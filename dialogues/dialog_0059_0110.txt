DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagarís. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I’m hoping you can help me get a bit of… a fresh start. I feel like I need a jumpstart, you know? I’m not sick sick, but I just don’t have the energy I used to.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. McNabb. It's perfectly reasonable to want to address a lack of energy, even if you don’t feel acutely ill. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this lack of energy started?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It didn’t happen all at once, you see. It’s been… gradual. I suppose it really started after my husband, George, passed away, about five years ago now. It's hard to say exactly when, though. I’ve been…keeping busy, you know, with the grandkids and church, and trying to keep the house up. But lately, even that feels like a lot.
DOCTOR: I see. Losing George must have been incredibly difficult, and it's very admirable that you've been so active despite that. It’s not uncommon for grief to manifest physically, even years later, and it can certainly impact your energy levels. So, five years ago, things were different. Could you describe what a typical day looked like for you before George passed away, compared to what a typical day looks like for you now?
PATIENT: Well, before… George and I, we were always doing something. He loved to garden, and I… I used to help him, and we’d bake bread together, every Saturday. We’d go to the market, have coffee with friends… we had a routine, a good one. And honestly, I had more pep! I could keep up with him, no problem. Now… I wake up, have a little breakfast, maybe read the paper. I try to do a bit of housework, but it gets… interrupted. Grandkids visit a lot, which I love, but it’s tiring. I try to volunteer at church a couple of times a week, but mostly I just… rest. It feels like I’m slowing down, and I don’t like it. I don’t have the energy to do the things I want to do, even simple things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. McNabb. It sounds like you've had a significant change in your lifestyle, and it's understandable that you're feeling this way. It’s good you’re recognizing the difference and wanting to address it. Besides the change in energy, have you noticed any other changes in how you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Well… Sometimes I feel a little… foggy, you know? Like I’m not quite as sharp as I used to be. It’s not terrible, but I’ll forget things sometimes, little things. And I haven’t been sleeping as well. I wake up a lot during the night, even if I’m tired. My appetite hasn’t been great either, but I make myself eat. I don’t want to lose any weight. I’m a practical woman, you know, and I know I need to keep my strength up.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. So, you've mentioned some fatigue, a little bit of cognitive fog, some difficulty sleeping, and a decreased appetite. Those can all be related. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, just to get a more complete picture. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young girl, a long time ago. And I had a hysterectomy in my early forties. That was… necessary, but it wasn’t easy. Aside from that, nothing major. I’ve always been a pretty healthy woman, all my life. A few colds here and there, but nothing that kept me down for long. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and a hysterectomy. Thank you. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a few. I take a baby aspirin every day, the doctor told me to, for my heart. And I take a calcium supplement for my bones. Oh, and sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. That’s about it, really. Nothing fancy. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, baby aspirin, calcium supplement, and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat just about anything. I used to love George’s cooking, and he used all sorts of spices! No, I don’t think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mother lived to be 89, she had a good long life. She had some arthritis, like me, and a little bit of trouble with her heart towards the end. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, from a heart attack. And my brother, he had high blood pressure. Aside from that… not much that I can think of. No history of cancer or anything like that, thankfully. It was always just the heart trouble and arthritis in our family, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble and arthritis in your family. That's helpful to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle? Well… It's not very exciting these days. I live alone, as I said, since George passed. I mostly keep to myself, but I have my grandkids who visit often, which I cherish. I try to stay active, but as we've discussed, it's been harder lately. I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, just a little wine with dinner sometimes, if I'm feeling fancy. I used to walk a lot, but I haven't been doing that as much lately, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to know. No smoking, limited alcohol consumption, grandkids provide social interaction, and a decrease in physical activity. Now, Ms. McNabb, I think I have a good understanding of your situation. Before I proceed with a physical examination, is there anything else you’d like to tell me, or any concerns you have that we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I feel a little… sad, you know? It's been five years since George passed, and I miss him terribly. I try to stay busy, but it's hard. I don’t want to bother you with my feelings, I just thought you should know. I just want to feel… like myself again. I want to have the energy to enjoy my grandkids, to volunteer at church, to keep up with my house. I just want to feel… better.
DOCTOR: Ms. McNabb, you aren't bothering me at all. It’s perfectly normal to feel sad after losing someone you love, and it’s important to acknowledge those feelings. Grief can affect both your physical and mental well-being, and it's certainly something we can address. It sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of factors—grief, a change in lifestyle, and some physical symptoms. We'll work together to figure out what's going on and how to get you feeling like yourself again. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Anything to help me feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you wouldn't mind, please have a seat here, and we'll begin. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. I'll also feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute, but that can be common with some anxiety. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. Your blood pressure is 140/85, which is slightly elevated. We'll keep an eye on that. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice a little tenderness in the lower quadrants. That might be related to the hysterectomy you had years ago. Your reflexes are normal, and your neurological function appears intact. Everything seems to be within normal limits, but we'll need some bloodwork to get a more complete picture.
PATIENT: Oh, my. That all sounds very… technical, Doctor. I don't understand half of it, but if you say it's within normal limits, I trust you. The tenderness in my abdomen… well, I’ve always had a little discomfort there, ever since the surgery. It comes and goes, but it’s never been anything serious, I don't think. Bloodwork, you say? What exactly will that tell us?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Ms. McNabb. It is a bit technical, and I apologize if I used too much jargon. I want to make sure you understand everything that’s going on. The bloodwork will help us check several things. We’ll look at your complete blood count to see if you have any signs of anemia, which could contribute to fatigue. We’ll also check your thyroid function, as an underactive thyroid can cause similar symptoms. We’ll check your vitamin D levels, as a deficiency can also lead to fatigue and muscle weakness. And we’ll check your blood sugar levels, just to rule out diabetes. Finally, we’ll check your kidney and liver function to make sure those organs are working properly. It’s a fairly comprehensive panel, and it will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on inside your body. Would you like me to write down what we’re looking for, so you have a reference?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be very helpful. I always forget these things the moment you say them. And writing it down would make me feel a little more… in control, you know? I appreciate you taking the time to explain it all to me. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Ms. McNabb. This lists all the tests we'll be running. As you can see, we're checking your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, blood sugar levels, kidney function, and liver function. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I'd like to ask you a few more questions about your symptoms. Have you been experiencing any changes in your weight, appetite, or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor, that’s very kind of you. This is a great help. As for my weight… I think I’ve lost a little bit, but not much. I try to eat, but like I said, my appetite hasn’t been great. And my bowel habits… well, they’ve been a little irregular, to be honest. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… not. It comes and goes, like everything else. I don’t like talking about this, but… I suppose it’s important, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. McNabb. And you’re not alone – many people experience changes in their bowel habits, and it's often a sign of something we can address. And it’s perfectly okay if you're uncomfortable talking about it; just tell me what you're comfortable sharing. Now, have you noticed any difficulty sleeping, other than waking up during the night?
PATIENT: Well, yes. It's not just waking up, Doctor. It’s… staying asleep. I’ll wake up, and then I just… lie there. My mind races, thinking about all sorts of things. George, the grandkids, the house, the church… everything. It's hard to quiet my mind. And then, when I do finally drift off, I don’t feel rested when I wake up. It’s a vicious cycle, really. I’ve tried drinking chamomile tea, and that sometimes helps a little, but not much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. McNabb. That sounds very frustrating. Difficulty falling or staying asleep, along with feeling unrested, is common, especially with stress and worry. One more question for now. Have you been experiencing any feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I miss George terribly. It’s been five years, but it still feels like yesterday sometimes. I try to be strong for the grandkids, but… it's hard. I don't enjoy doing the things I used to, not like I did with him. The church… it helps, but it's not the same without him. I feel… empty, sometimes. I don't cry all the time, but… it's always there, this sadness.
DOCTOR: Ms. McNabb, thank you for sharing that with me. It's perfectly normal to grieve, and it sounds like you’re still processing a significant loss. It’s admirable that you’re being strong for your grandkids, but it's important to acknowledge your own feelings, too. Based on everything you’ve told me—the fatigue, the cognitive fog, the sleep disturbance, the changes in appetite and bowel habits, and the feelings of sadness—I suspect several factors are contributing to how you're feeling. It's possible that grief is playing a major role, but we need to rule out any underlying medical conditions first. The bloodwork will help us do that. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan that addresses all of your symptoms, both physical and emotional. This might include lifestyle changes, such as improving your sleep hygiene and increasing your physical activity, as well as exploring options for managing your grief, such as counseling or support groups. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… very good. I just want to feel like myself again. I want to be able to enjoy my grandkids, to volunteer at church, to keep up with my house. I just want to feel… better. Thank you for listening to me, Doctor. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McNabb. I understand how you feel, and I'm here to help you every step of the way. Now, I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild sleep aid, just to help you get some rest while we're waiting for the bloodwork results. It’s not a long-term solution, but it might give you some relief. I’ll also give you a referral to a grief counselor, just in case you're interested in exploring that option. I want you to know that you're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything. Thank you for being so kind and understanding. I appreciate your patience and your willingness to listen. The sleep aid… is it habit-forming? I don't want to become dependent on anything. And the grief counselor… I'll think about it. It's just… hard to talk about.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. McNabb. The sleep aid I’m prescribing is a low dose and is generally not habit-forming when used as directed. However, it’s important to only take it when you really need it, and to gradually taper off it when you start to feel better. We'll discuss the proper dosage and usage when I give you the prescription. And I understand it’s hard to talk about. There’s no pressure to see the grief counselor. It’s simply an option that might be helpful if you’re feeling overwhelmed. You can try it and see if it’s a good fit for you, or you can decide it’s not for you. It's completely up to you. Alright. I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood now. After that, I'll write you the prescription and the referral, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly good. Thank you again for everything. I feel a little more hopeful now, just knowing that there's a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McNabb. I’m glad to hear that you’re feeling a little more hopeful. We'll work together to get you feeling like yourself again. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. After that, please stop by the front desk, and they'll schedule your follow-up appointment. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
