DOCTOR: Right. Criston Secondi, 36 years old. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Yes, that’s me. I… my pee. It’s orange. Like, really orange. Not normal color. I drink water, but still… orange. It started maybe three days ago?
DOCTOR: Orange urine, okay. Three days. Right. Well, that’s… not ideal. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not burning. Just… orange. It doesn’t feel different, just… looks wrong, you know? My wife, she said I should come see someone. She got worried.
DOCTOR: Your wife is…sensible, I suppose. It's good you're here. Orange urine can be a number of things. Mostly harmless, but we need to rule things out. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… like, my poop? No, not really. Same as always, I think. Maybe a little… harder, but I eat a lot of bread, so that happens sometimes. Is that important? I don’t know what “rule things out” means. Sorry.
DOCTOR: It means we need to figure out why your urine is orange. Constipation can sometimes contribute, yes. It's… complicated. And no, it’s not a sign of anything serious, usually. But we have to be thorough. Have you noticed any fatigue, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Fatigue… hmm. I work long hours, so I’m always tired. I don’t know if that’s new. And my appetite… yeah, maybe a little less. Not eating much meat lately, it’s expensive. Does that matter? I'm sorry, I don't understand all this. It's just orange pee!
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Secondi. I understand it's frustrating, but you came in with a symptom. We need to gather information to determine the cause. Less meat intake isn’t directly relevant, but it's good to know. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the chickenpox when I was a kid, but that’s it. Nothing serious. Just… normal stuff. I don’t go to the doctor much. My wife is always telling me to go, but… I’m busy. Is orange pee from something I ate? Maybe a fruit or something?
DOCTOR: Certain foods can temporarily alter urine color, yes. But three days is a bit long for that. And we need to rule out more concerning causes. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been in the hospital. I cut my hand bad at work once, but my boss just put a bandage on it. I work with… machines. Building things. It’s good work, but sometimes… accidents. Not bad accidents, though. Mostly just scrapes and cuts. Does that matter? I feel like I’m telling you my whole life story!
DOCTOR: It's helpful information, Mr. Secondi. We need to get a complete picture. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father… he had problems with his kidneys, I think. Something about needing a special diet. He died a long time ago, so I don’t remember much. My mother is okay, she’s old, but she’s healthy. She likes to garden. My brother… he has high blood pressure, I think. Is that important? I’m really not sure what’s going on here. It’s just… orange.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure and a family history of kidney problems are relevant. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything. My wife always says I shouldn’t eat so much spicy food, but… I like it. I don’t take any medicine, unless I have a headache, then I take… paracetamol? Is that right? The white tablets? I don’t know the name. I buy them at the shop.
DOCTOR: Paracetamol, alright. Okay, Mr. Secondi, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and I'll need a urine sample. That will help us narrow down the possibilities. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A urine sample… okay. I can do that. Physical exam… that’s okay too, I guess. Is it going to be long? I have to get back to work this afternoon. And… what if it’s something bad? My wife will be so worried. I… I don’t like hospitals.
DOCTOR: It won’t be long, Mr. Secondi. Standard procedure. And let’s not jump to conclusions. Most likely, it’s something minor. But we need to rule things out. Okay, if you'll follow me to the restroom, I'll give you a cup and instructions for the sample. Then we’ll come back and do the exam. It's quick. Please, try to relax. We're just being thorough.
PATIENT: Okay. Alright. A cup… I can do that. I'll try to relax. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing bad.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's get that sample first. And try not to worry. Most likely, it's nothing. I'll be right here when you're finished.
PATIENT: Okay.
