DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Krok, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Rosanova, is it? Yes, quite a name. It’s… a matter of some delicacy, you understand. A most… unpleasant discharge. Been going on for… oh, goodness, I couldn't rightly say how long. Days, perhaps? Weeks? Time does rather slip away at my age. It’s… bothersome, naturally. And my wife… well, she insisted I come. A good woman, my Fatima, but… firm.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krok, I understand. It is good of Fatima to encourage you to come in. “Unpleasant discharge” – alright, we can definitely look into that. And don't worry about the exact timeframe; we’ll figure it out. To start, can you tell me a little more about the discharge itself?
PATIENT: It’s… watery, mostly. Though sometimes… thicker. A bit yellowish, I suppose. Not terribly smelly, thankfully. I pride myself on hygiene, you see. Always have. It just… happens. And it stains the… undergarments. That’s rather the aggravating part, to be honest. A perfectly good pair of briefs, ruined. It’s… undignified. And it’s causing a bit of… irritation. A mild burning sensation, mostly after… well, after using the facilities.
DOCTOR: Okay, watery, sometimes thicker, yellowish, no strong odor, stains your briefs, and a mild burning sensation after urination. That gives us a starting point. Has this happened before, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that’s a good question. I… believe so. Years ago, perhaps? When I was a younger man, certainly. But it resolved on its own, as far as I recall. I vaguely remember some sort of ointment… or perhaps a tonic? It was… quite some time ago. My memory isn’t what it once was, you understand. A regrettable consequence of age, I assure you. I was quite a robust fellow in my youth, mind you. Worked the land, built things with my own two hands. But… that was then.
DOCTOR: Alright, a previous episode that resolved on its own with some sort of topical treatment. Good to know. Now, besides the discharge and irritation, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… there's a bit of… discomfort. A general ache, if you will. Not terribly painful, but… noticeable. And sometimes, when… attempting certain activities, there's a slight… sharpness. A fleeting sensation, quickly gone. I’m not one to dwell on such matters, you understand. A man of simple pleasures, I am. But it's… inconvenient, to say the least. And my wife… she's been rather… pointed in her observations.
DOCTOR: Okay, general ache and a sharp pain with activity. We’re getting a clearer picture. Now, just to be thorough, have you had a fever, chills, or any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Fever? No, Doctor. Not a touch. I feel perfectly well, all things considered. A bit creaky, perhaps, but that's just the age, you understand. Chills, no. And back pain… well, I always have a bit of a backache. From years of labor, you see. Lifting, bending, building… it takes its toll. But nothing unusual. Certainly nothing to trouble a doctor. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or unusual back pain. Good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I have my age, of course. That’s a condition in itself, wouldn’t you say? And… a bit of arthritis in the hands. Makes buttoning shirts rather difficult at times. Other than that… I believe I’ve been quite fortunate, all things considered. A healthy constitution, you see. Always ate well, worked hard, and avoided… excesses. My wife keeps me in line, you understand. She’s a stickler for a sensible diet. And regular check-ups. Though I must say, the younger doctors… they’re always poking and prodding. It’s rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis in your hands, otherwise generally healthy. Good to know. And I apologize if the exam feels undignified, Mr. Krok, I just want to make sure we cover everything. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Yes, there was… a hernia, years ago. When I was still working the land. Heavy lifting, you see. It needed fixing, of course. Couldn’t go on with a hernia, could I? And… oh yes, my prostate. Enlarged, they said. A common ailment, I believe. Had it… trimmed, I suppose. Years ago. A very unpleasant experience, I assure you. Nothing since then, thankfully. I prefer to avoid doctors whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, hernia repair and prostate trimming, both years ago. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… well, let me see. My wife gives me a pill for my blood pressure. A small white one, I believe. And another one for my arthritis. Yellow, that one. And… oh yes, sometimes she gives me a vitamin. For my… bones, I think. Can’t quite recall the name. She manages all that, you see. I just take what she gives me. She’s very particular about my health. A good woman, my Fatima. But… she does fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure, arthritis, and a vitamin, managed by your wife. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s a good question. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, you see. Foreign foods, strange fruits… never had any trouble. Though I do get a bit of a… rash sometimes, when I’m out in the garden. From the pollen, I suspect. But nothing serious. My wife gives me a cream for it. A soothing cream, it is. But allergies… no, I don’t think so. I pride myself on a robust constitution, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, just a rash from pollen in the garden. That’s helpful. Now, Mr. Krok, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: My… social history? Goodness. What exactly do you mean? I’ve been married to Fatima for… oh, goodness, almost sixty years now. A good marriage, all things considered. We have… children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren. A large family, I assure you. I worked the land my whole life, you see. A simple life. We don’t go out much anymore. Too much commotion. I prefer a quiet evening at home with Fatima. Is that what you mean by… social history? It's not terribly exciting, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Krok. That gives me a good understanding. Just one last question for now: do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Certainly not. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps. But nothing excessive. And recreational drugs… well, that’s simply out of the question. A respectable man doesn’t engage in such activities, you see. I pride myself on a clean and healthy lifestyle. My wife would never allow it, anyway. She’s a very… principled woman, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drugs. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Krok. Okay, I’m seeing here that you’ve been on Lisinopril for blood pressure and Naproxen for arthritis for several years now. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also need to examine your abdomen and… well, the area where you’re experiencing the discharge. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. That part. Yes, well… I suppose it’s necessary. I must say, Doctor, I’m not terribly fond of being… prodded and poked. But if you insist. Just be… gentle, please. And discreet. My reputation is at stake, you understand. A man of my standing… it wouldn’t do to be… exposed. Just be quick about it, if you would. And please, no unnecessary conversation. It's rather… embarrassing, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, I understand completely. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible, and I’ll maintain your privacy. Okay, Mr. Krok, everything seems normal besides the redness and discharge I observed. I didn’t detect any significant pain during the exam. I’m going to collect a urine sample to send to the lab for analysis. That will help us determine the cause of the discharge. I’ll explain the process now.
PATIENT: A urine sample, you say? Yes, alright. As long as it’s not too… invasive. My wife always makes me drink plenty of fluids, so I shouldn’t have any trouble… producing. Just… be quick about it, please. And no unnecessary conversation. It’s rather… delicate, you understand. A man of my standing… it wouldn’t do to be… discussing such matters.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, I understand. I'll leave you a sterile cup, and I'll step out of the room to give you privacy. Just collect a mid-stream sample – meaning start urinating, then collect a sample halfway through, and finish. Then, just bring the cup to the counter when you’re finished, and I'll send it to the lab.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, I’ll take that to the lab right away. Okay, I’ve sent the sample off. We should have results back in a few days. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to discuss the potential causes of your symptoms. It’s possible this is a simple urinary tract infection, or it could be something else. We'll know more once we have the lab results. Based on your history, age, and symptoms, I suspect a bacterial infection. However, we need the lab confirmation to know for sure. Do you have any questions so far?
