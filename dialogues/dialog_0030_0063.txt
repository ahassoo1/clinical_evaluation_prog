DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well… my back. It’s been really bad. Hurts a lot. It’s not new, you know? I’ve had trouble with it before, but this is… worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your back pain has been worse recently, despite having experienced it before. That's helpful to know. Could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s mostly… low down. Right here. And it shoots down my leg sometimes. Not always, but when it does… oof. Like a bad fire. It’s hard to stand for long, and sleeping is… not easy. I try to move slow, but even then… it just hurts.
DOCTOR: I see. So the pain is primarily in your lower back, but radiates down your leg at times, described as a sharp, burning sensation. And it’s interfering with your ability to stand for extended periods and is affecting your sleep. When did you first notice this current flare-up, and has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: It started… maybe two weeks ago? I think so. Hard to remember exactly, things been kinda blurry lately. But it got really bad after I… helped my cousin move some boxes. Big, heavy boxes. I shouldn’t have, I know. But she asked… and she needed help. After that, it just kept getting worse each day. Nothing really makes it better, you know? Just… more hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain began approximately two weeks ago and worsened significantly after assisting your cousin with moving boxes. And you haven’t found anything that provides substantial relief. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it? Okay. It's not a quick pain, like a poke. It's… steady. Like someone is sitting on my back all the time. And then, sometimes, it gets sharp. Like a knife. And then… the burning down my leg. It’s different, but it all feels bad. It’s… just constant. Never really goes away, even when I’m sitting. It just changes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant, steady ache with occasional sharp, knife-like pains and a burning sensation down your leg. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Yes! Sometimes. Mostly in my toes. Like… pins and needles. Not all the time, but when I stand for a long time, it gets bad. Like they’re falling asleep. And it feels… cold, even when they’re not. It goes away when I sit down, mostly. But it’s… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness and tingling in your toes, described as pins and needles, especially with prolonged standing. That's important information. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as arthritis, osteoporosis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes. Doctor told me… a few years ago… cancer. In my… belly. They did surgery and… medicine. It was good for a long time, but… they said it might come back. And… this back pain… it feels different than before. That's why I came. I don’t know if it’s the cancer again…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Meigs, especially given your history of cancer. It’s very wise of you to come in to get this evaluated, given that this pain feels different than previous experiences. To clarify, what type of cancer were you diagnosed with, and when was your last follow-up appointment with your oncologist?
PATIENT: It was… adenocarcinoma. That's what the doctor said. And… last appointment… let me think. It was… last year, maybe February? They did a scan and said everything looked okay, but… I haven’t been feeling okay lately. That’s why I'm worried it’s back. And this back pain… it’s worse. It's just… different. It’s not like the other pains I had before.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Meigs. Adenocarcinoma, diagnosed previously, with a clear scan in February of last year. And you are right to bring up the difference in this pain compared to what you've experienced before. Now, to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any past surgeries you've had, besides the cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Before the cancer… I had my gallbladder out. A long time ago. And… I broke my arm when I was a kid, so they fixed that. But that was a long time ago. Nothing else, I think. Just the gallbladder and the arm. And the cancer surgery, of course. But that was… a big surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve had your gallbladder removed and a repair of a broken arm in the past, in addition to the surgery for your cancer treatment. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Hmm… my mother, she had trouble with her back when she got old. Lots of pain. She didn't go to the doctor much, though. Just… lived with it. My father… he was healthy, mostly. Never much trouble. And my cousin… she has arthritis, I think. Her hands are always sore. But that’s… about it, I think. No one else with cancer, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of back pain in your mother and arthritis in your cousin. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I’ve taken a lot of medicine over the years, and never had a problem. Nothing I remember, anyway. Just… the usual stuff. Pain pills, antibiotics… never had a reaction.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. Thank you, Ms. Meigs, for providing all of this information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be causing your back pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. It’s just… scary, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Meigs, and I’ll do my best to determine the cause of your pain. Okay, I’m gently pressing here… does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right there. That’s… really sore. Like a bad bruise, but… deeper. And when I move like this… …it feels like something is pulling. It’s a sharp pain. Not like the steady ache, but… a different kind of hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Tenderness to palpation in that specific area of your lower back, and sharp pain with forward bending. And how about this?
PATIENT: Hmm… that feels… okay. Not much. Just a little… tap. Is that normal? It doesn't feel like when the doctor checks my knees, you know? It’s not… jumping. Just a little tap.
DOCTOR: Okay, diminished reflexes in your ankles compared to your knees. Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. A little… tickle. But it’s… not as strong as it used to be. Like… muffled. It's hard to explain. I can feel it, but… not clearly. It feels… distant. Like my foot is… asleep a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, diminished sensation in your feet. Alright, Ms. Meigs, thank you for your patience. Based on the examination, I’m noting tenderness in your lower back, diminished reflexes in your ankles, and reduced sensation in your feet. Given your history of cancer, the difference in this pain compared to previous episodes, and the neurological findings from the examination, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a mechanical back problem, such as a muscle strain or herniated disc, but we need to rule out other causes, including possible involvement from your previous cancer or nerve compression. To help determine the cause, I’d like to order some imaging studies, specifically an MRI of your lumbar spine. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. I'm worried, but… I trust you. Is it… expensive? I have insurance, but… sometimes it doesn’t cover everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Ms. Meigs. I will submit the order to a facility that works with most insurance plans, and my staff will verify your coverage and provide you with an estimated cost before the procedure. We can also discuss options if there are financial concerns. In the meantime, to help manage your pain, I’m going to prescribe a mild muscle relaxant and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, like ibuprofen. I also recommend gentle stretching and low-impact exercises, such as walking, as tolerated. Avoid any activities that worsen your pain. I will also provide you with a referral to a physical therapist, who can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles and improve your posture. Do you have any questions about the medications or the referral?
PATIENT: Okay… muscle relaxant and ibuprofen. That sounds okay. I've taken ibuprofen before. The physical therapist… that sounds good too. Will they help me with… moving? Because it’s hard to bend over, you know? And… what about the cancer? Does this MRI… will it show if the cancer is back?
DOCTOR: Yes, the physical therapist will definitely help you with safe and effective ways to move, bend, and improve your range of motion. They will tailor a program specifically for your needs and limitations. Regarding your concerns about the cancer, the MRI of your lumbar spine will primarily focus on assessing the structures of your spine – the discs, nerves, and muscles. However, if there is any concern about involvement of the bones or surrounding tissues, the radiologist will also look for any signs of recurrence or spread of cancer. It is not the primary scan for detecting cancer recurrence throughout the body; a CT scan would be more appropriate for that. But it will help us investigate whether the source of your pain might be related to your previous cancer treatment. I will order the MRI today, and my staff will contact you to schedule the appointment. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or bowel or bladder problems, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I’m still worried, but… I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something. I’ll wait for the staff to call about the MRI.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I understand your anxiety, and I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. We will work through this together, step by step. Here's a written summary of our discussion, including the medication prescriptions and the referral to physical therapy. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. Get some rest and try to take it easy. I’ll see you again after the MRI to discuss the results. Do you have any work that may be affected by this that would require a note?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, thank you! I work at the cannery. It’s… a lot of bending and lifting. A note would be very helpful. Thank you so much, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. This note explains your limitations and recommends temporary modifications to your work duties. Please submit this to your supervisor. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Quicksey. You've been very kind. I appreciate everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It was my pleasure. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your next appointment. .
