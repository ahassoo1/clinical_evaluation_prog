DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Engelhaupt will do, thank you. Really, I don’t have much time for…chat. Just need to get this over with. New to the area, you see. Medicare requires…a visit. Something about establishing care. It’s all very tedious, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. I understand wanting to be efficient. Establishing care is a standard procedure with Medicare, and we're happy to assist you with that. We’ll keep things as streamlined as possible. To begin, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the faintest. I used to dispatch…people. Very important work, you know. Kept things moving. That was…a long time ago. I suppose I don’t feel particularly unwell. A bit of stiffness in the mornings, perhaps. And my memory isn’t what it used to be, naturally. But who remembers things these days? Is this truly necessary?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Engelhaupt. Even a general sense of your health history is valuable. The stiffness you mention – is that in your joints?
PATIENT: Joints, yes. Though, to be frank, I haven't paid them much mind. It's just...everything feels a bit creaky, if you understand. Like an old…machine. Really, I'm quite busy, Doctor. My husband, bless his heart, isn't as spry as he once was, and I manage…things. Do we have to go into detail about every ache and pain? It seems a bit…undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Engelhaupt. We certainly don't need to dwell on every minor detail. Just a general overview will suffice. The “creakiness” – where specifically are you noticing it most?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, I suppose. My knees, mostly. And my back. And…my shoulders. Honestly, it’s difficult to say. I used to stand for hours at that dispatch console. Perhaps it's from that. Really, I don’t know. This is all rather…exhausting. Are we getting anywhere? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are, Ms. Engelhaupt. Thank you for your patience. Knowing it's widespread is helpful. And your history of standing for long periods gives us a good starting point. To get a clearer picture, could you describe what the discomfort feels like?
PATIENT: Discomfort? It's…a stiffness, as I said. Not a sharp pain, thankfully. More of a…resistance. Like trying to bend rusted metal. And it's worse in the mornings, naturally. And after…sitting for a while. Honestly, I can’t recall anything particularly bad. Just…old age, I suppose. It's what one expects. Really, I'm starting to feel quite faint. Is there somewhere I can sit down?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. Please, have a seat. It's perfectly normal to feel a bit lightheaded, especially when discussing these things. We can take things at your pace. Now, aside from the stiffness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, where does one begin? I forget things, as I’ve mentioned. And I get…winded, easily. Walking up the slightest incline is quite a chore these days. And I seem to be…sleepier than I used to be. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect it’s just the weight of years. My husband keeps telling me I need more…vitamin D, or something of that sort. Really, I’m not one for fuss. Is this required? I simply need a form signed, correct?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt. We will get to the form. These questions are simply to help me understand your overall health picture and ensure there isn’t anything more going on. The forgetfulness, windedness, and increased sleepiness – have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm. I suppose I don’t eat as much as I used to. My husband does most of the cooking now. Weight? I haven’t been on a scale in…years. Really, Doctor, I don’t concern myself with such trivialities. I simply want to get this Medicare business sorted and be on my way. Is there someone I can call to come pick me up? I’m afraid I didn’t drive today. This is…rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the inconvenience, Ms. Engelhaupt. We’ll move as efficiently as possible. Knowing your appetite has decreased is helpful. Just a few more quick questions, then we can proceed with a brief physical exam and get the necessary paperwork completed. Have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? Good heavens, no. I haven't been ill in…well, I can't recall when. Night sweats? Certainly not. Unexplained weight loss? I just told you, I haven't weighed myself! Really, Doctor, are these questions necessary? I feel like I'm being interrogated. I simply want this over with. Can we please just get the form signed? I have an appointment to keep. A very important appointment.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt. These questions are standard procedure to rule out anything serious, and I assure you, we're almost finished with this portion. Let's shift gears then. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I used to take…something for my sinuses, years ago. But I stopped. My husband handles the medications now, and he says I'm fine. Really, I've never been one for ailments. It’s all rather…unnecessary fuss. Can we please get this form signed? I’m beginning to feel quite faint again. And I do have that appointment…it’s with my hairdresser, you see. A very important appointment. And I simply must be on time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Engelhaupt. Since you’re not aware of any specific allergies, and your husband manages your medications, we can proceed. To complete the initial assessment, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a quick look at your joints. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. Just get it over with. Quickly, if you please. I have absolutely no patience for…prodding and poking. My joints? You’ll just confirm what I’ve already told you – they’re creaky and old. Honestly, I suspect it's a waste of time. But if it’s required…just make it swift. And then, the form, please. Is that too much to ask? A simple form. To get this Medicare business sorted. It’s quite…stressful, you know. Really, the indignity of it all. Hurry, if you please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs. Breath sounds are a little quiet, but I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Finally, let me just briefly examine your joints. Your knees and shoulders do exhibit some crepitus and tenderness, as you described, and range of motion is somewhat limited. All right. Thank you for your patience. Now, let's complete the Medicare form.
PATIENT: Finally. Thank goodness. Just…sign it, please. I need to get going. And please, don’t ask me any more questions. My memory…it’s simply not what it used to be. Honestly, this entire process has been…exhausting. I trust you have everything you need? I have a very important appointment, you see. A hair appointment. And I absolutely must be on time. Just…finish it, please. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. Here is the completed Medicare form. If you could just sign at the bottom, we’re all set. Based on our conversation and the brief exam, it appears you are experiencing age-related joint stiffness and mild decreased lung capacity. However, given your concerns about forgetfulness and fatigue, I recommend a follow-up appointment with a primary care physician for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can order blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Do you have a primary care doctor already?
PATIENT: A doctor? Oh, goodness, no. My husband handles all of that. He has…a doctor somewhere. I don’t bother with names, or details. Honestly, I just want to be left alone. This form…is this everything? Can I go now? Really, I’m quite tired. And I absolutely must be on time for my hair appointment. It’s…very important. Just…let me go. And thank you for…your time, I suppose. Though it was…rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. Here is a copy of the form for your records. Given your concerns, I will make a note to recommend a primary care referral to your husband’s doctor. They will be able to schedule a more comprehensive evaluation. Thank you for coming in today. I hope you enjoy your hair appointment. And please, don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Engelhaupt.
PATIENT: Honestly. The indignity of it all. Just…hair. That's all that matters now.
