DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? It’s this…business with my stool. Black. Like tar, practically. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking ‘em for years. Don’t know what’s gotten into it, but it’s not right. I just want to know what needs fixing, frankly. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Dawnetta. Black, tarry stools are certainly something we need to investigate. And I appreciate you being upfront about wanting to get to the bottom of this efficiently. You mentioned pain pills for arthritis… could you tell me the name of the medication and the dosage you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. Names… always forget the names. Let me think. It’s…the red one. No, the white one! With the little blue writing. Honestly, the pharmacist sorts it out for me. Dosage…two a day, usually. Sometimes three if my knees are acting up. They’re the strong ones, you know, the ones they warn you about on the telly. It’s been years, though. Years, I tell ya. It’s not like I just started taking them.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. It sounds like you’ve been on these pain medications for quite some time. While I appreciate you trying to recall the specifics, it’s important for me to have the exact name and dosage for your safety. Perhaps we can look through your medication list in our system?
PATIENT: System? Oh, honestly. More computers. Fine, go ahead. But don’t take all day about it. I’ve got things to do, you know. Garden needs weeding, and my husband…well, he needs reminding about everything, constantly. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve located your medication list. It appears you’ve been prescribed Tramadol 50mg, twice daily, with occasional increases to three times daily as needed for arthritis pain. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Tramadol, yes! That’s it. Tramadol. See? I knew it was something like that. Though, honestly, they should make the bottles bigger. Constantly running out. And yes, twice a day, sometimes three. Depends on the weather, mostly. Damp weather, knees ache something awful. Now, are we getting anywhere with this…stool problem? It’s not pleasant to talk about, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dawnetta, we are. Tramadol can sometimes cause gastrointestinal issues, including changes in stool color. However, black, tarry stools can also indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract, which is something we need to rule out. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask you a few more questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the change in stool?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Goodness gracious. No, no bleeding. Just…dark. And smells a bit different, maybe. Not bad bad, just…stronger. And I’ve been a bit tired lately, but who isn’t? I’m seventy-three, you know. Things wear out. And my appetite’s been a bit off, but then again, I don’t eat much red meat anymore. It gives me heartburn. Are you suggesting something serious? Because I haven't got time for serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Dawnetta, and I’m not suggesting anything definitively at this point. However, fatigue and a decreased appetite, combined with the change in stool, warrant further investigation. To be thorough, have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain…sometimes a bit of a rumble, but nothing major. Old age, you know. Everything rumbles. Nausea, no. Vomiting, heavens no. And weight loss…well, I’ve always been slim. Perhaps a pound or two, but that’s probably just the summer heat. Honestly, I think you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. I just want to know if I need to change my pills or what. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Dawnetta. You’re right to want a clear answer, and I want to provide that for you. Given your symptoms and history, I'd like to perform a quick physical examination, including listening to your abdomen and checking for any signs of anemia. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But make it quick, will you? I’ve got a casserole to start. Husband gets quite cross if supper isn’t on time. And don’t poke and prod too much, I bruise easily. Honestly, at my age… everything’s fragile. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Dawnetta. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m listening to your abdomen now. It sounds…relatively normal, though slightly diminished. There's a small amount of tenderness in the lower abdomen, but nothing significant. I'm also going to check your blood pressure and pulse, just to get a baseline. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72. That's within a normal range. I’m also going to check your stool sample to analyze it.
PATIENT: Stool sample? Oh, honestly. Must you? It’s just… embarrassing. Fine, do what you must. But the quicker this is over, the better. And try not to poke around too much. Honestly, I don't know why they need to examine everything so thoroughly. It's just stool, after all. Not like it's a precious jewel. Now, are you finished yet? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Dawnetta, and I apologize for any embarrassment this may cause. It’s a standard procedure to help determine the cause of the change in stool color. Based on what we’ve discussed and the initial examination, it's difficult to say definitively what’s causing this. However, given your age and the change in stool color, I would like to order a complete blood count and a fecal occult blood test to check for any signs of anemia or bleeding. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests and…another stool test? Honestly! Are you trying to drain all the blood out of me? Fine, do what you must. But I expect a clear explanation of the results. No medical jargon, mind you. I want to understand what’s going on, and I haven’t got time for complicated explanations. And if it turns out to be something serious… well, I don’t want to hear about it. Just tell me what pills I need to take to fix it. Now, are you finished with me? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. I’ve ordered the blood tests and the fecal occult blood test. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also have my nurse provide you with instructions for collecting the stool sample. Once the results are back, we’ll discuss them thoroughly, in plain language, and determine the best course of action. I promise to keep the explanation simple and straightforward. In the meantime, continue taking your Tramadol as prescribed. And if you notice any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or significant weakness – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just get me out of here. Honestly, all this poking and prodding and testing… it’s exhausting. And make sure that nurse explains the stool sample business clearly. I don’t want to mess that up. Just…get me a casserole recipe. Something simple. My husband's a fussy eater. And tell your lab people to hurry up. I haven't got all day. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Dawnetta. I’ll have the nurse provide you with a clear explanation of the stool sample collection and a simple casserole recipe. I’ve also made a note to expedite the lab results. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Dawnetta. And I hope you have a pleasant day.
