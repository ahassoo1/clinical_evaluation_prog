DOCTOR: Right. Mikeisha Boham, 40 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um... my sinuses, they bother me. It's been... a while now. I feel pressure, mostly. And sometimes, it's hard to breathe good through my nose. I don't... remember exactly when it started. It just... is.
DOCTOR: “Just is.” Right. Well, “a while now” isn't terribly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, you are right. I’m sorry. It is… hard for me to remember dates. Maybe… a few months? Before the hot weather started, I think. Before everything got so warm. It’s not a sharp pain, you know? Just… full. Like something is blocking it all up.
DOCTOR: A few months. And this fullness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days it is… better. Not gone, but not so bad. And some days, like today, it is… worse. When I bend over, it feels… full. And sometimes, at night, it is hard to sleep good. I have to breathe through my mouth.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other symptoms with this?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Um… let me think. Sometimes, I feel tired. But I work very hard, so… maybe that is just from the work. Oh! And… sometimes my head hurts, right here. Not a bad headache, just… a pressure, like with my sinuses. I don’t know if that is the same thing.
DOCTOR: Right. Tiredness, headache... anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don't think so. Sometimes… a little bit of a cough. But I don’t get sick often. It’s just… this pressure. It doesn’t get better with… with anything, really. I try to drink water, but it doesn’t help much. Is that… bad? I am sorry, I don't know what I am supposed to say.
DOCTOR: Look, I need you to be a little more specific. “Doesn’t get better with anything” is… unhelpful. Have you tried any over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Over-the… counter? You mean… medicine I can buy at the store? Um… I bought some once, for a cold. But it didn’t help with this. It was… yellow in a bottle. I don't remember the name. My husband, he buys medicine sometimes, but I don't know what he uses for me. I just… take what he gives me. I am sorry. I don't know much about medicine.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's move on. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um… I don’t think so. I work outside, with the machines… lots of dust. But I’ve always worked outside, so I guess I just… got used to it. I don’t get… itchy or anything. My eyes don’t water. I don't know if that means I don't have allergies, or… I just don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Um… I don’t get sick often, like I said. I had a baby, a long time ago. That was… okay. And I broke my arm once, when I was little. But… that’s all I remember. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time. My husband takes care of things like that. I am sorry, Doctor. I don't know what else to tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick exam then. I need to listen to your lungs and look in your nose. Sit back and I’ll get my stethoscope.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have to get back to work… soon.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear, though somewhat shallow breathing. Nasal passages are… congested, some mild swelling. No signs of acute infection, but definitely inflamed. Okay. It appears to be sinusitis, likely chronic. I'm going to recommend a saline nasal rinse, twice a day. And if it doesn’t improve within a week, we can discuss other options. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Saline… nasal rinse? Like… with water? What… what do I do with it? Do I buy it at the store? And what if it doesn't get better? Other options…? Will I need… medicine? I’m sorry, I have so many questions. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can buy a saline nasal rinse at the store. It comes in a bottle with a nozzle. You put it in your nose and it rinses out the congestion. I'll have the nurse print out instructions. As for “other options,” we’re talking about potentially a steroid nasal spray, or if it’s really bad, a referral to an ENT specialist. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, try the rinse. And if it’s getting worse – fever, severe pain, vision changes – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… a bottle with a nozzle. I can buy it at the store. And rinse my nose… twice a day. And if it gets worse, go to the emergency room. Steroid spray… and a specialist… I think… I understand. But what if I do it wrong? Is it hard? I don’t want to make it worse. And… how much does the spray cost? I don’t have much money…
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain the proper technique for the rinse. And the cost of the spray varies. I cannot discuss your personal finances. Try the rinse, follow the instructions, and see if it helps. If not, we'll reassess. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I will try the rinse. And… I will try to remember everything. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Next.
