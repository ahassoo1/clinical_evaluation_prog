DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for… a while now, I guess. Honestly, it’s hard to say how long. Feels like forever.
DOCTOR: “Tiredness… for a while.” Alright. And when you say “tired,” can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh. It's not like… just needing a nap. It's… everything feels heavy. Like I’m wading through mud. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. I don’t have the energy to… to do much of anything, really. It's just… draining.
DOCTOR: Heavy, draining… difficulty even getting out of bed. Okay. And has this level of fatigue been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh…constant, I think. Yes, pretty constant. There might be days that are… a little less bad? But honestly, they all blur together. It’s hard to remember specifics. I just know I never feel… good.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Constant fatigue, minimal variation.” Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Other…symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… Sometimes my muscles ache, a little. And…I don’t sleep very well, even when I am tired. Wake up a lot. But… that’s been happening for years, honestly. I don’t know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Muscle aches and disrupted sleep…Years of disrupted sleep, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. A long time. Since… well, since my husband passed. It started then, I think. It’s… hard to say for sure. Things were just… different after that. I don’t really remember feeling rested, even before this tiredness got so bad.
DOCTOR: I see. A change in sleep patterns following a significant life event. Alright. And are you experiencing any changes in your appetite, or have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Oh. My appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I don’t feel like eating at all. Other days I’m… peckish. I think I’ve lost a little weight, maybe? I don’t really check. Clothes feel a little looser, but… I haven’t weighed myself in ages.
DOCTOR: Variable appetite, possible unintentional weight loss. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, the doctor always said my blood pressure was a little high. I used to take a pill for it, but…I think I stopped a while ago? And…arthritis in my hands, I guess. It doesn’t bother me too much. Oh, and… I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. That's about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, possible non-compliance with medication, osteoarthritis, cholecystectomy. And are you currently taking any medications, aside from the blood pressure pill you mentioned?
PATIENT: No… nothing regularly. Just… when my arthritis flares up, I take some ibuprofen, maybe? But that’s it. Honestly, I try to avoid pills if I can. They never really seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen PRN for osteoarthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… Not that I know of. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. I… really can't recall anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Oh dear. What do you mean? I… I live alone now, since my husband passed. I don’t really do much. Mostly just stay home.
DOCTOR: Alright. Living alone following loss of spouse, limited social activity. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, absolutely not. Never. My husband didn't approve, and…well, I just never started. I don't need any of that. No, none of those things.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, abstains from alcohol and recreational drugs. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… my mother had… heart problems, I think. And my father had diabetes, yes. And… my sister had cancer, a long time ago. She… she didn't make it. It was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Maternal history of heart disease, paternal history of diabetes, sibling history of cancer. Alright. Well, Ms. Licano, we've covered a lot of ground. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a brief neurological assessment.
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have… things to do, you know? But yes, alright. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your blood pressure. 148 over 88. A bit elevated, but not entirely unexpected. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are… regular, but somewhat distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are… diminished, but symmetrical. I'm also noting some mild edema in your ankles. Alright. It appears you have some swelling in your lower extremities. I'm also noticing some pallor in your complexion. Are you feeling colder than usual lately?
PATIENT: Oh, well… my ankles have been a little puffy lately, yes. And…cold? I don't know. It’s been warm out, hasn’t it? Maybe. I just… always feel a little tired, like I said. It’s hard to tell what’s normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Pallor noted, patient reports generalized fatigue and difficulty distinguishing normal from abnormal sensation. Alright, Ms. Licano. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary physical exam, it's difficult to pinpoint a single cause for your fatigue. However, your elevated blood pressure, diminished reflexes, pallor, and edema are all concerning. It’s important we rule out some potential underlying issues. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and an EKG. These tests will help us assess your overall health and identify any deficiencies or abnormalities. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Tests? I don’t… I don’t really like tests. Is it something serious? I just thought I was… getting old. Will it take long? I have… appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Licano, I understand your apprehension. It’s never pleasant to think about potential medical issues. However, these tests are necessary to get a clear picture of what's going on. They are relatively simple blood draws and a quick, painless EKG. It's too early to say if it's something serious. I don't want to alarm you. However, your symptoms and the physical exam findings warrant further investigation. We need to rule out things like anemia, thyroid issues, kidney problems, and potential heart abnormalities. Ignoring these symptoms won't make them go away, and early detection is always best. It should take no more than a few days to get the results back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as we have them. Do you agree to the tests?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I don’t want a lot of fuss. And I really need to be sure about my appointments. But yes, alright. Do the tests. Just… please don’t keep me waiting too long for the results?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Licano. I’ll expedite the results as much as possible. Here are the lab orders; please take these to the lab. They are located just down the hall to your left. The lab technician will draw your blood and perform the EKG. Once you’ve completed the tests, please schedule a follow-up appointment with my office. We’ll discuss the results and determine the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend you maintain a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and get as much rest as possible. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness—please seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Healthy diet, hydrate, rest… and… see a doctor if anything gets worse. Right. I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I'll… go do the tests now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Licano. We’ll be in touch. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. .
