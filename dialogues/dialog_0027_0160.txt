DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's about this tiredness. It just won’t quit. And… well, it's embarrassing to admit, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot of it, but enough to bother me. And I figured, at my age, it's best to get it checked out before it gets worse. Though, frankly, I don’t see what could be wrong with eating a little earth. People do stranger things.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and… consuming soil. I appreciate you being so open with me, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s good you’re addressing this now. Let's start with the tiredness. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? I'm tired. All the time. Doesn’t matter if I sleep eight hours, ten hours, it doesn’t make a difference. It’s just… dragging. Makes everything hard. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. And I used to be so active! Now… not so much. Is that what you want to know? Because honestly, it’s just tiring being tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. It sounds incredibly frustrating. And you said this has been going on for a while, despite adequate sleep?
PATIENT: Adequate? Hmph. Maybe. It's been… well, I suppose it started getting really bad maybe six months ago, but honestly, I've been feeling a bit run-down for longer than that. A year, maybe? It's hard to say. Things just sort of… fade at my age, you know? But the dirt eating? That’s recent. A couple of months, max. Don’t know what’s gotten into me.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, fatigue for at least six months, possibly a year, and the soil consumption for the past couple of months. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I'm not feeling sick, sick. Just… weak. And a bit shaky sometimes. My appetite's been off, too. Not that I need a big appetite anymore, mind you. But, no, I haven't got a fever or anything. And I’m not coughing or sneezing. Just… tired and craving… well, you know. It’s not like it's glamorous, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness, shakiness, and decreased appetite alongside the fatigue and soil consumption. Just to be clear, when you say "soil," can you describe what kind of soil it is?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. It's dirt. What kind of dirt does it matter? It’s just… red clay. From the garden, mostly. It’s not like I’m eating potting soil or anything fancy. It’s just… smooth. And it feels… right, I suppose. Though I know it’s ridiculous. I just… sometimes I get a taste for it and… well. Don’t look at me like that.
DOCTOR: No judgment at all, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's important to understand everything. Red clay from the garden... Okay. Have you noticed any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? No. Not really. Maybe a little rumble sometimes, but nothing I haven’t had before. Nausea? No, thankfully. I get enough of that just thinking about… well. Vomiting? Absolutely not. I’m too old for that nonsense. And bowel habits… they’re… regular enough. Look, I’m not a complicated case. I'm just tired and I have a strange craving. Is that so hard to believe?
DOCTOR: Alright. No abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. Bowel habits are regular. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Known medical conditions… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was… oh, goodness, must be forty years ago now. And I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it’s not too bad. I mostly just ignore it. Other than that… nothing much. I’ve always been a healthy woman, until recently, of course. This tiredness… and the dirt. It's a puzzle, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal forty years ago, and arthritis in the knees. Anything else?
PATIENT: No. That's it. Really. I’ve never been much for doctors, to be honest. Always figured a bit of fresh air and hard work was good enough. But this… this is different. I can’t just ‘work through’ being tired all the time, can I? And I definitely can’t just ignore… well, you know. It's just... unsettling.
DOCTOR: You're right, Ms. Hardenburgh. Some things require a bit more investigation. Now, have you ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No. Just the gallbladder. And honestly, I'd forgotten all about it until you asked. It was ages ago, as I said. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I don't understand what any of this has to do with being tired and… having a peculiar taste.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Ms. Hardenburgh. I need to gather all the information to understand what might be going on. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, other than the gallbladder removal?
