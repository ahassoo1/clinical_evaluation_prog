DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Or… good afternoon, it is getting on, isn't it?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doc. Look, can we just get this over with? I got things to do, you know. Tremor, you said? Yeah, that’s why I’m here. It’s… annoying. Mostly in my hands.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. Annoying is… a good way to put it. We’ll try to be quick, I assure you. Mostly in your hands, you say?
PATIENT: Mostly. Sometimes it feels like...well, like a little earthquake inside me, but not really. It’s hard to explain. Been happening… oh, goodness. A while now. Months, I guess? Maybe longer. Honestly, time just… slips away, you know? Don't expect me to remember specifics.
DOCTOR: Yes, time does seem to accelerate as we get older, doesn't it?
PATIENT: Accelerate? Ha! It vanishes! Look, is this gonna involve poking and prodding? Because I really don't have the patience for a lot of that. Just tell me what it is and what I gotta do to make it stop. I used to be a very important man, you know. Directors don't have time for… fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. We’ll certainly try to minimize the poking and prodding, I promise you. But to get a better idea of what’s going on, I do need to ask a few questions, and do a quick exam. Just to be thorough. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Thorough… Fine. But fast. And no complicated words, alright? I haven't the energy for medical jargon. Just tell me in plain English what you think. And hurry it up. Honestly, waiting rooms… a waste of a perfectly good afternoon. What's first?
DOCTOR: Alright, plain English it is. First, let’s talk about when this tremor happens. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Definitely. More when I'm… trying to do something. Like, holding a glass, or signing something. That's the worst. Makes me look like a shaky old fool. Doesn’t happen when I’m just… sitting. Mostly. Though sometimes, even then, I feel a little… twitch. Not all the time, mind you. It's very… unpredictable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it’s more noticeable when you’re using your hands. And less so when you’re relaxed. Have you noticed it in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Other parts? Hmm. Now you’re asking. I suppose… sometimes in my leg. A little jittery feeling. Not as bad as the hands, though. It’s hard to say. I don't spend a lot of time inspecting my legs. Look, honestly, I'm more concerned about my hands. That’s what people see. You know, image is important. Especially when you've been… somebody. Does that make sense? I can’t have people thinking I'm falling apart.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Baide. Image is important. Now, aside from the tremor, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? You're being very vague, Doc. Look, I'm eighty years old. Things change. My hair falls out, my memory’s shot, I can’t hear as well… What exactly are you fishing for here? Just get to the point. If it’s about aches and pains, forget it. I got aches and pains everywhere. Part of getting old, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You’re right, aches and pains are a part of getting older. But I need to rule out anything else that might be contributing to this tremor. Have you noticed any stiffness in your joints?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Oh, goodness yes. Everything’s stiff! My fingers, my back, my knees… you name it. Especially in the morning. Like an old, rusty gate. But that's just age, isn't it? Arthritis, my wife used to call it. She knew all the medical terms. I never bothered learning them. Waste of time, I thought. Just tell me what I need to do to fix it. Is there a pill? A cream? Something? I don’t have time for… exercises.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll see what we can do. Have you noticed any changes in your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance? Hmm. Now you’re asking a tricky one. I suppose… maybe a little unsteady on my feet sometimes. Not falling or anything, mind you. Just… a little wobbly. But I blame my shoes. Always buying the wrong shoes. My daughter keeps telling me. She says I need something with more support. Honestly, all this questioning… it’s making me feel more off-balance just thinking about it. Look, can we just get to the examination? The sooner we’re done, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. We will. If you could just extend your arms in front of you, palms up, for a moment. And then tap your finger to your nose a few times. Just as quickly and accurately as you can. That’ll give me a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: There. Happy? It’s not exactly graceful, is it? I used to have steady hands. Directed masterpieces, I tell you! Now look at me… a trembling mess. Honestly, it’s humiliating. Just get on with it, Doc. The sooner I know what’s wrong, the better. And don't expect me to perform any tricks. I’m eighty years old, not a circus performer.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a complete picture. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t take all day. And be gentle, alright? My ribs are fragile. Honestly, this is a waste of a perfectly good afternoon. A waste. I had plans, you know. Important plans. But no, here I am, being poked and prodded by a… a… well, never mind. Just hurry it up, Doc. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Everything seems to be within normal limits, but there are a few things I’d like to discuss. Your tremor appears to be essential tremor, which is a common neurological condition, particularly in older adults. It’s not usually a sign of anything serious, but it can be bothersome.
PATIENT: Essential tremor? Never heard of it. Sounds… fancy. And bothersome is an understatement. It's ruining my life! What does that mean, exactly? And what can you do about it? A pill? An injection? Something? I don’t have time for… therapy. Honestly, I barely have the energy to get out of bed in the morning. Just tell me what I need to do to fix it, Doc. Plain English, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright, plain English. Essential tremor means your brain is sending a slight, involuntary signal to your muscles, causing them to shake. It often gets worse with movement, as you’ve noticed. There isn’t a cure, unfortunately. But there are treatments that can help manage the symptoms. We can try medication, like beta-blockers or anti-seizure drugs, to help calm the tremors. Lifestyle adjustments, such as avoiding caffeine and stress, can also be helpful.
PATIENT: Medication? More pills? Honestly, I’m already taking enough pills to fill a pharmacy. And avoid stress? That's rich! Try telling me how to avoid stress. I used to direct films! High pressure! Deadlines! Difficult actors! Look, is there anything else? Anything… stronger? Something that will actually fix this? Because I’m not interested in lifestyle adjustments. I want a solution, Doc. Not a lecture. And frankly, I don't trust these… beta-blockers. Sound like something they use to treat heart conditions, not tremors. What are the side effects? I don’t want to end up feeling worse than I already do. Honestly, this is all very… disappointing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. You’re right to ask about side effects. Beta-blockers can sometimes cause fatigue, dizziness, and low blood pressure. We would start with a low dose and monitor you carefully. There is another option, but it’s more invasive. We could consider deep brain stimulation, which involves implanting a device in your brain to help regulate the tremors. However, it’s a major surgery with potential risks and complications, and it’s typically reserved for more severe cases. Given your mild symptoms, I wouldn’t recommend it at this time. Perhaps we could try medication first and see how you respond?
PATIENT: Deep brain stimulation? You want to put a device in my brain? Absolutely not. Are you crazy? I may be old, but I’m not senile. I want no part of that. Look, I’m starting to think this tremor is just… something I have to live with. It’s annoying, yes, but maybe it’s not worth all this fuss. Medication sounds… unpleasant. Side effects, surgery… honestly, it’s all too much. Tell you what, Doc. I’ll try avoiding caffeine. Maybe. And I’ll try to… relax. But don’t expect miracles. Honestly, I think I’m just wasting my time here. Is there anything else you need to poke and prod? Because I’d like to get out of here. This afternoon is slipping away, you know. And I had plans. Important plans. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. We can certainly proceed that way. I will write you a prescription for propranolol, a low dose beta-blocker. If you experience any concerning side effects, please stop taking it immediately and contact my office. I’ll also give you some information about essential tremor and lifestyle adjustments. If your symptoms worsen or interfere with your daily life, please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. I’m here to help if you change your mind. And I'll also send a summary of today's consultation to your primary care physician. Do you have any other questions for me today?
