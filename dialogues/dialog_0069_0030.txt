DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. My name is Dr. Andraca, and it’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, honestly. I've noticed a change in how I smell, like… my body odor. It's not a bad smell, exactly, just different. I can't really explain it, and it’s worrying me a little. It started maybe a month or so ago?
DOCTOR: Okay, Kerriann, no need to be embarrassed at all. Changes in body odor can happen for a lot of reasons, and it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. It’s definitely something we can investigate. So, about a month ago you started noticing this change… Can you describe the difference in the smell a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's… tricky. It's not like the usual sweat smell, you know? It's… almost sweeter, maybe? Not like perfume sweet, but… different than just regular body smell. And it seems to be more noticeable after I've been working, which makes sense, I guess, 'cause I'm physical at my job. I lay floors, so it’s a lot of bending and lifting. But even when I’m not working hard, I think I can sometimes smell it, just… faintly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slightly sweeter odor, noticeable even at rest sometimes, and more prominent with physical exertion. That gives me a little more to work with. And just to clarify, has anything else changed around the same time?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. Not really, not that I can think of. My eating habits are pretty much the same. I haven't started any new medications. I’ve been a little more tired lately, but I just figured that was from the job. It’s been hot, too, so that could be it. Oh! And my period was a little late last month, but it came eventually. I’m divorced, so… it's not like I'm worried about that kind of thing, if that makes sense. Just… noticing it was different.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Thank you for sharing all of that, Kerriann. No need to be shy about anything. Changes in your menstrual cycle, even if you're not concerned about pregnancy, are good information. So, a slightly sweeter odor, noticeable even at rest, more prominent with exertion, no new medications, eating habits unchanged, a bit more tired, and a slightly late period last month. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if that's alright. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Sure, go ahead. No, I don’t have any known allergies. Not to food, not to medications. I've had a few bee stings when I was a kid, but nothing serious. I don’t break out in rashes or anything like that. My mother always said I was lucky that way. I haven’t had any problems with allergies in years, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And what about any current medications you're taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let's see… nothing regularly. I take ibuprofen sometimes if my back is really bothering me after work, but that’s it. Just as needed, maybe once or twice a month. And occasionally a multivitamin, but honestly, I forget half the time. It’s not a routine thing. Nothing else. Just the ibuprofen when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain and an occasional multivitamin. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... I had pneumonia when I was younger, maybe in my twenties. But that was a long time ago, and I recovered completely. And I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, of course. Oh! And I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been pretty well controlled with diet and exercise. No other major illnesses, really. Just the usual bumps and bruises from my job. Nothing serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in your twenties, tonsillectomy as a child, and high blood pressure currently controlled with diet and exercise. That's good to hear it's well-managed. And have you ever had any surgeries other than your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: No, just my tonsils. Nothing else. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, all things considered. My job is hard on the body, but I try to stay active and eat well to counteract it. I’ve never needed any other surgeries, thankfully. Not even a broken bone! Well, I sprained my ankle once, but that didn't require surgery. Just a lot of ice and rest.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, a quick question about your family. Is there any history of medical conditions that runs in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and she had heart problems later in life. She passed away a few years ago. And my father had high blood pressure, like me. My sister is healthy as a horse, as far as I know. But on my mother’s side, there was a history of diabetes and heart disease, definitely. And I think one of my uncles had cancer, lung cancer, I believe. But that’s about all I can remember off the top of my head. It was a big family, so keeping track is hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful information. Diabetes and heart disease on your mother’s side, high blood pressure like yours on both sides, and a history of lung cancer in an uncle. Now, just a couple more questions before we move on to a physical exam. Can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I lay floors for a living, so it’s very physical work. Lots of bending, lifting, kneeling… I'm on my feet all day. I try to eat healthy, mostly fruits, vegetables, lean protein. I don’t drink a lot, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I don’t smoke. I try to get enough sleep, but with my job, sometimes it’s hard. I live alone, so I don't have a lot of… distractions, I guess. I walk a lot, just from being at work, but I don’t really do any formal exercise. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, physically demanding job, healthy diet, occasional glass of wine, non-smoker, and adequate but sometimes interrupted sleep. Okay, Kerriann, thank you for all of that information. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I’m not usually one for doctors, but I figured it’s best to get this checked out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll need you to remove your shirt and bra, if you're comfortable. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Now, I'm just going to briefly palpate your lymph nodes to check for any swelling. No palpable lymphadenopathy detected. Thyroid feels normal. Alright, Kerriann, everything seems normal on the initial examination. However, the change in body odor is still concerning, and given your family history, we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Okay, that's… good to know it doesn't seem to be anything obvious. But what does that mean? What do we need to investigate? I’m a little worried now, to be honest. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, and I want to reassure you that we're taking this seriously. The fact that the physical exam was normal is encouraging, but a change in body odor can have several causes, some more concerning than others. Given your description of a slightly sweeter odor and your family history of diabetes, one possibility we need to rule out is uncontrolled diabetes. Even with a well-managed diet, blood sugar levels can fluctuate. Another possibility, although less likely given your normal thyroid exam, is a thyroid issue. Finally, while rarer, certain metabolic disorders can also cause changes in body odor. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. These tests will help us rule out some of the more common causes and guide our next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that… makes sense. Blood tests. I guess that's what I figured you'd do. Blood sugar… that's a bit worrying, with my mother. But I guess it's better to know. Yes, go ahead and order the tests. Whatever you think is best. When will I get the results? And will I need to come back for another appointment? I have to work, you know. It's hard to take time off.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. I’ll write the orders for you now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take the samples right away. It typically takes 24-48 hours for the results to come back. I will call you with the results as soon as they are available. We can discuss them over the phone and determine if another appointment is necessary. If the results are concerning, we’ll definitely schedule a follow-up to discuss further investigation and treatment options. If the results are normal, we can reassess the situation and consider other potential causes, or simply monitor for any further changes. To minimize disruption to your work, I'll try to schedule any follow-up appointment at a time that's convenient for you. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Blood tests, wait 24-48 hours, you'll call. That's good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking this seriously. It's just… embarrassing to talk about, you know? But I'm glad we're getting it checked out. I guess I'll go get the tests done now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. And you absolutely did the right thing by bringing this to my attention, and there’s absolutely no need to be embarrassed. It’s my job to listen and help you feel comfortable, and we’ll figure this out together. The lab is just around the corner – the receptionist can direct you. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before I call with the results. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: .
