DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Solero, you said? Hmm. Well, it’s about… this whole fuss about them wanting to do things. I don’t much care for folks poking around, if I'm honest. I've lived a long life, you know. A long life. And I’ve managed just fine so far without all these… interventions.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Wynell. It’s perfectly reasonable to be hesitant about medical tests or procedures, especially when you’ve been doing well on your own for so long. We definitely don’t want to do anything you’re not comfortable with. Could you tell me a little more about what “they” are wanting to do?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s mostly my daughter, Beatrice. She worries something fierce. She keeps going on about… scans, I think she called them? And blood work. Says my feet are… what was it? Swollen? She brings up everything, honestly. And then there’s that nice young man, the one from the home health agency. He keeps asking about… pain. I barely feel a thing! It's just old age, Doctor. It’s not like it’s anything new. Honestly, all this fuss is more bothersome than whatever’s going on with my feet.
DOCTOR: So, it sounds like your daughter and the home health aide are the ones encouraging these tests and check-ups, and you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed by it all. That’s completely understandable. Just to be clear, you’re saying your daughter and the aide have noticed some swelling in your feet, and the aide has been asking about any pain you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Well, yes. That's right. Swelling, yes. Beatrice is always going on about the swelling. And the young man… he asks such pointed questions! Like I’m made of glass or something. It’s… bothersome. I told her, I said, “Look, I’ve been a podiatrist for fifty years! I know what’s going on with my own feet!” Though, truthfully... it has been a good long time since I practiced. I suppose things do change. But I still don’t see the need for all these tests. It's just… a lot.
DOCTOR: You were a podiatrist for fifty years – that's wonderful! I can certainly understand why you might feel confident in assessing your own health, especially with that level of experience. And it's very common to feel a bit overwhelmed when others are suggesting tests and procedures. Just to get a clearer picture, even though you've been a podiatrist, and you're familiar with your feet, could you describe the swelling to me?
PATIENT: Hmm. Describe it… well, it’s just… bigger. They’re wider, I suppose. And… a bit tender, maybe? Not pain, exactly. More like… uncomfortable. Especially at the end of the day. And they feel… warm. Not feverish, mind you. Just… not cool like they used to be. I used to have such nice, cool feet. It’s all going downhill, you know. Everything. But I'm not complaining... much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the swelling is more noticeable at the end of the day, and you’ve noticed some tenderness and warmth in your feet. No fever, but they don't feel as cool as they used to. That gives me a better understanding. Now, has this swelling come on suddenly, or has it been gradually increasing over time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Gradually, I think. It wasn't like waking up one morning and boom – big feet! No, it’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose. A little bit bigger each day. Beatrice noticed it first, honestly. She has a very keen eye for such things. Always fussing over everything. I barely noticed it at all until she pointed it out. She’s a good girl, Beatrice, but she does worry too much.
DOCTOR: It sounds like it’s been a slow process, and your daughter has been very observant. That's good of her to be looking out for you. Now, besides the swelling, tenderness, and warmth, have you noticed any other changes in your feet or legs?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Changes… well, my ankles feel a little… stiff sometimes. Especially in the mornings. It takes a bit to get them moving. And… I think my skin is a little… darker, maybe? Yes, a bit darker than it used to be. And… oh! There’s a little spot on my left foot, right on top. It’s not painful, but it’s… different. I don’t remember ever seeing it before. It's small, mind you. Barely noticeable. But I did think it was odd.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for pointing that out. I see the spot, and it’s good you noticed the stiffness in the mornings as well. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about any other medical conditions you may have been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a long list, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life, remember? Let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure years ago, but it’s been under control for a long time. And… arthritis, of course. Most folks my age have some arthritis. And… I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. It was causing a lot of trouble. Oh! And I had a hip replacement about fifteen years ago. That was a good thing, though. Honestly, it's hard to remember everything. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. So, we have a history of high blood pressure, arthritis, gallbladder removal, and a hip replacement. Are you currently taking any medications for any of these conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take something for the blood pressure. A small white pill. And something for the arthritis. It’s a yellow one, I think. And… oh! Beatrice reminds me to take a little something for my bones. Says I need the calcium. Honestly, I have so many pills now, it's a wonder I remember to take them all. Beatrice keeps a chart, you know. She’s very organized. I don’t bother with charts. Too much fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're currently taking medication for your blood pressure, arthritis, and for your bones—calcium, it sounds like. And your daughter helps you keep track of those medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… Let me see. I don't think so. I’ve never had much trouble with allergies. I might be a little sensitive to shellfish, but I haven’t eaten shellfish in… oh, goodness, decades! So that doesn’t really matter, does it? And… I think I had a bit of a reaction to penicillin when I was a little girl, but that was so long ago, I barely remember it. Honestly, I’m not much for remembering things. It's just old age, I suppose. Everything gets a little… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible reaction to penicillin in the past and a sensitivity to shellfish, although you haven’t eaten it in a long time. Now, to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh, goodness. What does that mean? Well, I live in a… a lovely little assisted living place. They take good care of me. I mostly… sit. I don't do much walking anymore, if I'm honest. My daughter visits me every week, which is nice. And I read. I like to read. Mostly mysteries. And… I watch a bit of television. Mostly the news. Though it's not very cheerful, is it? It's a quiet life, Doctor. A very quiet life. Not much excitement.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a comfortable and peaceful lifestyle. So, you live in assisted living, enjoy visits with your daughter, reading mysteries, and watching the news. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your feet, your ankles, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam. Well… I suppose. I don’t much like being poked and prodded, if I'm honest. But if it’ll get Beatrice off my back… alright. Just be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle. And don't take too long. I have a good mystery novel waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as gentle as possible and won't keep you long. Okay, I'm just feeling your ankles now. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Hmm. A little bit. Not much, though. Just a dull ache. Like an old bruise, maybe? It’s nothing new. I get aches and pains all over, you know. It’s just old age. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to it anymore. But be careful, Doctor. Very careful. You're squeezing a very old lady's bones!
DOCTOR: Of course, I apologize if that was uncomfortable. I am being very careful. I see some mild discoloration here, and I noticed the small spot on your left foot earlier. It doesn’t appear to be infected, but it is worth keeping an eye on. Now, I'm just listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally for me.
PATIENT: Oh. Breathing. Yes. I’m a bit short of breath sometimes, if I’m honest. Especially when I get excited. Or when I walk too much. Which isn't very often, thankfully. It’s just old age, Doctor. My lungs aren’t what they used to be. Honestly, I don’t bother with doctors much. They always tell me the same thing: “It’s just old age.” It's very tiresome, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I do hear a little bit of wheezing, which can be common with age or if you’ve had any breathing problems in the past. Alright, Wynell. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some swelling and tenderness in your feet, possibly related to some arthritis and your age. The spot on your left foot doesn't appear to be a major concern at this time, but we should keep an eye on it. The mild wheezing suggests some possible mild lung involvement, which may require further investigation. Before we talk about potential plans, do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Plans? You mean… doing things? Honestly, I don’t much like the sound of that. I've lived a long life, Doctor. I've had enough "plans." I just want to be left alone to read my mysteries and enjoy my quiet life. Is that too much to ask? But, well... Beatrice will be asking. So what kind of "investigation" are you thinking? Will it involve needles? And will it take a long time? Honestly, I haven't got much time left, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Wynell. We don’t need to do anything you’re not comfortable with. The "investigation" I was referring to would involve a simple blood test to check for inflammation and rule out any other underlying causes for the swelling. It would also be helpful to get a chest X-ray to take a closer look at your lungs, just to make sure everything is okay. The blood test involves a small needle prick, and the X-ray is completely painless. Both tests would only take a few minutes. However, if you prefer, we can simply monitor your symptoms and see how things progress without any further testing. It’s your decision, and I will respect whatever you choose.
PATIENT: Needles… Oh, goodness. I hate needles. I always have. Faint at the sight of them, you know. And an X-ray… Is it safe? I’ve heard those things can be dangerous. Honestly, I don't know. Beatrice would want me to get them done, I'm sure of it. She always wants the best for me, even if it means poking and prodding. But I just want to be left alone. Tell you what, Doctor. Let's just… hold off for a bit. See how things go. If they get any worse, then maybe… maybe we'll talk about it. But no promises. And no needles, if you please. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Wynell. That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly hold off on the testing for now and see how things progress. No needles, I promise. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to check in and see if your symptoms have changed. If they do get worse, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your feet elevated whenever possible, and wearing comfortable shoes. And please, continue to listen to your body and rest when you need to. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Elevate my feet… comfortable shoes… Yes, I suppose. Beatrice already tells me all that. She's very good at nagging, you know. A few weeks… Yes, that sounds alright. As long as it doesn't involve any poking or prodding. Alright, Doctor. A few weeks it is. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I have a good mystery novel waiting for me. It’s been… nice talking to you. I suppose. And thank you for not making me get a needle.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Wynell. And you're very welcome. I’m glad we could come up with a plan you’re comfortable with. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Enjoy your novel, and I look forward to seeing you again in a few weeks. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
