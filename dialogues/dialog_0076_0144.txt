DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Calvery, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Lilly Calvery. Though, honestly, people forget my last name all the time. It's not important. I just… well, my daughter said I should come get checked up. She worries too much, that one. What exactly are we checking, anyway?
DOCTOR: Your daughter seems… conscientious. We’re doing a general check-up, Mrs. Calvery. Just to see what's going on. You're 64, right?
PATIENT: Sixty-four, yes. Though I feel younger, honestly. Not that anyone asks my opinion on the matter. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do. Not that I can remember what they are right now, but still. Things.
DOCTOR: We’ll try to be brief. Now, are you having any… complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? Oh, goodness. Where do I begin? The neighborhood kids are too loud, the grocery store changed their layout again… Honestly, doctor, at my age, there’s always something. But I suppose you mean about my body? No, nothing major. A little creaky, maybe. Isn’t everyone at this age? I haven’t fallen or anything, if that’s what you’re worried about. Though, now that I think about it… I did stumble a bit last week, but I blame the rug. A dreadful rug.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Creaky. Most people your age are creaky. Let’s focus on anything recent. Anything new?
PATIENT: New? Hmm… Well, my appetite hasn't been what it used to be. Not that I’m complaining, really. Food just… doesn't seem as appealing. And I get tired easier. But honestly, isn’t that just getting old? I used to be able to garden all day, now… a few weeds and I’m pooped. It’s probably just the heat, though. August is always dreadful.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite… fatigue. Anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it. Sometimes, when I’m trying to remember things… things just… don’t come. It’s not like a big problem, you understand. More like… words on the tip of my tongue. I used to have such a good memory. I could remember everyone’s birthday, everyone’s anniversary… Now, I struggle to remember what I had for breakfast! It’s quite embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Right. Memory problems. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long…? It's hard to say, really. It comes and goes, you know? A few months, maybe? Longer? Honestly, doctor, at my age, all the days just sort of… blur together. It’s not like it affects my daily life, not really. I can still manage. I still cook, I still… well, I still do things. I just… forget what those things were sometimes. It’s not important.
DOCTOR: Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Well, I have been a bit… clumsy lately. Dropped a plate last week, nearly tripped over the cat… Things like that. And sometimes, I feel… a little shaky. Just a slight tremble, you understand. Nothing major. I used to have such steady hands. I could do beautiful embroidery… But now… It’s probably just nerves. Or the heat. Honestly, doctor, everything feels a bit off these days. It’s probably just getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical…? Oh dear. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago. A very unpleasant experience, I assure you. And I broke my wrist when I was a child, climbing a tree, if you can believe it. A very foolish thing to do. And… I think I had the flu a few times. Honestly, doctor, it was all so long ago. I don’t remember the details. I’ve always been a healthy person, mostly. I don’t like going to doctors, if that makes any difference. It always ends in unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries other than the gallbladder?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me think… Oh! I had a bunion removed, years ago. On my left foot, I think. It was quite painful, but thankfully, it's all better now. And… I think my daughter mentioned something about a small procedure on my knee, years and years ago. But honestly, I don't remember the details. I don't like being put under, you see. It makes me feel… strange. Is this important, doctor? You’re asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It's… information. Family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s… complicated. My mother lived to be quite old, I think. Very stubborn woman, she was. Didn't believe in doctors either. My father… he died when I was young, I think. Something with his heart, I believe. But honestly, I don’t remember the details. We didn’t talk about these things much in my family. It was considered… impolite, perhaps. And my siblings… they’re all gone now, unfortunately. It's all very sad, really. Is this important, doctor? Because I’m not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Oh. Well, I’m widowed. My husband, George, passed away many years ago. A lovely man, he was. A very quiet man. We didn’t have many… social engagements, shall we say. We mostly kept to ourselves. I have a daughter, of course. She lives nearby, thankfully. She worries too much. I used to enjoy gardening, but my back isn't what it used to be. And I used to volunteer at the library, but I haven't been going lately. Not much of a social life, really. Mostly just quiet evenings at home. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Let me see… I don't think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I’m not very sensitive, you see. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don't care for shellfish, but that's a matter of taste, not allergy. And I used to be able to handle all sorts of plants in the garden without any problems. But honestly, doctor, my memory isn't what it used to be. I could be allergic to something and not even know it. It wouldn't surprise me. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications…? Oh dear. Let me see… I have something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. And sometimes, I take something for my arthritis, when my joints are acting up. But honestly, I forget what they’re called. My daughter manages most of it, you see. She fills my pill organizer. I just take what she gives me. I’m not very good at remembering these things, doctor. It’s probably best if you ask my daughter.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh… stand up? Oh dear. I suppose so. It might be a bit wobbly, you see. My legs aren't what they used to be. And I don't want to fall and make a mess of things. Be careful now, doctor. I'm not as steady as I used to be. Is this going to take long? I get a bit dizzy when I stand up too quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a quick check of your reflexes. A little weak. And your blood pressure is… elevated. 150/90. Pulse is a bit irregular, too. 88 and slightly thready. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a bit labored. Overall, somewhat frail appearance. Documenting: Gait instability, elevated blood pressure, irregular pulse, and mild dyspnea.
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… concerning. Dyspnea? Is that bad? I just get a little winded sometimes, you see. Especially when I climb the stairs. But I’m sure it’s nothing serious. Just getting old, I suppose. What does this all mean, doctor? Am I sick? My daughter will be so worried…
DOCTOR: It's… not ideal, Mrs. Calvery. We need to run some tests to get a better picture of what's going on. Blood work, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and possibly a chest X-ray. I'm also going to recommend a referral to a cardiologist. We need to rule out any serious heart problems. I’ll have the nurse draw blood now, and then we can schedule the other tests. Don’t panic, alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests? A cardiologist? This sounds… complicated. I don't like tests, doctor. They always make me anxious. And a cardiologist… that sounds very serious. I just wanted a little check-up, you see. My daughter made me come. She worries too much. Is it something bad, doctor? You have to tell me. I need to know.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say, Mrs. Calvery. That’s why we need the tests. Your symptoms – the fatigue, the memory problems, the irregular pulse, the elevated blood pressure – they could be a number of things. It's possible it's nothing serious, but we need to rule out the more concerning possibilities. I don't want to alarm you, but it’s better to be cautious. We’ll get the results as quickly as possible, and then we’ll discuss the next steps. The nurse will explain everything. I have other patients waiting. We’ll get this sorted out. Don’t worry.
PATIENT: Oh… But… what am I supposed to do now? My daughter isn't here. And I don't like hospitals. And I don't understand all these tests. Is there… is there anything I can do to feel better right now? Just… something to calm my nerves? This is all very overwhelming. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: The nurse will give you something for your anxiety, a mild sedative. And she'll explain the process for the tests. Really, it’s routine. Focus on breathing deeply. That’s all you can do right now. I have other patients who are waiting, Mrs. Calvery. I’ll have the nurse contact your daughter. Just… try to relax. .
PATIENT: .
