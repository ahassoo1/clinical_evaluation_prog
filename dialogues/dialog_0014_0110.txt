DOCTOR: Alright, Nicoletta, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Osterholm. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply… I feel like I need a little… jumpstart, I suppose. I’m getting on in years, you see, and things just aren’t working like they used to. I want to feel… fresher. More me again, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: A “jumpstart,” hmm. I see. Well, feeling less than your best isn’t enjoyable at any age. When did you start noticing these changes, this… lack of “freshness,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It hasn’t been sudden, you understand. More… gradual. Probably the last six months or so, really. I used to walk every morning, down by the beach, but lately… well, I find myself making excuses. And even just getting through the day feels a bit more…effortful. I used to have so much energy for my garden, but it’s just…sitting there now. Not like I’m sick, you know? Just… worn out.
DOCTOR: Six months… gradual onset… understandable. You said you’re still not feeling sick, which is good. No fever, chills, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all. No aches or pains, no cough… I sleep alright, though sometimes I wake up a bit stiff. But really, it’s mostly just… a lack of pep. Like the battery’s run down a bit, if you follow me. I just want to feel a little more like my old self again, Doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Nicoletta, that’s not too much to ask at all. A lot of people experience that as they get older. Let's try to pinpoint what might be going on. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear. Well… my appetite hasn’t been bad, exactly. But I haven't been cooking as much, you see. Mostly simple things. And I think… I think I’ve lost a little weight. Not a lot, but my clothes feel a bit looser. I hadn’t really thought much of it, to be honest. I used to be a good cook, always making big meals for my family, but it just feels like… too much effort now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh yes. Let me see… Just my blood pressure medicine. Lisinopril, I think it’s called? And I take a little something for my arthritis, just when it flares up. Naproxen, usually. Nothing else, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Naproxen as needed. Good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. My husband… he had some trouble with shellfish, but I haven't had any problems myself. I can eat pretty much anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, Nicoletta. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Just routine. Then we'll take a quick look at your reflexes and maybe a little balance test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I always get a little nervous with doctors, but I trust you.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll explain everything as I go. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your age. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular, though a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Throat looks fine. Now, let’s check your ears. … Ears look clear as well. I’ll just check your reflexes now.
PATIENT: Alright. Well, that didn't seem too bad. My mother always said a doctor’s visit was good for the nerves, even if it didn’t feel good at the time. A slight murmur, you say? I didn’t know I had that. Is that something I should be worried about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s a very mild murmur, Nicoletta. Many older people develop innocent heart murmurs. It's usually nothing to worry about, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s just do a quick balance test. Just stand like this for a moment. ...A little unsteady, but not alarming. Alright. Now, I’m going to have you walk a few steps, heel-to-toe. … A bit slow, and a little wide-based. Okay, Nicoletta, that’s enough for now. Everything seems…typical for your age, but let’s get some bloodwork done just to rule out anything else.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Typical is good! I always worry when they say “let’s get some bloodwork done.” What exactly are you looking for, Doctor? And will it be a lot? I don’t like needles very much, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Nicoletta. We’ll try to make it as quick and painless as possible. I'm looking for a complete blood count to check for anemia and infection, a thyroid panel to see if your thyroid is functioning properly, vitamin D levels as many older people are deficient, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar. It's a standard set of tests for someone experiencing fatigue and loss of energy. It shouldn’t be too much blood, just a few vials. I'll also order a urinalysis, just to rule out a urinary tract infection, as those can sometimes cause fatigue in older adults.
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That sounds like a lot of things! Anemia… is that serious? And what about the thyroid? My sister had trouble with that once. I just want to feel better, Doctor. Is there anything… anything I can do now to help myself, while we’re waiting for the results? Perhaps something with my diet? I do enjoy a good cup of tea, if that counts.
DOCTOR: It is a fair amount of blood, I admit, but necessary to rule things out. Anemia can be serious if left untreated, but it's often easily corrected with diet or supplements. And yes, your sister's thyroid trouble is relevant - we're checking to see if there's a similar issue. While we wait for the results, there are a few things you can try. Make sure you're getting enough protein in your diet – that’s important for maintaining muscle mass. Lean meats, fish, eggs, and beans are good sources. And yes, tea is fine, as long as it’s not replacing water. Hydration is key. Also, try to incorporate some gentle exercise into your daily routine, if you're able. A short walk each day can make a big difference. And most importantly, don’t push yourself too hard. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Nicoletta.
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds very sensible, Doctor. More protein, gentle exercise… I think I can manage that. My grandson always tells me to drink more water. I suppose he's right about that, too. He’s a good boy. I'll try my best with everything you've said. And when will I know the results, Doctor? Will I need to come back for another visit?
DOCTOR: Good. It’s always helpful to have support. The results should be back in about three to five business days. I'll have the nurse call you with the results, and we'll schedule a follow-up visit to discuss them and create a plan, regardless of what they show. We always like to follow up. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as a fever, chills, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please contact the office immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand perfectly, Doctor. Three to five business days… and I'll contact the office if anything new happens. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It puts my mind at ease. Thank you, Doctor Osterholm. You’ve been very kind. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nicoletta. You’re welcome. We’ll get those tests ordered and get you scheduled for a follow-up. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and answer any remaining questions. Take care of yourself, and remember what we discussed. Try to get some rest.
