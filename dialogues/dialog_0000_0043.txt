DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel, welcome. I’m Dr. Batara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Dr. Batara. Nice to meet you too. It’s this headache, see? Right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for… oh, let me think… about three days now, maybe four. It's not the worst pain, not like a migraine or anything, but it's there. Constant, you know? Makes it hard to concentrate on things. Especially my numbers. And that’s a problem for me, bein' a financial advisor and all.
DOCTOR: Numbers, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Gotta keep ‘em straight for my clients. Dates, amounts, percentages… everything. Usually, I’m pretty sharp, even at my age. But this headache… it’s like a fog. Makes it harder to recall things quickly. I don’t want to make any mistakes, you understand. People are trustin’ me with their life savings. It’s a big responsibility.
DOCTOR: So, you’re a financial advisor and you're experiencing… difficulty with your work due to a headache. Right. And this headache… is it constant, as you said?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty much constant. It’s not like it comes and goes in waves, more like a dull ache that just… stays. It doesn’t throb, if that makes sense. And it doesn’t really spread anywhere. Just right there, at the back of my skull. Sometimes it feels a little tight, like a band around my head, but mostly just… present. I’ve tried takin’ some over-the-counter pain relievers, the kind you get at the drugstore, but they don't seem to do much good.
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter medications... what specifically have you tried?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I think it was… Ibuprofen, mostly. And maybe some Tylenol, a couple of times. I don’t take a lot of pills, never have. Usually just tough it out, but this one’s hangin’ on. I tried takin’ ‘em with food, like the bottle says, and the right amount, but it just doesn’t seem to touch it. Honestly, Dr. Batara, it’s just… bothersome. It’s not the pain so much as the fuzziness it’s causin’.
DOCTOR: "Fuzziness," you say. Can you describe this "fuzziness" a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Well, it's hard to explain. It’s not like I can’t think, exactly. But… things feel distant, you know? Like I’m lookin’ at ‘em through a fog. I might be talkin’ to someone and have to really concentrate to remember what I was sayin’ just a few seconds ago. Or I’ll be lookin’ at a spreadsheet and it takes a little longer to process the numbers. Little things, but they’re addin’ up. And bein' an advisor, gotta be sharp. I worry I'm slowin' down. It's not a dizzy feeling, or blurry vision, just… a little bit out of it. It's like my brain is workin' through molasses.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms with this headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no nausea or vomitin’. No blurry vision, like I said. My neck’s a little stiff, maybe, but I’ve always had a bit of trouble with my posture. I haven't noticed any weakness in my arms or legs. And no changes in my taste or smell. Honestly, Dr. Batara, it’s mostly just the headache and this… cloudiness in my head. I sleep okay, I think. Maybe I wake up a little more tired than usual, but I'm an old man, so that's nothin' new.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago. But the doctor put me on some medicine and it's been under control for a long time now. I haven’t been to the doctor much lately, to be honest. I try to stay healthy, eat right, and get some exercise. Nothing major, just walkin’ around a bit. I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was decades ago. And… oh, my wife and I, we used to go to the clinic regularly for our vaccinations, but… well, she passed away a few years back.
DOCTOR: And what about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Just the medicine for my blood pressure, like I mentioned. It’s called… let me see if I can remember… Lisinopril, I think. Small dose, ten milligrams a day. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes I take a little bit of Vitamin D in the winter, just 'cause the doctor suggested it. But that’s about it. I don’t like takin’ a lot of pills, never have.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Dr. Batara. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m not afraid of a little exam. Just let me know if it’s gonna be… uncomfortable, alright? Old bones ain’t as flexible as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Good. Let’s start with your blood pressure. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Now, I’d like you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. And finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Alright. Everything appears normal, neurologically speaking. Your reflexes are normal, grip strength is good, and your heart and lungs sound clear. However, your blood pressure is a little high.
PATIENT: Well, that's… good to know, I suppose. A little high blood pressure doesn't surprise me too much, with my age. I try to watch my salt intake, but sometimes it's hard. It’s just a little worrisome that this headache is hangin’ on. Do you think it’s related to the blood pressure, Dr. Batara? Or do you think we should look into somethin' else?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say definitively at this point, Mr. Gibbel. Elevated blood pressure can cause headaches, but there are many other potential causes as well. Given your age and the fact that this headache is persistent and accompanied by some cognitive changes—the “fuzziness” you describe—I think it’s prudent to investigate further. I’d like to order a few blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. We should also get an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. And, given the cognitive symptoms, I'd recommend a CT scan of your brain, just to rule out anything serious. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to your brain. Do you agree?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… serious, Dr. Batara. Is it somethin' you’re worried about? I… I don’t want to get too anxious over nothin’. But I understand what you're sayin’. Better safe than sorry. If that’s what you think is best, then yes, I agree. Let’s do the tests. I trust your judgment. Just… please let me know what you’re lookin’ for, alright? It helps to know what's goin’ on in my own head.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The CT scan will allow us to visualize your brain and rule out any structural abnormalities, such as a tumor, bleed, or stroke. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I’m not necessarily worried, Mr. Gibbel, but it’s important to be thorough. Your symptoms could be due to something relatively benign, like stress or mild hypertension. But we need to rule out anything more serious. The lab orders are sent, and I will schedule the CT scan for you as soon as possible. The receptionist will contact you to arrange a time. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a low dose of medication to help control your blood pressure. It’s a mild diuretic – will help you get rid of some extra fluid. And I recommend you keep a detailed headache diary, noting the time, severity, and any associated symptoms. This will help us monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A headache diary… alright, I can do that. I used to keep track of my numbers pretty meticulously, so I guess I can get back into the habit. The diuretic… is it somethin’ with a lot of side effects? I try to avoid takin’ too many pills, if you remember. And… what about the results? How long will it take to get them back? I’m a bit anxious about waitin’, to be honest. Will the receptionist contact me directly, or should I call the office?
DOCTOR: The diuretic has minimal side effects in most patients—usually just increased urination. It’s a low dose, so the risk is low. And, frankly, controlling your blood pressure is important for your overall health. It’s not ideal, no, but sometimes a little medication is necessary. As for the results, the blood tests should be back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan will take a little longer, maybe 2-3 business days for the radiologist to review and send the report. The receptionist will contact you directly to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. They'll also let you know if there are any urgent findings. I understand your anxiety, Mr. Gibbel, but we need to be patient. Rushing things won’t help anyone. We’re doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. And if you experience any worsening symptoms—severe headache, fever, weakness, confusion—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers everything, Dr. Batara. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. And… thank you for takin’ the time to listen to me. It’s nice to have someone take my worries seriously. I’ll keep the headache diary and try to be patient, like you said. I’ll be sure to call if anything gets worse. And I appreciate the reminder about the emergency room.
DOCTOR: Very well. Get some rest, Mr. Gibbel. And keep me updated. .
