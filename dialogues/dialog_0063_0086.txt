DOCTOR: Good afternoon. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. Now, Ms. Kovtun, you're twenty-nine years of age, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Twenty-nine. And it’s Kahrin, please. No need for the “Ms.”, if you don’t mind. Just want to get this over with, if that’s okay. I’m here for the results, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “results” is… a simplification. I prefer a more thorough understanding of why you’re seeking medical attention. Though, if you insist on brevity… What precisely prompted you to schedule this appointment?
PATIENT: Look, I was told to come in for the blood work results. I don't really do explaining things over and over. The nurse gave me the date and time, said Dr. Jules wanted to discuss them. I’m a logistician, I like things streamlined. So, can we just… get to the point? What did the tests show?
DOCTOR: “Streamlined,” you say. Very well. Though a complete medical history is… preferred… we can attempt to expedite this. The blood work revealed… some irregularities. Specifically, your Vitamin D levels are quite low. And your iron is on the lower end of acceptable. Have you been feeling unusually fatigued lately?
PATIENT: Fatigued? Not… really. I mean, I work long hours, so tired, yeah. But not… unusually. I just thought it was the job. What does low Vitamin D even mean? Is it bad? And the iron… is that why I feel a little breathless sometimes when I’m walking up stairs?
DOCTOR: "A little breathless," you say. It could be related to the iron deficiency, yes. Low Vitamin D... it impacts bone health, immune function, general well-being. It's not immediately life-threatening, but it can lead to other complications if left unaddressed. Now, have you been spending much time outdoors lately?
PATIENT: Not as much as I used to. I work indoors, mostly. And when I'm not working, I'm usually… well, pretty busy. Honestly, getting outside just hasn't been a priority. So, is it just… I need more sunshine? Is that all? Or is it something I need a pill for? Because if it’s a pill, that's fine. I can handle a pill.
DOCTOR: “Just” sunshine is a… gross oversimplification. It can be corrected with increased sun exposure, if feasible. However, given your lifestyle, supplementation is likely the more practical approach. We’ll start you on a Vitamin D3 supplement, 2000 IU daily. As for the iron… Do you have any dietary restrictions?
PATIENT: No dietary restrictions. I eat… whatever’s convenient, mostly. I’m not picky. So, a pill for the Vitamin D and… what about the iron? Another pill? Is it going to make me feel sick? I’ve had bad experiences with pills before.
DOCTOR: Yes, likely another pill. Ferrous sulfate, 325mg twice daily. It can cause gastrointestinal upset – nausea, constipation, dark stools. Take it with food to minimize those effects. And drink plenty of water. We'll monitor your iron levels with a follow-up blood test in three months. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. Okay, so… Vitamin D pill, iron pill, take with food, drink water, blood test in three months. Got it. Is that… everything? I mean, is there anything else I need to worry about? I really need to get back to work. I have deadlines.
DOCTOR: For someone your age, and given the brevity of our consultation, no, I believe that covers the most pressing issues. I would strongly advise a more balanced diet and increased physical activity, but that is, of course, at your discretion. I’ll have the nurse prepare the prescriptions and schedule the follow-up bloodwork. Do you have any further questions before I finish?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s… everything. Thank you. Just… get the prescriptions ready, please. And the appointment. I need to go. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will assist you. Have a… productive day. .
