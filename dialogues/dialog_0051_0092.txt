DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Glazewski, you say? Hmm. Well, I’m here 'cause… things ain't right. I get outta breath, just walkin’ to the store, you know? And my mouth... feels like the desert. Eyes too. Dry as anything. It’s been… a while now, I guess. Don’t rightly remember when it started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: I understand. Shortness of breath and dryness… both in your mouth and eyes. And you’re having trouble pinpointing when this began. That’s alright, it happens. It's common for things to develop gradually. So, just to clarify, the breathlessness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I do somethin’. Walkin’, even talkin’ too long sometimes. Sittin’ still, I’m alright. Usually. It’s just… gettin’ worse, I think. Noticed it more lately. Used to be able to walk a mile, no problem. Now? Forget about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s exertional – meaning it gets worse with activity – and has been progressing recently. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned the dryness… is that just in your mouth and eyes, or are you experiencing any dryness anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm… anywhere else? Let me think. No. Just the mouth and eyes. Skin’s always been dry, livin’ in Florida, but that's normal, right? Never anything extra dry. Just… the usual. It's mostly annoyin', you know? Makes talkin' a pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the mouth and eyes then, and you’ve lived in Florida long enough to be used to some dryness generally. I understand it’s mostly an annoyance, but we want to figure out why it’s happening. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shortness of breath and dryness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well… sometimes I cough. Not a bad cough, just… a little tickle in my throat. Happens more when I lay down, I think. And… my legs. They swell up a bit at the end of the day. Been happenin' for a while, too. Might be the heat, though. Everything swells in the heat, don't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, especially when lying down, and some leg swelling. You suspect the swelling is heat-related, which is reasonable. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like heart problems, lung issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Heart problems… Doc told me somethin’ years ago… high blood pressure, I think. Gave me pills. Took ‘em for a while. Stopped when I ran outta refills, to be honest. Didn't seem to be doin’ much good anyway. Lung problems? No. Never smoked. Didn’t like it. Diabetes? Nah. I like my sweets, but never been told I have it. Old Man Hernandez had it, poor fella. Terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication in the past, but discontinued. No known lung issues and no history of diabetes. That’s good to know. And any surgeries or hospitalizations that you can recall?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… Had my appendix out when I was a kid. That's about it. Nothin' major. No hospitalizations, not really. Spent a night once when I broke my arm fallin' off a roof, fixin' somethin'. But that was a long time ago. Just a broken arm.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, and a broken arm many years ago. We’re getting a good picture here. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family who has had similar problems – heart disease, lung problems, or anything else that runs in the family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother, she died young. Heart trouble, they said. Real quick. Never knew her well enough to know details. My father… he lived to be old. Strong as an ox. Never got sick a day in his life, as far as I know. Lots of cousins, but didn’t see ‘em much. Never talked about health problems much, to be honest. Mostly talked about baseball.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a mother who passed away from heart trouble at a young age, and a father who remained healthy throughout his life. That’s helpful information, thank you. Now, just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I take a little somethin' for my knees sometimes. Arthritis, you know? Makes 'em ache. Just somethin' I got from the drugstore. Ibuprofen, I think it's called. And... sometimes I take a vitamin. Multivitamin. Just to keep healthy. That’s about it. Nothin' fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a daily multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Nah. Not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. Bees sting, like anybody, but that ain't an allergy, is it? Never had a reaction to any pills or nothin'. Good constitution, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, can you tell me a little about your daily life?
PATIENT: Daily life… Not much to tell, really. I live alone. Retired, been that for… oh, a long time now. I watch TV. Read the paper. Walk around a bit, when I can. Used to fish a lot, but haven’t been in a while. Mostly just… takin' it easy. It's a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Sounds peaceful. Alright, Mr. Guilds, I think we have a good start. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. Just gettin' old, I reckon. Everything’s fallin' apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds, everything seems fairly straightforward, but I did notice a few things. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and I heard a slight murmur when listening to your heart. Your lung sounds are a bit quiet, and there’s some mild swelling in your legs. Now, I want to order a few tests to get a better idea of what’s going on. I want a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an EKG to check your heart, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Always somethin'. Well, alright. If you think it's necessary. Just… don’t want a lotta needles. Never been good with needles. When do I gotta do 'em? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, Mr. Guilds. We'll try to make it as quick and painless as possible. We'll just need a small sample of blood. The lab is right down the hall, and it shouldn't take more than a few minutes. As for the results, it usually takes a couple of days for everything to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan. In the meantime, are there any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: A couple of days, huh? Alright. Not too bad. As for questions… well… is it somethin' serious? I ain’t lookin’ for trouble, doc. Just wanna get back to watchin' my baseball.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, it’s too early to say definitively whether it’s serious. The symptoms you're describing – shortness of breath, swelling in your legs, and the findings on the exam – could be caused by several things. It could be something relatively minor, like fluid retention due to your age, or it could be something more significant, such as a heart condition or lung problem. That's why we're running these tests – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on and determine the best course of action. I don’t want to worry you unnecessarily, but it’s important to take these symptoms seriously and rule out anything potentially serious. We'll know more once the tests come back. In the meantime, please try to avoid strenuous activity and let me know immediately if your symptoms get worse. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Strenuous activity… yeah. That ain’t gonna be a problem. I ain't been doin' much of that lately. So… you think it could be my heart? Like my mother?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, Mr. Guilds. Given your mother's history, it’s something we need to investigate. However, it’s important to remember that everyone is different, and having a family history of a condition doesn’t automatically mean you have it too. That’s why we’re doing the EKG and other tests – to get a more accurate assessment of your heart function. We'll look at all the results together and then we can discuss possible causes and next steps. We’ll take things one step at a time. For now, try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I reckon not. You explained it pretty well, doc. Just… try not to keep me waitin’ too long for the results. Appreciate you lookin’ into it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guilds. We'll do our best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. The lab should be able to expedite things, knowing your concerns. Here’s a copy of the lab request. Just take it to the front desk, and they’ll get you scheduled. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant swelling in your legs – please don’t hesitate to call us or go to the nearest emergency room immediately. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Take care of yourself, and please call if you have any questions at all. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, doc. You’re a good one. .
