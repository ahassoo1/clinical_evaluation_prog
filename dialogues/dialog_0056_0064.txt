DOCTOR: Hi Sherion, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It's my chest. It's been… hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels like… a tight squeeze, you know? Like someone is sitting on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight squeeze. That’s helpful. And how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I think, maybe two weeks ago? At first it was just when I walked up the hill to the store, but now… sometimes it happens even when I'm just sitting. It’s funny, it happened this morning while I was making coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's becoming more frequent, even with minimal exertion. And when you say “tight squeeze”, where exactly in your chest do you feel it?
PATIENT: Right here, in the middle. Not on the sides, but right… smack-dab in the middle. And sometimes, it feels like it goes a little bit into my left arm, but not always. It's not a bad pain, you know? More… uncomfortable. Like a heavy weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, center of the chest, potentially radiating to the left arm. And you describe it as uncomfortable, like a heavy weight, not sharp or stabbing?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Not stabbing, no. It’s… dull, mostly. And heavy. Like someone put a stone there. It doesn’t take my breath away, but it makes me stop what I’m doing. My husband, Carlos, he says I get a little bit pale when it happens too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s causing you to pause your activity and your husband has noticed some paleness. Have you noticed anything else happening with the chest discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I get a little bit sweaty when it happens, just a little. And… maybe a little bit short of breath, but not much. It's not like I’m gasping for air or anything. And… oh! I feel a little bit sick to my stomach sometimes, but that doesn't happen every time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some sweating, mild shortness of breath, and occasional nausea with the chest discomfort. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have a little bit of… what Carlos calls the “sugar problem”. You know, diabetes. It's not too bad, I take a pill every morning. And my blood pressure… sometimes it goes up a little bit, but mostly it’s okay. I have Medicare, so they check it pretty often. I haven't been to the hospital for anything big in… oh, goodness, maybe ten years? Just regular check-ups.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have type 2 diabetes, managed with medication, and some history of high blood pressure. Ten years since any hospitalizations, mostly routine check-ups. Are you currently taking any medications for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. For the sugar, I take Metformin, one pill in the morning. And for the blood pressure, I take… Lisinopril, I think it's called. A small white pill. I take it every night before bed. Carlos helps me keep track of everything, he's very good with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Metformin and Lisinopril. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of! Carlos always asks when they give me something new at the doctor, and they haven't found anything. I eat everything, even spicy food! Though Carlos doesn’t like it so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, quickly, have you or anyone in your family ever had any heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My father… he had a little bit of trouble with his heart when he was older. He had to have a… a doctor put a little thing in his leg, a long time ago. He didn’t talk much about it. My mother, she was healthy as a horse! No heart problems on her side. Carlos's side… I don't really know. We didn’t talk about that much either.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of heart issues in your father. Alright, Sherion, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine! Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold. My skin gets chilly sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/88. Your pulse is 82 and regular. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear a slight murmur when I listen to your heart. It’s not a loud murmur, but it's worth noting. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Now, I’m not going to jump to any conclusions, but given your symptoms, your history, and what I’m hearing now, I want to order a few tests to get a better picture of what’s going on. We’ll do an EKG to check your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart, and some blood work, including a cardiac enzyme test. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds like a lot! A murmur? Swelling? I hadn't even noticed the swelling, really. Carlos might have. But tests… yes, yes, that's probably best. If you think it’s important, I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you need, just let me know. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I’m not trying to alarm you, Sherion, just being thorough. The tests will help us rule things out and get you the right care. I’m going to have the nurse draw some blood now, and then we’ll get you scheduled for the EKG and chest X-ray. In the meantime, I want you to take it easy. Avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. Carlos will be glad to hear that. He worries about me. No strenuous activity… I mostly just garden and cook, so that shouldn’t be too hard. And I’ll remember about the emergency room. Severe pain… I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and… patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. I’m glad I could help, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before we get the test results back. The nurse will be in shortly to get started with the blood work. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again! I will be waiting.
