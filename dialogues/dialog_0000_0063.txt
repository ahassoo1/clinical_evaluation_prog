DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs, welcome. I’m Dr. Batara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Batara. It's nice to meet you. My back... it hurts really bad. It's been hurting for a little while now, but it's gotten much worse these past few days. It makes it hard to do... well, anything, really.
DOCTOR: “A little while” isn’t very specific, Ms. Meigs. Can you be more precise?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started… maybe six weeks ago? A little bit after my sister came to visit. Not right after, but… around then. It was just a little ache at first, you know? I thought I just slept wrong. But then it started getting worse each week. Now... now it's a sharp pain, and it doesn't go away. Even when I'm sitting.
DOCTOR: Six weeks. And this “sharp pain”... where exactly is it located?
PATIENT: It's... mostly in my lower back, right here. But it also goes down my left leg sometimes. Not all the way to my foot, but… down the back of my leg. It feels like… a burning and a pinching, if that makes sense. And when I try to bend over... oof. That's when it really hurts.
DOCTOR: So, lower back pain radiating down the left leg. Burning and pinching sensation. Worse with bending. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. Sitting still sometimes helps a little. But not for long. And… warm baths feel good for a minute, but then the pain comes back. I tried some of those pain creams from the store, the ones for muscles, but they didn't do much. It's pretty constant, to be honest. Just different levels of bad.
DOCTOR: Constant pain for six weeks... and no relief with over-the-counter remedies. Alright. Have you had any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Yes! Now that you mention it, yes. Sometimes my left foot feels… kinda numb. Like when it's been asleep. And sometimes it tingles, like little pins and needles. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens. Mostly when I've been walking for a bit. Or… standing for too long.
DOCTOR: Numbness and tingling… Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever had back problems before?
PATIENT: Not really. Just normal aches, you know, from working. I work at the factory, packing boxes. It's a lot of bending and lifting. But never anything like this. I did see a doctor a few years back... about something else. About the… the cancer. But that’s… that's different. I don't know if that's what this is about. Is it?
DOCTOR: Cancer?
PATIENT: Yes. They found something in my lung, a couple of years ago. I had some treatment… some pills and some radiation. It… it went into remission, the doctor said. But I worry sometimes… that it's come back. Could this back pain be… from that? That’s what I’m scared of, mostly.
DOCTOR: Lung cancer in remission… Yes, I see it here. Alright. It’s good you brought that up. It is important. Now, let’s rule things out systematically. I’m going to need to do a physical exam. Can you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, that’s… that’s fine. I'll lie down. Is it going to hurt? I’m a little worried about moving too much with the pain.
DOCTOR: It may be uncomfortable, but I’ll be gentle. I need to check your range of motion, reflexes, and strength. We’ll start slowly. First, just lie flat on your back. Relax your legs. And let me know immediately if anything is too painful. Now, can you point your toes up towards the ceiling?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It feels… a little tight. Not sharp pain, just… tight. And a little achy. But it's okay, I think. It's probably just from laying down.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about this?
PATIENT: Ooh! That one! Yes, that's where it hurts the most! Right there. That’s a really bad spot. It feels like… like a burning knife. Sorry!
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. I apologize. Yes, that is quite tender. Now, let’s try some straight leg raises. I’m going to lift your leg, keeping it straight. Tell me if you feel any pain radiating down your leg. We'll start with the right leg first.
PATIENT: Okay. It's… okay so far. Just a little stretch. Nothing bad.
DOCTOR: And now the left?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh! That one! That one is bad! Stop, please! It's shooting down my leg! A really bad burning pain! Please, don’t lift it anymore! It's really, really painful!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Stop right there. I’m not going to push it. That was… quite telling. Based on your history and the physical exam, it’s likely you have a herniated disc with radiculopathy – meaning the nerve root is being compressed. However, given your history of lung cancer, we need to rule out other possibilities. I want to order an MRI of your lumbar spine and a chest X-ray to compare with previous scans. I will also order bloodwork, including inflammatory markers. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: MRI… and X-ray? A herniated… what? And is that… is that serious? And the cancer… you think it might have spread? Contrast dye… no, I don't think so. I've never had any problems with dye before. But… what if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs, let’s take it one step at a time. A herniated disc is when the cushion between the bones in your spine slips out of place, pressing on a nerve. It's a common cause of back pain, and often treatable. It doesn’t automatically mean anything serious. We need the MRI to confirm the diagnosis and see exactly what's going on. As for the cancer... the X-ray is a precaution, just to ensure there’s been no recurrence or spread. It's possible, but not necessarily probable. We’re being thorough. I understand you’re worried, and it's good you’re asking these questions. For now, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and an NSAID to help manage the pain. I also want you to avoid any heavy lifting, bending, or twisting. I’ll have the lab draw blood for the tests, and the radiology department will schedule your scans as soon as possible. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay… Muscle relaxant and NSAID… and no lifting. That’s… hard, because of my job. Can I… can I still go to work? Just… doing lighter things? And how long will the scans take? And when will I get the results? I really just want to know… is it bad? Is the cancer back?
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, I understand your anxiety, but I cannot provide a definitive answer until we have the results of the tests. Speculation is not helpful. Regarding work, I would strongly advise you to stay home until we know more. Lifting, bending, and twisting will only exacerbate your condition. Perhaps you could discuss a temporary leave of absence with your employer. The scans should take approximately 30-45 minutes each. The results will take 24-48 hours to be interpreted by the radiologist. I will call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or a fever – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. I understand. No lifting… stay home… wait for the results… and go to the emergency room if something bad happens. Thank you, Doctor. I… I hope it's not bad. That's all. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will provide you with the prescriptions and schedule your bloodwork and scans. I expect to speak with you within 48 hours. .
