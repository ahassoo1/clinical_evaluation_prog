DOCTOR: Hi Laury, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I... want to know more about where my family come from. I hear you can do… a test with spit? To find out? I want to know more about my ancestors.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re interested in exploring your ancestry, and you've heard about genetic testing using a saliva sample. That’s definitely something we can discuss. It’s becoming increasingly popular. Just to clarify – are you experiencing any health concerns today that prompted this visit, or is this solely for genealogical purposes?
PATIENT: No, no health problems. Just… curious. I’m old, you know? I want to know before… before it’s too late. My mother, she told stories, but… old stories get lost. I want to see it, if you understand. Not just hear. Is that okay? Is this test… good?
DOCTOR: Yes, I absolutely understand. It's wonderful that you want to connect with your heritage, and wanting concrete information is perfectly reasonable. It’s a very common desire, especially as time goes on. So, these ancestry tests – they look at specific markers in your DNA to estimate your ethnic origins and potentially connect you with relatives. They can be very informative, but it’s important to understand their limitations. They’re not perfect, and the results are estimates. They’re also most accurate for tracing broader ethnic groups – pinpointing exact villages or specific ancestors is usually difficult. Before we proceed, do you have any concerns about the privacy of your genetic information?
PATIENT: Privacy? Hmm… I don't know much about that. You keep it safe, right? Like my medical… things? I trust you, Doctor. But… what happens to the spit after? Does someone else look at it? I just want to know about my family. Not for… everyone to know.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid and important question, Laury. Your privacy is absolutely my priority, and it’s good you’re asking. The company that analyzes the sample – and we use [Company Name - I’d verbally state the name of a reputable company here] – has strict privacy policies in place. They don’t share your raw genetic data without your explicit consent. They may use anonymized, aggregated data for research, but that wouldn’t include any personally identifiable information. We also have protocols here at the clinic to ensure your information remains confidential. They will provide you with a detailed consent form outlining all of this before you agree to anything. Do you want me to go through some of the common concerns with you now, or would you prefer to read the form yourself first?
PATIENT: Maybe… you tell me a little. I don’t read so good anymore. My eyes… they get tired. What kind of things should I be looking for in the paper? What do people worry about with this spit test?
DOCTOR: Of course, happy to. One of the main things people consider is the potential for unexpected family connections. The test might reveal relatives you weren’t aware of, which can be a surprise. It can also sometimes raise questions about paternity, though that isn't what you're looking for. Another thing is incidental findings. Sometimes the test can reveal a predisposition to certain health conditions, even if you haven’t asked specifically about those. [Company Name] will offer you the option to receive or not receive this kind of information. Finally, there’s the accuracy of the results. As I mentioned, it’s an estimate, and the databases they use are more comprehensive for some ethnic groups than others. Your Marshallese ancestry might be less represented in those databases, so the results may be broader. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Hmm… unexpected family… that’s okay. I don't have many living family. Health things… maybe I don't need to know. I'm old, Doctor. What about… how much does this spit test cost? And… how long does it take to get the answer? Is it a long time?
DOCTOR: Good questions. The cost of the test is around $99-$199, depending on the level of detail you choose. They often have sales, too. We can look at their website together if you'd like. As for how long it takes, it typically takes about 6-8 weeks to get the results. You'll receive an email notification when they’re ready, and you can access them online through a secure portal. They’ll also send you instructions on how to collect the sample – it's fairly straightforward. You spit into a tube, seal it, and mail it back to the lab. Do you think that sounds manageable for you?
PATIENT: Spit in a tube… yes, I can do that. 6-8 weeks… that’s okay. Not too long. And the price… $100? That’s not too bad. Okay, Doctor. I think I want to try. But… can you help me with the paper? I want to make sure I understand before I sign anything. I don’t want to be surprised.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Laury. That's exactly the right approach. I'm happy to go through the consent form with you line by line. We can take our time and make sure you feel comfortable with everything before you sign. Let's start with this first section... It explains the purpose of the test and what kind of information you'll receive. Do you want me to read it aloud, or would you prefer I just point out the key points?
PATIENT: Please read it aloud, Doctor. My eyes… they’re tired, you know? Thank you. Slow is good. Very slow.
DOCTOR: "This ancestry test uses DNA from a saliva sample to estimate your ethnic origins. The results will provide a percentage breakdown of your ancestral heritage, based on comparisons to reference populations around the world. It's important to understand that this is an estimate and may not reflect your complete ancestry. The test also identifies potential relatives who have also used this service, if any matches are found..." Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Like… a guess. But a smart guess, right? Because of the… spit? And the… references? Is that like… people they compare me to? Other spit? It’s a little strange, thinking about it. But I want to know. Keep reading, Doctor. Thank you. You are very patient.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Laury. And yes, that's a good way to think of it - a smart guess, based on comparisons to other people's DNA. The "reference populations" are groups of people with known ancestry, and they compare your DNA to theirs to estimate your origins. "The results may also provide information about potential health risks, based on the presence of certain genetic markers. You have the option to opt-in or opt-out of receiving this health information. This test is not intended to diagnose or treat any medical condition. It is for informational purposes only..." They really emphasize that it’s not a medical test. It's just a snapshot of your ancestry and potential predispositions. Do you want me to explain the opt-in/opt-out part a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, please. What does that mean? I don't want to be… surprised by bad news. I just want to know where my family came from. Not if I’m going to get sick. Is that clear? Can I say "no" to the sick things?
DOCTOR: Absolutely clear, Laury. And yes, you can definitely say “no” to the health information. When you register for the test online, there will be a section where you can choose whether or not you want to receive those results. If you check the box to opt-out, you won't see any information about potential health risks. You can simply leave that box unchecked, and they won't include that data in your report. It’s entirely your choice. Do you want me to continue reading the form, or would you like to pause here and think about it for a moment?
PATIENT: No, keep reading. I trust you, Doctor. And I want to finish the paper. Maybe it will make me feel better to read it all. It’s good to know everything before I agree, right? So… keep going. Thank you. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: "Your DNA data will be stored securely by [Company Name] and will not be shared with any third parties without your explicit consent. You have the right to access, modify, or delete your data at any time. The company may use anonymized, aggregated data for research purposes, but your personal information will remain confidential..." They have a pretty strong privacy policy, but it's always good to be aware of how your data is being used. Do you have any questions about that part?
PATIENT: Anonymized… what does that mean? Like… no name? No me? Just… spit? If it's just spit, that's okay. I don’t mind if they look at spit. As long as they don't know it's my spit. That’s good. That’s okay. Keep reading, Doctor. I’m almost finished, right?
DOCTOR: Exactly. "Anonymized" means they remove any identifying information, like your name or contact details, before using the data for research. It’s just spit, as you said – they can’t trace it back to you personally. You are almost finished, yes! Just a few more clauses about their terms and conditions. "...By submitting your sample, you agree to these terms and conditions. You also acknowledge that the results are not guaranteed to be accurate and should not be used for legal or immigration purposes..." And that’s pretty much it. It’s mostly legal stuff, as you can see. Do you have any final questions about the form, or are you ready to proceed with the registration?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. It's a little scary, thinking about my spit going away. But… I want to know. Yes, let’s do it. Let’s try the spit test. Can you help me with the computer? I’m not very good with the… machines. I’m an old man, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Laury. I’m happy to help. That’s what I’m here for. Okay, so first, we’ll need to create an account. We’ll just enter your name, date of birth, and email address. Do you want me to type it in for you, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Please type it for me, Doctor. My hands shake too much. And… be careful with the date of birth. I forget sometimes… I think it’s March 12th, 1938. But… check it. Make sure it’s right. I don't want any trouble with the machines.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's confirm: March 12th, 1938. Is that correct, Laury?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right! Good, good. You are very careful, Doctor. Thank you. What happens next? Does it ask about my family? I want to tell them I’m from the Marshall Islands. Will it ask?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does ask about your ancestry! They want to know your family’s origins to help interpret the results. Here it is. It’s a dropdown menu. We can select “Marshallese” from the list. Do you see it?
PATIENT: Hmm… Yes! There it is. “Marshallese.” I can see it. You help me click it, Doctor. My fingers… they don’t work so good. There. Click it. Good, good. What happens after that? Do I have to pay now? I have my wallet… here.
DOCTOR: Okay, great! And yes, now it's asking for payment information. It’s $99 plus tax. Do you want me to type in your credit card information, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Please, Doctor. You do it. I don't trust those machines with my money. And… be careful! Don’t let them take too much. Just $99, right? Is it safe? This internet… it scares me. It’s like… invisible people taking my things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Laury. I understand your concern. I'm very careful. Just $99, plus a small amount for tax. See?
PATIENT: Good. Good. Thank you. Okay… what now? Do I get the spit tube in the mail? How long does that take? I want to start! I’m excited now. It feels… good to know. Even if it’s just a guess.
DOCTOR: Perfect! You’ve successfully registered and paid. Now, they’ll send you a spit kit in the mail. It usually takes 7-10 business days to arrive. Here’s your shipping address. And they estimate it will arrive on August 16th. It will include detailed instructions on how to collect the sample and mail it back to the lab. You’ve done it, Laury! Now all you have to do is wait for the kit to arrive. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you so much. You are very kind and patient. I was so scared of the machines, but you helped me. I hope I find out something good. Something about my family. Thank you again, Doctor. You are a good person.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Laury. It was my pleasure to help. I hope you find out some wonderful things about your family’s history. And remember, even if it's just a guess, it's a guess based on your DNA, and that’s pretty special. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and I hope you receive your kit soon.
