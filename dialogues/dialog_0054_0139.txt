DOCTOR: Good morning, Yamir. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… fitness check. For… referee. Need paper say I’m okay. Quick, if possible? Wife… she passed last year. Not easy to get time away.
DOCTOR: I understand, Yamir. I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. Losing someone like that… it certainly makes things harder. We'll do our best to make this as quick and efficient as possible while still ensuring we cover everything needed for your referee certification. So, a fitness check for refereeing. That’s helpful. To start, can you tell me a little bit about the physical demands of refereeing?
PATIENT: Physical… hmm. Running. A lot of running. Up and down the field. Stop and start. Sometimes… pushing, if game get… rough. Not boxing, but… people bump into each other. I try to stay away from bumps. Mostly running, though. And… standing a long time. Very long time. I am not young anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, running, stop-and-start activity, potential for bumping or contact, and prolonged standing. That gives me a good general idea. And you're right to be mindful of staying in shape as we get older – very sensible. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about how often you referee, and how long a typical game lasts for you?
PATIENT: I… maybe two games a week. Sometimes one. Depends. Usually… soccer. Kids’ games, mostly. 90 minutes. But… not always playing. Lots of… stopping game. Talk to players. Whistle. Stop, start, stop, start. And… before and after game. Warm up, cool down. Maybe… hour each side. So, total… maybe two, two and half hours. Each game.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly two to two-and-a-half hours per game, including warm-up and cool-down, mainly soccer with kids. That’s good information. Now, have you noticed any specific issues or concerns while refereeing?
PATIENT: Hmm… knees. Sometimes. Old injury. Not bad, but… ache after running. And… feet. Standing a lot. Feet get tired. Sometimes… little bit of pain in lower back. Not… not serious. Just… old. Like everything else. I stretch. Helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees with a previous injury causing some post-exercise ache, foot fatigue, and some mild lower back discomfort. Stretching provides some relief, that’s good. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Doctor say I’m… okay. Regular check-ups. Blood pressure sometimes… a little high, but pills fix it. Nothing… serious. No diabetes. No… heart stuff. Just… getting old. Like I said. I eat… okay. Not too much junk food. Try to walk every day.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. You have a history of slightly elevated blood pressure that is currently controlled with medication, otherwise generally healthy. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: No. Just… the blood pressure ones. Small white pills. Take one every morning. No… vitamins. No… nothing else. I used to take something for… allergies. But… Doctor said I didn't need it anymore. Years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the one medication for blood pressure. And you previously took something for allergies but are no longer using it. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Never had… reaction. I eat… everything. Sometimes spicy food make me sweat, but… that’s not allergy. I can eat peanuts. Shellfish. Everything. I used to be… worried about bee stings. But… never got stung.
DOCTOR: Excellent, no known allergies. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was young… tonsils. Took them out. A long time ago. And… broken arm. Playing soccer. Also… when I was young. Maybe ten years old? Nothing… recent. No hospital stays. Not for… serious things. Just… quick fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tonsillectomy and a broken arm, both occurring when you were a child. Do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Father… high blood pressure. Like me. He… not take pills. Bad. Died young. Mother… okay. Never sick. Sister… also okay. No… cancer. No… diabetes. Mostly… long life. Lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of hypertension on your father’s side. And your mother and sister have no significant medical history. Lastly, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never smoke. Alcohol… sometimes. One glass of wine with dinner. Maybe twice a week. Not much. No… drugs. Never. Bad for… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional alcohol consumption , and no recreational drug use. Alright, Yamir, thank you for providing that information. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to assess your fitness for refereeing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Quick, please? I have… game Saturday.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll keep it concise. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look at your knees, feet and back, just to see if we can pinpoint where that discomfort is coming from. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. One more… deep breath in… and out. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you bend them for me, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: A little… stiff. But okay. Not… pain. Just… feel old. Like everything else.
DOCTOR: I feel some mild crepitus – that's a little grinding sensation – which is common with aging, and I don't detect any significant swelling or tenderness. Range of motion is slightly limited, but not dramatically so. Now, could you walk around for me a few steps, and show me how you normally walk?
PATIENT: Like this. A little… slow. But… normal. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see a slight antalgic gait – that means you're subtly favoring your left side when you walk, likely to compensate for the knee discomfort. Now, let’s take a look at your feet. Could you point your toes and flex your ankles for me?
PATIENT: Like this. A little tight. Standing a lot… not good for feet. But okay. No… big pain.
DOCTOR: I’m not detecting any significant swelling or tenderness in your arches or ankles. I do feel some mild tightness in your plantar fascia – that’s the band of tissue along the bottom of your foot – which could contribute to the fatigue you’ve been experiencing. Finally, let's check your back. Could you bend forward and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Not… can touch toes. Not anymore. A little stiff. Lower back… a little ache.
DOCTOR: Okay. Limited range of motion, and I feel some mild tenderness in your lower back muscles. No significant muscle spasms. Alright, Yamir. Based on the physical exam, you have some expected age-related changes – mild crepitus in your knees, tightness in your plantar fascia, and mild tenderness in your lower back muscles. There's no evidence of any acute injury or serious underlying condition.
PATIENT: Okay. So… can I referee? Saturday game… important.
DOCTOR: Based on what I’ve seen, I don't see any medical reason why you shouldn’t referee. However, I recommend a few things to help prevent further discomfort. First, warm up thoroughly before the game, paying particular attention to stretching your hamstrings, calves, and lower back. Second, be sure to wear supportive shoes and consider using orthotics if you have them. Third, if you start to experience pain during the game, stop and rest. Don't push through it. Would you like me to provide you with a written note stating that you’ve been evaluated and are cleared for refereeing, with those recommendations included?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. That would be… good. Thank you, Doctor. Quick… makes everything easier.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Yamir. This summarizes the evaluation and provides those recommendations. I’ve also included my contact information in case you have any concerns. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You have… been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Yamir. I’m glad I could help. Please, take care of yourself, and enjoy the game! Feel free to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day.
