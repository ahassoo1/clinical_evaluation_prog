DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret. My name is Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. I… I have been having some trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I try to take a deep breath. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble breathing and a whistling sound – that’s definitely something we want to look into. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began… maybe two weeks ago? It was not so bad at first. Just when I walked up the stairs. But now… it happens even when I am sitting. It is getting worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been progressive over the last two weeks, starting with exertion and now happening even at rest. And you describe it as a whistling sound. Is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. When I am resting, it is not always there. But if I move… or get excited… then it is there. Like a small tea kettle, almost. Do you understand? Is that… clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very clear, Margret – a whistling sound, like a tea kettle, triggered by activity or excitement. That helps a lot. Now, besides the whistling, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes, my chest feels… tight. Not pain, exactly. More like… squeezed. And I have been coughing a little. Not a bad cough, but… a dry cough. Mostly at night, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A tight chest and a dry cough, especially at night, along with the whistling and shortness of breath. Okay. Have you had a fever, chills, or any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. Not that I have noticed. And no swelling. My feet… they feel normal. I check them sometimes, because my sister… she had problems with her legs. But mine are okay. I am very careful.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or COPD, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I have been to the doctor for… aches and pains, you know, old age things. But never for my lungs. My mother… she had a weak heart, but I… my lungs have always been strong. I used to walk a lot. Very strong legs, I had.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of lung problems yourself, and your mother had heart issues. Have you ever had pneumonia or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… maybe once? A very bad cold, many years ago. The doctor gave me some medicine, and I rested. I don’t remember the name of it. It was a long time ago, Doctor. And I was not very sick, just a bad cough for a few weeks. Nothing like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bout of bronchitis many years ago, but nothing significant. Now, have you ever smoked cigarettes or been exposed to a lot of secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. Never liked it. My husband… he used to smoke a little, but not in the house. He smoked outside. I always made sure of that. I did not want the smell. And I always kept the windows open. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about any medications you’re currently taking, and any allergies you might have. Do you have a list of your medications with you today?
PATIENT: I do, Doctor. Just a small one. I take a pill for my blood pressure, and one for my arthritis. That is all. And… I am not allergic to anything that I know of. No reactions to foods or… anything. I am usually very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me take a look at that. Lisinopril for blood pressure and Ibuprofen for arthritis. Good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen levels, and maybe take a look at your throat. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly fine. Please, do what you need to do. I trust you. I want to know what is happening, so I can feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let's start by listening to your lungs. I'm going to ask you to take some deep breaths in and out while I listen. Okay. I'm hearing some wheezing in your lungs, especially when you exhale. That explains the whistling sound you've been describing. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. Now let's check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen level is 92%, which is a little bit low, but not critically so. I'll also take a look at your throat. Your throat looks clear. No signs of infection there. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps so I can see if your breathing changes with exertion. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. It feels… a little dizzy, but I am alright. It is harder to breathe when I walk. My chest feels… tight. Is that what you wanted to see?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I wanted to see. I noticed your breathing became more labored and you started to use more effort to breathe when you walked. And you mentioned the chest tightness. Okay, Margret. Based on what you've told me and the examination findings—the wheezing, lower oxygen saturation, and increased difficulty breathing with exertion—it sounds like you are likely experiencing an exacerbation of asthma. Even though you haven’t been diagnosed with asthma before, it's possible to develop it later in life, or it could be a new-onset condition. However, to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test, which measures how well your lungs are working. Would you be able to go to the imaging center today?
PATIENT: An X-ray… and a test? Is it… serious, Doctor? I have never had an X-ray before. And I do not understand… a ‘pulmonary’ test? Is it painful? I… I want to know what is happening, but I am a little scared now. What if it is something… bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Margret, and it's perfectly normal to feel scared when you don't know what's going on. The X-ray is a quick and painless imaging test that helps us see if there are any problems in your lungs, like pneumonia or fluid buildup. It doesn’t involve any radiation that would be harmful. The pulmonary function test is a breathing test, where you’ll simply blow into a tube. It measures how much air you can breathe in and out, and how quickly you can do it. It's also painless, but it does require some effort. It will give us a clear picture of how well your lungs are working. Right now, it’s important to remember we’re just gathering information to get a clearer diagnosis. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something bad happening, but we need to rule out other possibilities and confirm what's going on. For now, while we await the results, I want to start you on a bronchodilator inhaler. This will help to open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. I will write you a prescription for Albuterol. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. Albuterol… an inhaler. Is that… a lot of medicine? Will it make me feel… strange? I have heard stories… about side effects. And how often… would I need to use it? I am a little nervous. What if it does not work? I just want to breathe normally again.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, Margret. Albuterol is a very common and generally safe medication. It's a rescue inhaler, meaning it's used as needed when you're feeling short of breath, and it doesn't usually cause significant side effects. Some people experience a slight tremor or racing heart, but those effects are temporary and usually mild. It works by quickly relaxing the muscles around your airways, making it easier for air to get in and out. We’ll start with as-needed use, so only when you’re experiencing symptoms of shortness of breath or wheezing. I’ll write the prescription with instructions on how to use it properly. The pharmacist can also demonstrate the correct technique for you. We’re also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results of your X-ray and pulmonary function test. This will help us create a long-term treatment plan to manage your breathing and prevent future exacerbations. In the meantime, if your shortness of breath worsens or you experience chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is that all clear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I think so. As-needed… only when I am short of breath. The pharmacist will show me how to use it. And a follow-up appointment next week. And the emergency room… if it gets worse. I… I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I was very scared. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Margret. It’s my job to help you understand what’s going on and to make sure you feel comfortable and safe. I'm glad I could ease some of your worries. Here’s the prescription for the Albuterol. The nurse will be in shortly to give you discharge instructions and schedule that follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, and try to rest.
