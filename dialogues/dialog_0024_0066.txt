DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a… a popping, or clicking sensation in my back. It’s quite bothersome, really. Not painful, necessarily, but… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Disconcerting, you say. Hmm. And where, precisely, is this… popping occurring, Mr. Mastrantonio?
PATIENT: It’s primarily in my lower back, Doctor. Right around the base of my spine, I believe. Sometimes I feel it a little higher up, but mostly it’s focused there. It happens when I twist, or bend, or even just stand for a long period. It doesn't happen every time, mind you, but frequently enough that it’s started to worry me.
DOCTOR: Right. And how would you rate your activity level, generally?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, my occupation keeps me quite active. I'm an electrical and electronics installer and repairer, specifically on transportation equipment – trains, mostly. So, I’m constantly bending, reaching, lifting… it's a physically demanding job, to be frank. I wouldn’t say I’m a marathon runner, but I’m certainly not sedentary. I'm on my feet most of the day. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It conveys a certain… lack of foresight, Mr. Mastrantonio. Now, have you experienced any actual pain associated with this popping?
PATIENT: Ah, well, no, Doctor. Not pain, exactly. It’s more of a… a mild discomfort, sometimes. A sort of ache afterward, if I’ve been twisting a lot. But truly, no sharp pain. It's more the sensation itself that’s troubling me. It feels… unstable, if that makes sense. Like something is slightly out of place.
DOCTOR: Unstable. Right. And have you noticed any weakness in your legs, or numbness, or tingling?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No weakness, numbness, or tingling at all. Everything feels… normal in that regard. My legs feel strong, and I have full range of motion, as far as I can tell. It's truly just this popping and the occasional mild ache afterward. It's not radiating down my legs or anything like that, if that’s what you were going to ask. I've been trying to pay close attention.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be wonderful. Please, let me know if there’s anything specific I should be doing or avoiding during the examination. I want to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: Please lie face down on the table. I will need you to relax your muscles as much as possible. And I will be palpating your spine, so inform me immediately if anything causes discomfort. Do try to remain still.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I will do my best to remain still, and I’ll let you know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. Just tell me what you’d like me to do.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness here… and here. No significant muscle spasm, but… there is a slight asymmetry in the spinous processes at L4-L5. And I detect a slight limitation in the range of motion with lateral bending. Can you point to the exact location of the clicking sensation?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. It feels like it originates from this area, although it sometimes radiates a little bit to the left. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, but this is where I feel it most prominently. And it’s definitely more noticeable when I twist my torso.
DOCTOR: Alright, bend forward and touch your toes. Now, bend backward. And now, side to side. Hmm. There is a palpable click with lateral flexion at L4-L5, consistent with your report. No evidence of radiculopathy. The reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact.
PATIENT: So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? Is there something… wrong? You mentioned L4-L5... is that a problem area? I’m not very familiar with medical terms, so please excuse my ignorance. I just want to understand what’s going on and what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Mastrantonio, it appears you have a mild facet joint dysfunction at L4-L5. Essentially, the small joints in your spine are not moving optimally, leading to the clicking sensation and discomfort. It’s not an uncommon condition, particularly in individuals with physically demanding occupations. It is not a serious condition at this juncture, but left unaddressed, it can lead to chronic pain and instability. We can attempt conservative management, starting with physical therapy and core strengthening exercises. I will also prescribe a short course of a muscle relaxant to alleviate any associated spasms. However, I must stress the importance of proper body mechanics at work. A lack of foresight in this area will only exacerbate the problem.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. Facet joint dysfunction… and the importance of body mechanics. I suppose I do tend to push myself, trying to get the job done efficiently. Physical therapy and core strengthening exercises sound reasonable. And a muscle relaxant to help with any spasms would be very welcome. Could you perhaps recommend a physical therapist in the area? And do you have any specific advice regarding proper body mechanics at work? I want to be proactive and avoid this becoming a chronic issue. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Here is a list of recommended physical therapists. I suggest you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. As for body mechanics… lift with your legs, not your back. Maintain a neutral spine. Avoid twisting while lifting. And take frequent breaks to stretch. It’s common sense, really. I'm prescribing cyclobenzaprine 10mg, take one tablet at bedtime as needed for muscle spasms, not to exceed two tablets in 24 hours. I will also prescribe a short course of Naproxen 500mg twice a day for inflammation. I expect to see you back in four weeks to reassess. If your symptoms worsen before then, contact the office immediately. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. That was very thorough, and the list of physical therapists is greatly appreciated. I understand the instructions regarding the medications, and I’ll be sure to follow them carefully. Thank you for your time and your expertise. I’ll schedule an appointment with a physical therapist right away and focus on improving my body mechanics at work. I appreciate you being so direct, even if it was a little… stern. It’s good to know what I need to work on.
DOCTOR: Very well. See to it that you do. Next patient. .
