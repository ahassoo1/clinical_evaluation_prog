DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Verrall, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Smith Verrall. It's... good to meet you, Doctor... Overgaard, yes? I think my paperwork says that. I'm here about... well, trying to start a family. My daughter, she thinks I should come get checked out first. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Trying to start a family at your age… that’s… unusual. Though, people are doing all sorts these days. Your daughter is… prudent, I suppose. Let’s get some details, shall we?
PATIENT: Unusual, yes. She keeps saying things about... timing. And my age, of course. I don't really understand all of it, to be honest. I just want to make sure everything is okay, if that makes sense. I'm not the youngest anymore, and I don't want to... cause any problems. What kind of details do you need? I get a bit forgetful these days, so maybe you should ask one thing at a time?
DOCTOR: One thing at a time, very well. Let’s start with the most obvious. Have you and your partner been actively trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Partner? Oh. No. No partner. That’s... that’s why my daughter wanted me to come. She said it’s... different when there isn’t a partner. I’m… using a donor. Is that what you mean? I don’t know much about it, really. She arranged everything. It all happened quite fast.
DOCTOR: A donor… Right. Well, that complicates things, naturally. We'll need to discuss the risks associated with donor insemination, and ensure everything is being done… responsibly. First, tell me, how long have you been attempting this, and what method is being used?
PATIENT: Attempting? Oh… it’s only been… a couple of months, maybe? Three, four? It’s hard to keep track. My daughter handles all the… the technical parts. She said something about… at-home insemination? With a… a kit she ordered online. I don’t really ask too many questions. I trust her. Is that… okay? I hope it’s okay. It just seemed easier than going to a… a clinic. But she worries a lot, so maybe she’s right to worry.
DOCTOR: At-home insemination… with a kit ordered online. Mr. Verrall, with all due respect, that is… extraordinarily ill-advised. There are significant health risks associated with unregulated procedures like that, not to mention the legal ramifications. We need to discuss proper screening for both you and the donor. Do you know if the donor has been screened for sexually transmitted infections, genetic conditions, or any other potential health concerns?
PATIENT: Screened? Oh… I don’t think so. She just… found someone online. She said he was… healthy. He was a student, I think? She did a lot of… checking his social media, I remember that. But… screening? No. I don’t think she mentioned anything about that. Oh dear. Is that bad? She seemed so confident. She said it was all very modern now, people doing things this way. I didn’t want to upset her. She’s been very good to me, looking after me since my wife passed. I just wanted to… make her happy. What sort of risks are we talking about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, "modern" does not equate to "safe." You have put yourself at risk for a multitude of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and others that can have devastating consequences. There's also the risk of genetic conditions being passed on to any potential child, and legal complications regarding parentage. Honestly, this is… reckless. We absolutely must determine the donor's medical history, and your own, before proceeding any further. Have you had a recent physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that sounds terrible. I… I had a check-up, I think, maybe a year ago? With my old doctor, before he retired. He said my blood pressure was a little high, and told me to watch my salt intake. But that was all. I haven't really seen a doctor since then. I don't like going to doctors, if I'm honest. It always reminds me of… well, never mind. So, you're saying the man I… the donor, might have something? And I could get it too? My daughter is going to be so upset. She thought everything was fine. What do we do now?
DOCTOR: We need to determine the extent of the risk immediately. I'm ordering a comprehensive panel of STI tests for you, and a full blood workup. I also strongly recommend genetic counseling and testing. And, frankly, a consultation with a reproductive endocrinologist is warranted. This is beyond the scope of general family medicine, and attempting further insemination without proper screening is simply irresponsible. I'm also going to require a detailed medical history from your daughter – and I will need her consent to access that information. This is not a matter of upsetting her, Mr. Verrall; it's a matter of protecting your health – and the potential health of any child involved. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… like a lot. Tests, and counseling, and another doctor… My daughter will be furious. She’ll say I’m making a fuss. But… if it’s about health… yes, I understand. I suppose you’re right. It’s just… I don’t want to cause trouble. Can I… can I at least tell her I’m going to talk to you first? Before you… contact her? And what about the cost? I don’t have… insurance. It’s all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. What happens if… if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can inform her you are seeking further evaluation. However, be aware that I have a professional obligation to ensure your safety, and I will be contacting her directly to discuss the risks involved and the necessity of proper screening. As for the cost… Unfortunately, these tests are not inexpensive. I will have my office staff provide you with a list of potential resources for financial assistance, but I cannot guarantee coverage. And if something is wrong… we will address it accordingly. Treatment options will depend on the specific condition, and may include medication, counseling, or further medical intervention. But delaying this evaluation only increases the risk. Now, let’s get started with these lab orders. The sooner we have results, the sooner we can determine a course of action. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed with bloodwork?
