DOCTOR: Hi Arlan, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Hernandez, you say? Hmm. It’s this… this waterworks business. Been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, that’s for sure. Old age, I suppose. Though I don’t feel that old. Just… frequent. That’s the word, frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. I understand. And how long has this been going on, Arlan?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… time slips away, doesn’t it? Let me think… a few months, maybe? Hard to say exactly. It didn’t start suddenly, you see. Just… gradually got worse. I don’t keep track of these things. My wife usually notices first, but she’s been… preoccupied.
DOCTOR: I see. A few months, gradually worsening. And is it just frequency, or are you having any trouble starting to go, or a weak stream, or any burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning? No, no burning. Thank goodness for that. Starting… well, it’s not difficult, exactly. It just… feels like I don’t quite empty everything. Like there’s always a little bit left. And, well, I have to go back pretty soon after I just went. It's more annoying than painful, really. Though I suppose anything annoying enough can become painful, eh?
DOCTOR: Right, so not difficult to start, just a feeling of incomplete emptying and needing to return relatively soon after. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. I haven’t been looking at my… output, if you don't mind me putting it that way. My wife does the laundry, so she'd be the one to notice anything… different. It looks normal to me. Pale yellow, I suppose. What color should it be? Is this a test? I don't do well with tests.
DOCTOR: No, no test, Arlan, just gathering information. Pale yellow is generally normal. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, even a tiny bit?
PATIENT: Blood? Heavens, no! I would certainly notice that. My wife would have a fit. No, Doctor, no blood. I'm quite certain. Though, you know, sometimes things are… subtle. But I haven't seen anything that would worry me. I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No blood. Now, let’s talk about other things. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain alongside this frequent urination?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Not recently. This summer’s been warm enough, thank you very much. And pain… well, my back aches sometimes. Old age, again. But not… lower abdominal pain. No. Nothing like that. Just the usual creaks and groans.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you drinking more fluids than usual, Arlan?
PATIENT: Now that’s a good question. I don’t know that I am, but… my wife’s been making a lot of iced tea lately. Good tea, mind you. Sweet, just how I like it. I’ve been having a glass or two with my meals. Maybe that’s it? A man can get thirsty in this heat, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased iced tea intake. That could certainly contribute. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Doctor, are you asking about… well, you know. That’s a bit personal, isn’t it? I mean, things are… regular enough. Nothing exciting to report. A man doesn’t discuss these things with strangers. Though, I suppose you're a doctor, so… it’s different. But no, everything’s as it should be. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Arlan, and I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. It’s just important to get a complete picture. Okay, let’s move on. Do you have any history of diabetes, or has anyone in your family been diagnosed with it?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. My mother, bless her soul, had something… a sugar problem, maybe? She was always craving sweets. Had to watch what she ate. But me? Never been diagnosed. I enjoy a good pastry now and then, but nothing excessive. I wouldn’t say I’m a diabetic. Though… I haven’t been to the doctor in quite a while.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, Arlan?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Just a little something for my blood pressure. A small white pill. My wife keeps track of it, mostly. She fills the little pill organizer every week. I think it's… Lisinopril? Or something like that. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Over the counter, mind you. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… well, I get a bit of a sniffle when the pollen’s bad in the spring. But that's just seasonal, you know? Nothing serious. And no, I don't think I'm allergic to any medications. Never had a reaction. I’m a pretty sturdy fellow, all things considered. Though my wife always double-checks everything. She’s very careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological check. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam, you say? Well… I suppose so. I haven’t had one of those in… goodness, decades. But if you think it's necessary, Doctor, go right ahead. Just be gentle, alright? Old bones creak easily. And try not to take too long. I have a few things I need to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Arlan. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. It’s a little tender in the lower abdomen, but no significant masses or guarding. Your reflexes are normal, and your gait appears stable. It seems your prostate is slightly enlarged, which can contribute to frequent urination and incomplete emptying. However, further testing is needed to confirm this.
PATIENT: Prostate, you say? Enlarged? Now there's a word I haven't heard in a while… My wife's father had trouble with that, I remember. Lots of trips to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Is that what this is? Is it… serious? I don't want any fancy operations. I'm too old for that kind of thing. What kind of testing are we talking about?
DOCTOR: It's common for the prostate to enlarge with age, Arlan, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It can cause the symptoms you’re experiencing, like frequent urination and a weak stream. Your wife's father’s experience is a good example. As for testing, I’d like to do a urinalysis to check for infection and a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test. This helps us assess the size of your prostate and rule out other potential causes. We can also perform a simple urine flow test to measure how quickly your bladder empties. It’s not an operation, just some basic tests to get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests… Alright, alright. As long as it’s not an operation, I suppose I can handle a few tests. Urinalysis… PSA… Urine flow… Sounds… complicated. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, go ahead. Just… please explain everything clearly. I don’t like surprises. And try not to poke around too much. Old bones, remember?
DOCTOR: Of course, Arlan. I’ll explain everything thoroughly, and we’ll take it slow. The urinalysis is just a simple urine sample – we’ll provide a cup, and you’ll just provide a sample when you’re able. The PSA test is a blood draw, just like getting your cholesterol checked. We'll take a small vial of blood. The urine flow test involves you simply urinating into a special container while we measure the speed and volume. It’s all very straightforward. It will give us a better understanding of what's going on, and we can discuss the best course of action from there. I’ll write the orders for these tests now, and then the nurse will come in and draw your blood and give you instructions on how to collect a urine sample. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Alright… sounds… manageable. A little inconvenient, perhaps, but manageable. So, blood draw and a… container? I suppose I can do that. As long as someone explains it all clearly. And, well, I hope it doesn't take too long. I have a garden that needs tending, you know. Tomatoes don’t weed themselves. Go ahead, Doctor. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Arlan. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. In the meantime, I'll print out some information about the tests and what to expect. We can also discuss lifestyle modifications that might help with your symptoms, such as limiting caffeine and alcohol, and ensuring you’re adequately hydrated. It might also be helpful to keep a bladder diary, noting how often you urinate and the amount of fluid you drink. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… modifications? A bladder diary? Heavens, I have enough to keep track of as it is. Limiting caffeine… I enjoy my afternoon tea. And alcohol… well, a small glass of sherry now and then never hurt anyone. A diary… Sounds like a lot of fuss, if you ask me. But, alright, alright. I'll try to remember these things. Maybe. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… get it over with. I’m ready for this nurse, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arlan. I understand. The nurse should be with you shortly. She’ll explain everything clearly and answer any questions you might have. I’ll review the results with you as soon as they’re available, and we can discuss the best course of action based on those findings. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’ll figure this out together. .
