DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. So, you're here today… tell me what brought you in. Don't leave anything out, even if you think it's not important. I need the full picture, you understand?
PATIENT: Well, it's… down there. You know. My… thing. It's been… leaking. A little bit. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. It’s kinda gross, if you ask me. I don’t know why it's happening. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: "Leaking," you say. Alright. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Maybe… a month? Two? I don’t really keep track of that stuff. Time just… goes. It started after… well, after I met that fella at the market. Not that he did anything! Just… around then, I noticed it.
DOCTOR: Right. A month or two. And is it constant, this leaking?
PATIENT: No, no, not all the time! Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not. Mostly when… well, when I get a little warm down there. Or after… you know… using the bathroom. It's not like a flood, mind you. Just… a dampness. It’s really annoying. And it smells funny.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said it smells… different?
PATIENT: Yeah, different! Not like… me. Like… fish, kinda. Or maybe old socks. I don’t know. I just know it’s not right. I keep myself clean, you know. Always have. It’s just… this thing is acting up. Makes a body feel ashamed, it does.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Genard, it sounds like we need to take a look. It could be a number of things, and frankly, trying to guess without an examination wouldn't be helpful. I’m going to need to do a quick pelvic exam. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A… a what now? A pelvic…exam? You want me to… let you look down there? Oh, goodness no. Absolutely not! I don't even know you, lady. And what good will poking around do anyway? It's just going to… bother it more. I’d rather just get some cream or something. You got any cream for… things that smell funny?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, with all due respect, a cream isn't going to solve this. You're describing symptoms that require a proper evaluation. It could be something simple, but it could also be something more serious. I understand your discomfort, but refusing an exam prevents me from doing my job. It’s a necessary step to determine what’s going on, and to ensure you receive the appropriate care. We have female chaperones available if that would make you more comfortable. But honestly, delaying this is simply not a good idea. We need to rule out infection, and other potential problems.
PATIENT: Infection? Oh, goodness. You think I have a disease? That’s what you’re saying? I’ve never… I’ve lived a good life! I don’t go around with… with those kinds of people. It’s probably just… a little irritation. From the heat, maybe? I told you, I keep myself clean. I don’t need poking and prodding! Honestly, I think I’ll just go home and put some baby powder on it.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, please. I did not say you have a disease. I said we need to rule out potential problems, and infection is one of them. Continuing to ignore this, or self-treating with baby powder, could lead to complications. Look, I understand you're uncomfortable, but this isn’t about judging your lifestyle. It’s about your health. I’m going to ask you one more time. Will you allow me to perform a quick examination?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not! You keep talking about poking around and… and complications. It sounds awful! I’m a grown woman, I can decide what’s best for my body. I don't need a young doctor telling me what I need. I’m leaving now. And honestly, I think you need to be more polite to your patients.
