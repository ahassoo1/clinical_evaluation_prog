DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. So, you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: My heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like… flippy-floppy. Not all the time, but enough I worry. It started maybe a month ago? I think so. My wife, she says I look tired too.
DOCTOR: "Flippy-floppy," huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. Is that… bad way to say it? I don’t know the words, you know? It's not painful, just… fast. Like a little bird in my chest, going very quick. And sometimes I feel… weak. Like I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s not the most medical description, but I understand. And it’s good you’re coming in to get it checked. "Fast" and "weakness" are definitely things we need to explore. A month ago… anything specific happen around the time it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Work was normal. We had some hot weather, maybe? I drink lots of water, always. My wife, she makes me. She worries a lot too, you know? Nothing… big happened. Just… normal life. I work with the machines, the big metal things that make… stuff. Chemicals. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Chemicals…yes, that is important. What kind of chemicals are we talking about?
PATIENT: Mostly… cleaning stuff for the machines. And some for… making the things. I don’t know the names. Long names. My boss tells me what to do, I just push the buttons and make sure the pipes don't break. He says it’s safe, but… you know? I don't smell anything bad, if that helps.
DOCTOR: “Safe” is a relative term. Alright. So, no major life changes, normal work, chemicals involved… and this feeling, this “flippy-floppy” sensation, does it happen when you’re at work, or does it happen at home too?
PATIENT: It happens both places. But maybe… more at work? When I’m moving fast, checking the machines. If I try to lift something heavy sometimes too. At home, it's… less. When I’m sitting, watching TV with my wife, it’s okay. Mostly. It happened once when I was just walking to the store, but that was hot day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so exertion seems to be a trigger. And heat as well. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… other things that feel bad? Sometimes I get… short of breath. Not always, but when the heart is going fast, then I have to stop and… breathe deep. And my chest feels… tight. Not painful, just… squeezed. It goes away when I sit down. And… I sweat a lot, even when it's not hot. More than usual. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Short of breath, chest tightness, increased sweating… yes, all important. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or any heart problems before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I go to the doctor for check-ups, but he just says I’m okay. Always says I'm a healthy man. I eat good food, my wife makes sure of that. I don’t smoke, I don’t drink much. Just… this heart thing. And the sweating. And I haven't taken insurance. Is that a problem? It's expensive.
DOCTOR: The lack of insurance complicates things, but we’ll figure it out. Right now, I want to listen to your heart and lungs. And I’m going to check your blood pressure. Then, I think we need to run some tests. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to stop, you know? The flippy-floppy feeling. It scares my wife. And me a little too. Go ahead, check it. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please take off your coat and roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Here. Is this okay? It’s not very big arm. I don't lift much weight. Mostly just push the buttons.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright. Size isn’t everything. Now, just relax your arm. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 148/92. And your pulse is 96, slightly fast. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Is everything okay? It feels funny when you listen. Like… something is poking. Not painful, just… strange. I’m trying to relax, I promise. My wife says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: I'm hearing a slight murmur. It's not necessarily cause for alarm, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. Okay, Mr. Puder. I want to order an EKG, which is a simple test to check your heart’s electrical activity. I also want to do some blood work to check your electrolyte levels and rule out any other potential issues. And, given your symptoms and the murmur, I think it would be best to get an echocardiogram—an ultrasound of your heart—to get a better look at its structure and function. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any trouble with medicines before. Contrast dye? What’s that for? Is that for the… echo thing? I don't like needles, but I will do whatever you need. Just want this to stop. My wife worries a lot. She’s a good woman. She makes the best tea.
DOCTOR: The contrast dye is sometimes used with the echocardiogram to get a clearer picture of your heart. It’s injected through an IV, so yes, it involves a needle. We don't always need it, we'll see if the initial images are sufficient. Alright. I'm going to write you orders for the EKG and blood work. There's a lab just down the hall; they'll take care of you there. The echocardiogram will need to be scheduled at the imaging center; my staff will help you with that. Given your history, symptoms, and the elevated blood pressure, I also want you to start a low-sodium diet immediately. I will give you a handout with some guidelines. And I strongly recommend you start taking a baby aspirin daily, unless you have any bleeding problems. It can help prevent blood clots. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Low sodium… that means no salt? My wife makes good food, but she uses a lot of salt. And aspirin? That's for pain, right? I don't have much pain. This is… a lot. Will I feel better soon? Is it something serious? My wife is going to worry so much. What does “serious” mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take this one step at a time. Low sodium doesn’t mean no salt, just less. We want to avoid adding extra salt to your food. Your wife can still make good food, just maybe use more herbs and spices instead. Aspirin is also a blood thinner, which helps prevent clots. It's a preventative measure. As for whether it’s “serious”… it’s too early to say definitively. The symptoms you’re experiencing – the heart palpitations, shortness of breath, elevated blood pressure, and the murmur – could be a sign of several different things. We need the test results to get a clearer picture. It could be something relatively minor, or it could be something that needs more aggressive treatment. That's why we're doing these tests. It’s important not to panic. We're taking this seriously, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it. And yes, I understand your wife will be worried, but we'll keep her informed every step of the way. We’ll call her with the results, and we’ll discuss the best course of action. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay. No panic. My wife... she will be happy I came to the doctor. She worries about everything. What does “course of action” mean? Like… medicine? Or… surgery? That sounds scary. And what about work? I can’t just… stop working. We need the money. Will this affect my job? I push the buttons, I make the stuff. They need me. And... how long will this take? The tests, the waiting... my wife...
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. Let’s address your concerns. “Course of action” simply means the plan we make after we get the test results. It could be as simple as medication and lifestyle changes, or it could involve further testing or, in rare cases, a procedure. But we are nowhere near that point yet. We don’t know enough to discuss surgery or anything drastic. As for work, it’s too early to say whether this will affect your job. We'll need to see what the tests reveal. If you do need to take time off, we can provide a doctor’s note explaining your condition. The EKG and blood work should be relatively quick, just a few minutes. The echocardiogram will take a bit longer, maybe 30-45 minutes. The results will take a few days to come back. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We’ll be able to address the work situation more fully then. I understand your wife will be worried, and I’ll do everything I can to keep her informed. And I know you're concerned about your job. We’ll take everything one step at a time. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay. One step at a time. Is the echo thing… painful? No needles? Just… machine? And the baby aspirin… can that make me bleed? I don't bleed easily. I cut myself shaving sometimes, but it stops quick. My wife will worry about that too. She says I bruise easy. Is that bad? And… is it my heart? Is something wrong with my heart? Just tell me straight. My wife… she will want to know. Can I tell her what you said? About not knowing yet? She’s a good woman. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. Let’s address your concerns, straight as I can. The echocardiogram is not painful. It’s just a machine that uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart. There are no needles involved. The baby aspirin can increase your risk of bleeding slightly, but for most people, the benefits outweigh the risks. If you bruise easily, that’s something we’ll keep an eye on. Just let me know if you notice any unusual bleeding. As for whether something is “wrong” with your heart… it's too early to say definitively. The murmur I heard could be a sign of a problem, but it could also be harmless. That’s why we’re doing these tests. We need more information before we can make a diagnosis. And yes, you can absolutely tell your wife what I said. She deserves to know, and it’s important that you’re both on the same page. Tell her that we're taking this seriously, that we’re doing tests to get more information, and that we don’t have a diagnosis yet. Tell her that we'll call with the results as soon as they're available. And tell her not to worry too much. We're going to take care of this, one step at a time. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s everything. Thank you, doctor. You’re very… kind. My wife will be happy I came. I will go do the tests now. And I will tell my wife. She worries a lot. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. You take care now. And don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Take care, and please give your wife my best.
