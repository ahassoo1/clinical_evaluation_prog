DOCTOR: Hi Thyra, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you too. I'm just here to get some forms filled out, really. Medicare sent me over and said I needed a doctor to sign off on a few things. Nothing major, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds good. Medicare forms… right, right. Let me just pull up your file here… Fabing, Thyra… yes. Okay. Just to be sure, and to get a good picture of things, even if it's just for forms, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Sure. Um, overall… I think I’m pretty good. I work out on the reservation sometimes, mostly just walking and helping with things around the place. I don’t really have any big health problems that I know of. I get a little tired sometimes, but I think that’s just from work, you know? And getting older. I don’t go to the doctor much unless I need to, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right, that makes perfect sense. Walking is great! Very good for you. And you said a little tired sometimes… is that a new thing, or has that been going on for a while?
PATIENT: It’s probably been going on for a little bit, honestly. Maybe the last year or so? It comes and goes. Some days I feel fine, and other days I just feel… worn out. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, but it’s definitely noticeable. I just figured it was part of getting older, like I said. Or maybe the weather? It’s been hot lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little over a year… comes and goes… and you think it might be related to the weather. Just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Maybe I’ve been a little more thirsty than usual? But with the heat, that seems normal, doesn't it? I haven’t been sick or anything, no fever, no cough, no aches. Just… tired. And maybe a little extra thirsty. I really haven't been paying super close attention, to be honest. I don’t usually worry about things unless they really bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, thirst alongside the tiredness… and no other significant symptoms. That's good to know. Just to cover all bases, have you had any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… I think I might have lost a few pounds. Not a lot, but enough that my jeans feel a little looser. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, so I couldn’t give you an exact number. But yeah, probably lost a couple of pounds in the last few months. I haven't been eating a lot different, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss along with the tiredness and thirst… Just to be thorough, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and maybe a quick look at your throat. It will only take a few minutes. And then we can talk about the Medicare forms. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. I don't mind. A quick check-up is probably a good idea anyway. It's been a while since anyone really looked at me. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could just have a seat up here, that would be wonderful. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Okay, blood pressure is 118 over 72. That’s within a normal range. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear… no wheezing or crackles. Throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Pulse is 78 and regular. Everything sounds and looks pretty good so far. I’m going to take your temperature now.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I always get a little nervous when someone listens to my chest, but everything sounds clear is good to hear.
DOCTOR: Temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Okay, so normal temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and lungs. Throat looks good. Given what you've told me – the tiredness, the thirst, and the slight weight loss – and the fact that you haven’t been feeling sick, I think it would be a good idea to run a few blood tests just to rule things out. I’m thinking a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a TSH to check your thyroid. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds smart. If it helps figure out what’s going on, then yeah, let’s do the blood tests. I trust your judgement, Dr. Polczynski. I just want to feel normal again, you know? So whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. Alright, I'm ordering those tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in right away. It will just be a quick blood draw. Once we have the results back, we can discuss them and figure out the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or if your symptoms get worse. As for the Medicare forms… it looks like they just need a basic health assessment. I can complete those now that I've had a chance to talk to you and do a quick exam.
PATIENT: Okay, perfect. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and run the tests. Hydrating and resting sounds good. And thank you for handling the forms, that's one less thing to worry about. I really appreciate it, Dr. Polczynski.
DOCTOR: Alright, all done. I've submitted the forms electronically. You should receive confirmation shortly. As for the blood tests, I’m sending the order to the lab now. They’ll call you when they’re ready for you. It should be pretty quick. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained everything really well. I feel much better knowing we're getting it checked out. Thank you again, Dr. Polczynski. You’ve been very helpful. I guess I’ll head down to the lab then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Thyra. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns. And I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Dr. Polczynski. I appreciate everything. Bye now.
