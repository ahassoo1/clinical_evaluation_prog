DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Schneer’s the name, Betty Schneer. Um… well, I think it’s my ears. They ain't what they used to be, that’s for sure. People mumble a lot these days, or maybe it’s just me! I dunno, really. It’s been gettin’ worse, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with your hearing. It's very common, especially as we get older. “Not what they used to be” – that’s a good way to put it. And it is often difficult to tell whether it’s people mumbling or your hearing changing! When did you first start noticing this getting worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe… six months? A year? Time kinda slips away, ya know? I used to be able to hear the birds chirpin’ clear as a bell, and now… not so much. And the TV… gotta have it up pretty loud. My neighbor complained last week, actually. Bless her heart, she’s a sweet thing. But I just can’t make out what folks are sayin’ sometimes. Especially women, for some reason. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is common, Mr. Schneer. Higher-pitched sounds are often the first to go with age-related hearing loss, and women's voices tend to be higher pitched than men’s. Six months to a year... that gives us a good starting point. Is this happening in both ears, or is it worse in one ear than the other?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that’s a good question. I think… both, but maybe the left one’s a bit worse. It’s hard to say, really. I don't pay much attention to which ear it is, just that it’s a struggle to hear. Sometimes it’s like… muffled, ya know? Like someone put cotton in my ears. Does that make sense? And when there’s a lot of noise, like at the grocery store, forget about it. Total chaos.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Schneer. "Muffled" and worse with background noise – those are common complaints. And it sounds like it’s affecting both ears, but potentially a bit more on the left. Now, have you ever been exposed to a lot of loud noises during your life?
PATIENT: Loud noises… well, I worked in a shoe factory for… oh, goodness, forty years! Lots of machines, bangin’ and whirrin’ all day long. It was pretty noisy, yeah. We all wore earplugs sometimes, but not always, ya know? It was hot and uncomfortable, and they weren't the most comfortable things. Didn't really think much about it at the time. Just got used to the noise, I suppose. Now I wonder… could that be the reason?
DOCTOR: It certainly could be, Mr. Schneer. Prolonged exposure to loud noises, like you experienced in the factory, is a common cause of hearing loss. That's very important information. Alright. I'd like to do a quick hearing test to get a better idea of what’s going on. It's a simple test where you'll wear headphones and I'll play some tones, and you'll tell me when you can hear them. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, a test, huh? Sounds alright to me, Doctor. As long as it ain't too complicated. I ain’t the sharpest tool in the shed anymore, ya know. Just tell me what I gotta do, and I'll try my best. Headphones are fine. Let's get it over with, eh? I’d like to know what’s goin’ on with these ears of mine.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. It’s very simple, I promise. No need to worry at all. We'll just see how well you respond to different sounds. I’ll explain everything as we go along. If you’d follow me, we can go into the soundproof room. It’ll take about 20-30 minutes, and I'll be right here the whole time. We’ll start with the right ear.
PATIENT: Right ear, you say? Alright then. Lead the way, Doctor. Soundproof room… sounds fancy! Hope I don't get lost in there. I reckon my ears are ready for their test. Though I don't expect they'll do very well!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer, have a seat here. I’m going to put these headphones on you. I'll be in the other room operating the machine. I’ll speak to you through the intercom, and I'll ask you to indicate when you hear a tone. Just press the button when you hear anything – a beep, a click, anything at all. Okay, can you hear me clearly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can hear ya just fine. Though it sounds a bit echoey in here, naturally. A bit like bein’ in a well. Alright, ready when you are. Just let me know what I gotta do again, just in case my brain forgets. It does that sometimes, ya know.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Schneer. When you hear a tone in either ear, just press this button. Don’t worry if it’s faint, just press the button whenever you think you hear something. It's that simple. We’ll start with the right ear. Okay, Mr. Schneer, let’s take a quick break. How are you doing?
PATIENT: Oh, it's alright, Doctor. A bit tedious, maybe, but alright. Heard a few beeps here and there, but mostly just silence. I think… I think I might've missed a couple. My mind wanders sometimes, ya know? It's hard to concentrate on just beeps when you're thinkin' about what you're gonna have for dinner! Is it alright if we take a little break? Just a few minutes to clear my head?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. That's perfectly alright. It's important to take breaks when you need them, especially when concentrating. We can pause for a few minutes. Take your time. Just let me know when you're ready to continue. No rush at all. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Thank ya, Doctor. That's mighty kind of ya. Just need to gather my thoughts a bit. Thinkin’ about old times, mostly. Workin’ in the factory… long hours, but good friends. Alright, I think I’m ready to give it another go. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer, that’s the right ear finished. Now we’ll do the left ear. Same thing – just press the button whenever you hear a tone. Alright, Mr. Schneer, we're all finished with the testing now. Thank you for your patience. It takes a bit of concentration. Let me have a look at the results… Okay, Mr. Schneer, you can come out when you're ready. We need to talk about the results.
PATIENT: Alright, comin’ out now. Hope I didn’t fail too badly! What’d ya find, Doctor? Is it bad news? I reckon I already know it ain't good… these ears ain’t what they used to be. Just tell me straight, eh? I’m an old man, I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Come sit down, Mr. Schneer. Okay, so the test confirms what we suspected. You have some hearing loss. It’s most pronounced in the higher frequencies, which explains why you're having trouble hearing women’s voices and conversations in noisy environments. It's more significant in your left ear. This type of hearing loss is very common, especially with your history of working in the shoe factory. The loud noises likely contributed to it. It’s not a sudden loss, it’s developed over time, so that’s something. But it is enough to be causing you difficulty. Do you have any ringing in your ears, or any dizziness?
PATIENT: Ringing… sometimes, yeah. A faint ringin’, like a high-pitched whine. Comes and goes, mostly when it’s quiet. And dizziness… not really. A bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I put that down to gettin’ old, mostly. So it’s the factory, you reckon? All them machines bangin’ away for forty years… always thought it was a bit too loud, but ya get used to it, don’t ya? What can be done about it, Doctor? Can ya fix it? I don’t want to end up completely deaf, that's for sure. It’s hard enough hearin’ ya now!
DOCTOR: It's very likely the factory noise contributed significantly, Mr. Schneer. Prolonged exposure like that is a common cause of this type of hearing loss, which we call noise-induced hearing loss. Unfortunately, we can’t fix it in the sense of restoring your hearing to what it once was. However, there are things we can do to manage it and improve your quality of life. The most common solution is hearing aids. These are small devices that amplify sound and can be customized to your specific hearing loss. They’ve come a long way in recent years – they’re much smaller and more discreet than they used to be, and they can significantly improve your ability to hear conversations, watch TV, and participate in activities you enjoy. Before we talk about hearing aids, I’d like to refer you to an audiologist. They’re specialists in hearing loss and can perform a more comprehensive evaluation and recommend the best course of action for you. They’ll determine if you’re a good candidate for hearing aids and help you choose the right style and fit. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: An audiologist, huh? Sounds good to me, Doctor. If they can help, I’m all for it. I’m gettin’ too old to be missin’ out on things. Always wanted to hear the birds singin’ again, clear as a bell. And talkin’ to folks without askin’ them to repeat themselves all the time… that’d be a blessin’. Alright then. Send me to the audiologist. What do I gotta do? Fill out forms? Bring somethin’ with me? Just tell me what’s expected, eh? I don’t wanna mess it up.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad to hear that. I’ll fax a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance – she’s an excellent audiologist right here in the city. Her office will call you to schedule an appointment. Here’s the referral form. It has her contact information and what to expect during the appointment. They’ll likely do a more detailed hearing test than we did today, and they’ll discuss your hearing loss and any potential solutions. It's a good idea to bring a list of any medications you’re taking, and if you have a family member or friend who can accompany you, that’s helpful. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. You’ve been mighty helpful, I appreciate it. Just gotta get this referral sorted and see what the audiologist says. Hopefully they can do somethin’ for these old ears of mine. Thank ya kindly for your time. I’ll be seein’ ya.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I'm happy to help. I'm optimistic that the audiologist can improve your hearing. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, Mr. Schneer. And hopefully, you'll be hearing those birds sing again soon.
