DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it's about getting some shots, I reckon. My daughter… she’s trying to get her husband to come live here from overseas. And I understand there’s paperwork and… well, vaccinations needed for the visa process. I'm helping her sort it all out, but I'm not quite sure where to begin.
DOCTOR: Vaccinations for a visa, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. She mentioned something about needing proof of certain shots before he can even apply. I believe it has to do with rules from the government… immigration, maybe? It’s all a bit confusing for an old man like me, truth be told. She thought I should come and get a list of what's required, and see if I needed any boosters or anything.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the requirements can be… extensive. It's not simply a matter of what you need, Mr. Skarbek, but what the immigration services require. Do you have any documentation from your daughter regarding specifically which vaccinations they’re requesting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don’t, Doctor. That's part of the problem! She just said to come get information about the requirements. I didn't know there was a specific list she needed to bring. I apologize for the confusion. Is there a way to find out what's needed without… a paper from her? Maybe you have a general list you could start with?
DOCTOR: It would have been more efficient with documentation. Very well. We can start with the standard requirements for immigration medical examinations. However, be aware this may not be exhaustive. We’ll need to verify with the specific visa type eventually. The standard vaccinations required are typically: Varicella, Tdap, Influenza, MMR, and Hepatitis A and B. Have you had these vaccinations previously, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That's… a lot of names. Let me see… I’ve had a flu shot every year for the last… well, quite a few years, I reckon. And I remember getting something at school when I was a boy, a shot in the arm, but I couldn't tell you what it was. The others… I honestly don't recall. I'm afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. Would there be a way to… check if I’ve had them? Perhaps blood tests or something?
DOCTOR: Blood tests can confirm immunity, yes, but they aren't always definitive and can be costly. And frankly, Mr. Skarbek, relying on childhood recollections is often unreliable. Let’s start by looking at your EHR. Do you have a record of previous vaccinations with this clinic, or with any other provider in the area?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I haven't been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, it must be five years or more. And before that, I mostly saw a doctor back home, with the Cherokee Nation health services. I doubt those records would be here. I moved here a few years ago to be closer to my daughter. I'm afraid I don't have much in the way of medical history readily available.
DOCTOR: Very well. In that case, we will proceed as if you are unvaccinated for those requiring documentation. This means we will need to administer the vaccinations. It’s the safest course of action, given the circumstances. First, let’s review your medical history briefly. Any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. Let me see… I have a touch of arthritis in my knees, nothing too serious. And my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but I take a small pill for that every day. Other than that, I'm fairly healthy for an old man, I suppose. I try to stay active, walk a bit when the weather's good. No allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright. And the medication for your blood pressure – do you recall the name and dosage?
PATIENT: It’s… Lisinopril, I believe. And I take 10 milligrams, once a day, every morning. It's been a few years since the doctor explained it all. I hope I’m remembering correctly. My daughter handles most of refilling it now, so I don’t see the bottle much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril 10mg daily. Good. Now, before we proceed with the vaccinations, I need to perform a brief physical exam to ensure there are no contraindications. Can you please step onto the scale and I’ll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Here I go. I hope I'm not too heavy for that scale!
DOCTOR: Weight is 102 pounds. Blood pressure is 148 over 85. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, Mr. Skarbek, but within acceptable limits given your history and current stress levels. We will monitor it. Now, let’s proceed with the vaccinations. I recommend administering Tdap, Influenza, MMR, and Hepatitis A. We can discuss Hepatitis B after reviewing the specific visa requirements. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. As long as it's the safest course of action, I trust your judgment. I don’t look forward to the shots, mind you, but if it's necessary for my daughter's husband, then so be it. Perhaps we should start with the least painful one? If there is such a thing…
DOCTOR: Very well. Tdap is typically the most reactive, so we will start with Influenza. It's generally the best-tolerated. Please roll up your sleeve. This may sting briefly, Mr. Skarbek. Afterwards, there may be some soreness at the injection site. There. That’s one down. Just keep that area clean and dry. Now, we'll move on to MMR. I'll need to explain the potential side effects of that one in a bit more detail…
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Side effects? What sort of side effects, Doctor? I'm not good with… medical talk. Is it something I should be worried about? I just want to be sure I don’t fall apart or anything. My daughter would have a fit! It didn’t hurt too bad, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Mr. Skarbek, it's essential to understand that all vaccines have potential side effects. The vast majority are mild – soreness, low-grade fever, fatigue. With MMR, there is a very small risk of a rash, or in extremely rare cases, a temporary decrease in platelet count. We are prepared to manage any adverse reactions, but severe complications are exceedingly rare. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, particularly given the potential for exposure to these diseases. It’s a matter of public health, and ensuring your daughter’s husband is protected. Now, let’s get this over with. Please relax your arm. This one might be a little more noticeable than the Influenza vaccine.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. If you say it's best, then I suppose I trust you. But please, be quick about it. And if I start feeling unwell afterwards, will you be able to help? My daughter is a nurse, but she's at work and I don’t want to bother her unless it's serious. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: There. Done. And now, we'll proceed with Tdap. It’s important to be aware that this vaccine often causes significant soreness at the injection site. We can discuss strategies to manage the discomfort after the injection. This is the last one for today, Mr. Skarbek. Try to relax. All done. There. That concludes the vaccinations for today. Now, let’s discuss post-vaccination care and what to expect…
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That one did hurt. I feel… a little shaky, Doctor. Is that normal? And what did you say about managing the discomfort? Should I be taking something for the pain? I hope it doesn't keep me from walking… my daughter wants me to go with her to the grocery store tomorrow. It feels like my whole arm is throbbing.
DOCTOR: Some soreness and mild fever are perfectly normal after Tdap, Mr. Skarbek. It's a sign that your immune system is responding. The shaking is also not uncommon. We can provide you with a prescription for ibuprofen to manage the discomfort. It should help alleviate the pain and reduce any swelling. As for walking, you should be able to continue your normal activities, but avoid strenuous exercise for the next 24-48 hours. Here's a prescription for 600 milligrams of ibuprofen, to be taken every 6-8 hours as needed. I also recommend keeping the injection sites clean and dry. If you develop a high fever, severe headache, or any difficulty breathing, you must seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness for the ibuprofen. And no, I don't think so. Just… try not to get a high fever, keep the spots clean, and take the pills. It sounds simple enough, I suppose. Will this… protect my daughter's husband enough? Is there anything else I need to do, or any paperwork I need to get from you? I want to be sure everything is done correctly. It's all so confusing.
DOCTOR: Yes, these vaccinations should provide adequate protection against these diseases, assuming no underlying immune deficiencies. I will provide you with a vaccination record, detailing the dates and types of vaccines administered. This is sufficient documentation for most immigration purposes, but it's always best to confirm the specific requirements with the relevant authorities. Here's your record. You will also receive a bill for the vaccinations. Mr. Skarbek, I understand your concerns, but I assure you that you have received the necessary vaccinations. Any further questions should be directed to your daughter, as she is familiar with the specific requirements of the visa process. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That’s… good. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose that’s all then. And thank you for your patience with an old man and his questions. It’s been… a lot. I better go home and lie down now. I feel a little faint. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Skarbek. Get some rest.
