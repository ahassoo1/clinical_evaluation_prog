DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for a while now, honestly. I don't really know when it started, exactly. Everything feels a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tiredness… okay. And when you say "a while," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, a rough estimate… Maybe… six months? Or was it a year? It's hard to say. Time just… slips away. It's not like I'm doing anything to be tired, you know? Not a lot of energy for much these days, anyway.
DOCTOR: Right. Six months to a year… alright. And is this tiredness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I think. It’s not like I have good days and bad days, exactly. Just… always some level of tired. Some days are worse than others, sure, but it's never really gone. It makes everything… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… aches, maybe? Little aches and pains all over. Not like anything major, just… there. And I've been… forgetful. Even more than usual, I mean. It’s frustrating. I can't seem to remember what I had for breakfast half the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Aches and forgetfulness… Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes… I don't really eat much, if I'm honest. Not because I don’t want to, just… no appetite. And I think I’ve lost a bit of weight. Not trying to, just… clothes feel looser. Does that make sense? It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. Chills, maybe sometimes, but I always just put that down to the air conditioning. And night sweats… Now that you mention it, maybe? I do wake up feeling a little damp sometimes, but… I always assumed it was just a warm blanket. I don't know. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Existing… Well, my heart… I had some trouble with it a few years back, but the doctor said it was mostly under control. And… I don’t know. Old age, I guess? Things ache. Is that a condition? Honestly, I can't really remember what all they told me. My husband, God rest his soul, always handled all the medical stuff. It was easier that way.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Heart trouble… okay. Do you recall what specific heart condition you were diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Ugh… Something with the rhythm… arrhythmia, maybe? Or atrial… something? It was a long time ago, and the doctor used a lot of big words. I mostly just remember having to take pills and go for checkups. I really don’t like thinking about it, to be honest. It was a scary time. And I’m not very good with names and details these days. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. Arrhythmia… we can look that up in your records. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I think I had my gallbladder out. Years ago, though. And… maybe my appendix? It was all a very long time ago. I honestly can’t remember clearly. Everything feels so distant these days. It’s just… a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder and possibly appendix. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My husband, like I said, passed away a few years back. No children, sadly. I had a sister, but she moved to Romania a long time ago, and we haven't spoken in years. She didn't like… how things were going. I don’t really know about her health, to be honest. We haven’t been in touch since… well, a long time. It’s just me now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to take a lot of allergy medicine for hay fever, but that was years ago. I think. Honestly, Doctor, I’m really not much help with this stuff. It's all just… a blur. I’m sorry to waste your time. Is this… is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies. No, it won't take much longer. Let me just ask a few more quick questions. What medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just these. For my heart, I think. And… a vitamin D pill. My doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. I think this white one is for the rhythm, and this blue one… I have no idea. I just take them every day. I really don't pay much attention. It's easier that way, honestly. It's all just… routine.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get this sorted out. Now, finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven't touched a drop of alcohol since… well, since my husband passed away. It just didn't seem right after that. And drugs? Heavens, no! I'm a pharmacy technician! I work with that stuff, I don't use it. I just want to feel better, Doctor. That's all. Is there anything else I need to tell you?
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Ms. Licano. That's very helpful. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just routine things, checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, that sort of thing. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you have to. Just… please be quick. I have errands to run, and I don’t really have the energy for a long examination. But yes, go ahead. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not critically so. Now, let's listen to your heart. I do hear a slightly irregular rhythm. It's subtle, but it's there. Lung sounds are clear, though. Now, I'm just going to feel your abdomen. It's soft, no tenderness. No masses. Okay. Now, can you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh… It’s a little difficult. My legs feel… weak. And… dizzy, a little. I don't do a lot of walking these days, Doctor. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Easy now. Just take a deep breath. It's alright. Yes, you do seem a bit unsteady. I'm going to order some blood tests. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function, and a Vitamin D level. And an EKG, to get a better look at your heart rhythm. We also need to rule out any underlying infection or vitamin deficiencies. Do you have any trouble with your vision?
PATIENT: Vision…? It's… not as good as it used to be, I suppose. Everything's a bit blurry, actually. I keep needing to adjust my glasses. I thought it was just old age. I haven't been to the eye doctor in… well, I don't even remember. Is that important? I just assumed my glasses needed a new prescription. I really just want to know what's making me so tired.
DOCTOR: It is important. Blurry vision can be a symptom of several things. We'll get these tests done and find out what’s going on. I also want you to schedule an appointment with an ophthalmologist. While we await the results, I’m going to prescribe you a low-dose multivitamin. It’s unlikely to cause harm and may help with some of your symptoms. And I want you to take things easy. Don't overexert yourself. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Licano. Now, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Honestly, Doctor, it’s a lot to take in. So many tests, so many appointments… I just hope it’s nothing serious. And… thank you. For listening. And for trying to help. Can I… can I go now? I really need to get home and rest. This whole thing has exhausted me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Licano. Absolutely. The nurse will come and get you shortly to draw some blood. We'll call you as soon as the results are available, probably in a couple of days. And please, don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you feel worse. Here's a summary of everything we discussed, and the lab orders. Rest up, and try not to worry too much. It was nice meeting you. .
