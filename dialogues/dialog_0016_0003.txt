DOCTOR: Good morning, Jerrel! I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, I told the nice lady at the front desk. My hand... it shakes. Been happening for a bit now. Not sure why it's happening, and frankly, I don't have time to sit here all day figuring it out. Just... fix it, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're frustrated, Jerrel. We'll definitely try to figure out what’s going on with your hand and get you feeling better. “A bit now” is helpful, but could you tell me roughly how long this shaking has been happening?
PATIENT: Roughly? Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. Months, maybe? Seems like... a while. Longer than a couple of weeks, definitely. I just noticed it when I was trying to eat soup the other day and made a mess. It's embarrassing, is what it is. I used to have steady hands, you know. Directed some important films. Now look at me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly frustrating when something changes that affects your daily life, especially something you rely on. So, it’s been happening for months, and you noticed it recently when eating soup. Is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I try to do something precise. Holding a fork, writing... trying to light a cigarette, though I don't do that much anymore. When I'm just... sitting, it's not so bad. Though sometimes, even then, I think I feel a little quiver. It's probably nothing. Look, are you going to ask me a lot of questions, or are we going to do something? I have a lunch reservation.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions feel tedious, Jerrel, but they help me get a clearer picture. It is helpful to know it's worse with precise movements and you sometimes feel a quiver even at rest. Just a couple more to start. Has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, “changed”? I’m eighty years old, everything changes! My knees ache more, I forget where I put my glasses... is that what you want to know? I haven't been doing anything different, Doc. Same routine for years. Maybe... maybe the coffee's a little stronger lately. My housekeeper started getting it from a new place. Could be that. Though I doubt it.
DOCTOR: That's good information, thank you. The coffee change is worth noting. And you're right, a lot changes over time. Do you have any other medical problems that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Like I'm keeping a list! My back goes out sometimes. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago, but I take a pill for that. And... and my wife, bless her soul, she always said I had a touch of arthritis. It's probably just old age, alright? I'm an old man. What do you expect? I swear, doctors these days... always asking questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, Jerrel. We'll get to the physical exam soon. Just a few more quick questions, and then we'll do some checking. You mentioned high blood pressure and take medication for it - do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, names... I never could remember names. It's a little white pill. Pinkish, I think. I've been taking it for… a long time. Honestly, Doc, I just ask my wife – had – to refill it every month. She handled all that. I just… took the pill. Don't look at me like that. It's not like I'm a medical professional. I directed the ones on TV, alright? Big difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little white, pinkish pill for high blood pressure. That’s helpful. Do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Now you’re just fishing. Let me think... sometimes I take something for my knees, when they really bother me. Ibuprofen, maybe? The over-the-counter stuff. And… oh, my daughter started giving me something for my memory. Said it had ginkgo biloba in it or something. Little green capsules. I take one every morning. Though honestly, I can't tell if it's doing anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ibuprofen for your knees and a green capsule with ginkgo biloba for memory. Thank you for telling me. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a problem. I eat pretty much everything. I used to travel all over the world, ate all sorts of things. Never had a reaction. Honestly, Doc, I don't have time for this. Are we going to look at my hand or what? I have a very important lunch.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jerrel. No known allergies. Let's take a look at your hand. If you could just sit here, and extend your arms, palms up, that would be great. I'm going to observe your hands at rest and then ask you to do a few simple movements. This will help me assess the tremor. It's a quick examination, I promise.
PATIENT: Get it over with. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just tell me what's wrong and give me something for it. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel. I'm just noting some slight tremor in both hands, even at rest, as you mentioned. It's more pronounced when you extend your arms and reach, as you’re doing now. I'm also checking your muscle tone and reflexes. Everything seems…within normal limits otherwise. No significant rigidity or weakness. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. They sound clear. I’m also going to check your gait. Could you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Careful, now! I told you, I'm eighty! Don't want me falling and suing you. This is all very… thorough. And frankly, unnecessary. It’s just a shaky hand, Doc. Not the end of the world. Just get me something to stop it, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jerrel. It’s good we checked your gait to rule out any balance issues. Everything appears relatively stable, but we'll want to be cautious. Based on what you've told me and the examination, there are several possibilities. The tremor could be related to age, medication side effects – potentially the blood pressure medication or the ginkgo biloba – or a common condition called essential tremor. It's not always possible to pinpoint the exact cause. Given your age and other medical conditions, I recommend we start with a few tests to rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. These will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. We can also discuss adjusting your current medications to see if that helps. What do you think?
PATIENT: Ugh, tests. Of course. More waiting. More poking and prodding. Look, Doc, can’t you just give me a pill? Something to calm the shaking? I don’t want to spend my remaining years in doctor’s offices. Honestly. Fine, do your tests. But I’m warning you, if this doesn't help, I’m finding another doctor. One who understands that an eighty-year-old man doesn't need a full workup for a shaky hand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jerrel, and I’m not trying to subject you to unnecessary tests. These are simply to rule out other potential causes and ensure we’re addressing the right problem. We can discuss options for managing the tremor while we await the results. For now, we can try a low dose of propranolol, a medication sometimes used for essential tremor. However, given your history, we’ll start with a very low dose and monitor you closely for any side effects, such as low blood pressure or a slow heart rate. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion. They specialize in movement disorders and can provide further evaluation and treatment options. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A neurologist. Wonderful. More specialists. Fine, fine. Do what you have to do. But I’m telling you, this is all a waste of time. I just want my hand to stop shaking! Propranolol… fine. But if I start feeling dizzy or something, I’m calling you immediately. And don't expect me to be happy about it. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel. I’ll write you a prescription for a low dose of propranolol and the referral to the neurologist. The neurologist's office will call you to schedule an appointment. Here are the prescriptions and the referral. Please take the propranolol as directed and let me know immediately if you experience any side effects like dizziness, fatigue, or shortness of breath. I'll also have the nurse go over the instructions for the blood tests with you. We'll review the results as soon as they're available and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. I understand your frustration, and I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to help you manage this. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. I have a lunch reservation, remember? And frankly, after all this poking and prodding, I need a stiff drink. .
