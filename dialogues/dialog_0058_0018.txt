DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Todoro-vich, is it? Yes. It’s… it's rather a nuisance, to be perfectly frank. I seem to be… going to the bathroom quite a lot. More than usual, certainly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s… disruptive. I’m not entirely sure when it started, truthfully. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, alright. Frequent urination… hm. And you say it's been going on for "a little while"?
PATIENT: Yes, “a little while.” Weeks, perhaps? It’s difficult to say precisely. Time… it seems to slip away these days. I wouldn’t want to mislead you with inaccurate details. It’s not a sudden thing, Doctor. It’s been… gradual. More noticeable lately, though. I do find myself getting up several times during the night, which… is rather tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright, weeks, gradual onset, nighttime trips… and is it a strong urge to go, or just a little dribbling?
PATIENT: Hmm. A strong urge, I believe. Yes, definitely a strong urge. Not dribbling, no. It comes on rather suddenly, actually. I need to go, and quickly. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least. I wouldn’t describe it as a slow leak, if that makes any sense. More of a… a full emptying, when it happens. Though, it happens often.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Now that you mention it… there was a bit of discomfort. Not severe pain, mind you, but… a stinging sensation. It’s not constant, though. Only occasionally, and usually towards the end of… well, you understand. It’s brief, thankfully. I hadn’t thought much of it, to be honest. Just assumed it was… age. But yes, a little stinging from time to time.
DOCTOR: And any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the urine? Let me see… I don’t believe so. It looks… normal, as far as I can tell. The usual colour, I suppose. I haven’t noticed any blood, or anything… unusual. I drink plenty of water, you see. Always have. Though, perhaps I should be paying closer attention. It's all a bit of a blur, truthfully. I don’t routinely examine… my urine, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Other symptoms? Let me see… No, I don’t believe so. I feel generally well, despite… all this. No fever, no chills. No nausea, no vomiting. Perhaps a little… tired, but that could just be my age, as I said. I haven't noticed anything particularly alarming, no. Just the frequent bathroom trips, and the occasional stinging sensation. Is there something specific I should be looking for, Doctor? I am rather… oblivious to these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of diabetes or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Now, that’s a good question. My mother… I believe she had something similar. Yes, she did. She was always… very careful about her diet. And my father… he had some trouble with his prostate, I recall. It caused him some discomfort, and he had to visit the doctor frequently. It was many years ago, of course. I don’t recall the specifics, but yes, prostate issues on my father's side, and diabetes on my mother’s. I do hope that answers your question, Doctor. It’s difficult to remember details from so long ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. Always considered it a rather… unhealthy habit. No, definitely not a smoker.
DOCTOR: Alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive, I assure you. A social drink, now and then. I wouldn't say I drink heavily, Doctor. More of a… a civilized indulgence. Perhaps once or twice a week. No more. It certainly doesn't contribute to… any of this, I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, let's do a quick exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I'll need to do a prostate exam. It will be… uncomfortable.
PATIENT: A… a prostate exam? Oh. Well. I… I suppose that is to be expected, given my family history. Uncomfortable, you say? Yes, I rather anticipated as much. Very well, Doctor. If it is necessary, then I shall endure it. Though, I must confess, I am not looking forward to it. Do… do let me know before you begin, if you would be so kind. Just a little warning is all I ask.
DOCTOR: Lie down on your side, please. And yes, I'll let you know when I'm about to begin. Prostate is slightly enlarged, and tender to palpation. No obvious nodules. Abdomen is soft, no masses. It's likely prostatitis - inflammation of the prostate. We'll need a urine sample to rule out infection, and a PSA test to check for more serious issues. I'll order those now.
PATIENT: Prostatitis… inflammation, you say? That doesn’t sound particularly pleasant. No surprise, I suppose, given everything. A urine sample and a… a PSA test? Very well, Doctor. Whatever is necessary to get to the bottom of this. I trust that is a simple enough procedure? I do hope it doesn't involve anything too… invasive. And what, if you don't mind me asking, is the purpose of the PSA test? Just to understand the situation a little better, you see. It always helps to know what one is dealing with.
DOCTOR: The urine sample will tell us if you have an infection. The PSA test measures a protein made by the prostate. Elevated levels can indicate prostate cancer, but it can also be elevated from inflammation or other non-cancerous conditions. It's just a blood test, nothing invasive. The nurse will draw it for you now. We’ll discuss the results when they come back. I'm going to prescribe you an antibiotic just in case it's an infection. Take it for ten days, even if you feel better. If you develop a fever, severe pain, or difficulty urinating, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An antibiotic… for ten days. Even if I feel better. And if fever, pain, difficulty… the emergency room. Yes, I understand. A PSA test to rule out… worse things. It all sounds rather… involved. I confess, Doctor, I’m not a fan of medical procedures, but I trust your judgment. I shall take the antibiotic as prescribed, and I’ll be sure to pay attention to any… warning signs. And the nurse will draw the blood sample, you say? Very well. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It does ease my mind a little, knowing what to expect. Perhaps I can ask one final question? Is there anything I can do to help alleviate the symptoms in the meantime? Besides taking the medication, of course.
DOCTOR: Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. And try sitting on a warm bath a couple of times a day. That might help with the discomfort. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. .
PATIENT: Fluids, no caffeine, warm baths… Yes, I can manage that. Thank you again, Doctor Todoro-vich. I appreciate your time and assistance. .
