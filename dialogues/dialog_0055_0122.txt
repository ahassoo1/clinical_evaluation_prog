DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. I am here because… well, it is difficult to explain. My memory… it is not what it was. It started a few months ago, small things, forgetting where I put my keys. But now… now it is more frequent. And concerning. I am… hypertensive, you see. The doctor before… he said it could be that.
DOCTOR: Hypertension can certainly contribute to cognitive difficulties, yes. Though it is rarely a straightforward correlation. We will need to explore this more thoroughly. “More frequent,” you say. Can you give me some specific examples of what you’ve been experiencing lately?
PATIENT: Specific… yes. Last week, I had a meeting with the board of the community association. I… I completely forgot the name of Mr. Henderson’s wife. We have known each other for ten years! And just yesterday, I went to the grocery store for milk and… I came home with bread. Only bread. I had to drive back. It is… embarrassing. And frightening. It was never like this before.
DOCTOR: I see. Forgetting names occasionally is not uncommon, but the incidents you describe are more concerning, particularly with the recent escalation. Do you find yourself getting lost, even in familiar places?
PATIENT: Lost? Not… truly lost. But… disoriented. Sometimes I drive to the association and I… I question if it is the correct route. I know it is, I have driven it a thousand times, but I will check the map on my phone… just to be sure. And once, last month, I walked into the wrong building entirely. It was similar in appearance to my office. Very unsettling. It is… a feeling of not being quite present, Doctor. If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Alvara. And these instances of disorientation are important to note. Now, let’s delve into your medical history a bit further. You mentioned hypertension. Are you currently taking any medication for that, or any other condition, for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes. I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once daily, for the blood pressure. And… occasionally, ibuprofen, for my arthritis in the knees. But only when it is very bad. I do not take anything else. And I try to be very careful with the ibuprofen, as the previous doctor warned me about interactions. I… I am very good about taking my pills, Doctor. Every morning, same time. I have a routine.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you are diligent with your medication. And it's wise to be cautious with the ibuprofen. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside these memory issues and disorientation?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Sometimes, I feel… a little unsteady. Not dizzy, exactly, but… off balance. It is fleeting. And… I have been more tired lately. Very tired. I used to have so much energy, managing the properties and the association… Now, I find myself needing to rest in the afternoon. It is… unlike me. And… My vision has been… blurry, sometimes. Mostly at the edges. I thought it was just my age, to be honest. But… perhaps it is connected. Is that possible, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is possible, Ms. Alvara. Several factors could be contributing to these symptoms. Fatigue, unsteadiness, and blurred vision, coupled with the memory issues… it warrants a thorough evaluation. Before we proceed, let’s review your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than routine procedures?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… No. Never. I have been very healthy, all my life. A few surgeries, as I get older, cataracts removed, a knee replacement five years ago… but nothing serious. No major illnesses. No heart problems. No… strokes. I assure you, Doctor. I am a very… robust woman. It is just… this memory. It is so frightening to feel myself… changing. It is the unknown that worries me most.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Alvara. And it is reasonable to be worried about such changes. Now, regarding your family history… are there any instances of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or other neurological conditions in your immediate family?
PATIENT: My mother… yes. She had… what the doctors called “early onset” dementia. She was only 72 when she started to forget things. It progressed quickly. Very quickly. It was… difficult. Very difficult for all of us. And… My grandmother, on my father’s side, she also had memory problems in her later years, but it was never… diagnosed. They just said it was “old age.” But it was similar. That is why I am so worried, Doctor. I see the shadow of her face in my own reflection sometimes. It is… a terrible fear.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Alvara. Given your mother’s history, it is prudent to investigate these symptoms thoroughly. Now, let’s briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never. I have never smoked in my life. My husband… he smoked, for many years, but he passed away ten years ago. And I… I drink occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. But very rarely. I do not drink to excess. I prefer tea, actually. And I try to keep very busy. Managing the properties, attending association meetings… it keeps my mind active. It used to, at least.
DOCTOR: I see. And finally, are you currently experiencing any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. None that I am aware of. I have always been fortunate in that regard. I can take most medications without issue. Is that all, Doctor? I apologize if I have been rambling. I just… I want to understand what is happening. And I want to be sure… that it is nothing serious. I have a great deal to manage, you see. And I need my memory. I simply must.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Alvara. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I would like to conduct a brief neurological examination to assess your reflexes, coordination, and cognitive function. It will involve some simple tests, nothing to be concerned about. May I proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. Whatever is necessary. I want to understand. I am ready. Just… please be gentle. My knees, you see… they are not what they once were.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We will take things slowly. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. First, I would like you to follow my finger with your eyes – do not move your head. Look to your right… now to your left… now follow my finger up and down… and finally, diagonally.
PATIENT: Right… left… up… down… diagonally… Is that all, Doctor? It feels… a little dizzying, to be honest. But I am trying my best.
DOCTOR: It's alright. That is perfectly normal. Now, I would like you to close your eyes and tell me the date, including the day of the week.
PATIENT: The date… today is… August… the second… 2025. The day… is it Tuesday? No… Wednesday? Oh dear… I know this. I know this. It is… I apologize, Doctor. I am usually very good with dates. It is just… slipping away from me. It is terribly frustrating. Is this a bad sign?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Alvara. We are simply gathering information. Now, I would like you to repeat three words after me. Remember them, as I will ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple… table… penny.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple… table… penny. Apple… table… penny. Yes. I believe I have them. Are we finished with the words, Doctor? It is… a little taxing, to be honest. My mind feels… cluttered.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, could you please hold out your arms in front of you, palms up, and close your eyes. I will lightly tap your arms and assess your reflexes.
PATIENT: Yes… here. Is that correct, Doctor? They twitched… did they? It is difficult to tell. I have arthritis, you see. It affects my reflexes. It might not be accurate.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes… here. Is that sufficient, Doctor? I am afraid my knees are not what they once were. I feel a little unsteady. It is difficult to walk straight.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. Please, have a seat. Based on the neurological examination and your reported symptoms, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Your memory difficulties, disorientation, and unsteady gait are concerning. Given your mother’s history of early-onset dementia, we must rule out a similar condition. However, it is also possible that these symptoms are related to a vascular issue, a medication side effect, or another underlying medical condition. I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. Additionally, I recommend an MRI of the brain to assess for any structural abnormalities. Would you be amenable to those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Whatever is necessary. If it will help to understand what is happening, then I am willing to do whatever tests you deem appropriate. An MRI… is that… painful? And the blood tests… will they be able to tell me if it is… like my mother? I just… I want to know. Even if it is bad news, I would rather know than live in this uncertainty. I need to prepare myself. And my family.
DOCTOR: The MRI is not painful, Ms. Alvara. You will lie still inside a scanner, and it will take approximately 30-40 minutes. It can be a little claustrophobic for some, but we can discuss options for managing that if you are concerned. As for the blood tests, they will provide valuable information about your overall health and can help rule out certain conditions. They are not definitive for diagnosing dementia, but they can provide clues and guide further investigation. I will write the orders for the tests now. The lab is located on the third floor, and you can schedule the MRI at the imaging center across the street. Once we have the results, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding driving, especially long distances, and refraining from making any major decisions until we have a clearer understanding of your condition. Additionally, would you like me to provide you with a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be… very helpful. A neurologist… a second opinion. It would give me peace of mind. Avoiding driving… making major decisions… it is… difficult. But I understand. I will do whatever you recommend. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for your time. And for your honesty. It is… a comfort to know that you are taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I understand this is a difficult time, and I want to assure you that we will work through this together. I will have my assistant schedule the follow-up appointment for you and provide you with the necessary referral information. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please do not hesitate to contact the office. I wish you all the best, Ms. Alvara.
