DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away. It's been bothering me for a few weeks now, and it feels…deeper than usual. It worries me a little, you see. My heart hasn’t been the best lately, and I always get nervous when I cough a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nadene, especially with your heart history. A persistent cough can be worrisome. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe a little over a month now. It started mild, just a tickle, but it’s gotten worse. I try to ignore it, but it wakes me up at night sometimes. And I get so tired trying to catch my breath after a good coughing spell. It’s… draining. I used to be able to walk to the market, but now I have to rest halfway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s progressed over a month, waking you at night, and causing fatigue and shortness of breath. And it's affecting your ability to walk. Do you notice anything that specifically triggers the cough, or makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think. Not really anything specific, not that I’ve noticed. It seems to happen anytime, really. Sometimes it’s worse when I lie down, I think. And maybe a little worse after I eat… but I eat pretty simple things, mostly. Rice, beans, chicken… nothing fancy. I don't smoke, and I haven't for years. My husband… well, he used to, but he’s gone now. It's just…always there, a little tickle turning into a big cough.
DOCTOR: Alright. So no specific triggers, potentially worse when lying down and after eating, and you haven’t smoked. And you said your husband used to smoke… that's good to know. Do you have any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I feel a little bit swollen in my ankles, especially at the end of the day. And I get winded very easily, like climbing just one flight of stairs feels like a big effort. Oh, and I’ve been more tired than usual, even for an old lady like me! I used to have so much energy, but now… I mostly just nap. I also feel a little full, sometimes, even when I haven’t eaten much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that all makes sense, Nadene. Swollen ankles, increased fatigue, shortness of breath, and feeling full easily… These are all important things to know. Let’s do a quick examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your ankles. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. My ankles do bother me, especially when it's hot. They get so puffy. It’s like little balloons sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your breathing sounds a little… wheezy, I'm hearing some mild crackles in the lower part of your lungs. And your heart rate is a bit fast, a little irregular as well. Now, let’s take a look at those ankles. Yes, there is some swelling, and a little bit of pitting edema. That means the indentation remains for a few seconds after I press on it. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My weight. I think I have gained a little bit, maybe five or six pounds in the last few weeks. It’s hard to say exactly, I don't weigh myself every day. But my clothes are feeling tighter. I haven't changed my eating habits, so I was a little surprised. My daughter, Elena, she keeps telling me to watch my salt intake, but… I don’t add much salt to my food. Mostly just a little when I cook the beans.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nadene. So we have a persistent cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, wheezing, crackles in your lungs, an irregular heartbeat, swelling in your ankles, and some recent weight gain. It’s good Elena is looking out for you, and that you haven’t significantly changed your diet. I'd like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll do a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, a blood test to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any infection, and an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. I miss walking to the market. An X-ray and a blood test… and that heart thing. Is it going to be painful? I don't like needles much.
DOCTOR: No, Nadene, none of it should be painful. The blood test is just a small prick of the finger, and the EKG is completely non-invasive – we'll just put some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all. The X-ray is just a quick picture, you’ll stand still for a moment. I’ll write the orders for the lab and radiology now. Then, the nurse will come in and draw your blood, and she can explain where to go for the X-ray and EKG. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Stickers and a little prick… that doesn’t sound too bad. Will I be able to eat before the tests? I always get a little weak if I don't eat something. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have Elena coming to visit next week, and I don’t want to worry her unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can definitely eat before the tests, please do! In fact, it’s a good idea to have a light meal beforehand. As for the results, it usually takes 24-48 hours for the lab and radiology to send them over. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for early next week to discuss them together. That way, we’ll have plenty of time to go over everything and decide on the best course of action before Elena arrives. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Early next week is good. And knowing I can eat something before… that’s a relief. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. That’s my job. I’m glad I could help ease your worries. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and she'll give you instructions for the X-ray and EKG. In the meantime, try to relax, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all for now. Thank you again for your kindness. I’ll wait for the nurse then. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Nadene. You take care, and we’ll see you early next week. .
