DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it's… something with some swelling, I believe. Honestly, it’s a bit hard to recall precisely when it started, or how. It feels like it’s been a little while, though.
DOCTOR: Swelling, you say. Alright. And where exactly is this swelling located, Jahaad?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly here, I think. On the side of my neck, right here. It doesn’t hurt, not really. More… noticeable, than painful. It's a strange sensation. I apologize for being so vague; details are…difficult for me to remember.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jahaad. Memory can be tricky. It’s perfectly alright. Just tell me what you can recall. So, the swelling is on the side of your neck. Has it changed in size recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it might be a little larger than it was a week or so ago, but honestly, it’s hard to say for sure. It’s subtle, if that makes sense. I wouldn’t have even noticed it if I hadn’t been… well, if I hadn’t been feeling it more frequently, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific made it worse, or better?
PATIENT: That’s… another difficult one. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, no. It doesn’t seem to be affected by activity, or… what I eat, or anything like that. It’s just… there. Which is why I thought I should come and see someone. I’m not usually one to worry over things, but this is… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any other symptoms along with this swelling?
PATIENT: Let me think… No… not that I’m aware of. No fever, no difficulty breathing… no pain, as I mentioned. Perhaps a little… fatigue, lately? But I’ve also been rather busy, so that could just be that. It's hard to separate what's normal for me, from anything new. I apologize again for being unhelpful; I truly wish I had more concrete information.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Jahaad. We'll work through this. Fatigue can certainly be a symptom of many things. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: A cold… hmm. I don't believe so, no. Not recently. Perhaps a minor sniffle a month or so ago, but nothing significant. No fever, no cough, no aches… just a very slight cold. It didn't last long, and I didn't bother seeing a doctor for it. It felt like just a normal seasonal thing, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any history of similar swelling in the past?
PATIENT: Similar swelling… No, I don’t think so. Not that I recall, anyway. I’ve always been quite healthy, generally. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing like this. This is… new territory for me. I really appreciate your patience; I know I’m not providing much to work with.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Jahaad. We'll gather what information we can. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I haven't taken any medications regularly in years – just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, perhaps. And even those haven't caused any problems. I'm fortunate in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to maintain a healthy diet, so I don't feel the need for supplements. As for medications, I haven't needed any for quite some time. I really strive to avoid them whenever possible, if that makes sense. I believe in letting my body heal naturally, whenever it can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. I have regular check-ups with my primary care physician, and everything has always been normal. I've never been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, and I don't have any family history of serious illnesses, either. I'm quite fortunate, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and gently feel the area of swelling on your neck. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise, and I'm happy to cooperate in any way that will help us determine the cause of this swelling. I understand the need for a physical examination.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular and strong. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let me gently palpate the swelling on your neck. The swelling is approximately 2 centimeters in diameter. It feels… firm, but not particularly hard. It’s also slightly tender to the touch, but not acutely painful. It appears to be located just beneath the skin, and doesn't extend very deeply. No warmth or redness noted. I'm not feeling any other enlarged lymph nodes in your neck or elsewhere. Alright. Based on my initial examination, the swelling is relatively small and localized, and doesn’t appear to be causing any significant discomfort. However, to rule out any underlying causes, I'd like to order a complete blood count, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A complete blood count and a thyroid stimulating hormone level… I trust your judgment. Please, proceed with the tests. I want to understand what’s causing this, and I’m happy to undergo whatever investigations you deem necessary. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw some blood. It should only take a few minutes. While we wait for the results, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not at the moment, actually. I think you've explained everything very clearly, and I'm comfortable with the plan. I suppose I'll just wait for the results and see what they indicate. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness, Doctor. It's reassuring to be in such capable hands.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. We'll review the results as soon as they become available, and discuss the next steps at that time. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, difficulty breathing, or increased pain, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. The lab technician should be here shortly. I’ll check on you again once the blood draw is complete.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will certainly keep you informed if anything changes. I appreciate your attentiveness. I’ll just sit here quietly and wait for the technician, then.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: .
