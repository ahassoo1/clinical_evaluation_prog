DOCTOR: Hi Mykeisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hi Doctor Polczynski. It's nice to meet you too. I've been having some trouble with my blood pressure, that's why I made an appointment. It's been a bit high lately, according to the machine at the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure. That's good you're getting it checked, and even better that you came in to see me about it. Just to be clear, when you say "a bit high," do you happen to remember any specific numbers from the pharmacy readings?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... I don't remember the exact numbers, no. But the pharmacist said something about it being over 140, I think. And the second number was... around 90? Something like that. It was a few times now that it's been like that, not every time I go, but enough to worry me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, over 140/90 a few times. That is worth looking into. Do you feel any symptoms when your blood pressure is high?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not really, no. I mean, sometimes I get a little bit of a headache, but I get those headaches anyway, you know? Nothing that feels different when the machine says my blood pressure is up. I feel pretty normal, to be honest. A little tired sometimes, but who doesn't?
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific symptoms related to the high readings. Just the occasional headache and some tiredness. Let’s get a better idea of what's going on. I'm going to check your blood pressure myself, just to confirm the pharmacy's readings. Then, I’d like to go over a bit of your medical history, if that's alright with you. Have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is the first time anyone’s even mentioned it to me, actually. I usually feel pretty healthy, to be honest. So, checking it is fine, go ahead. And yeah, asking about my history is good too.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit here and relax your arm, that would be perfect. I'll take a couple of readings, just to get a good average. 148 over 92... and again... 150 over 94. Hmm. Okay, those readings are elevated. While I'm doing this, can you tell me about any other health problems you've had?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, but that cleared up with some physical therapy. Nothing major. And I had the flu really bad last winter, but everyone gets that, right? Oh! And I had my gallbladder taken out about ten years ago, but I’ve been fine since then. I don’t really have any other problems, to be honest. I try to eat okay and walk when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some knee trouble that resolved with therapy, the flu, and gallbladder removal ten years ago. That's helpful to know. Any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... My mom, she had high blood pressure. She was on medication for it for years, I think. And my grandfather, on my dad's side, he had a stroke, but that was a long time ago. I don't really know much about it, honestly. He didn't talk about his health much. That's all I can really think of, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure in your mother and a stroke in your grandfather. That adds some context. And just to get a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly. Just a multivitamin every now and then, but that’s it. I really don't like taking medication unless I absolutely have to. I prefer to just try to stay healthy naturally, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Alright, and one last thing before we move on to a quick physical exam, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not even when I was a kid. I eat all sorts of things, I don’t really have any food allergies or anything like that. So, no, I don’t have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. So, no medications, no allergies. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your pulse, and check your reflexes. It won’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Let’s get it over with. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulses are 2+ bilaterally and equal. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. No edema noted in extremities. All right, everything sounds and feels normal so far. Given your blood pressure readings, family history, and the absence of any other concerning findings, it’s likely we're dealing with early-stage hypertension. However, we need to confirm this with some further testing. I'd like to order a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel. These tests will help us assess your kidney function and cholesterol levels. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. Tests for my kidneys and cholesterol… yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and get it sorted out, if I can. So yes, order the tests, please. How will I go about getting them done? Will I need to come back here?
DOCTOR: Okay, I've just sent the orders to the lab at the clinic across the street – 123 Main Street. You can go there anytime this week, no appointment necessary. They’ll just need your insurance information. It’s a simple blood draw. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend starting to monitor your blood pressure at home if you can. You can get a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. It's a good way to get a more accurate picture of your blood pressure over time. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Monitor it at home... That's not a bad idea, actually. I guess it would be good to keep an eye on it myself. I think I can manage that. And the lab is just across the street, you said? No appointment? Okay, that's easy enough. I guess I don't have any questions right now, no. Just go to the lab and then we’ll schedule another appointment. Is that right? Is there anything else I need to do or worry about in the meantime?
DOCTOR: That's exactly right. Go to the lab when you have a chance, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back. In the meantime, try to maintain a healthy lifestyle – eat a balanced diet, get regular exercise, and manage stress. Also, avoid excessive salt and caffeine intake. It's important to remember that we're just gathering information right now, so there’s no need to worry excessively. We will address it, if necessary. I'll also print out a sheet with some general information about hypertension and lifestyle modifications for you to take home. Here you go. Do you have any questions about anything I’ve said, or anything else on this sheet?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, thank you. No, I think that covers everything, actually. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s good to know what’s going on and have a plan. I'll go to the lab this week and then I’ll give the clinic a call to schedule a follow-up. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your time.
