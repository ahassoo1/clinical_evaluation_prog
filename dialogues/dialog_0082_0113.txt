DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Iuzzolino, you say? Sounds…foreign. Anyway, it’s this bladder of mine. Been going to the bathroom…a lot. More than I used to, that’s for sure. It’s a nuisance, really. Wakes me up at night, too. Not ideal when you’re…my age.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive, especially at night. It’s good you brought it up. “Foreign,” you say?
PATIENT: Well, I didn't mean to be rude, Doctor. It's just... everything's changing these days, isn't it? Used to be everyone around here had good, solid American names. But no matter. It's the going that bothers me, not who’s name is on the door. Does that make sense? I just... I just want it to stop happening so much.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Mr. Segretto. Times are changing, that’s for sure. And yes, you’re right, let’s focus on getting you some relief. “Stopping” it, as you say, is the goal. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about how often you’re going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How often…that's a tricky one. It feels like all the time! Maybe…every couple of hours during the day? And then…two, maybe three times a night? Sometimes more if I drink anything before bed. Which I like to do, mind you. A little glass of something to help me sleep. But then…well, then this happens. It’s a vicious cycle, really. I don't keep track of it precisely, if that's what you're asking. I’m a farmer, Doctor, not a bookkeeper.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Segretto. A farmer’s life is demanding enough without keeping track of bathroom trips! “Every couple of hours during the day, two or three times at night…” That gives me a starting point. And you mentioned a glass of something before bed… Do you find that alcohol specifically makes it worse, or is it just any liquid?
PATIENT: Well, I mostly have a little brandy. Helps me relax, you see. But... now that you mention it, it does seem worse after the brandy. Though, honestly, sometimes I just wake up for no reason at all and have to go. Maybe it’s my age. Everything’s getting…leaky, if you catch my drift. Not just the bladder, either. Old age is not for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you’re right to mention it could be age-related changes. However, we want to rule out other possibilities before assuming that’s the sole cause. Now, aside from the brandy and waking up at night, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Let me think. No, not really. I mean, I get up to go, and I go. It’s not painful, not like a burning sensation or anything. And it doesn’t…splash, if you know what I mean. Just a regular stream. Sometimes it’s a little weak, now that I think about it. But that might just be me getting older, too. I wouldn’t say it’s a powerful stream like it used to be, but it gets the job done. Is that helpful? I’m not good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Segretto. No pain, no burning, normal stream, just a bit weaker… That helps narrow things down. Now, have you had any changes in your thirst lately?
PATIENT: Thirst? Hmm… not that I've noticed. I always drink enough water, especially when I'm working outside. It gets hot, you know. Gotta stay hydrated. Maybe I drink more now, thinking about it. But that’s just 'cause it's summer, and I'm out in the sun all day. I don't feel particularly thirsty, though. Just… drink it because I know I should. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Segretto. Drinking water because you know it’s good for you, even if you don't feel particularly thirsty. Now, let’s talk a bit about your past health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking things I don’t remember. I had something with my heart, a long time ago. They gave me some pills for it, but I stopped taking them years ago. Doctor said it wasn’t serious. And my blood pressure…it’s been a little high, I think. But nothing major. I’m a pretty healthy man, for my age. I work hard, eat good food, and don’t smoke or drink too much. Well, except for that little brandy before bed, but we’ve already talked about that. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. Old age… it takes its toll on the memory.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Segretto. Memories can fade over time. “Something with the heart, high blood pressure…” I’ll make a note to check your records for more details. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve taken a lot of pills in my life, for this and that. Never had a reaction, not that I can recall. Maybe a little stomach upset sometimes, but nothing serious. My wife handles most of the medication stuff, to be honest. She’s the organized one. I just take what she gives me. I’m not good with names or dosages or anything like that. She keeps track of all that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Segretto. And it’s helpful that your wife manages your medications. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. It will just involve checking your abdomen and a quick neurological check. We’ll also check your blood pressure, just to confirm what you said. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’ve always been a pretty sturdy fellow, so I doubt you’ll find anything wrong. Just…try not to poke too much, alright? My wife will have my hide if I come home complaining. She's very particular about my comfort. And try not to take too long, if you don't mind. I've got chores to do, you see. The farm doesn’t run itself.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and we won’t keep you long. Alright, let’s start here. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels tender. I’m just checking for any abnormalities. …Your abdomen is soft, no masses or tenderness to report. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs… everything sounds clear. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, as you mentioned, but not drastically so. Now, just a quick neurological exam… follow my finger with your eyes… good. Can you squeeze my hands…?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. It’s not as bad as I thought, thankfully. Squeezing… yes, I can squeeze. Strong as an ox, I tell you! Well, maybe not quite as strong as I used to be. But still pretty good, for my age. And my eyes are working just fine, thank you very much. I still read the newspaper every morning, you know. And I can see my wife perfectly well, which is the most important thing. Now, what does all this mean, Doctor? Am I going to have to go to the hospital or something? I'd really rather not. The farm…it needs me.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Segretto, you are not going to the hospital. Everything seems normal so far. Your neurological exam is fine, and your squeeze is good—definitely not as strong as an ox, but perfectly adequate! Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have an overactive bladder. This is common, especially as we age. It can cause frequent urination, waking up at night, and sometimes a feeling of urgency. The brandy may be exacerbating it, as alcohol can irritate the bladder. Now, to be sure, I'd like to order a simple urine test to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A urine test… oh, alright. Anything to put my mind at ease. Infection… that doesn’t sound good. My wife always says I need to drink more cranberry juice, for that very reason. It's awful stuff, but she’s insistent. So, a little sample, you say? I suppose I can manage that. Where do I… …Where do I go to do that? I haven’t done one of those in years, if I recall correctly. And is there a special cup or something? Don’t want to make a mess. My wife would be furious.
DOCTOR: Right this way, Mr. Segretto. The bathroom is just over there. Yes, there’s a special cup in there, and instructions on how to collect the sample. It’s quite simple. We just need a small amount, and it’s best to try and collect a mid-stream sample – that means letting a little bit go first, then collecting the sample, and finishing afterwards. It’s to get the most accurate results. Don't worry about making a mess. There are wipes and everything you need in there. Take your time, and when you’re finished, just bring the cup back to me, and I’ll send it to the lab. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A mid-stream, you say? Sounds complicated. But I'll try my best. Wipes… good. I appreciate the wipes. Old bones aren’t as nimble as they used to be. I’ll go now, then. And try not to laugh when I come back, alright? I’m a farmer, not a surgeon. This is all a bit… humbling, to be honest. Just let me know if you need anything. And please, no mid-stream lectures.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Segretto. No lectures, I promise. Patient presents with complaints of frequent urination, nocturia, and possible overactive bladder. Ordering urine analysis to rule out infection. Will discuss treatment options upon results. Patient appears anxious but cooperative. Family history… need to pull that from the EHR…
