DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, I've been noticing a lump in my lower abdomen for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out. It doesn't hurt, really, but it's definitely there, and it's making me a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A new lump is always something to have evaluated, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. “A little while now” – could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Probably around three or four months, maybe? It started quite small, and I almost dismissed it as just... weight fluctuation, you know? But it hasn't gone away, and it feels like it’s grown a bit over that time. It’s not a sudden change, just gradual.
DOCTOR: Right, gradual onset over three to four months. And you said it doesn’t cause any pain?
PATIENT: That's right, no pain at all. Sometimes, maybe a very slight pressure, but it's so minimal I wouldn't even call it discomfort, really. Just... awareness of something being there. It doesn’t bother me when I'm moving around or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or discomfort with movement. And you've noticed a gradual growth. Have you noticed any other changes – any changes in your bowel habits, your appetite, your weight, or any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing else really. My appetite’s been normal, and my weight's pretty stable. Bowel habits are… regular, I suppose. I haven't noticed anything unusual there. No fever, no fatigue… honestly, it's just the lump. That’s what’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Not much, thankfully. I've generally been quite healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No major surgeries, no chronic conditions… I do have Medicare, as my wife and I are both retired now, but haven't needed to use it much over the years. I can’t think of anything else significant, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No major medical problems in the past. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a bit tougher. My parents are both… they’re not with us anymore. And I didn’t get to know many of my extended family. My mother did have some trouble with her stomach, I remember, but I don’t know what exactly. Nothing specific like cancer, as far as I know. It was… a long time ago. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright. Family history can be difficult to piece together sometimes. And finally, are you currently taking any medications or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Just a daily multivitamin. And no allergies – no food allergies, no drug allergies, nothing like that. I've always been pretty good in that regard, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, no allergies, multivitamin only. Well, Amy, this is all very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of what we’re dealing with. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen, starting higher up and working my way down to the area where you feel the lump. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Certainly. Okay, I’m ready. And I will let you know if anything feels uncomfortable, absolutely. Just take your time, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm feeling some mild resistance in the lower abdomen, as you described. It feels approximately… 2 centimeters in diameter, somewhat firm, and doesn’t seem to be particularly mobile. There’s no tenderness to palpation at this time, which is good. The skin overlying the area is normal in color and temperature. I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes in the area. It appears to be located approximately… two inches above your pubic bone, and slightly to the left. It's difficult to say definitively what this is without further investigation, but it doesn’t immediately raise any red flags. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better look at it. That will help us rule out anything serious and determine the best course of action. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. A CT scan and blood work. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I trust your judgment completely, and I'm happy to do whatever you recommend. Will the CT scan require any… preparation? And when would I be able to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The CT scan will require you to drink a contrast dye beforehand – it helps to visualize the structures in your abdomen more clearly. The nurse will give you specific instructions on how much to drink and when. It's important to follow those instructions carefully. As for the results, it usually takes 24 to 48 hours for the radiologist to interpret the scan and send the report. I will review the results as soon as they are available and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That all sounds very clear, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you going through that so thoroughly. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just a little anxious, naturally, but I feel much better knowing we're taking steps to figure things out. Thank you again for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious in this situation, and I’m glad I could put your mind at ease a little. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions for the CT scan and schedule a follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s everything. Thank you so much for everything. I really appreciate your kindness and patience. I’ll see you when the results are in.
DOCTOR: Alright, you’re very welcome, Amy. Take care, and we’ll see you soon. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. .
