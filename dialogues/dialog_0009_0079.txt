DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…Courtnye is fine. Um, it’s my bruising. It’s been getting worse, even though I'm already on a blood thinner. It's kinda worrying me, to be honest. I don't really like going to doctors, so I figured I should get it checked before it gets really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Courtnye. I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked. Bruising that worsens despite being on a blood thinner is something we need to look into. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Sure. It's… everywhere, really. Like, I bumped my arm on the doorframe yesterday – just a little bump – and I’ve got a bruise the size of my hand now. And I keep finding new ones, even when I don’t remember hitting anything. My legs are the worst, I think. I noticed one on my stomach yesterday too. It’s just… a lot. It’s not painful, usually, just… visible. And it’s definitely more than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Bruising with minimal trauma, and new bruising appearing without a clear cause, are definitely things we need to investigate. Now, you mentioned you're already on a blood thinner. Do you mind telling me what blood thinner you’re taking, and why you were prescribed it?
PATIENT: Oh, um…let me think. It’s… Warfarin, I think? Yeah, Warfarin. The doctor back in town prescribed it after I had a blood clot in my leg a couple of years ago. Deep vein thrombosis, he called it. I've been on it ever since. I try to take it exactly as he said, but… sometimes I forget, to be honest. But I'm good about it most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin for a history of deep vein thrombosis. And you've been generally consistent with taking it, with occasional lapses. That's important information. Do you have your INR results handy, or do you know when the last time it was checked?
PATIENT: INR… oh, boy. No, I don’t have that with me. I get it checked at the lab every month, but I don't usually keep track of the numbers. The doctor back in town always tells me if it’s okay. I went last week, so it should be fine, I guess? But I don’t know the actual number, sorry. I’m really not good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Courtnye. We can certainly look up the results in the system here. Okay, I see your INR from last week was 1.8. That is… a little on the low side. A therapeutic range for Warfarin is generally between 2 and 3, so it seems your dosage might need adjusting. To get a better picture of what's going on, I'd like to ask you a few more questions. Have you noticed any bleeding elsewhere – nosebleeds, bleeding gums when you brush your teeth, blood in your urine or stool, or unusually heavy periods?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No nosebleeds, gums are fine, everything seems normal there. And… no, definitely not. Everything’s… pretty regular, I guess. Except for the bruising, of course. I haven't felt weak or anything either. Just… easily bruised, and it’s worrying me. It feels different than before, like it’s happening way too easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No other signs of bleeding, and no feeling of weakness. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Besides the DVT, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. And I've got a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s pretty much it. Nothing major, honestly. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I eat okay, try to walk when I can… just… this bruising is throwing me off. It's just not normal for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled hypertension and arthritis. That’s helpful. And you feel generally healthy otherwise. Now, are you taking any other medications besides the Warfarin and your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! I take a multivitamin every day. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. Like, just when they're really bad. Not every day, just when I need it. And that's it, I think. Oh, and I take a little bit of Tylenol sometimes for headaches. But that’s only now and then. It’s really not much, Doctor. Mostly just the vitamins and the blood thinner.
DOCTOR: Okay, so vitamins, Warfarin, blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and Tylenol occasionally for headaches. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. Okay. My mom had high blood pressure too, and she had a stroke a few years back. My dad… he had diabetes. And his side of the family… there’s a lot of arthritis, I think. My grandma had it really bad. Other than that… not much, really. Nothing about blood clots or anything like that. Mostly just the usual stuff, you know? High blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis… It’s not a very healthy family, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis. That’s good to know. Now, one last thing for now, before we do a quick physical exam. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched any of that. I don't like the taste of alcohol, and smoking is just… awful. I'm a pretty boring person, Doctor. I drink water and take my pills, that's about it. I’m ready if you want to check me out now, just to get this over with, if that's alright? I've got some errands to run later.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Courtnye. You’re not boring at all! It’s good to hear you prioritize your health. And I understand wanting to get this sorted out so you can get on with your day. Let’s go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at the bruising, mainly on your arms and legs. Just to get a better idea of what we’re dealing with. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I just want to make sure it's not something serious. Honestly, I'm starting to get a little worried, even though I try not to be. Let's just get on with it, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your concern, and we'll do our best to figure this out. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. The bruising is quite extensive, as you mentioned, and it appears to be at varying stages of healing. Some are newer, with a reddish-purple hue, while others are older and more yellowish-brown. There’s no significant tenderness to palpation, which is good. I'm not feeling any lumps or masses. Your pulses in both legs are strong and equal. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it seems we have a few possibilities to consider. The fact that you’re on Warfarin, and your INR was a little low last week, suggests that your blood thinner dosage may need adjusting. However, the extensive bruising warrants further investigation to rule out other causes. I'm going to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture. I want to check your complete blood count to see if you have any signs of anemia or other blood disorders. I’ll also check your coagulation studies again, to confirm your INR and assess other clotting factors. And I'm going to order a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, and get it fixed. I don't want this to get any worse. I'm starting to worry about falling or something, with all this bruising. Blood tests are fine. Do I need to do anything special before them? Like, fast or anything? I’m terrible with remembering that kind of stuff.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, Courtnye. We want to prevent any falls or complications. And yes, you'll need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We'll schedule them for tomorrow morning, so you can have dinner as usual tonight, and then nothing after that until after the tests. I’ll also write you a prescription for a topical cream – a vitamin K cream – to help with the bruising. It won’t solve the underlying problem, but it can help to speed up the healing process. I’ll also recommend you avoid any activities that could cause further injury, and be extra careful when you’re walking. While we wait for the results, if you experience any unusual bleeding – like nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your urine or stool, or heavy periods – or if you feel any weakness or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay, fasting, no food after dinner, vitamin K cream, and watch for bleeding. Got it. And go to the ER if anything weird happens. That's a lot to remember! No, I think that's everything. Just... when will I get the results? And when can I see you again, to talk about them? I really appreciate you taking the time to look at this, Doctor. It's just... worrying, you know? I'm not a fan of being sick or anything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to help you get to the bottom of this. The lab results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re available. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and decide on the best course of action. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week is fine. Whatever works. Just… please call as soon as you get them. I’d really appreciate it. I’m… kinda anxious about this, to be honest. I don't like waiting, and I don't like being sick. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Anything I forgot to mention? I just want to get everything right, so I don’t have to come back again anytime soon.
DOCTOR: You’ve done everything perfectly, Courtnye. You’ve provided all the necessary information, and you’re taking the right steps to address this. There’s nothing else you need to do right now. Just remember to fast before the blood tests tomorrow, and be mindful of any unusual bleeding. And please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Here’s the prescription for the vitamin K cream, and a sheet with instructions on how to apply it. I’ll see you next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, try not to worry too much, and remember that we’re here to help you every step of the way. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. Really. I appreciate your patience and your help. It's… a relief to finally be doing something about it. I’m gonna go get these tests done tomorrow. I’ll try not to stress too much. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. It was my pleasure. And you take care of yourself. Don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. We'll get this figured out.
