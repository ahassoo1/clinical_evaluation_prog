DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and kind of yellow. Like, my skin and eyes are a bit yellow, you know? It started a few days ago, and I think it might be something I ate. I had some fava beans... and then this happened. I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but it seemed to start right after.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, fava beans. My neighbor, she makes a wonderful stew with them, and I hadn’t had it in years, so I took a big bowl. It was lovely… until I started feeling unwell. I wasn't sure what was causing it, but then I remembered reading something… years ago… about fava beans and… well, something like this. Do you know what I mean? Is it possible something in them did this?
DOCTOR: It is possible. We’ll need to explore that further. Tell me, Ms. Haggar, have you ever had a reaction to anything before?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can recall, no. I mean, I have allergies – dust, pollen, things like that – but nothing… dramatic, like this. Just sneezing and a runny nose. Nothing with food, or that made me turn yellow! It’s a bit worrying, to be honest. I’m not usually one to get sick, and I definitely don't usually turn yellow.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm, this yellowing – is it in your skin and the whites of your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Both. It's not… bright yellow, exactly. More like a… a pale, sickly yellow. I noticed it when I was brushing my teeth this morning. My husband – well, my ex-husband, we're separated – he pointed it out too. He said I looked… unwell. He’s usually quite observant, so when he says something, it’s probably worth paying attention to.
DOCTOR: I see. And when did you say you ate the fava bean stew?
PATIENT: It was… let me think… it was last Tuesday, I believe. August 2nd, 2025. It was lunchtime, and I brought a bowl to work with me. I had a pretty big portion, maybe a bit too big now that I think about it. The symptoms started showing up maybe a couple of days later. Wednesday I felt a bit tired, but I just thought I was overworked. Then yesterday, it got worse, and this morning… well, that’s when I decided to come in.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Haggar. We need to do a quick physical exam, and then I'd like to order some blood work. The yellowing you’re describing – jaundice – can indicate a few different things, but given the timing with the fava beans, we need to check your liver function. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, then feel your abdomen. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. Liver function… yes, that makes sense. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Yes, I'll just relax. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. It’s a little strange, feeling so tired all the time, and this yellow color… it’s quite unnerving.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, abdomen. Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really… a little bit uncomfortable, maybe, but not pain. It feels… a bit bloated, perhaps? Like I’ve had a large meal, but I haven’t. And just… generally sensitive to the touch. It’s hard to explain. It's not a sharp pain, it’s just… a general feeling of fullness and sensitivity.
DOCTOR: Bloating and sensitivity… alright. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel – that includes liver function tests – and a bilirubin level. Also, let’s run a reticulocyte count, just to be thorough. That’ll give us a good starting point. Do you have any known allergies to contrast dye, should we need any imaging later on?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds very thorough, Doctor, thank you. No, I don’t think so. I’ve had a few scans in the past for a bad back, years ago, and I don’t remember any issues. No reactions, or anything like that. Just… back pain! I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I’ll double-check with my old medical records, just in case, if you like. I have them at home, somewhere.
DOCTOR: Good idea. While we're waiting for the results, try to stay hydrated and avoid any strenuous activity. We'll need to see what the bloodwork reveals before we can say anything definitively, but given your history and the symptoms, we’ll be looking closely at possibilities like hemolytic anemia. We may need a specialist consultation if the initial tests are concerning. Do you have a primary care physician we should forward these results to?
PATIENT: Oh my, that sounds… serious. Hemolytic anemia? Is that… bad? I haven't got a primary care physician, no. I usually just come to you when I have a problem. I'm not really one for regular check-ups, I'm afraid. Is it alright if we just keep everything here, then? You can let me know if you need anything else. And if it is something serious, I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll keep everything here. Let me explain hemolytic anemia briefly. It means your red blood cells are being destroyed faster than your body can make them. The fava beans could be the trigger, in a condition called G6PD deficiency. It's a genetic thing, and not everyone has it. The bloodwork will tell us if that’s a possibility. We'll take it one step at a time. The lab should have the results back within a few hours. I'll have someone call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, avoid fava beans and anything that might contain them. And just to be safe, let’s get a urine sample as well.
PATIENT: Oh, a urine sample, yes, of course. That makes sense. G6PD deficiency… it’s a bit overwhelming, all this new information! I've never even heard of it. So, it’s like… my body is attacking its own blood cells? And the fava beans just… started it off? Avoiding fava beans… that shouldn't be too hard, but they're in so many things, aren't they? Thank you for explaining it, Doctor. It's reassuring to know what we're looking for, even if it is a little scary. I’ll go and get a urine sample now. Is there anything specific I need to do?
DOCTOR: Just a standard sample, Ms. Haggar. There's a restroom down the hall with everything you'll need. Try to collect a mid-stream sample – that’s after you’ve been urinating for a few seconds. Bring it back to the nurse when you’re finished. We’ll review the results as soon as they’re available, and then we’ll have a better idea of what’s going on. Try not to worry too much. We're just gathering information at this point.
PATIENT: Okay, a mid-stream sample. I think I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. I'll go and do that now. You're right, it's best not to worry… easier said than done, of course! I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’ll see you soon, then.
