DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I need some papers signed, actually. Some health forms… for, uh… well, just some things. I don’t really understand all the fuss, to be honest, but they said I needed a doctor to verify them. Is this where I do that? I’d like to get this over with quickly if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, we can certainly do that. Forms…right. I see. It’s… becoming more common. Just need to verify your general health status. I’ll need to ask you a few questions, just to be thorough. It won’t take long, I promise. Let’s start with…can you tell me a little bit about why you need these forms completed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s for… a volunteer thing. I’m trying to help out at the community center, working with the kids. They need a health check, I guess, to make sure I'm not, you know, spreading anything around. It's nothing serious, I assure you. I'm pretty healthy for my age! Just want to get this paperwork done so I can start volunteering. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Community center…good for you. Alright. So, just to get a general picture… have you been feeling well lately?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just getting older, I suppose. No aches or pains, nothing that keeps me from doing what I need to do. I still get around pretty well! Though, my memory isn’t what it used to be…but I wouldn’t call that a health problem, exactly. More of an…inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Alright…and have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Well, my appetite’s been a little small lately. Not much of an eater, I guess. And… I think I might have lost a little weight, but I haven’t really been keeping track. Everything feels a little loose, if that makes sense? I mostly eat soup and things that don’t take a lot of effort to make. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. Small appetite, some weight loss…and feeling a bit loose. We should probably take a quick look at you, just to get a better picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I just want to get this paperwork done, honestly. I don’t want to make a big fuss. But yes, go ahead. Whatever you need. Quickly, if you could? I have a bridge game this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Quick exam. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Please, have a seat here on the table. And if you could just loosen your shirt… thank you. Let's start with your heart. Take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Oh, my. Alright, alright. Just a little drafty in here, isn’t it? Is everything alright? You don’t seem to be listening for very long… is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. That’s… adequate. Heart sounds are… within normal limits, though a little faint. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths, if you could. It's just a quick check, Melvenia. Lungs are clear. Now, if you wouldn't mind, just lie back for me. We'll just feel your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Careful now… my bones aren’t what they used to be. Just get it over with quickly, if you would. My bridge partners will be wondering where I am. This whole thing is very… unsettling, to be honest. I haven't been this exposed in years.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a gentle press… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh! A little… right there. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It’s been like that for a little while now, on and off. I just thought it was gas, to be honest. An old woman’s troubles, you know? Is it something serious? I really hope not.
DOCTOR: Alright…and what about here?
PATIENT: No, that's okay. That feels…normal. Just leave that spot alone, please. It's just…sensitive. Are you finding something wrong? I'm really not feeling well all of a sudden. This is making me nervous! Perhaps I should just go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, Melvenia. Just going to take a moment to review. You mentioned some weight loss, decreased appetite, discomfort in your lower right abdomen…and fatigue. Given your age and these symptoms… I'm going to want to order some blood work. Just a routine check to rule out anything serious. And I'd like to get a CT scan of your abdomen, just to get a clearer picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? Really? This is exactly what I was afraid of. A CT scan… that sounds…serious. Look, Doctor, is it something bad? Can you just tell me, straight out? I don't want to be running around getting tests if it's just a little gas or something. I'm an old woman, I don't want to be poked and prodded if it's not necessary. And… how much is all of this going to cost? Because, frankly, I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Melvenia. It’s…difficult to say definitively without the tests. But given the discomfort you're describing and the other symptoms, it’s best to rule out anything serious. The CT scan will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on in your abdomen. As for the cost… I'm aware you don't have insurance. I can speak with the billing department and see if we can work out a payment plan, or perhaps find a program to assist with the cost. I don’t want to alarm you, but it could be something like diverticulitis, or even… something more. That's why the tests are important. Do you agree to proceed with the blood work and CT scan?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Diverticulitis… I think my sister had that. It sounded awful. Alright. Fine. Do the tests. I suppose I don’t have much of a choice, do I? But please, Doctor, if it's nothing serious, promise me you won’t put me through anything unnecessary. And… about that payment plan? Can you really help me with that? I don’t have a lot of money, you know. I live on a fixed income. Just…please don’t let this bankrupt me. And when can I get this done? I really want to get back to my bridge game. This is all so stressful.
