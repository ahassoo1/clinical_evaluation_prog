DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. Please tell me, in as concise terms as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm... well, it's a bit… complicated for me to explain. My… friend, she wants a baby. And someone said I should come here, before… before it happens. For… checking things. It's about making sure everything is okay, yes? I don’t really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: "Making sure everything is okay…" Yes, well. It is best to be thorough. So, you’re seeking a pre-conception evaluation. You say your friend wishes to become pregnant… and you are here for… testing?
PATIENT: Testing, yes. That sounds right. I… I think so. It’s my… well, we both want this baby. It's just… I’m not the one… carrying it. Is that… clear? I don't want to be rude, but my head is a bit foggy these days.
DOCTOR: Right. A… partner evaluation. And you're experiencing some cognitive difficulties, it seems. Very well. To clarify – you are a male partner and want to ensure you are fit for procreation. Have you had any prior medical evaluations, specifically related to fertility, or anything at all, really?
PATIENT: Fit for… procreation? That's a big word, Doctor. I… I don't think so. I've been to the doctor for colds, maybe a broken arm when I was young, but nothing… special. Never anything about… this. I work sales, you see. Lots of travelling. Not much time for… checking things. I’m not even sure what they check for.
DOCTOR: Sales, you say. Frequent travel. Well, that explains the lack of consistent care, I suppose. We need to assess your overall health, and specifically, factors that may impact sperm quality and quantity. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms – pain, discharge, difficulty with urination, or any other concerns?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Nothing like that. Everything… works. I think. And no discharge. Just… tired a lot. Maybe. It’s hard to say. The travelling, you know? Different beds, different food… It plays with your body, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… plausible. Let’s move on. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat most things. Sometimes my nose gets a bit tickly with dust, but that's everyone, isn't it? No bad reactions to any medicines I’ve ever taken. Just the usual… headache from a cold.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to stay away from those things. I believe in letting the body… heal itself, when it can. Except for maybe a painkiller for a bad back now and then, but that's not… regular.
DOCTOR: Right. Very well. Now, have you had any prior surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. When I was a boy, I had my tonsils out. That's about it, I believe. A very long time ago. And… oh! I broke my arm when I was maybe eight. They put a cast on it. Was that a surgery? I don’t really remember. It was so long ago.
DOCTOR: The tonsils, yes. The cast isn't considered surgery. Now, tell me about your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a hard one. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. Died when I was young. My mother, she lived a long life, but she was always… frail. Lots of coughs and colds. I don't remember any big illnesses, like… cancer or anything. We didn’t talk much about those things, you see. It was a different time.
DOCTOR: Heart disease in the father. Okay. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work hard. Travel a lot, like I said. I try to eat okay when I can, but it's hard on the road. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I stopped. Maybe twenty years ago. And I… used to drink, but not much these days. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Previous smoking, occasional alcohol. Alright. Now, for the sake of completeness, and to avoid any… complications, we need to conduct a brief physical examination. And perhaps some basic lab work. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to make sure everything is okay for… for the baby. A physical examination, yes. And the lab work. I hope it doesn't take too long, I have a flight on Thursday.
DOCTOR: We will be as efficient as possible. Please, if you could step over to the examination table and lie down. I will begin with auscultation of the heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, slightly muffled. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/85. Pulse is 78 and regular. Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, we will need a semen analysis. I'll give you instructions for collection.
PATIENT: A semen analysis? Oh. That… sounds complicated. Where do I… how do I…? And what are they looking for exactly? I hope it's not too embarrassing.
DOCTOR: The laboratory will provide you with a sterile container and detailed instructions. It simply involves providing a sample. They are assessing sperm count, motility, and morphology. It's a standard test. The nurse will explain the process in detail. Now, do you have any other questions for me before I write up the requisition for the analysis?
PATIENT: Morphology? Is that… like, the shape? I don’t… I don’t think I've ever thought about the shape of… them. And the nurse will explain? Good. Because I’m not sure I understand all this medical talk. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. Just… please make sure everything is okay. For the baby.
DOCTOR: The nurse will guide you through everything. I'll have her provide you with these instructions and the requisition form. We’ll review the results once they’re available. Until then, I suggest you focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. And please, try not to overthink it. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all. Thank you for your time. And thank you for… explaining everything. I will go and see the nurse now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Stop.
