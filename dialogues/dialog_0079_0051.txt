DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 79 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, seventy-nine, that sounds right. Let me see… well, my niece, she said I should come. Something about… blood? She worries, you see. I think she wants to know what kind of blood I have. It's a bit silly, really, but she's a good girl. I don't recall needing to know that before, not ever.
DOCTOR: I see. Your niece is concerned about… the type of blood you have?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! She said it’s… important, just in case. I work with ropes, you know? Big ropes, for… things. It’s a bit dangerous, I suppose, though I’ve been doing it for… well, a long time. A very long time. Do you need to know why she wants to know? I honestly can't remember what she said exactly. It was over tea, and I get lost in my thoughts, you see.
DOCTOR: While it's good your niece is proactive, determining your blood type isn't typically a routine matter unless you're experiencing a medical issue or anticipating a need for transfusion. However, since she's concerned, and you mention working with ropes… is there any history of injury while working with them?
PATIENT: Oh, injuries… well, little scrapes and bruises, of course. Nothing serious, not in… decades. A few falls, maybe. But nothing that needed… blood, I don’t think. I always patched myself up. My husband, he was a sailor, you see, and taught me all sorts of knots and… first aid. A very practical man. He's… gone now, though. A long time ago. I suppose it's good to be sure, if you ask me. It's better to know, isn't it? Even if I can’t quite recall why my niece is so worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. And to be clear, you haven’t experienced any recent bleeding that was difficult to stop, any unusual bruising, or felt excessively fatigued?
PATIENT: Fatigue… well, I get tired, of course. I’m seventy-nine, Doctor! But no more than usual, I don’t think. And bruising… hmm. I bumped my arm on the doorframe yesterday, I think, but it’s hardly noticeable. Just a little colour. Nothing… alarming. Honestly, it all seems a bit much, doesn't it? My niece, she does worry so. I just want to be polite and get it over with. Is it a long procedure?
DOCTOR: Very well. It sounds like we can proceed with a standard blood draw to assess your overall health and, if you wish, determine your blood type. It’s a quick procedure, Ms. Nini, just a small sample taken from your arm. We’ll also review your medical history to get a better understanding of your general wellbeing. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials we should be aware of before we begin?
PATIENT: Latex… hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t think so. I used to wear gloves, but… a long time ago. I can't recall if they were latex. My husband, he was allergic to… shellfish, I believe. But I don’t have any allergies myself, not that I’m aware of. I do get a bit itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just the weather. Is it very painful? I don't like needles, you see. Not at all.
DOCTOR: It’s a very brief pinch, Ms. Nini. Most people find it tolerable. We use a small needle, and it’s over quickly. We can also apply a topical numbing cream if you'd prefer, though it would require a short waiting period before the blood draw. Perhaps we can start with just a basic check of your blood count, and we can add the blood type later if you feel comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you, Doctor. A numbing cream… that sounds good, actually. A very short waiting period, you say? I don’t want to be here all day. And yes, a basic check sounds sensible. If it’s not too much trouble. I just want to make my niece happy. She means well, even if she does fuss over nothing. So, yes, the cream would be lovely. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's get that applied. The nurse will be in shortly to prepare your arm and apply the cream. It will take about 15-20 minutes to take effect. While we wait, perhaps you could tell me a bit about your current medications, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… Let me see… just a little something for my joints, sometimes. They ache, you know? Especially in the cold. It’s a small white pill. I get it from the pharmacy. Can’t recall the name, though. And sometimes, a little something for sleeping. But not every night. Just when I can’t… quiet my mind. It’s a small blue one. That’s all I think. Nothing… serious. My niece manages most of it, you see. She keeps track of everything. I just take what she gives me. She's very organized.
DOCTOR: I see. It would be helpful to have a list of those medications, if possible, to ensure there are no interactions. Perhaps your niece could provide that information at a later time?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. She has a list. Everything is written down. She keeps it in her… folder. A very sensible girl. She’ll bring it next time, I’m sure. She's very good with details, my niece. Much better than me, that’s for certain. I tend to… misplace things. And forget names. And dates. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see. Is it alright if she brings it then? I don’t want to bother her now. She's busy, you know. A very important job.
DOCTOR: That would be perfectly acceptable, Ms. Nini. We'll just focus on getting the blood draw done for now. The nurse should be with you shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any concerns you have?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just the blood draw. And perhaps the cream. And my niece bringing the list. It’s a very nice room, you have. All… clean and bright. It makes me feel… safe. I don’t like hospitals, you see. Too many… beeping noises. And people in white coats. But you seem very kind. And patient. That's important. So, no, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Nini. We'll take good care of you. I'll let the nurse know you're ready.
