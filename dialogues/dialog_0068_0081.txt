DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailia. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sham. It is… concerning, frankly. I have been losing weight, despite maintaining what I believe is a perfectly reasonable diet. And, on top of that, I wake up soaked nearly every night. It’s quite… disruptive. I assure you, my lifestyle is very orderly.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss and night sweats… disruptive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, disruptive is putting it mildly. It affects my entire schedule. And it’s… unseemly, to be perfectly honest. One expects a certain level of… control. I do have private insurance, if that is relevant. I find it best to have all matters properly arranged.
DOCTOR: Yes, insurance is good. And I understand wanting things orderly. Hmm… How long has this weight loss been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Approximately three months, Doctor. It began rather subtly, but has become increasingly noticeable. I initially attributed it to stress, though I maintain a very calm demeanor. I assure you, I do not appear stressed. It's just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Three months… And how much weight would you estimate you've lost?
PATIENT: Approximately seven kilograms, Doctor. Perhaps more. I haven’t been precisely measuring, naturally. One doesn't dwell on such… unpleasant details. It’s simply… less. I used to require alterations to my clothing, and now… they fit quite loosely. It is rather alarming, when one considers it.
DOCTOR: Seven kilograms… and the night sweats – are they every night, or just frequently?
PATIENT: Almost every night, Doctor. It's quite… thorough. The bedding is completely saturated. It requires significant laundering, which is… a disruption, as I mentioned. And, frankly, a bit undignified. I find it difficult to discuss, but I assure you it is not a matter of… insufficient hygiene.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the weight loss and night sweats, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. There is a… a general fatigue. I find myself requiring more rest than usual. I maintain a very active schedule, you understand, so it is… problematic. And a slight… discomfort, occasionally, in my chest. Nothing severe, but… noticeable. I do not believe it warrants extensive investigation, but I felt it prudent to mention it.
DOCTOR: Chest discomfort… How would you describe that discomfort?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to articulate. A sort of… tightness, really. Not a pain, precisely. More of a… pressure. It comes and goes. I find that deep breathing exercises alleviate it somewhat, but it does return. I assure you, I am quite vigilant about my health. I do not ignore such things. It’s simply… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, cough, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None of those. No fever, no chills, no cough. My bowel habits are… regular. Perfectly regular, I assure you. I maintain a very disciplined lifestyle, so such disruptions are… unlikely. I do occasionally experience a slight… lack of appetite, but that is likely connected to the weight loss, is it not? It’s all rather… interconnected, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Just a routine check.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must admit, I find such examinations… unnecessary. I assure you, my physique is perfectly sound. However, if it is standard procedure, I suppose I have no objection. Just… please be gentle. I have a rather sensitive constitution. And do ensure your hands are thoroughly sanitized.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly… distant. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some subtle… diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. No acute tenderness, but some… slight resistance. Your lymph nodes feel… normal.
PATIENT: Resistance, you say? That is… concerning. I assure you, I do not engage in any… strenuous activities that would cause such a thing. Perhaps it is simply… muscle tone? Though I maintain a very trim figure, it is not… robust. Is this a matter of serious concern, Doctor? Because I have a rather important engagement next week, and I cannot afford to be… incapacitated.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively. The diminished breath sounds and slight abdominal resistance… it could be a number of things. Given your weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue, I'd like to order some blood work and a chest X-ray. Just to rule things out. It's a precaution, really. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and a few other markers. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable? I suppose so. Though I do find it… rather excessive. All this poking and prodding and… blood work. However, if it is necessary to… allay my anxieties, then I acquiesce. But please, Doctor, ensure the laboratory is reputable. I do not wish to contract any… unsavory ailments. And do let me know the results promptly. My schedule is quite… demanding.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll order the tests from a highly reputable lab. And I’ll have the results sent to you as soon as they’re available – usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, if you experience any shortness of breath, fever, or severe chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Perfectly. Emergency room, you say? That is… reassuring, I suppose. Though I highly doubt such a situation will arise. I maintain a very… controlled environment. And I expect a detailed report, Doctor. Not merely a list of numbers, but a comprehensive explanation. I assure you, I am quite… discerning. And I would appreciate it if the results were sent electronically, if possible. My assistant manages my correspondence.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll ensure the results are sent electronically with a detailed explanation. And again, if anything changes, please don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. I’ll have my assistant coordinate the details with yours. Alright. I believe that covers everything for today. Thank you for coming in.
