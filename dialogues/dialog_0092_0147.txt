DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been noticing a lump, lower down in my stomach… it’s been bothering me a bit, so I thought I should get it checked out. It’s not really painful, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you describe the lump a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It feels… firm, not squishy. And maybe the size of a plum? It’s hard to say exactly, but definitely noticeable when I lie down. I first noticed it, oh, maybe a month or so ago? It hasn't grown a lot, but it hasn't gone away either.
DOCTOR: Alright, a firm lump about the size of a plum, noticed roughly a month ago, and hasn’t significantly changed in size. That’s helpful. And you mentioned it’s more noticeable when you lie down – is that because it becomes more prominent, or is it easier to feel at that time?
PATIENT: Easier to feel, I think. When I’m standing or moving around, I don’t really notice it. But if I’m lying flat on my back, it’s definitely more… present. It doesn’t hurt to lie down, though. It just… feels bigger, I guess, because there’s nothing else distracting me.
DOCTOR: Okay, it becomes more noticeable when lying down due to less distraction. Good to know. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with noticing this lump?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. No pain, like I said. No fever, no changes in my bowel habits… nothing like that. My appetite’s been normal, and I haven’t lost any weight, as far as I can tell. I have been a bit more tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t these days? It’s hard to say if that’s related.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mr. Raghunathan. No pain, fever, changes in bowel habits, normal appetite and weight, and just a general feeling of tiredness. Let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any current medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I don’t have diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything like that. My wife keeps telling me to get more exercise, but other than that, I’m in good shape, I think. I do have Medicare, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No major medical conditions and generally healthy. And thank you for letting me know about your Medicare coverage, that is helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. And I haven’t been hospitalized since I was a child – a bad case of pneumonia when I was little, but that was a long time ago. Nothing since then, thankfully. I try to avoid hospitals if I can, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Raghunathan. No surgeries or hospitalizations since childhood. Now, could you tell me a little about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had some heart trouble when she was older, and my father had… I think it was high cholesterol. Nothing major, as far as I know. My wife’s side of the family is pretty healthy, mostly. Her mother lived to be ninety, which is good. No history of cancer that I’m aware of on either side, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble and high cholesterol, but no known cancer. That’s good to know. And just to complete the picture, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m married, as I mentioned. We’ve been married for fifteen years. I work as a choreographer – I teach dance classes and put on performances. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I used to be more active, but with work, it's been harder to find the time lately. I don’t use any recreational drugs.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Raghunathan. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything. No reactions to any medications I’ve taken in the past – just the usual mild side effects, like a little drowsiness. My wife always checks when she gives me anything, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s a very thorough history, Mr. Raghunathan. Thank you for providing all of that information. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I hope it won’t be too uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, Mr. Raghunathan, if you could lie down on your back for me, please. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently palpate your abdomen to feel for the lump and assess its characteristics. I will let you know what I am doing as I go. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. Okay, I can feel a firm mass in your lower abdomen, about the size of a plum, as you described. It's not particularly tender to the touch, and it seems to move freely. It is approximately 3x3 centimeters in size. Do you feel any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt, Doctor. It just… feels like something’s there. Like a solid lump, but not painful. It’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it’s good to know you can feel it too. It’s not my imagination, then?
DOCTOR: No, it’s definitely not your imagination, Mr. Raghunathan. I can feel it clearly. Based on the physical exam, the lump is firm, mobile, and approximately 3x3 cm in size. It’s located in the lower left quadrant of your abdomen. Given the location and characteristics, several possibilities could be responsible, but further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause. To help us narrow down the possibilities, I would like to order some laboratory tests and potentially an imaging study. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. What kind of tests are we talking about? And an imaging study… like an X-ray? I confess, I'm a bit nervous about all of this. But I'd rather know what's going on than worry about it endlessly.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mr. Raghunathan. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when facing the unknown. We will proceed cautiously and methodically. I would like to order a Complete Blood Count to look for any signs of infection or inflammation. We’ll also do a Basic Metabolic Panel to check your kidney and liver function. For the imaging study, an X-ray isn’t the most helpful in this situation. I recommend an abdominal ultrasound. It’s non-invasive, doesn’t use radiation, and provides detailed images of the soft tissues in your abdomen. It will help us visualize the lump and determine its characteristics more precisely. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better than an X-ray, honestly. Ultrasound sounds fine. And the blood tests too, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. When can I get these done? And will I need to come back to discuss the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the orders for the CBC and BMP, and the requisition for the ultrasound. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the blood samples right away. As for the ultrasound, we can schedule it at the imaging center across town. I’ll have the receptionist schedule it for you before you leave, aiming for sometime within the next few days. Once the results are available, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and determine the next steps. I anticipate having the results back within 3-5 business days. Does that timeline work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. 3-5 days is fine. And scheduling the ultrasound now is very helpful. I appreciate you taking care of everything. I suppose I should head to the lab now, then? And just to be sure, the receptionist will have everything I need for the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Raghunathan, that is correct. Please head to the lab, and they will take care of the blood samples. The receptionist will provide you with the requisition form for the ultrasound and all the necessary instructions. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We'll be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment once the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as pain, fever, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits – please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a lot better knowing we have a plan. I’ll head to the lab now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any further questions. Have a good day, and we'll be in touch soon.
