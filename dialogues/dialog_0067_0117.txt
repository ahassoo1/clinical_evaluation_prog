DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good mornin’. Doc, right? Yeah... I been coughin’. Not just any cough, though. There's... stuff. Red stuff. When I cough it up. I smoke, you see. Been smokin' a long time. That got somethin' to do with it, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Reyno. Coughing up red stuff is definitely something we need to look into. And yes, smoking is a very important piece of information. Just pulling up your chart now… So, you've been coughing, and this cough is producing blood – is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Blood. Not a lot each time, but... enough to worry me. Honestly, I don't remember when it started, exactly. Coulda been a week ago, maybe more. Things kinda blur, ya know? I just noticed it and figured I should get it checked.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to have it looked at. It is important to figure out the cause. And it's not uncommon to not remember exact dates, especially when you're dealing with something ongoing. So, about a week or more of coughing up blood… Has the amount of blood changed at all over that time – gotten more, less, or stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Hmm... I think... maybe a little more now than when it first started. Not a huge difference, but... yeah. A little more. And it feels... rougher, if that makes sense. Like it’s really comin’ from deep down. I don’t know. I ain’t a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. "Rougher" and coming from deep down… And the slight increase in amount. Do you have any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Not really. I get tired easy, but I always have. And… sometimes a little short of breath, but I figure that’s the smokin’ too. Can’t really remember anything else… Is there somethin’ I should be lookin’ for?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and shortness of breath. Those are good things to mention, even if you suspect they're related to smoking. And it’s good you’re asking what to look for. We'll get to that. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more general questions, just to get a better overall picture of your health. Have you had a fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… Nah, I don’t think so. Not that I noticed. I get kinda cold sometimes, but that's just bein' old, I guess. No sweats, no nothin’ like that. I sleep pretty good, actually. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or night sweats. Good. And you sleep well for the most part. Now, have you had any chest pain with the cough, or at any other time?
PATIENT: Chest pain… Sometimes. Not like a sharp pain, more like… a tightness. When I cough real hard, it kinda hurts. But it doesn't last long. Like a pulled muscle, maybe? I dunno. I ain’t been doin’ much heavy liftin’ lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness in your chest with coughing, feeling like a pulled muscle. And it doesn’t last long. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… Doc told me somethin’ about that, years ago. Said I needed to watch my salt. But I forget to take the pills sometimes. Everything else… not that I know of. I don’t go to the doctor much. Mostly just when somethin’ really bothers me. Like this cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure that you’ve been told about, and sometimes forgetting to take your medication. And you don't have any other known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. That’s all I can really remember. No big surgeries, nothin’ like that. I mostly just stay outta trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, but no significant surgeries. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Sometimes my skin gets itchy when I’m around cats, but that’s just cats, ya know? Never had a bad reaction to any pills, not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, other than the blood pressure pills you sometimes forget?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. Like I said, I ain't too good at rememberin' 'em. I mostly just take somethin' for my arthritis when it's really bad. Over the counter stuff. Is that all you need to know? I wanna get this cough figured out.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication inconsistently and over-the-counter arthritis medication as needed. Thank you for that information, Mr. Reyno. That gives me a good picture of your medical background. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and then I'll do a quick physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Just get this cough checked out. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. If you could please take a deep breath in and out for me… I’m listening to your lungs now. Okay… and now I'm going to listen to your heart. I hear some wheezing in your lungs, and your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. I’m going to palpate your lymph nodes now. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged. I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is good. Now, I’m going to check your throat. Open your mouth and say “Ah.” Your throat is a little red, but no obvious lesions. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Okay. Wheezin’, huh? I figured somethin' was up. Is that bad? What’s next, Doc? I'm kinda anxious now.
DOCTOR: The wheezing can be a sign of several things, Mr. Reyno, and it’s good we’re looking into it. It often indicates inflammation or narrowing in the airways. It's good we're checking it out. Given your history of smoking, the red-tinged cough, and the wheezing I heard, I want to get a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. This will help us rule out any serious causes and see if there's any infection or other problems. Would you be able to get that done today?
PATIENT: X-ray, huh? I guess so. If you think it's necessary. I don't like radiation, but… I wanna know what's goin’ on. Where do I go? Is it here?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's best to get it done. The X-ray machine is just down the hall, in the radiology department. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and give you the paperwork and directions. She'll walk you down and make sure you get checked in. It’s a quick procedure. While we're waiting for the X-ray results, I'm going to order a sputum culture. This involves collecting a sample of the mucus you cough up, and it can help us identify any bacteria or other organisms that might be causing the infection. Sarah can also explain how to collect that sample. “Sarah, could you please come in here for a moment?
PATIENT: Okay. Sputum culture… sounds kinda gross. But I’ll do whatever you need me to do, Doc. Hopefully it won’t take too long. I got things to do, ya know? But I appreciate you lookin’ into this.
DOCTOR: “Hi Mr. Reyno, Dr. Pfennig has ordered an X-ray and a sputum culture. I'll walk you down to radiology now for the X-ray. I'll also explain how to collect the sputum sample. It's best to do it first thing in the morning, when you've had a good cough. Here's a pamphlet with detailed instructions. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Morning, huh? First thing… alright. I can do that. What if I can't cough nothin' up? I sometimes have dry spells. Will that mess things up?
DOCTOR: “That's a good question, Mr. Reyno. If you have trouble coughing up a sample, just let the radiology technician know. They can use a nebulizer to help loosen up the mucus. Don't force it. And if you still can't get a sample, we can try again another time. It's not the end of the world. Let's just focus on getting the X-ray done first. Do you need me to walk you down now?
