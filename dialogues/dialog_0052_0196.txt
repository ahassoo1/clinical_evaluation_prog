DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 52 years of age. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, 52... feels older some days. Well, honestly? Just... tired. Really, really tired. It's been going on for… a while now. I don’t really keep track of things like that anymore. It just is. It's hard to do things, even simple things.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Tired" can mean a lot of different things, Ms. Licano, and it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. When you say it’s been going on for “a while,” could you estimate roughly how long – weeks, months, or even longer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months, definitely months. Maybe… a year? It all blurs together, you know? My husband… he used to keep track of everything. Since he's gone… time just sort of… happens. Is that a good answer?
DOCTOR: That is a very good answer, Ms. Licano. It's completely understandable that it's difficult to keep track when you've experienced such a loss. A year is helpful. And when you say "tired," is that a physical tiredness – feeling weak or exhausted even with rest?
PATIENT: Yes, that part, definitely. Even after a full night, I still feel like I haven't slept. But… it's more than that, too. Like… everything is just… heavy. Hard to explain. Makes it hard to even want to do things. I used to love gardening, but now... I just look at the yard and feel overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a combination of physical fatigue and a feeling of… heaviness, and a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. That's very helpful. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and feeling of being overwhelmed?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! My joints ache. Not all the time, but often enough to notice. And… sometimes my head feels a little foggy. Like I'm trying to see through a cloud. I don't get sick very often, though. No fevers or anything.
DOCTOR: Joint aches and a feeling of fogginess… alright. And you mentioned not getting sick often, which is good. Are these joint aches present in any particular joints – hands, knees, hips, etc.?
PATIENT: Mostly my hands and knees. Makes it hard to get up and down, you know? And open jars. Silly things, really. My knees bother me more in the mornings, especially if it's been raining. I don't know if that matters.
DOCTOR: That's very relevant, Ms. Licano. The pattern of pain in your hands and knees, and the association with rainy weather, gives us some additional information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That's a good question. My husband handled all that paperwork. I… I think the doctor said something about my cholesterol being a little high once? But I don’t take anything for it. And… maybe some aches and pains, but nothing serious enough to do anything about. I have Medicare, so they check things regularly, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, some past mention of high cholesterol. And regular check-ups with Medicare are helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. Yes, I had my gallbladder out… a long time ago. Maybe… twenty years? More? And I was in the hospital briefly when I broke my wrist a few years back… tripped over the cat. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal and a wrist fracture. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, or any other illnesses that are common?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That's a sad story. My mother had… something with her heart. I don't remember the details, it was a long time ago. And my brother… he had cancer. Lung cancer, I think. He passed away several years ago.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your mother and brother, Ms. Licano. That must have been difficult. Knowing that family history is important. Now, let’s talk a bit about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband always said it was a terrible habit. I've never even tried a cigarette. I do… enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just one, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, just one glass of wine with dinner. And do you do any regular exercise or physical activity?
PATIENT: Exercise? Not really. I used to enjoy walking in the garden, but… like I said, it’s hard to get motivated these days. Mostly, I just take it easy. Read a bit, watch TV.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, just the basic one. And… occasionally, I’ll take something for my aches and pains, like ibuprofen. But not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or insect stings?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I get a few mosquito bites in the summer, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Ms. Licano. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel… better. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you wouldn't mind, please sit back on the examination table. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your joints and reflexes. It won’t take long. Heart rate is regular, approximately 72 beats per minute. No murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, although slightly diminished at the bases. Mild tenderness to palpation of both knees, particularly on the medial joint line. No significant swelling or warmth appreciated. Range of motion is slightly limited due to discomfort. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Mild tenderness to palpation of the metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands. No significant swelling appreciated. Alright, Ms. Licano. Based on what you’ve told me and the results of the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing fatigue, joint pain, and some difficulty with range of motion. These symptoms could be caused by a number of things.
PATIENT: A number of things? What kind of things? Is it… serious? I just want to know what’s going on, and what we can do to make me feel less tired.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ms. Licano. "A number of things" is broad, and I want to be as specific as possible. Given your age, symptoms, and family history, some possibilities include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or even a vitamin deficiency contributing to fatigue. We also need to rule out other potential causes. It's not necessarily serious, but it does require investigation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will check your vitamin levels , inflammatory markers, and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infections. I would also like to order X-rays of your hands and knees to assess the degree of joint damage. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and X-rays… It sounds like a lot. But… if it will help, I suppose. I just… I don't like needles. And I worry about what the X-rays will show. Are you sure it's necessary?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension, Ms. Licano. No one enjoys needles, and it’s natural to be anxious about the results of any test. However, these tests are the best way to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. We can discuss strategies to make the blood draw more comfortable if you'd like, such as applying a topical anesthetic beforehand. The X-rays will allow us to visualize the structure of your joints and assess the extent of any arthritis. Knowing this information is crucial for guiding your care. If the blood tests and X-rays are inconclusive, we may need to consider a referral to a rheumatologist – a specialist in joint diseases – for further evaluation. Would you like me to go ahead and order those tests for you?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, go ahead. Order the tests. Whatever it takes to figure out what's wrong. Just… please, try to make the blood draw as quick and painless as possible. And… explain everything to me clearly, Doctor. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Licano. I promise to explain everything to you clearly and keep you informed every step of the way. We’ll have the lab technician use a small needle and take a minimal amount of blood. I'll also write down specific instructions for you on how to prepare for the blood draw and what to expect afterward. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, vitamin D and B12 levels, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to check for inflammation. I’m also requesting X-rays of both hands and knees. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood draw, and you can schedule the X-rays at your convenience. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a personalized treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding activities that exacerbate your joint pain. Would you like a written summary of these recommendations?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A written summary would be very helpful. I tend to forget things easily, you know? It's good to have something to refer back to. Thank you, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Licano. Here you go. This includes information about managing your fatigue, protecting your joints, and a list of the tests we’ve ordered. It’s important to remember that feeling tired and experiencing joint pain isn’t normal, and you deserve to feel your best. We’re going to work together to figure out what's going on and develop a plan to help you regain your energy and comfort. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. Just… thank you for listening to me, Doctor. It's been a long time since someone really listened. I suppose… I'll see you when the results are back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Licano. I’m glad I could listen. You’ll receive a call from the lab to schedule your blood draw, and once the results are back – typically within a week – my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns. We are here to support you. Have a good day, Ms. Licano. And remember, we’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: .
