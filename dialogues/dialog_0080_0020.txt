DOCTOR: Hi Avril, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. My name is Avril Benites. I am here for… a check-up, I think? The lady on the phone said it was a telehealth visit, but I am here in person now. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right to ask. There seems to have been a bit of a mix-up with scheduling – it was originally booked as a telehealth visit, but we have you here in person today, which is perfectly fine. We can absolutely do a full check-up. So, tell me – besides the scheduling issue – is there anything specific you were hoping to address during this visit?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my back has been… not so good lately. It is a little sore, mostly when I am… bending. I work with cars, you see. Mechanic. It could be from that, I suppose. And my knees, they ache sometimes too. But I am old! Maybe that is just getting old. I do not know. Is that what you want to know? What is bothering me?
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain and some knee aches – and you’re a mechanic, so that gives us a good starting point. "Mostly when bending," you said. Can you describe the pain in your back?
PATIENT: Yes, mechanic for… oh, many years now. Thirty, maybe more. The back pain… it is not sharp. More of a dull ache, you understand? And it feels… stiff. Especially in the mornings. Like I need to… work it loose. It is better when I move around, but bending is difficult. Picking things up… that is when it hurts the most, I think. Not every time, but often.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, stiffness in the mornings improving with movement, and worsened with bending and lifting. That's helpful. And where exactly in your back are you feeling this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… low. Lower back, near the… the small of my back. Not up high, more… here. It is hard to explain. Not on the sides, but right in the middle, near where my spine is. Sometimes it feels like it goes… around a little. But mostly it is in the middle, low part.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, midline pain, sometimes radiating around a bit. Do you have any pain that goes down your legs at all?
PATIENT: Down my legs? No, not really. Sometimes a little… tightness in my hips, but not pain. It is… hard to explain. Not shooting pain, like… like I have heard people talk about. Just a little stiff, like they need stretching. My legs are okay mostly. It is the back and knees that bother me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no radiating pain down the legs, just some tightness in the hips. Let’s talk about those knees. How long have you been having knee pain, and what makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: The knees… oh, for a long time. A few years, I think. Maybe longer. They ache after I am on them for too long, you see. Like when I am working under a car. Or if I climb stairs. That makes them sore. Sitting and resting… that helps. And sometimes, if I take a warm bath, it feels better. But it comes and goes. It is not always bad, but it is always… there, a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so both your back and knees are aggravated by activity and relieved with rest, and warmth seems to help the knees. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm. Other symptoms… let me think. I have been a little… tired lately, maybe? But I am old, Doctor. Everyone gets tired, yes? And sometimes my hands feel a little stiff in the mornings, but I do a lot with my hands. Working with cars. I am not sure if that is something to worry about. I do not have any… fever or anything like that. Just the back, the knees, and a little tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little fatigue and some morning hand stiffness, no fever. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: I don’t think so. Maybe a little, but not much. It is hard to say. I eat mostly the same. I do not feel like I have gained or lost a lot of weight. I am… a big woman, always have been. But I have not noticed a change recently. Perhaps a few pounds, but nothing significant. I try to eat healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask some routine questions about your medical history, if that's okay. First, do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: That is okay. Allergies… hmm. No, I do not think so. Not that I know of. I can take most medicines. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy with certain creams, but that is all. Nothing serious. I have never had a bad reaction to anything, that I remember. No, no allergies. I do not think so.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I take a little bit of something for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me, a few years ago. Small white pill. I do not remember the name, I am sorry. And sometimes, when my knees are really bad, I take something for the pain. Ibuprofen, I think? The kind you can buy at the store. But I do not take it often. That is all. Just the blood pressure pill and sometimes the ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a blood pressure medication and ibuprofen as needed. Do you know the dosage of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I do not. I have the bottle at home, I am sure. But I do not remember. It is a small one, and I take it every day. The doctor told me how much, but I… I forget. I am sorry. I do not have a good memory for numbers, you see. I can tell you what it looks like, but not how much to take. It is a small, white pill, like I said.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we can look that up later. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm. Surgeries… let me think. Yes. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Many years ago. And I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but that was so long ago, I barely remember it. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. No major hospital stays, no. Just the gallbladder and the arm, when I was small. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a broken arm as a child. And finally, is there any family history of medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that is a difficult one. My mother… she had some problems with her heart, I think. But she did not go to the doctor much. And my father… he smoked a lot, and he got sick, but I do not know what with. My brother… he has arthritis in his hands, I think. But that is all I really know. They did not talk about these things much, you see. Old family. We did not go to the doctor often. So, I do not have much information for you, I am sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, it's common for family history information to be limited. We can work with what you have. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your back and knees. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now I’m going to check your reflexes… Please relax your arms… Those are normal as well. Now, let's take a look at your back. Could you please bend forward gently, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Okay. Ouch. It is a little… stiff. Not too bad, but I can feel it. It is better when I bend slowly, but still… a little ache. Is that what you want to see?
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some mild tenderness along your lower spine here. And there is some tightness in the muscles on either side. It doesn't seem to be anything structural, like a fracture or dislocation. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please sit on the examination table and let me bend and straighten them?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Be careful, Doctor, they are a little… creaky. See? They make a noise. And it is a little… uncomfortable. Not a sharp pain, but a dull ache. Especially when I bend them all the way.
DOCTOR: Okay, I can feel some crepitus – that’s the grinding sensation you’re feeling – and there’s some mild tenderness on the inside of both knees. There’s no significant swelling or warmth. Your range of motion is a bit limited, but not severely. So, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you have some mild lower back strain and osteoarthritis in both knees. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, especially as we get older. It’s basically wear and tear on the joints. It can cause pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. The back strain is likely related to your work as a mechanic – all the bending and lifting.
PATIENT: Osteo… what did you call it? Wear and tear? That sounds about right, working with cars all these years. Is it… bad? Will I need surgery? I am not a fan of surgery, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis, yes. It's very common. And thankfully, most cases of osteoarthritis don't require surgery. We can manage the symptoms with a combination of things. Surgery is usually reserved for more severe cases, when other treatments aren't working. For you, I recommend starting with some simple measures: over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen when you have pain, regular gentle exercise to strengthen the muscles around your back and knees, and maintaining a healthy weight. We can also discuss some physical therapy exercises that can help improve your range of motion and flexibility. Do you think you would be interested in physical therapy?
PATIENT: I think I could try that. Physical therapy… Yes. I have heard good things. Strengthening the muscles… That makes sense. I suppose I should try to move more, even when it hurts. Ibuprofen I can do. I have that at home. What about my back? Is there anything special I can do for that besides the exercise? It is hard to move without making it worse sometimes.
DOCTOR: For your back, in addition to the exercise, it’s important to practice good body mechanics – that means bending your knees and keeping your back straight when you lift things, avoiding twisting motions, and taking frequent breaks to stretch. A warm compress or a heating pad can also help relieve pain and stiffness. We can also talk about some over-the-counter muscle relaxants, but I usually recommend trying the other methods first. I also want to rule out anything more serious, so I'm going to order some X-rays of your lower back and knees. This will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out any fractures or other problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-rays… Yes, that is probably a good idea. Better to be safe. Fractures… I do not think I have a fracture, but it is good to check. I am always careful, but accidents happen. Yes, let us do the X-rays. Will they… will they hurt? And how long will I have to wait?
DOCTOR: No, the X-rays don’t hurt at all. You’ll just stand or lie down while the technician takes some pictures. It only takes a few minutes. The radiologist will then look at the images and send a report back to me, which usually takes a day or two. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, please continue to take the ibuprofen as needed, and try to focus on those gentle exercises and good body mechanics. If your pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any numbness or tingling in your legs, please call the office right away. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You have explained everything very well, Doctor. Just… the exercises and the ibuprofen and the X-rays. I can do that. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. It is nice to have someone explain things so clearly. I suppose I should go get the X-rays now? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Yes, let's get those X-rays done. The radiology department is just down the hall to your left. The receptionist will check you in and give you instructions. Once they’re done, they’ll send the images directly to me. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss the next steps. Here’s a little handout with some exercises for your back and knees. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. It was nice meeting you too, Avril. Take care.
