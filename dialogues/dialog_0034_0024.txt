DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Confirming that I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but my insurance, Medicare, is asking for it before they’ll cover a trip I need to take.
DOCTOR: I see. A fitness-to-fly form, then. Certainly, we can look into that for you. Just to clarify, Medicare is requesting this documentation before authorizing coverage for travel?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Before they’ll approve anything. It’s… frustrating, honestly. I haven’t had any problems flying before, but they’re being very strict about it this time. They said something about needing to verify I don’t have any conditions that would make flying unsafe. I just need the letter to send to them so they’ll approve my claim.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Sayar. It’s good they are being thorough, though. To complete the form accurately, I’ll need to gather some information from you. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like heart problems, lung disease, or any conditions that require ongoing treatment?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I was very healthy, and… well, my husband was the one with a bit of a sensitive stomach. I mostly just got regular check-ups. And… honestly, it’s been a little hard to keep track of things since he passed. Not that I can’t remember, exactly. It’s just… a lot. But no chronic conditions, no. I’ve never been told I have any.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Sayar. That must be incredibly difficult. It’s perfectly understandable to have things a bit jumbled after such a loss. So, no known chronic medical conditions. That’s good. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries either. Never needed any, thankfully. Just the usual childhood things, vaccinations… nothing major. I broke my arm once when I was little, but that healed completely. I always considered myself pretty lucky when it came to health. I just want to get this letter and be able to… well, to travel. It’s important.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No surgeries, and a history of good health. We're off to a good start. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure when she was older, but she lived to be eighty-seven, so it didn’t seem to bother her too much. And my father… he had some arthritis in his knees. Nothing major, just a bit of stiffness. My husband’s side… I don’t know them very well, honestly. We didn’t keep in touch. So, not really anything significant that I’m aware of. Just the usual aging things, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, arthritis in your father, and no known significant medical history on your husband's side. That’s helpful. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I remember asking my husband all the time if he had any, and he just liked to complain about the taste of everything. So, no. Nothing I’m allergic to, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No allergies. One more quick question regarding medications – are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't take anything regularly. Maybe a pain reliever if I have a headache, but that's it. I always figured it was best to just… not take anything unless I really needed to. I try to stay as natural as possible, you know? So, no prescriptions, no vitamins, no supplements. Just… plain old me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know, Ms. Sayar. No chronic medical conditions, no surgeries, no significant family history, no allergies, and no current medications. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to confirm everything looks well. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this letter, so please, don't hesitate. I’m happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 122/78, which is excellent. And your pulse is 72, nice and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds strong and regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Finally, let’s just check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Everything sounds and looks good, Ms. Sayar. Based on this examination and the information you've provided, there are no contraindications to flying. I’m happy to complete the fitness-to-fly form for you.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! Really? That’s such a relief. Thank you, Doctor. That’s all I needed to hear. How long will it take to get the letter? And is there anything I need to do now? I really appreciate you taking the time with me. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. I can complete the form right now and have my nurse, Sarah, print it for you before you leave. It should only take a few minutes. She'll also make a copy for our records. There is nothing further you need to do at this time. Just submit the completed form to Medicare. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Truly. Just getting the letter is perfect. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and helpful. And please, thank Sarah for me. I really appreciate it. I think I’ll just… wait here while she prints it, if that’s alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. It was my pleasure to assist you. Sarah will be in shortly with the completed form. Please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions or concerns once you receive it. Have a wonderful day, and safe travels.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
