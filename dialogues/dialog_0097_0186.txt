DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. It's lovely to meet you. So, to start us off, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor Georgiou. Yeah, nice to meet you too. I’m here for a tryout physical. For… well, a sports team. Trying to get on, you see. Hopefully, I'm still fit enough. Let’s get this over with, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kingan. A tryout physical – wonderful! It’s great you’re staying active. We'll get everything checked out to make sure you’re in the best shape possible. And don't worry, we'll be as efficient as we can. First, just to confirm a few details – you're 62 years old, and your height is 183 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Six-two… and 183 centimeters. Sounds about right, hasn't changed in years. Though I might be a bit lighter these days… I weigh… uh… 129, I think. Give or take a pound or two. Don’t bother with exact numbers, honestly. Just tell me if I'm good to go for this tryout.
DOCTOR: Okay, 129 pounds. Thank you. And it's good to know you're prioritizing getting this done quickly. To get a good sense of things, could you tell me a little more about the team you’re trying out for?
PATIENT: It's… a wrestling team. Old-timers league, mostly. Not the Olympics, you understand. Just… guys who still like to grapple a bit. Keeps us young, or… well, keeps me from getting too rusty. It's a local thing, you wouldn't know it. Don't need a fancy medical report for this, honestly. Just checking if my bones are still holding together.
DOCTOR: Wrestling! That's fantastic. It is a physically demanding sport, even in an old-timers league. We still want to make sure everything's safe, though. Even a routine check-up can catch things we wouldn't expect. To start, have you had any injuries in the past that might affect your ability to wrestle?
PATIENT: Injuries? Oh, a few. Knocks and bruises, mostly. Shoulder's a bit dodgy sometimes, old wrestling injury from… well, a long time ago. Nothing serious, I've always just worked through it. Pulled a muscle here and there, but nothing that kept me down for long. Honestly, if it hadn't bothered me for the last twenty years, it's not gonna bother me now. You think a little pain is gonna stop me?
DOCTOR: I understand you've managed to work through previous discomfort, Mr. Kingan, and that’s commendable. But even old injuries can sometimes flare up unexpectedly, especially with a return to activity. It’s important to assess the current state of that shoulder. Could you describe what happens when it bothers you?
PATIENT: Well… it’s mostly when I reach up high, or twist it a certain way. Like… reaching for something on a high shelf, or when I'm pinning someone. It gets a dull ache, and a bit of stiffness. Doesn't stop me, I just gotta be careful. Sometimes it clicks, too. A little pop. Doesn’t hurt, just… feels weird. And if I really overdo it, it'll be sore for a day or two. But like I said, nothing major. Twenty years of wrestling, you get used to these things.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. The clicking sound is something we'll want to pay attention to. It could indicate some mild instability or cartilage involvement. Let’s just listen to your heart and lungs quickly, and then I’d like to do a quick exam of your shoulder, just to get a better understanding of the range of motion and any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. Just get it over with. Heart and lungs… shoulder… whatever. Just… don’t take too long, yeah? I got things waiting. And try not to pull on my shoulder, alright? It's old. Really old.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kingan. I'll be very gentle. Everything sounds clear and normal so far. Now, if you could just lift your arm up as high as you comfortably can… and then try to reach behind your back, touching your shoulder blades together. Just go to the point of any discomfort, don't force anything. I'll just feel around and see if there's any tenderness.
PATIENT: Oof. There. That's about as high as I can comfortably go. And that… that's a bit of a stretch. Feels a little tight in the back there, yeah. Don’t poke too hard, alright? It's sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. I’m just feeling for any specific areas of pain or muscle guarding. I do notice some tightness in the rotator cuff muscles, and there's a bit of tenderness right here. And when I move your arm like this… …do you feel any pain or clicking?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s where it usually bothers me. And… yeah, I feel a click there. Not sharp pain, just… a little pop. Like something’s catching. And it’s… tighter going that way. Like I said, it's old. Twenty years. You expect it to be perfect? Just tell me if I can wrestle, alright? That’s all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kingan. The strength in your shoulder is a little diminished, and there's definitely some underlying discomfort and limited range of motion. The clicking is also something we should consider. Given your history and the findings of this examination, I wouldn't recommend diving straight into competitive wrestling without some further evaluation and a rehabilitation program. It's not about whether you can wrestle, but about minimizing your risk of injury and ensuring you can continue to be active for years to come. I think it would be helpful to get an X-ray of your shoulder to rule out any underlying arthritis or bone spurs, and potentially a referral to a physical therapist to strengthen the muscles around your shoulder and improve your range of motion. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Physical therapist? Look, Doctor, I appreciate you checking me over, but… I just wanna wrestle. It's not the Olympics, it's just a bit of fun with some old buddies. I don’t have time for all that. I haven't got insurance, you see. That’ll cost money. I've been wrestling for decades, I know my body. I can handle a little pain. I just need to know if it's gonna break or not. Can you tell me that, or not? Just a straight answer. Is it safe, or is it gonna put me in a hospital? That's all I need to know. Forget the fancy tests and the therapy. Just tell me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty about your financial situation. I truly wish I could give you a simple "yes" or "no" answer, but medicine isn't always that straightforward. Based on my examination, I can't definitively say that wrestling is completely safe for you right now. There is a risk of further injury, especially with the existing weakness and discomfort in your shoulder. While it might not cause an immediate fracture, you could potentially exacerbate the underlying issues, leading to more pain, limited mobility, and even require more extensive treatment down the line. However, I also recognize your strong desire to continue wrestling. If you're determined to participate, I strongly recommend starting slowly, warming up thoroughly before each match, and avoiding any movements that cause significant pain. It's crucial to listen to your body and stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. Would you be open to discussing some gentle exercises you could do at home to strengthen your shoulder muscles?
PATIENT: Gentle exercises… Alright, fine. I guess that’s better than nothing. I’m not gonna be doing any Olympic lifts, I can promise you that. Just… something simple I can do at home. Something to keep the old muscles from completely falling apart. But listen, if it gets too bad, I'm not calling anyone. I’ll just… stop. Understand? I don't want a fuss. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll try it. And look, no pressure about the X-ray or the therapist. I get it. Just… help an old man wrestle, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kingan. I completely understand. Here are a few gentle exercises you can do at home three times a week. They'll focus on strengthening the rotator cuff muscles and improving your range of motion. I’ve included diagrams to help you with the proper form. These are: Pendulum Exercises: Gently swing your arm in circles, forward and backward, and side to side. External Rotation with Resistance Band: Use a light resistance band to gently rotate your arm outwards. Shoulder Blade Squeezes: Gently squeeze your shoulder blades together. Start with a few repetitions of each exercise and gradually increase the number as you get stronger. Remember to stop immediately if you feel any pain. And please, please, listen to your body. If the pain worsens or doesn't improve, or if you experience any new symptoms, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. I’ll document these exercises in your chart, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have about them. I'm also going to provide you with a handout on proper warm-up techniques for wrestling. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s alright. Pendulum exercises… rotator cuff… I’ll try to remember it all. Warm-up techniques… yeah, that’s good. I tend to just jump right in, but I guess I should be more careful. Look, Doctor Georgiou, I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old fool like me. And I appreciate you not pushing me into expensive tests I can’t afford. I’ll try these exercises, and I’ll be careful. Hopefully, I won't end up broken. Alright, I think that’s all. I should probably get going. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kingan. It was my pleasure. Remember, staying active is important, but it’s equally important to listen to your body and prioritize your safety. If you experience any concerns at all, please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. And if you find these exercises helpful, wonderful! If not, we can explore other options. Take care of yourself, and enjoy your wrestling. .
