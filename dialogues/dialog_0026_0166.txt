DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… well, persistent enough that I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes it feels a bit… off in my right one too.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your legs… and it’s mostly on the left, but you’ve noticed it a bit on the right as well. Can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Certainly. It began, I believe, approximately three weeks ago. I was working on a particularly intricate animation sequence – a lot of time spent seated, naturally – and noticed a slight tingling in my foot initially. It wasn’t concerning at the time, I assumed it was just from being in one position for too long. But it gradually spread up my leg over the following days, and now it’s… a consistent numbness, not just tingling. It doesn’t feel like pins and needles, exactly. More like… a dulling of sensation. I can still feel things, but it’s muted.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago, started with tingling in the foot while working on animation… spread up the leg, now a consistent dulling of sensation. That’s helpful. Has anything specific made it better or worse since it started?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I've noticed that resting it does provide some relief, but it's temporary. When I get back to work – or even just walking around for extended periods – it returns fairly quickly. Interestingly, if I'm actively focusing on something else – like, intensely concentrating on a complex task – I sometimes don’t notice it as much. It’s… a bit odd, really. There isn’t anything I’ve done that makes it worse specifically, just that prolonged activity brings it back. And I haven’t had any injuries to my leg recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting provides temporary relief, concentration can distract you from it, and no recent injuries. That’s good to know. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the numbness?
PATIENT: Let me consider… No significant pain, thankfully. No weakness that I’ve noticed. My reflexes seem normal, although I suppose I’m not the best judge of that. I haven't experienced any changes in bowel or bladder function, if that’s relevant. Oh… and I’ve been a little more tired than usual lately, but I attributed that to the long hours at work. It’s difficult to discern what’s normal fatigue and what might be connected.
DOCTOR: No pain, no weakness, no changes in bowel or bladder function, and some fatigue. Okay. Now, I’d like to get a little more information about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven't been diagnosed with any prior medical conditions. I’ve been fortunate enough to remain generally healthy throughout my life. I do have regular check-ups with my primary care physician, just for routine maintenance, and those have always been unremarkable. I don't take any regular medications, either. I'm insured through a private plan, if that's relevant for record-keeping.
DOCTOR: Good, no prior conditions or medications. That’s helpful. Have there been any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, and I've never been hospitalized, Doctor. I had a rather unpleasant bout of the flu a few years ago, but that was handled at home. Otherwise, my medical history is fairly straightforward, I believe. I've always been quite careful about avoiding injury, given the nature of my work – a broken wrist would be… problematic.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My maternal grandmother had diabetes, type 2, I believe, though she managed it well with diet and exercise for many years. My father's side of the family is… fairly robust, generally. No history of neurological disorders that I'm aware of. My mother did have some issues with arthritis in her later years, but that seemed to be more age-related. I don’t believe there's anything particularly concerning on either side of the family, but I'm happy to provide more detail if you have specific questions. I know my mother kept fairly detailed records.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal grandmother with type 2 diabetes, and some arthritis in your mother. And, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned, my occupation is special effects and animation, which requires long periods of sitting, primarily. I try to maintain a reasonably healthy diet, though it can be challenging with irregular work hours. I eat a good amount of fish, as it’s readily available here, and limit processed foods where possible. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine on occasion. I do get out for walks when I can, but it's not a consistent part of my routine. I'm single, if that’s relevant, and live independently. I wouldn't describe myself as particularly physically active, but I'm not entirely sedentary either.
DOCTOR: Okay, long periods of sitting for work, reasonably healthy diet, no smoking or heavy alcohol use. Now, one final question regarding allergies… Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No known allergies, Doctor. I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions to medications, foods, insect stings, or anything else that I’m aware of. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. I haven’t had any issues with seasonal allergies, either, despite living here in Alaska. I’ve always been able to tolerate most things without any adverse effects.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tarin, that's very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. Please proceed. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can to help determine the cause of this numbness. I trust your professional judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you wouldn't mind, please sit up on the examination table. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. Okay, your reflexes seem normal on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you resist as I try to push your arms and legs down?
PATIENT: Certainly. Please proceed. I will do my best to resist.
DOCTOR: Okay, strength appears to be equal on both sides as well. Now I’m going to test your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It feels… normal. I feel the pressure as expected. No numbness in that area. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay… and how about here?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that too. It feels… slightly muted, actually. Not entirely absent, but not as strong as the sensation on my right leg. It's difficult to describe, but there is a definite difference in intensity. It's in the same general area where I've been experiencing the numbness, though. Higher up on my left leg, just below the knee.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do detect a slight difference in sensation and there is some mild tenderness here. I also want to check your gait. Could you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, your gait appears fairly normal, although I did notice a slight hesitation on your left side. It's very subtle. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary physical exam, it seems likely that this numbness is related to some nerve compression. It could be something as simple as a pinched nerve in your back or hip, or it could be related to the way you sit for prolonged periods. To get a clearer picture, I would recommend an MRI of your lower back and hip to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. An MRI seems like a sensible next step to determine the underlying cause. I'm definitely open to that. I would appreciate having a clearer understanding of what's happening, and if there's something that can be done to alleviate this numbness. I trust your judgement, and if you believe that's the best course of action, then I fully agree.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll go ahead and write an order for an MRI of your lower back and hip. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding prolonged sitting as much as possible. If you must sit, try to take frequent breaks to stretch and walk around. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help with any discomfort you may be experiencing. I also want to rule out other potential causes. Do you have a history of diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As I mentioned earlier, I haven't been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously. My primary care physician regularly monitors my blood sugar during my check-ups, and it has always been within the normal range. I don’t have any family history of diabetes on my side either, other than my maternal grandmother who had type 2, but it was well-managed, and I don't have any of the other symptoms typically associated with the condition. I don’t have excessive thirst or frequent urination, and my vision is perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That helps to rule out one possibility. I'm also going to order some blood work, just to get a baseline and check for any vitamin deficiencies that might be contributing to the numbness. Once we have the results of the MRI and the blood work, we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your detailed examination and the clear explanation of the next steps. I understand the need for further testing to determine the underlying cause, and I feel confident in your plan of action. I will schedule the MRI and blood work as soon as possible. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. If you have any concerns or questions before your appointments, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well.
