DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well, though I confess, I wasn't particularly thrilled about having to come in. It’s about my eyesight, you see. It’s… deteriorating. Not rapidly, mind you, but enough to be bothersome. I suppose it's just… getting harder to see things clearly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Alcorta. It's certainly concerning when you notice changes in your vision. Thank you for coming in to have it checked out. Could you describe what you mean by “deteriorating”?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's not as though I've suddenly gone blind, if that's what you're asking. It's more… subtle. Things aren’t as sharp as they used to be. Reading the newspaper, for example – I find myself holding it further and further away. And distances… judging them correctly isn’t as easy. It's rather inconvenient, really. One has to be very careful navigating stairs.
DOCTOR: I see. So, increasing difficulty with both near and distance vision. Holding the newspaper further away is a helpful detail, and the trouble with judging distances is also important. When did you first notice these changes, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, you understand. Not like flipping a switch. Probably… six months ago, maybe? It started with just a little fatigue when reading, and I attributed it to the lighting. Then I realized I was… squinting more. It's been a gradual slide, really. Not a dramatic event. Perhaps a bit longer than six months, actually. Time does seem to slip away these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Mr. Alcorta. Gradual onset over approximately six months, with initial fatigue and then increased squinting. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms associated with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… Well, there's been a… a sort of haziness sometimes, particularly at night. Driving is a bit more difficult than it used to be. Not dangerous, mind you, but I have to be very attentive. And… honestly, I've had a few headaches. Not debilitating, but persistent. A dull ache behind the eyes mostly. I assumed it was stress, to be frank. One has enough of that these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so haziness, particularly at night, some difficulty driving, and persistent, dull headaches behind the eyes. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's delve into your medical history a bit. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Well, I had a bout of… bronchitis, a few years back. Nothing serious. And I’ve always had rather high blood pressure, though it's generally well-controlled with… well, with lifestyle adjustments. I avoid salt, mostly. Other than that… no, nothing significant. I’m not one for doctors, you see. Prefer to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for self-care, Mr. Alcorta, and that’s commendable. It's good that your blood pressure is well-controlled. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a daily aspirin, Doctor. For… preventative measures, you understand. And occasionally, ibuprofen for… the headaches, when they’re particularly bothersome. But it’s rarely needed, thankfully. I try to avoid pills whenever possible. They never agree with me.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, daily aspirin and occasional ibuprofen for headaches. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a… a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been rather careful about what I consume. And I keep a tidy house, which minimizes exposure to… whatever allergens might be lurking.
DOCTOR: Very good. No known allergies. Now, a few questions about your family history. Do you have a family history of any eye conditions, such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she had rather poor eyesight in her later years, but it was never properly diagnosed. She just… needed stronger and stronger glasses. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, I believe he had cataracts, but I wasn't particularly close to him. It was a long time ago. Honestly, we didn’t discuss these things much in my family. Not a very… medical family, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Alcorta. Family history can be difficult to recall. So, some history of vision decline in your mother and cataracts in your grandfather. Finally, before we proceed to a physical examination, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I’m a Human Resources Assistant, so mostly desk work. I enjoy reading – though it’s becoming increasingly difficult, as we’ve established. I walk when the weather permits. I'm… quite particular about my diet, as I mentioned. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I wouldn't say I lead an exciting life, Doctor, but it’s a comfortable one.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Alcorta. That provides a good overview. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination of your eyes. This will involve checking your visual acuity, assessing your peripheral vision, and examining the structures of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: An examination, yes. Of course. Though I confess, I don't have a particularly high tolerance for… poking and prodding. I trust you'll be gentle? I’d prefer it be as swift as possible, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I assure you I will be as gentle as possible and keep the examination swift. Let's begin with your visual acuity. Could you please stand approximately 20 feet away from the chart and cover your left eye with the palm of your hand?
PATIENT: Very well. Proceed. Though I must warn you, my eyesight has been deteriorating. Don’t be alarmed if I struggle.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Alcorta. That's perfectly alright. Please read the smallest line of letters that you can clearly see. Take your time.
PATIENT: “...P… T… 2… F… 7…” “...L… C… and… um… 3.” It’s… rather blurry, Doctor. I’m straining. Perhaps the lighting isn't ideal? Is it possible to adjust the illumination?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Alcorta. We'll note that you read to approximately 20/70 with your right eye. Now, let's switch and cover your right eye.
PATIENT: Very well. Let's see… “...F… P… T… 2…” “…And I’m afraid that’s all I can discern, Doctor. It’s quite indistinct. The letters are… merging together.”
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Alcorta. We'll note approximately 20/100 vision with your left eye. Now, I’m going to assess your peripheral vision. I'm going to ask you to focus your gaze on this point , and tell me when you see a finger entering your field of vision from the side. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision, yes. Proceed. Though I confess, I've always been rather… observant. I anticipate I'll perform admirably. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Focus on that spot, Mr. Alcorta. Tell me when you see my finger entering from the side.
PATIENT: “There. I see something… a flicker of movement. To your left, Doctor. Rather faint, but perceptible.” “It’s not particularly… distinct. I wouldn't rely on that, if I were you.”
DOCTOR: And now, your right side, Mr. Alcorta. Let me know when you see my finger entering your field of vision.
PATIENT: “There… I believe I see something. To your right, Doctor. Though it’s considerably… more delayed. And fainter than before. Much fainter. I almost didn’t notice it at all.” “Is this procedure almost complete, Doctor? My eyes are beginning to feel rather strained.”
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, we’re nearly finished. Now, I’m going to use an ophthalmoscope to examine the back of your eyes. This won’t be uncomfortable, but I will be getting quite close. It’s just a bright light, and I’ll ask you to focus on a specific point.
PATIENT: A bright light, you say? Very well. Just… try to be quick about it, Doctor. And do be careful. I'd prefer not to have my vision further compromised. Proceed. Though I confess, I'm not particularly fond of having things shone in my eyes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Look straight ahead and focus on that point on the wall. This will only take a moment. Now, let’s take a look at your left eye. Focus straight ahead. Alright, Mr. Alcorta. That completes the physical examination.
PATIENT: Well, that was… rather intense. Is everything alright, Doctor? Did you see anything concerning? I trust my eyesight hasn’t sustained any further damage? Do tell. I’d prefer a straightforward answer, if you please. No need to sugarcoat anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. The examination revealed some findings that require further discussion. Your visual acuity is reduced in both eyes – approximately 20/70 in your right eye and 20/100 in your left. Your peripheral vision is also slightly constricted, particularly on the right side. More significantly, during the ophthalmoscope examination, I observed some mild optic disc pallor in both eyes, along with some subtle retinal changes. These findings suggest a possible underlying condition affecting the optic nerve. While it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, these findings are suggestive of potential glaucoma or optic neuropathy. To determine the exact cause and extent of the problem, I recommend several further tests, including visual field testing, optical coherence tomography , and possibly a consultation with an ophthalmologist. Do you have any questions at this point, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Glaucoma… or neuropathy, you say? Those… sound rather serious. I confess, I’ve heard of glaucoma. My aunt suffered from it, I believe. A gradual loss of sight, was it not? And… optic neuropathy? Is that… progressive? Tests, you say. More tests. And a consultation with a… specialist? This is becoming rather… involved. What are the… implications, Doctor? Am I going blind? And what does this mean in terms of… treatment? Is there anything that can be done? Be frank with me, Doctor. I’d prefer a clear and concise explanation, without any medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your concern. It’s natural to be worried when hearing these terms. Let me assure you, we’re still in the early stages of investigation. We haven't reached a definitive diagnosis yet. Glaucoma can lead to vision loss if left untreated, but it's often manageable with medication or, in some cases, surgery. The goal of treatment is to lower the pressure inside the eye and prevent further damage to the optic nerve. Optic neuropathy refers to damage to the optic nerve, and the implications depend on the cause. Some types are reversible, while others can be progressive. We need to determine the underlying cause of your optic nerve changes to understand the prognosis and treatment options. At this point, it's too early to discuss specific treatments. The next step is to perform the recommended tests, including visual field testing and OCT, to get a clearer picture of your condition. The visual field test will map out your peripheral vision to identify any areas of loss. The OCT will provide detailed images of your optic nerve and retina to assess the extent of any damage. Once we have the results of these tests, we can determine the best course of action. I will refer you to an ophthalmologist for a specialist evaluation and further guidance. They will be able to provide a definitive diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan. In the meantime, there’s no need to panic. We're taking the necessary steps to investigate your condition and provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Tests… a specialist… it’s all rather… overwhelming. And expensive, I presume? I haven't insurance, as you know. What are the… typical costs associated with these tests? And the specialist consultation? I need to be realistic, Doctor. I can't simply afford whatever is deemed necessary. And… realistically, what’s the prognosis if it is glaucoma? What’s the typical rate of vision loss? Am I looking at… eventual blindness? Be frank, Doctor. I understand these are difficult questions, but I need to know what I’m facing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your concerns about the cost of these tests and the specialist consultation. It’s a valid point, and I want to assure you that we'll explore all available options to help you access the care you need. The cost of the visual field test typically ranges from $150 to $300, while the OCT scan can cost between $200 and $500. A specialist consultation with an ophthalmologist usually ranges from $200 to $400. However, these prices can vary depending on the facility and location. We do have a financial counselor at the clinic who can help you explore potential payment plans, discount programs, or charitable organizations that may provide assistance. I can provide you with their contact information after this consultation. We also have some local resources that may be able to assist with the cost of specialist care. Regarding the prognosis of glaucoma, the rate of vision loss can vary significantly depending on the type of glaucoma, the severity of the condition, and how well it’s controlled with treatment. In many cases, with early detection and appropriate treatment, vision loss can be slowed or even prevented. However, if glaucoma is left untreated or is not effectively controlled, it can lead to progressive vision loss, eventually resulting in blindness. It’s important to emphasize that this is not a certainty, and with proactive management, many people with glaucoma are able to maintain their vision for many years. The first step is to get a definitive diagnosis and understand the specific type of glaucoma you may have. Once we have that information, we can develop a personalized treatment plan to help you manage your condition and protect your vision. I recommend scheduling the visual field test and OCT scan as soon as possible, and I will provide a referral to a specialist ophthalmologist for further evaluation. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: A financial counselor… discount programs… it all seems rather… complicated. And I confess, I've always been rather skeptical of such things. Very well. Schedule the tests, I suppose. The visual field test and the… OCT scan. But I’ll need a clear understanding of the costs before proceeding. And a referral to this… specialist. And perhaps… if you could provide me with the names of a few specialists, I’d prefer to do my own research. I like to be… informed, you see. I don’t simply trust blindly. Yes. The costs, and the names. That will be all for now, Doctor. I suspect I’ll have further questions after I've had a chance to… consider everything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your desire to be informed and I'm happy to provide you with the information you need. Let me see… the cost of the visual field test at our affiliated facility is $225, and the OCT scan is $350. I will provide you with a written estimate for your records. I will also provide you with the contact information for our financial counselor. Here are the names of a few highly-regarded ophthalmologists in the area: Dr. Eleanor Vance, Dr. Samuel Peterson, and Dr. Maria Rodriguez. I've included their contact information and brief bios. Please take your time to review this information and don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any further questions. We're here to support you through this process. I wish you all the best, Mr. Alcorta. Please schedule a follow-up appointment once you've had the tests completed so we can discuss the results.
