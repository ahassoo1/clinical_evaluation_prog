DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, my left leg has gotten rather swollen. And, um, I’ve been told I have a funny heartbeat, something called… atrial… fib-rill-ation? Is that right? It's been happening for a bit now, and the swelling is new.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Nixon. It sounds like you've been experiencing a couple of concerning symptoms – the leg swelling and this potential atrial fibrillation. It’s good you're getting it checked out. Let's start with the leg swelling. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? Just in my left leg, not both. It feels… tight, and it looks bigger than my other leg, naturally. It doesn’t hurt much, just feels… uncomfortable, and heavy. I haven’t bumped it or anything, it just… appeared. I’ve been trying to keep it up when I sit, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Keeping it elevated is a good first step. So, it started about a week ago, primarily in the left leg, and it’s described as tightness, a difference in size compared to your right leg, and some discomfort, but not significant pain. And you haven't experienced any trauma to the leg?
PATIENT: No, no trauma at all. I haven’t fallen or anything like that. Just… woke up one morning and it was a bit puffier, and it’s gotten… more noticeable since then. I do sit quite a lot, for my studies, you see. I’m training to be a computer science teacher. Perhaps that’s to blame?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Prolonged sitting can contribute to swelling, but we need to rule out other potential causes. And congratulations on your studies, that sounds very interesting! Now, let’s talk about this atrial fibrillation you mentioned. Who told you about that, and do you know if any tests were done to confirm it?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was my general practitioner, Doctor MacIntyre. He… he listened to my heart, and said it wasn’t beating regularly. He said something about an EKG, yes, he did do a test, a quick one with stickers on my chest. He said it showed the… fib-rill-ation, and suggested I see someone, which is why I'm here. He didn’t explain much beyond that, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, Dr. MacIntyre performed an EKG which indicated atrial fibrillation, and he referred you here for further evaluation. Do you recall when he did this EKG, and has he prescribed you any medications for the irregular heartbeat yet?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was, oh, about three months ago, I believe. Early May, perhaps? And no, he didn’t give me any medication. He said to monitor how I felt, and if I felt unwell, to make an appointment. I haven’t felt terribly unwell, just a bit… tired sometimes, and a little breathless if I walk up stairs quickly. That’s all, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the EKG was done approximately three months ago, and you’ve been monitoring your symptoms since then – some fatigue and shortness of breath with exertion. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, and no heart problems, as far as I know. I don’t recall ever being told I had anything like that. My family doesn’t have a history of heart trouble either, to my knowledge. My mother is still very active, and she’s… well, she's older than me, naturally, but she’s doing very well.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Not a single one. I managed to avoid all that, thankfully. I broke my arm when I was a wee girl, but they just put it in a cast. Nothing more complicated than that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything regularly. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I might take a paracetamol, but that’s it. And I don't take any vitamins or supplements, no. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly. Though I do enjoy a biscuit with my tea, if you don't mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Nixon. A biscuit with tea sounds lovely. Now, one last few questions regarding your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I do not smoke. Never have, never will. My mother would have my hide if I did. It's a terrible habit, and I’ve always steered clear of it. I do occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but that’s the extent of it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And how much alcohol would you say you consume in a typical week?
PATIENT: Oh, not much at all, Doctor. Perhaps one or two glasses of wine on a Friday or Saturday evening, if I’m not busy with my studies. Usually just one. I don’t drink during the week, not at all. I need a clear head for my coding, you see. It requires concentration.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I haven’t ever had a problem with any medication. I’m quite fortunate, really. No allergies at all.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Nixon. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your leg to assess the swelling. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I trust your judgement, naturally. I just want to get to the bottom of this swelling and this… fib-rill-ation, as Doctor MacIntyre called it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat on the table, we'll get started. I'll begin by listening to your heart and lungs. I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, consistent with the atrial fibrillation Dr. MacIntyre mentioned. I also note some mild crackles in your lower lungs, bilaterally. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/85 mmHg. Finally, I'll examine your left leg. I’m noting visible swelling in your left lower leg, and it’s approximately 2 centimeters larger in circumference than your right leg. Your skin is warm to the touch, and there’s mild tenderness upon palpation. There are no signs of redness or skin breakdown. Based on my initial examination, it appears you have unilateral leg edema, and the auscultation findings suggest some fluid retention in your lungs. The atrial fibrillation needs further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Fluid in my lungs… and swelling in my leg… Is that serious, Doctor? What does it all mean? And what do we do about it? I must admit, I’m a bit worried now. Is this something I should be very concerned about?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Nixon, and it’s good you’re expressing your concerns. While these findings do warrant further investigation, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something extremely serious at this moment. However, we need to determine the underlying cause to ensure we provide the appropriate treatment. The atrial fibrillation is an irregular heartbeat, and that can sometimes lead to fluid retention, which could explain the swelling in your leg and the crackles in your lungs. The swelling itself could also be due to a variety of factors, such as prolonged sitting, venous insufficiency, or, less commonly, something more serious like a blood clot. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a few tests. I recommend an EKG to confirm the atrial fibrillation, a complete blood count to rule out any infection or anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a D-dimer test to check for blood clots. We should also get a chest X-ray to evaluate the fluid in your lungs. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. Please, do whatever tests you think are necessary. I want to know what’s going on, and I trust your judgement completely. An EKG, blood tests, a chest X-ray… yes, that all sounds very sensible. Will these tests be done here, at the clinic? And how long will it take to get the results? I have studies, you see, and I need to know if I’ll be able to attend my classes. I’m rather behind as it is.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can perform the EKG and draw the blood samples here at the clinic today. The EKG is quick – it will only take a few minutes. The blood draw will take a little longer, but it shouldn’t be too disruptive. We'll send the samples to the lab, and the results usually come back within 24-48 hours. The chest X-ray will need to be done at the imaging center across the street. It’s a quick procedure, and they can usually fit you in within the hour. I'll write you a referral, and the results will be sent directly to me. Once I have all the results, I will review them carefully and discuss the findings with you. Depending on the results, we may need further investigation, such as an echocardiogram to assess your heart structure and function. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to elevate your left leg whenever possible, and to avoid prolonged standing or sitting. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound acceptable to you, Nixon?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Elevate my leg, avoid standing… I can manage that. And I will certainly come to you immediately if anything worsens. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s a relief to have a plan. So, shall we begin with the EKG and the blood draw, then? And then I’ll go across the street for the X-ray? I just hope it doesn’t interfere too much with my studies. But my health is, of course, the most important thing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Your health is the priority, and we’ll do our best to minimize any disruption to your studies. Let's start with the EKG. It involves placing a few stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It's completely painless. Once that's done, we'll move on to the blood draw. After that, I'll write you a referral for the chest X-ray. Do you have any transportation arranged to get to the imaging center?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. My mother is taking me home after this, and she’s kindly offered to drive me to the imaging center as well. She’s very accommodating, thankfully. She worries about me, naturally. I’m a bit nervous about the X-ray, to be honest. I’ve never had one before. Is it… unpleasant? And will I be exposed to much radiation? I’ve heard things about that.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be a bit nervous about something new, Nixon. The X-ray is a very quick and straightforward procedure. You’ll simply stand or lie down while a technician takes an image of your chest. It doesn’t involve any pain or discomfort. Regarding radiation exposure, it is true that X-rays do involve a small amount of radiation. However, the amount of radiation is very low and is considered safe. The benefits of obtaining the X-ray to help diagnose your condition far outweigh the small risk of radiation exposure. The technician will use a lead apron to protect other parts of your body, and they will minimize your exposure as much as possible. If you are concerned, you can always inform them of your concerns, and they will be happy to address them. I'll write a detailed referral for the imaging center, including instructions for the technician. Once you have the X-ray, they will send the results directly to me. I'll review them along with the other test results, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. A lead apron… that’s reassuring. And knowing the technician will send the results directly to you is helpful. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. You’ve put my mind at ease. I feel much better now, knowing what to expect. I suppose there’s nothing more to do for now but get the tests done. I will see you again once the results are in? And I’ll let my mother know about the lead apron, just in case.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s exactly right. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are in. I'll have my nurse schedule that for you before you leave. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or increased swelling in your leg – please don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease, Nixon. Please let me know if you have any further questions before you go. And thank your mother for her support – it’s wonderful to have a supportive family. It was a pleasure meeting you today. We'll get to the bottom of this, and I’m confident we can create a plan to help you feel better.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you for your kindness and patience. I feel much more hopeful now. I will let you know immediately if anything changes. And I will see you again soon.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Take care, Nixon, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We'll be in touch soon.
