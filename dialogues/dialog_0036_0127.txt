DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they’re starting to droop. It's not a sudden thing, it’s been slowly getting worse over the last few months, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids over the past few months. That is something we should investigate. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. When you say "weaker," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… difficult to explain precisely. It’s not like a sudden inability to do things, but everyday tasks are becoming more… strenuous. Like, carrying groceries upstairs, or even just holding my arms up for a while. I find myself needing to rest more often after doing things I used to do without thinking. It’s mostly in my arms and legs, I believe. And… sometimes my speech feels a little slurred towards the end of the day, but I’m not sure if that's just tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so progressive weakness in your arms and legs, noticeable with everyday activities, and some slurred speech at the end of the day. That’s helpful. And you said this has been developing over months – roughly how many months would you estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, but I’d say… perhaps six months, maybe eight? It started very subtly, so I didn’t really pay much attention to it at first. It was just a little bit of extra fatigue, which is easy to dismiss. But it's definitely become more noticeable in the last three or four months, I’d say. Perhaps around February or March is when I really began to worry.
DOCTOR: Alright, February or March is a good timeframe. And just to clarify, has there been any specific event or injury that you can recall that might have triggered this, or did it just come on gradually?
PATIENT: No, not that I can think of. It wasn't after any sort of accident or anything like that. Just… slowly getting worse. I haven’t done anything different, as far as I know. I haven’t started any new exercises or changed my diet drastically or anything. It's… frustrating, because I can’t really identify a cause. It just is.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's definitely concerning when symptoms develop without a clear trigger. Let's move on to some other questions to help narrow things down. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness and drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I have been feeling a little more short of breath lately, especially when I exert myself. It's not debilitating, but I notice it. And… now that you mention it, my vision has been a bit blurry sometimes, but I thought that was just from needing new glasses, to be honest. Perhaps it’s connected? And… oh, I’ve also been swallowing a bit more difficulty than usual, particularly with… drier foods, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion, blurry vision, and difficulty swallowing, especially with dry foods. That’s important information. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I've always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I haven't been hospitalized or had any major surgeries. I've seen a dentist regularly, of course, but nothing more than that. I’m usually quite good at avoiding getting sick. It’s why this is so concerning, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical conditions or surgeries. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit more complicated. My father… he had some issues with his heart, I believe, later in life. He passed away a few years ago. And my mother… she had diabetes, but it was well-managed. As for other relatives, I’m not really sure. I didn’t really keep track of their medical histories, and we weren’t particularly close. It's rather a large family, scattered around Sweden, mostly. I don't have much information beyond my parents, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart issues in your father and diabetes in your mother. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I lead a fairly quiet life, to be honest. I work, I read, I take walks… not much excitement, really. It’s probably a bit boring, but it’s always suited me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And finally, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had any severe allergic reactions. I can eat most foods without issue, and I haven’t had any problems with medications in the past. I did have a bit of a rash once from a bug bite, but that wasn't a severe allergy, just a mild irritation. I don’t have any known sensitivities, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for that thorough information, Gedalya. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I just want to figure out what’s causing this, if possible.
DOCTOR: Great. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72 and regular, your respiratory rate is 16, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Your throat is clear, and your ears look normal. I do notice some mild ptosis – drooping of the upper eyelids – bilaterally, which you mentioned. Your muscle strength is slightly reduced in your arms and legs, particularly with prolonged effort. Your reflexes are normal. Your cranial nerves appear intact, but I do notice some slight difficulty with eye movements. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam findings, your symptoms are concerning for a possible neuromuscular disorder. The ptosis, weakness, difficulty with eye movements, and difficulty swallowing are all red flags. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but we need to investigate further. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Neuromuscular disorder… that sounds rather serious, Doctor. I must admit, I’m a little worried now. What sort of investigations are you thinking of? And… what are the possible causes of such a disorder? Is it something I should be very concerned about? I apologize for all the questions, but… it’s unsettling to hear this. I’m not very good with medical terms, so if you could explain things simply, I would be most grateful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Gedalya. It is unsettling to hear that term, and you're right to ask questions. "Neuromuscular disorder" is a broad term, and it doesn't necessarily mean the worst. It simply means there's a problem with the nerves and/or muscles. Several things could be causing this. Some possibilities include Myasthenia Gravis, which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the connection between nerves and muscles; Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, another autoimmune condition; or, less likely, but still possible, something like a motor neuron disease. It could also be related to a vitamin deficiency or a side effect of a medication, though that's less common given your history. To investigate further, I'd like to order some blood tests to check for antibodies associated with autoimmune disorders, assess your vitamin levels, and rule out other potential causes. I also recommend an Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Study . This is a painless test that measures the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves and can help pinpoint the location and severity of the problem. Depending on the results, we might also consider an MRI of your brain and neck. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make a little more sense, thank you, Doctor. Autoimmune disorder… that sounds… complicated. So, blood tests and… an EMG and NCS. Is the EMG and NCS painful? You said it's painless, but... I've heard things. And an MRI… that sounds rather claustrophobic, doesn't it? I must confess, I don't do well in enclosed spaces. And… if it is an autoimmune disorder, is there a treatment? Or is it something I would have to… live with? Again, I apologize for all the questions, but… I’m rather anxious about all of this. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to be anxious. Let’s address your questions one by one. The EMG and NCS can be a little uncomfortable, but not usually painful. It involves inserting small needles into your muscles to measure electrical activity. You might feel a brief, mild stinging sensation, similar to a mosquito bite, but it's generally well-tolerated. It takes about 30-60 minutes. As for the MRI, it can be claustrophobic. If you're concerned about that, we can discuss options, such as an open MRI, which is less enclosed, or medication to help you relax during the procedure. We can also do a shorter scan to minimize the time you spend inside the machine. Now, regarding treatment, if it is an autoimmune disorder, there are several options available. Myasthenia Gravis, for example, can be managed with medications that suppress the immune system, as well as lifestyle modifications. In some cases, surgery to remove the thymus gland may be considered. The goal is to improve your symptoms and allow you to live a normal, productive life. It's often a chronic condition, meaning it requires ongoing management, but with proper treatment, many people with autoimmune neuromuscular disorders can lead fulfilling lives. Do you feel comfortable with me ordering these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, I… I think so. Ordering the tests seems… sensible. I suppose it’s better to know what we’re dealing with, even if it’s not good news. An open MRI would be preferable, if that’s possible. And perhaps a mild sedative, just to be on the safe side. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly, and… you’ve been very patient with my questions. I appreciate it. What’s the next step? Will I be contacted to schedule these tests? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. The next step is to schedule the blood tests, EMG/NCS, and MRI. My assistant, Sarah, will contact you within the next few hours to arrange those appointments. We’ll try our best to accommodate your preference for an open MRI. I’ll also write a prescription for a mild sedative if you’d like, to be used for the MRI. As for the results, the blood tests usually take a few days to come back. The EMG/NCS and MRI typically take a little longer, around a week or so, as they need to be reviewed by a specialist. Once I have all the results, I’ll contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan, if necessary. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased weakness, difficulty breathing, or trouble swallowing – please contact the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and patience. I appreciate your thoroughness and your willingness to answer my questions. I'll await Sarah's call, and… I'll try to stay positive in the meantime. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day as well. .
