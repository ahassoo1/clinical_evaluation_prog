DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. I want to... how you say... find out more about where my family come from. My daughter, she buy me one of those tests... the DNA one. But I need help to understand it, maybe? I no understand all the words.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Scobie. Those DNA tests can be a bit overwhelming with all the information they give you. We can definitely go through the results together and see if we can piece things together. Do you happen to have a copy of the report with you today, or did it come directly to me?
PATIENT: I think it come to you, Doctor. My daughter, she do all the sending. I just give her the spit in the tube. I not very good with computers, you see. She say you can help.
DOCTOR: That's no problem at all, Mr. Scobie. Your daughter sounds very thoughtful. Let me pull up the results here… Ah, yes, I see it now. It looks like we have a pretty detailed report from AncestryDNA. Okay, so it looks like the primary ethnicity estimated is Marshallese, which makes sense given your background. There's also a smaller percentage identified as Japanese and some Polynesian ancestry. Does that generally align with what you know about your family history?
PATIENT: Yes, that sound right. My grandfather, he from Japan, I think. And my mother, she say her people always come from the islands. Polynesia... that one far away, yes? Lots of water. My father, he Marshallese, of course. But... this test, it say how much from each place? It just have all these numbers.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the numbers, Mr. Scobie. They represent the estimated percentage of your DNA that originates from those regions. So, here it says 88% Marshallese, which is quite a strong connection. 7% is estimated as Japanese, and 5% as Polynesian. It's important to remember these are estimates. DNA testing is very good, but it’s not perfect. It’s based on comparing your DNA to databases of people with known ancestry. Sometimes, there can be overlap or uncertainty. For example, there’s some genetic similarity between Polynesian and Marshallese populations, so it can be tricky to differentiate precisely. Does that explanation make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that... that help a little. So, it mean I mostly Marshallese, but a little bit from Japan and... the islands? It not mean I am Japanese, just that some people long ago come from there? My daughter, she talk about... cousins maybe? People I never meet?
DOCTOR: That's exactly right, Mr. Scobie. You've got it. It doesn't mean you are Japanese or Polynesian, but rather that you inherited some DNA from ancestors who originated from those regions. Think of it like a family tree – you're a branch of that tree, carrying bits and pieces from all the branches that came before you. And yes, many people use these tests to find distant relatives! The testing companies often have databases where you can connect with people who share DNA segments with you, potentially identifying distant cousins or other relatives. Would you be interested in exploring that aspect of the report?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe. I no know how to do that... the computer part. My daughter, she good with that. But... is it safe? People I never meet... they know where I live?
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible question, Mr. Scobie. Privacy is definitely important. The testing companies have privacy settings that allow you to control how much information you share with others. You can choose to only see matches without revealing your own location or contact information. Here, you can see that you can choose to view matches without sharing your name, location, or family tree. You can also choose to contact matches directly, or keep it anonymous. It's entirely up to you how much information you share. I can walk you through the settings now, or you can review them with your daughter. They have pretty good help resources online too. Would you like me to show you how to adjust the privacy settings now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Show me how to keep it safe. I want to find cousins, but not let strangers know where I live. My daughter, she always say be careful on the internet.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s very wise of both of you. Okay, so here, under “Privacy Settings,” we’re going to focus on a few key areas. First, “Public Profile Visibility.” We'll set this to "Private," so only you and people you explicitly connect with can see your profile. Next, "DNA Matches Visibility." We'll leave this on "Connected Matches Only," meaning only the matches you've approved can see the level of detail you choose to share. And finally, "Location Sharing." We'll definitely turn this off. This prevents anyone from seeing your general location. See?
PATIENT: Okay... private, only matches, no location. That sound good. So, if I find someone, I see their name, but they no see where I live? And I can choose to talk to them, or not? It not like they automatically know everything about me?
DOCTOR: That is exactly right, Mr. Scobie. You’ve got it perfectly. When you find a match, you'll see their username and the estimated relationship based on the amount of shared DNA. You'll also see any information they have chosen to share on their profile, like a family tree. But they won’t see your location or any other personal details unless you choose to share them. And you have complete control over who you connect with. You can send them a message and start a conversation, or simply ignore the match. There’s no obligation to connect with anyone. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes. That good. My daughter, she be happy. She always worry about the internet. Thank you, Doctor. You explain it very well. So, now I just... look for matches? Is it easy?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I'm glad I could help. And yes, now you just look for matches! It's fairly straightforward. Once you're logged into the AncestryDNA website, there’s a section called "Matches." It will list everyone who shares DNA with you, ordered by the estimated relationship. You can click on each match to view their profile and see how you’re connected. The website also provides tools to help you build a family tree and connect with other relatives. It might take some time to explore all the options, but there are plenty of helpful resources available online. Do you want me to show you how to navigate to the "Matches" page now, or would you prefer to try it on your own with your daughter’s help?
PATIENT: Let my daughter help. She better with computers than me. I think I understand enough now. You answer all my questions, and I no feel so worried anymore. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I'm so glad I could help ease your concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, if you have any questions or run into any trouble, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day, and please give your daughter my best. .
