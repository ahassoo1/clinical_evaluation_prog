DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s…Lason. Colt Lason. Honestly, it's been my wife, Soriya, pushing me to come. She says I’ve been…forgetful. Not me, of course, but she worries. I just…sometimes things aren’t as clear as they used to be, I suppose. Little things. Mostly little things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of Soriya to bring that to your attention, and it’s very common for these things to develop gradually. “Little things” can be important. Can you give me some examples of what you mean by “not as clear”?
PATIENT: Well, just yesterday, I went to get the mail. Perfectly normal. But I… I couldn’t remember which house number was ours for a moment. Just stood there, looking at the numbers like…like I’d never seen them before. And the other day, I made coffee, but I completely forgot to put the coffee in the pot before I turned it on. Just…hot water. Soriya wasn’t pleased. It’s not like I’m losing my mind, Doctor. I still know how to tile a bathroom, if that makes any difference. Best in the city, they say.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Forgetting things like house numbers or steps in a routine, even simple ones, can be concerning. And it’s good you're still able to recall skills like tiling - that’s a good sign. To get a better picture, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes in your memory or thinking?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm. Well, sometimes I feel like…like people aren't speaking clearly. Not that they’re mumbling, necessarily, but it takes me a moment to process what they're saying. And I used to be able to follow the news just fine, political stuff, everything. Now…it all seems so complicated. Like everyone’s speaking in circles. Soriya says I repeat myself sometimes. I don’t feel like I am. Honestly, she asks too many questions.
DOCTOR: Okay. Difficulty understanding conversations and following the news…and Soriya noticing repetition…those are all things we should explore. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality lately?
PATIENT: Mood? I’m…fine. Irritable, maybe. But that's just Soriya. Always nagging. She thinks everything is a crisis. And the neighborhood kids, always leaving their balls in my yard. Honestly, it’s a perfectly reasonable thing to be upset about! I’m not some…some pushover. But no, I haven't been sad, if that’s what you’re asking. Just…frustrated. A lot of things bother me now that didn’t used to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Increased irritability, things bothering you more easily… we'll note that. Now, let’s go through some medical history. Do you have any current medical problems that we should be aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doctor says I have to take a pill for it. Can't remember the name, something…blue. Little blue pill. I take it most days. Soriya reminds me. And my knees, they ache. Getting old, I suppose. Used to be able to kneel all day laying tile, now…now it’s a struggle. No diabetes, no heart problems that I know of. Just the blood pressure and the knees. And the occasional backache, from lifting heavy things. Still do some tiling jobs, you know. Can’t just sit around.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis in the knees, and some back pain. I see some notes here about amlodipine for the blood pressure – that’s the little blue pill. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Amlodipine, that’s right! Finally. See, I do remember things. No allergies, not that I know of. Soriya tries to get me to eat all sorts of…healthy things, but I don't think I’m allergic to anything. Maybe to her cooking, sometimes. Just kidding, Doctor. Mostly. I get a little itchy when I touch certain plants, but it's nothing serious. Just a rash, goes away after a while.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medication allergies, mild contact dermatitis. And you mentioned a few past injuries?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Plenty. Tiling isn't exactly gentle work, you know. Twisted my ankle once, badly. Years ago. Took months to heal. And I pulled a muscle in my back lifting a shipment of stone. That's the one that bothers me now, I think. And I used to play soccer, back in Cambodia, before…before things changed. Plenty of knocks and bruises then, nothing major. Just…old injuries.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings – had problems with memory loss, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother…she was always a little…forgetful. But everyone just said she was old. And my father, he was a very strong man, always thinking clearly. No, I don't think so. I had two brothers, but we lost contact a long time ago. Before…well, it doesn’t matter. No memory problems that I know of. My wife’s side of the family…I don’t know them very well. She doesn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, let’s briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol…I enjoy a beer with dinner sometimes. One or two, nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? Doctor, I’m a tile setter, not a… a hooligan. I need a steady hand for my work, you know. No, I don't use any drugs. And I certainly wouldn’t, not with all the work I have to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. So, to recap, you're experiencing some forgetfulness, difficulty with processing information, and increased irritability. You have a history of high blood pressure and osteoarthritis. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam, if you don't mind. We’ll check your reflexes, balance, and do a quick memory test. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A memory test? Honestly, Doctor, I told you, I remember things perfectly well. It’s everyone else I worry about! But… fine. Do your test. Get it over with. Just don’t expect me to be…impaired. I need to get back to work, you know. I have a bathroom to tile on Wednesday. A very important bathroom.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll just do a few quick things. First, let’s check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 85. Pulse is 72, and temperature is normal at 98.6. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Now, let’s check your balance. Could you please stand up and close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Close my eyes? Really? You’re just looking for something to be wrong. Fine. Don’t expect me to fall, Doctor. I’m a very steady man. Though, Soriya does say I've been a little clumsy lately. She’s always watching, you know. Always looking for…something.
DOCTOR: Alright, balance is a bit unsteady, but not significantly. Now, let's do a quick cognitive test. I'm going to say three words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me. Then, I'll ask you to recall them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Ready as I’ll ever be. Three words? What kind of words? Don’t make them too difficult. I don't want to be embarrassed. Just get it over with. Go on, then. Let’s hear your three words.
DOCTOR: The three words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat those back to me, please.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There. Perfectly done. Now, can we be finished? I have a bathroom to think about. And Soriya will be asking where I am any minute now. She’s very punctual, my wife. Extremely punctual.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now I’m going to ask you to do something simple. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? Honestly, Doctor. Must you ask such obvious questions? It’s… August 2nd. August 2nd, 2025. See? Perfectly clear. I still know what day it is, thank you very much. It's a Thursday, if you must know. Though, I usually lose track of the days on the weekends. Too much… relaxation.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, can you tell me what city we’re in?
PATIENT: What city? Honestly, Doctor, are you questioning my sanity? I live here! It's… it’s… Well, it's a big city. Lots of traffic. Oh… uh… it’s… the one with… the tall buildings. And the… the market. I… I usually just go to the tile shop, so I don't pay much attention. It's a city, alright? A big one.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it seems you are experiencing some cognitive changes. Your recall of recent events, like today’s date and city, is impaired. While it’s not necessarily indicative of a specific condition, it’s concerning enough that I recommend further evaluation. I want to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Blood work? What are you trying to tell me, Doctor? Am I… am I losing my mind? I told you, I remember things! I still tile bathrooms perfectly well. This is all Soriya’s fault. She’s always worrying, always exaggerating. I don't need any tests, or blood work, or… or brain doctors. I just need to get back to work. And I need to tell Soriya you’re upsetting me. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your concerns, and I’m not trying to alarm you. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when facing these kinds of possibilities. We're not jumping to any conclusions. The blood work and neurological assessment are simply to rule out any treatable causes for your memory issues. Early detection and diagnosis, if there is a problem, can help us develop a plan to manage it effectively. I want to assure you that we’ll be with you every step of the way. I strongly recommend the referral to a neurologist, just to be safe. They can conduct a more thorough evaluation and provide a clear understanding of what's happening. Would you be willing to consider it?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, alright. Do your tests. Get it over with. But if it turns out to be nothing, Soriya is going to hear about this. She worries too much. Always has. But…if you think it’s best…a neurologist, then. Just… don't keep me waiting too long. And I want a clear explanation. No fancy medical jargon. Just… tell me what’s wrong, in plain English. And I still need to tile that bathroom on Wednesday. That’s very important.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lason. I promise to explain everything clearly and in plain English. And we’ll do our best to get you scheduled with a neurologist as quickly as possible. I'll also give you a list of resources on cognitive health. Here is the lab requisition for your blood work. You can get that done at any local lab. And here is the referral form for a neurologist. I recommend Dr. Emily Carter. She’s excellent. I’ll also write you a prescription for a multivitamin. While it won’t address the underlying issue, it can help ensure you’re getting essential nutrients. I want to reiterate that we’re here to support you through this process. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Two weeks? That seems like a long time. But… fine. I suppose. And Dr. Carter, you say? Is she…strict? I don’t want a doctor who’s going to tell me what to do. I’ve been tiling bathrooms for forty years, I think I know what I’m doing. No, I don’t think so. Just…get me the results quickly. And tell Soriya to stop worrying so much. That’s all. I need to go home and…and think. And maybe tile something. That usually makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'll make a note to expedite the results as much as possible, and I'll mention your concerns to the neurology office. Remember, Dr. Carter is highly respected and known for her compassionate approach. Take care of yourself, Mr. Lason, and please don't hesitate to call if anything comes up before your follow-up appointment. And try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together. .
