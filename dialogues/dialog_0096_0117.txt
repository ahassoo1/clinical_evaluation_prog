DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… cough. Been coughin’. And… there was some… red stuff. When I coughed. Not a lot, but it was there. I smoke, you know. Been a long time. I don’t… remember exactly when it started, this cough. Just… lately.
DOCTOR: Right. A cough, and you noticed some blood when you cough?
PATIENT: Yeah. Blood-tinged… that’s the word. Not a whole lot, like I said. Just… spotted it. It worried me, so I figured I should come in. I don’t… usually bother with doctors. Medicare mostly, and… things usually work themselves out. But this didn’t.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good you did come in, Mr. Reyno. Even if “things usually work themselves out,” blood in your cough is something we need to investigate. Now, you mentioned you smoke. How much do you smoke, and for how long have you been smoking?
PATIENT: Uh… a pack a day. Maybe a little more sometimes. Been… a long time. Since I was… young. I don’t… I honestly can’t remember exactly when I started. Fifty years? Maybe more. It's hard to say. I've been smokin’ a long time, Doctor. Really long. I don't keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Fifty years is… a significant amount of time, Mr. Reyno. And a pack a day is quite a lot. Alright. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other stuff? Let me think… I get tired easier, I guess. Always figured it was just gettin’ old. And… sometimes I feel kinda short of breath. Not all the time, but when I… walk up hills, or somethin’. Or carry stuff. Just… winded. I haven’t really… thought much of it. Does that count? I don't… I don't know what counts.
DOCTOR: It counts, Mr. Reyno. Fatigue and shortness of breath are important. Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I know of. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I figured that was the weather. Chills… no. Night sweats… maybe? I sleep pretty warm, always have. Hard to say if it's… sweats. I just wake up kinda… damp. Does that make sense? I don’t… really pay attention to that kinda stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. Now that you mention it… my clothes have been a little loose. But I thought… I thought I was just… losing weight. Tryin’ to eat better, you know? Didn’t really connect it to… anything. Not much weight, though. Just… noticed things weren't as snug as they used to be. I don't… weigh myself regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Mr. Reyno, given your smoking history, the cough with blood, and these other symptoms… we need to rule out some serious possibilities. I’m going to listen to your lungs, and then I’d like to get a chest X-ray. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… yeah, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I don’t… really understand all that stuff, but if you think it's necessary… go ahead. Just… try to make it quick, if you can? I got… things to do. But yeah, X-ray sounds… fine. Just hurry, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit back and relax, I'll get my stethoscope. It won’t take long. Deep breath in… and out. Okay. And again… deeper breath. Hmm. I hear some… diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, and some… wheezing. I’ll need to document those findings.
PATIENT: Diminished… wheezing… okay. Sounds… bad? I don't… I don't know what those words mean. Just… tell me if it's serious, Doctor. I don't need a whole explanation, just… is it somethin’ I need to worry about? Just… be straight with me, okay? I got… a lot on my mind. Just… tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, those findings could indicate a number of things. Given your smoking history, we need to consider possibilities like COPD, bronchitis, and, frankly, even lung cancer. That’s why we’re doing the X-ray. I’m not trying to scare you, but it’s important to be realistic. We need to rule things out to determine what’s going on. The X-ray will give us a better picture. And frankly, you should have stopped smoking decades ago. The nurse will be in shortly to take you for the X-ray.
PATIENT: Lung… cancer? Oh. Oh, man. Just… let's just get the X-ray over with, okay? Just… hurry, please. I… I don’t know what to say. Just… do it. Fast. I… I need to… think. Just… the X-ray. Now. Please. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you momentarily. Just try to stay calm, Mr. Reyno. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can figure out a plan. .
