DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this unsteadiness. I’ve been feeling quite off balance, lately. It’s difficult to explain precisely. Things seem to… sway, even when they shouldn’t. I apologize if that isn’t very clear. My memory… isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Unsteadiness… right. And when did you first notice this swaying sensation?
PATIENT: That's a difficult question, Doctor. It feels like… a gradual thing. Not sudden. Perhaps… a few months ago? It's hard to pinpoint. It comes and goes, you see. Some days are better than others. I wish I could be more specific. My husband… passed not too long ago, and things have been a bit… hazy, generally. I do recall it being more noticeable after… after the services. But perhaps it was just the stress.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can certainly manifest in many ways. A few months… so, roughly since after the services. And does this unsteadiness happen with any particular movements?
PATIENT: I don’t believe so, Doctor. It doesn’t seem connected to walking, or turning, or… really anything specific. Sometimes it's when I'm simply standing. Other times, it's when I'm sitting. It’s quite unpredictable, which is… unsettling. Is that a helpful detail? I hope I’m not being too vague.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Snerling. Any information is helpful. Let’s see… before we proceed, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I do get rather tired easily, these days. More tired than usual, certainly. And… occasionally, a bit of dizziness. Not a spinning sensation, exactly, just a… light-headed feeling. But I’m not sure if that’s connected. It could just be low blood sugar; I sometimes forget to eat properly.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and occasional lightheadedness… alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or experienced any headaches?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't noticed any changes to my vision or hearing. No headaches, either. My sight seems as good as it always was, and I hear… well, as well as a woman my age should, I suppose. Though I confess, I haven't had it formally checked recently. It’s been… difficult to keep up with everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… I do take a blood pressure pill… a small, white one. And something for my cholesterol, a yellow capsule. But I honestly can’t recall the names, Doctor. My husband always managed the medication reminders, and I haven't quite gotten it organized since… I do have private insurance, though, so I suppose the records are somewhere? I apologize for being so… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, it says here you're on Lisinopril 10mg daily for blood pressure and Atorvastatin 20mg daily for cholesterol. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. No allergies to foods, no reactions to any medication… not that I remember, at least. Though I confess, I sometimes forget if I've taken my pills already. Perhaps that's a different kind of reaction! But truly, I don't think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides high blood pressure and cholesterol?
PATIENT: That's… a good question, Doctor. My husband always handled the doctor’s appointments, you see. He kept track of everything. I think I had a bout of bronchitis a few years ago, but that was easily treated. Nothing serious. And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. But other than that, I’m not sure. I truly don’t recall any other diagnoses. Is it alright if we perhaps check the records? I apologize for being so… vague. It's just… everything feels a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – approximately 15 years ago, and the bronchitis as you mentioned. No other significant medical history listed. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she had some issues with her heart, I believe. A weak heart. She passed when I was quite young, actually. And my father… he was quite healthy, as far as I know. He lived a long life. I don’t recall any other significant medical history in my immediate family. They lived in Ethiopia, you see, and medical records weren’t always… readily available. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Snerling. And finally, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, as I mentioned, my husband passed away not too long ago. We lived a quiet life together, mostly at home. I don’t drink alcohol, and I’ve never smoked. I used to enjoy gardening, but… I haven’t really felt up to it lately. My work… I’m a rotary drill operator in the oil and gas industry. It's physically demanding, but I've been doing it for quite some time. That's about it, I suppose. A rather uneventful life, all things considered. Is there anything else you need to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Snerling. Thank you for sharing all of that. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment to check your balance and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed whenever you are ready. I trust your judgment completely. And… thank you for listening so patiently. It’s a relief to finally be discussing this with someone.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, but a little distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Please stand up slowly. Okay, close your eyes and stand with your feet together. You do exhibit some mild unsteadiness with your eyes closed. It's subtle, but present. Now, I’d like you to walk a straight line heel-to-toe for a few steps. Slight difficulty with heel-to-toe walking, some minor coordination issues. Alright, Ms. Snerling. That’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh dear… that felt a little precarious. I do feel a bit… off balance now. But thank you, Doctor. What do you think it might be? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Snerling, based on your history and the physical exam, there are several possibilities. The unsteadiness, fatigue, and mild coordination issues could be due to a number of things. It’s unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, but it does warrant further investigation. The elevated blood pressure is something we need to address as well. Given your symptoms and medical history, I’m considering a few possibilities: Vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause neurological symptoms, inner ear problems affecting balance, or potentially even early signs of peripheral neuropathy, which can be associated with your work in the oil and gas industry. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, Vitamin B12 levels, and a thyroid panel. I’d also recommend a referral to an audiologist for a hearing and balance evaluation. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Blood tests and a hearing evaluation… absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I want to understand what's happening, and hopefully find some relief. I am comfortable with that. And… thank you. It’s a relief to have a plan. Will you be able to explain the results to me when they are ready?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Snerling. I'll personally review the results with you when they are available, and we'll discuss the best course of action. The lab results typically take a few days to come back. I’ll also send a referral to a qualified audiologist, and their office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and avoid any activities that might increase your risk of falling. If you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms, such as severe dizziness, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything so clearly. Thank you for listening so patiently to my… rather vague recollections. I appreciate your kindness. I will follow your instructions, and I will contact you if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Snerling. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. My office will be in touch to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. And just to reiterate, if you experience any sudden worsening of symptoms, especially dizziness or difficulty speaking, please seek immediate medical attention. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have my word. Goodbye.
