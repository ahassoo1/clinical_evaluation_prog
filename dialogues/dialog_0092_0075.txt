DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having a bit of trouble staying awake during the day, even though I use a machine at night for my sleep apnea. It’s just… tiring, you know? I thought I was doing everything right, but the sleepiness is still there.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. It’s certainly frustrating when something isn't working as expected, especially when it comes to getting a good night’s rest. It’s good you’re already using a machine for your sleep apnea—that’s a very important first step. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about this sleepiness?
PATIENT: Sure. It's not like I'm falling asleep standing up or anything, but I find myself really dragging in the afternoons. Especially after lunch. And sometimes even earlier. I just feel… foggy, you know? Like I haven’t quite woken up. It makes it hard to concentrate, even when I’m trying to read or watch something. I used to be quite sharp, but lately… not so much. It’s a little concerning, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s more of a persistent daytime fatigue and difficulty concentrating, rather than overwhelming sleepiness. And it seems to be worse in the afternoons, especially after eating. That’s helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… well, I’d say at least six months, maybe a little longer. It started gradually, you know? At first, I just thought I was getting older, a bit more tired than usual. But it’s not getting any better, and if anything, it’s slowly getting worse. It’s been particularly bad the last couple of months, actually. I really noticed it over the July 4th holiday when I was trying to visit family. Just couldn't quite enjoy it, you know? Kept wanting to nap.
DOCTOR: I understand. Six months of gradually worsening fatigue, with a recent increase in the last couple of months – that’s important to note. And it’s impacting your ability to enjoy things, which is concerning. Let's talk about the machine you use for your sleep apnea. What type of machine is it – a CPAP, BiPAP, or something else?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the machine. It’s a CPAP, I believe. A Philips Respironics one. My doctor – Dr. Ramirez, back in Miami – prescribed it about three years ago now. It’s got a mask that fits over my nose, and it blows air into me while I sleep. Honestly, it took a while to get used to, but I’ve been pretty consistent with it. I try to use it every night, unless I’m traveling and something goes wrong. They gave me a report card, a little thing that shows how often I'm using it. I’m happy to show it to you if you'd like.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. A report would be very helpful. While you’re getting that, could you also tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, let’s see. I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, no problems since then. I also had a bit of a heart flutter a few years back – atrial fibrillation, they called it – but it's been managed with medication for the past two years. Aside from that, I’ve got the usual – high blood pressure, a little arthritis in my knees, but nothing too serious. Oh, and I was divorced a long time ago, if that counts. Medicare is my insurance these days. I try to stay healthy, you know? Walk every morning, eat my vegetables... mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. This is helpful. So, we have a history of gallbladder removal, atrial fibrillation managed with medication, hypertension, and some arthritis. And you're currently insured through Medicare. Regarding your medications, could you please list them for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me see… I take Lisinopril for the blood pressure, 20 milligrams every morning. And then there's Apixaban for the heart – that’s 5 milligrams twice a day. And sometimes I take Tylenol for the arthritis, but not every day, just when my knees are really bothering me. That's about it, really. Nothing fancy. I try to keep the list as short as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure, Apixaban 5mg twice daily for atrial fibrillation, and Tylenol as needed for arthritis. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to be a bit sensitive to shellfish as a child, but I haven't eaten that in decades. As far as medications go, I don't think I’ve ever had an allergic reaction. Dr. Ramirez checked when they prescribed the Apixaban, just to be sure. No rashes, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Paske. No known allergies is certainly helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. I quit smoking about forty years ago, best decision I ever made. And I haven't touched a drink in decades, either. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but it started to interfere with my sleep, so I gave it up. And recreational drugs? Never been my style. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor. I prefer a good book and a quiet evening to anything else. And, as I said, I try to get my walk in every morning. Keeps me going, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Paske. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see. My father had high blood pressure, just like me. He lived to be 85, though, so it didn’t seem to bother him too much. My mother had some trouble with her heart later in life, but I don’t know the specifics. She passed away when I was fairly young. And my only brother… he had some problems with diabetes, unfortunately. He wasn’t as careful with his diet as he should have been. On my wife's side… her mother had arthritis, just like me. That's about all I know, really. They weren't big on talking about medical history. It wasn't considered polite, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis. That gives us some useful information. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, go right ahead. I’m used to check-ups, you know. I try to stay on top of things. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special, like take a deep breath or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. Just breathe normally for me. Heart sounds are regular, but I do note a slight murmur. It's difficult to grade without further testing, but it's present. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 148/82, which is slightly elevated. Ears are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses. Alright, everything seems generally okay, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur are things we’ll need to investigate further. I also noticed you seem a little… puffy around the ankles. Is that normal for you?
PATIENT: Oh, you noticed that, did you? Yes, it’s been a bit worse lately, actually. It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it's barely noticeable, other times it's a little more pronounced. I figured it was just from being on my feet too much, but maybe it’s something more. It doesn't hurt, thankfully, just… noticeable. It's been happening on and off for a couple of months, I’d say. The doctor in Miami never mentioned it, though. I just assumed it was normal for someone my age.
DOCTOR: That’s good you’ve noticed it, Mr. Paske. Edema, or swelling in the ankles, can be a sign of several things, including heart issues or kidney problems. Given your history of atrial fibrillation and slightly elevated blood pressure, we should look into this further. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few blood tests, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a BNP level – that’s a test to check for heart failure. I’d also like to get an EKG to look at your heart rhythm, and a urinalysis to check your kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. That sounds perfectly sensible. I want to get to the bottom of this, you know? I’m happy to have whatever tests you need. I trust your judgment. Just let me know what I need to do, and I’ll do it. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s causing all this fatigue and the puffiness in my ankles. It’s just tiring, you know? Makes it hard to enjoy life.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. We'll get to the bottom of it. Okay, I’ve ordered the blood tests, EKG, and urinalysis. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will be in shortly to take you down there. They’ll also get the EKG done. Once the results are back – usually within a day or two – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, it's important to continue using your CPAP machine as prescribed. Try to maintain a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and get regular, gentle exercise. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and taking this seriously. I feel much better knowing we're taking steps to figure out what's going on. Just let me know when the nurse is ready for me, and I'll head down to the lab. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could help. The nurse should be with you shortly. Don’t hesitate to let me know if anything changes or if you think of any other questions.
PATIENT: .
