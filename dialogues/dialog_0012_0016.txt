DOCTOR: Hi Nicky, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it's nice to meet you too, Doctor. Though, honestly, I've seen better equipped offices. But never mind that. It's this bruising, see? My wife – God rest her soul – was on this blood thinner, and now I am, and I'm starting to look like a plum. It just… doesn’t seem right. I bump into things normally, like anyone, but this is… excessive.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's concerning when you notice changes in bruising, especially when you're on a blood thinner. And it's good you're bringing it up. "Looking like a plum" – I get what you mean, and we definitely want to figure out what’s going on. First, can you tell me a little more about when you started noticing this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… hmm. It’s not like it was sudden, you know? It’s been creeping up on me, I suppose. Maybe… a month? Six weeks? It's hard to pinpoint exactly. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to these things unless they become a problem. My wife always handled the medication and kept track of dates. I just… took the pills when she gave them to me. Now I'm the one keeping track, and clearly not doing a very good job of it.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Nicky. It’s a big adjustment taking on that responsibility, and it’s okay not to have all the details right away. A month to six weeks… that gives us a starting point. And just to be clear, what blood thinner are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Warfarin. That’s what she was on, and that’s what they put me on when… well, never mind. Warfarin. And the dosage… let me see… 5 milligrams, I think. Yes, 5 milligrams. Daily. Though, sometimes I forget, and take it a little later in the day. Is that a problem? She always took it precisely at 6 PM.
DOCTOR: Okay, 5 milligrams of warfarin daily. And yes, consistency with timing can be important with warfarin. It doesn’t necessarily mean it's a huge problem if you occasionally take it a little later, but it’s good to know. We’ll want to check your INR level to see how well your blood is thinning. Have you had your INR checked recently?
PATIENT: My… what level? Honestly, Doctor, you're using words I don't understand. My wife always handled the tests, the numbers, everything. I just… showed up when she told me to. I know they poked me with a needle, and I got a bill. That’s about the extent of my knowledge. When was the last time? Let me think… it was probably… before the six weeks of bruising started. Maybe a month ago? Before that, I have no idea. Look, I'm an old man. I'm not good with these details. Just tell me if something's wrong, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, Nicky, that's perfectly alright. It is a lot to keep track of, and you're not alone in feeling overwhelmed. Your INR – it’s just a blood test that measures how long it takes your blood to clot. It helps us make sure the warfarin is at the right dose. So, it sounds like it's been roughly a month since your last INR check. Given the increased bruising, it’s a good idea to get that checked again right away. I’m going to order a blood draw for you now. It's a quick test, and we can get the results back fairly quickly. While we wait for the results, can you tell me a little bit about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… Well, I've been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. Just generally… run down. But I'm an old man, Doctor! What do you expect? And my gums… sometimes they bleed a little when I brush my teeth. Nothing major, just a little spot of red. Oh, and I had a nosebleed a couple of weeks ago. It stopped pretty quickly, but it was a bit more than usual. Is that… is that all connected? It all sounds rather alarming when you list it out like that.
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me all of this, Nicky. Yes, the fatigue, bleeding gums, and nosebleed – those can all be related to being on warfarin and potentially an elevated INR. It's definitely worth investigating. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at the bruising. I'll also gently examine your gums. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? My wife always said I had sensitive gums. And try not to take too long. I have a bridge game this afternoon. Not that I'm a particularly good player anymore, but it's something to do. Honestly, this whole thing is rather inconvenient. I just want to know if I need to stop taking these pills. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Nicky. That’s a perfectly reasonable thing to ask. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll figure out what's going on. Blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning at the moment. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Okay, I see some significant bruising here, mostly on your forearms. It appears to be a mix of old and new bruises. Your gums are slightly swollen and there is some bleeding when I gently probe them. This suggests a possible issue with your clotting. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it does seem likely that your INR may be elevated. We need to get those blood test results back to confirm. I've put in the order, and they should be available within a couple of hours. In the meantime, I want to be cautious. Avoid any activities where you might be prone to injury, and let me know if you experience any unusual bleeding – like blood in your urine or stool, or a nosebleed that won't stop. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. No bumping into things, no bleeding everywhere… got it. Honestly, Doctor, it sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. I just hope it's not something serious. I’ve had enough health problems in my life to last several lifetimes. Can I at least have a cup of coffee while I wait for these results? Or is that forbidden now too? Don’t tell me I have to cut out coffee!
DOCTOR: No, you don’t have to cut out coffee! That’s not a restriction at this point. Coffee is perfectly fine. I understand your concern, Nicky, and I want to reassure you we're taking things one step at a time. We're not jumping to conclusions, just being cautious while we get more information. I'll have the nurse come in and take your vitals again while we wait for the lab results. We will also review your medication list. It would be helpful to know if you’re taking any other medications or supplements. Do you take anything else, even over-the-counter pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Well, I take aspirin sometimes, for my knees. They ache, you know? Especially in the mornings. Just a low dose, 81 milligrams, when they’re really bothering me. And… oh, yes. I take a multivitamin every day. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. My wife always kept track of everything, and now… well, I'm trying my best. Honestly, this whole thing is rather stressful. I just want to get back to my bridge game. It's the only thing that keeps me sane.
DOCTOR: Okay, low-dose aspirin when needed for your knees, and a daily multivitamin. That’s good to know, because aspirin can thin the blood as well, and we need to take that into account when interpreting your INR results. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot right now, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling stressed. We’ll figure this out together, Nicky. I’m going to step out for a moment to review your chart and prepare for the results. The nurse will be in shortly to check your vitals, and I’ll be back as soon as the lab results are available. Please, just relax and try not to worry. Is there anything I can get you – a glass of water, perhaps?
PATIENT: Water would be nice, thank you. And… try not to keep me waiting too long, alright? I really don’t want to miss my bridge game. It’s Tuesday, you know. That’s my day. Tell the nurse to be gentle with the blood pressure cuff. It always makes my arm ache. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate you trying to help, but this whole thing is rather inconvenient. Just… get me back to normal, alright? That’s all I ask. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Nicky. We’ll do our best to get you back to normal as quickly as possible. I’ll let the nurse know about your arm and to be gentle. I’ll be right back with the results as soon as they’re available. .
