DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please, tell me—in as concise a manner as possible—what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to put it simply… I feel like I need a bit of a… jumpstart, you know? I’m not sick sick, but things just aren’t… peppy anymore. I’m getting older, of course, and I just want to feel better, more like myself again. A reset, perhaps? Is that… understandable?
DOCTOR: Understandable, yes. Though "peppy" is not a medical term, Ms. McNabb. We need to be more specific. Can you elaborate on what "not peppy" entails?
PATIENT: Oh, forgive me, Doctor. Old habits, I suppose. I used to be quite the gardener, very active. But now… well, I tire more easily. It takes me longer to get things done, even simple things. And I don’t have the… the energy to do the things I enjoy. Not like I used to. It's not a pain, not a specific illness, just… less. Less of everything, really. Does that make sense? I taught little ones for so long, so I try to be clear!
DOCTOR: “Less of everything.” Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It didn't happen overnight, that's for sure. I'd say… maybe the last six months or so it’s become more noticeable. Before that, it was just… the usual slowing down, you know? Getting older. But now it feels… different. Like I need a little help to get back on track, if that makes sense. It's hard to pinpoint an exact date, Doctor. It’s a gradual thing, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Gradual, yes. But we still need a timeline for proper evaluation. Six months… and has anything specific occurred in those six months that might correlate with this decline?
PATIENT: Oh, my… that is a good question. Let me think… well, my husband, bless his soul, passed away last November. So… that was about nine months ago now. It was… a difficult winter, naturally. A lot of grieving. I suppose it could be that. I’ve been trying to keep busy, but… it's not the same, is it? I did spend a lot more time indoors, less sunshine, perhaps. Is that relevant, Doctor? I’m not sure. Everything feels a bit… mixed up, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Loss of a spouse is… significant. Certainly a factor. And reduced sunlight could contribute. We will need to rule out other possibilities, naturally. Do you experience any changes in your sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep. Yes, that's been a bit… off. I used to sleep like a log, you know? But now I wake up several times during the night. Not because of pain, just… awake. I lie there for a bit, then maybe get up and read for a while, then try to go back to sleep. It's not every night, but it happens often enough to be noticeable. I don’t feel tired exactly, just… restless. It's hard to explain. It's not a full night's rest, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Restless… Right. And any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, well… yes, actually. It’s not that I don’t want to eat, you understand. I enjoy my food! It’s just… I don’t have the same appetite I used to. I find myself eating smaller portions, and… well, sometimes I just don’t feel very hungry at all. My daughter keeps telling me I need to eat more, but it’s just… not appealing, you know? It's not that I'm forcing myself to skip meals, but I'm not seeking them out like I used to. I suppose it’s just… another thing. Everything feels a bit… muted, really.
DOCTOR: Muted. Right. Now, Ms. McNabb, I am going to need to ask some more detailed questions. This is to ensure we cover all bases. Do you have any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Not a constant pain, no. My knees get a little stiff sometimes, especially in the mornings, but that's just… old age, I suppose. Nothing that requires medication or anything like that. Just a little creakiness, you know? And sometimes my back aches a bit after gardening, but that's just from bending over, not a persistent pain. Nothing serious, Doctor. I assure you. I’m not here because I'm in pain, I’m here because I want to feel better. Is that… alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, let me think. Well, about ten years ago, my doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high, so he put me on a small dose of medication for it. I’ve been taking it ever since, and it seems to be keeping things under control. Other than that… no, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I’ve always been a fairly healthy person, Doctor. That’s why this is so strange. I take pride in taking care of myself, you see. I don't recall any other serious conditions. My daughter does worry about my cholesterol, she’s always reminding me to eat more fish, but I’ve never had it formally checked. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Important, yes. We will need to review your records. And what medications are you currently taking specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just the one, I believe. It's… let me see… it's a small white pill. I think it's called… Lisinopril? Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. Just one, every morning with my breakfast. And occasionally, if I have a bad headache, I’ll take some over-the-counter ibuprofen, but that’s not very often. Honestly, Doctor, I don't take many medications. I try to avoid them if possible. My mother always said, "Less is best." Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, not that I know of. I've always been quite lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, and I've never had a bad reaction to any medication. I’ve been stung by a bee once or twice, like any gardener, but that was just a little swelling, nothing serious. No allergies at all, Doctor. I’m a pretty simple person, really. No sensitivities, no reactions. Just… getting older, I suppose. This is all new to me.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, Ms. McNabb, I'm going to perform a brief physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and respiration. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. There we go. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you see. Please don’t hesitate to tell me if I need to shift positions. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Respiration is normal. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, normal bowel sounds. Reflexes are diminished but present bilaterally. Everything appears within normal limits for your age, Ms. McNabb, but we still need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. That… doesn’t sound too bad, does it? Diminished, you say? Well, I am getting on in years, after all. It’s to be expected, I suppose. Blood tests, you say? Of course. Whatever you think is best. Is there anything I should do to prepare for them? Fasting, perhaps? Just let me know, and I’ll make sure I follow your instructions. I want to get to the bottom of this, you see. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for eight hours prior to the blood draw. We'll need to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, thyroid stimulating hormone, and vitamin D levels. I'm also going to order a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol. I’m also concerned about potential B12 deficiency, given your symptoms, so we’ll include that as well. The lab is just down the hall. You can schedule an appointment at the front desk. We’ll review the results in about a week. In the meantime, continue your Lisinopril as prescribed. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… quite a list, isn't it? Complete… everything. Well, alright. If that's what it takes. Fasting for eight hours… yes, I can manage that. I suppose I can have a light dinner tonight and then nothing until after the blood draw. B12… deficiency? Is that… serious, Doctor? And a lipid panel, you say? To check the cholesterol? My daughter will be pleased. Alright. I think I’ve got it. So, just schedule an appointment at the front desk, and I’ll fast beforehand. And then we’ll review the results next week. Is there anything else I need to do? Any specific instructions? I want to make sure I do everything correctly.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. McNabb. Those are the only instructions. Please schedule the blood draw as soon as possible. We’ll discuss the results next week. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, significant weakness – seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions for me now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor. No, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, thank you. I'll go schedule the blood draw right away. Chest pain, shortness of breath… alright, I’ll keep an eye out for those. Thank you again, Doctor Mutnick. I appreciate your time and attention. I look forward to discussing the results with you next week. Perhaps… perhaps we can figure out how to get my “peppy” back?
DOCTOR: We will see, Ms. McNabb. Good day.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright then. Good day to you too, Doctor. .
