DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this itching. Everywhere, really. It started a couple weeks ago, I guess. Not like a rash, just… itchy skin. It’s driving me a little crazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm, itchy skin… alright. And you said it started about two weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. Maybe a little longer, now that I think about it. It wasn't sudden, it sort of… crept up on me. At first, I thought it was just dry skin, you know? But lotion doesn't seem to be helping much.
DOCTOR: Right, crept up on you. And you’ve tried lotion… any particular kind?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, the usual. Aveeno, mostly. Sometimes Eucerin when it's really bad. Nothing fancy. Doesn’t seem to make a difference, though. It just… itches. All over. Back, arms, legs… even my scalp is a bit itchy now. I haven't changed anything in my routine, either. Same soap, same detergent, everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. No changes in soaps or detergents… okay. Have you noticed any redness, bumps, blisters, or anything else with the itching?
PATIENT: No, that’s the thing. Nothing with it. Just… itchiness. No bumps, no rash, no spots. That’s why I'm a bit puzzled. My skin just feels… irritated, all the time. It’s not raised or anything, just… feels like I need to scratch constantly. It’s worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Worse at night… alright. And has anything like this happened before?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bit of eczema as a kid, I think, but that was… a long time ago. This isn't like that. That was in patches, red and scaly. This is just… everywhere. Constant. It’s… uncomfortable is the best way to describe it. Never had an all-over itch like this before, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior history of this specific type of itch. Let’s talk about other medical conditions. Do you have any current health problems—diabetes, kidney issues, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out a few years back, but that’s been fine. And I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. No diabetes, no kidney issues, doctor said my thyroid was fine at my last check-up. I get regular blood work done, you know, with Medicare covering it.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal, controlled hypertension… good to know. And you mentioned medication for your blood pressure—what are you taking, if you recall?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, I think. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. Been on it for… oh, maybe five years now? Something like that. No problems with it, doctor checks it regularly. And I take a little bit of fish oil, just for general health, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril and fish oil… okay. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I've tried all sorts of things over the years. My wife used to say I had an iron stomach. Sadly, she's… gone now. But, no, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Alright, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about family history. Any history of skin problems in your family—eczema, psoriasis, anything like that?
PATIENT: My mother had a bit of eczema when she was younger, I think. Nothing major, just a little bit on her elbows. And my brother had some bad poison ivy once, but that was just a one-time thing. Other than that, not really. No real history of skin problems, to my knowledge. We weren't really a family that talked about our health much.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not much anymore. Maybe once a month, if that. And absolutely no drugs. Never been interested in that sort of thing. Just a quiet life, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I just want to take a look at your skin and see if I can get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m not seeing any obvious rash, lesions, or signs of infection. Skin is dry. No visible hives. I'll take a look at your back now. Back is also dry. No visible abnormalities. Scalp is slightly dry, a little bit of dandruff, but nothing significant. Overall, your skin appears dry, but otherwise unremarkable.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Is it just dry skin, then? Because the lotion isn't helping. It's been pretty dry lately, I admit, but this feels… different. More irritating. I’m just hoping it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. It could be simple dry skin, but the fact that lotion isn't helping, and the degree of itching… makes me think we need to rule out other possibilities. There are a number of things that can cause generalized itching, even without a visible rash. Given your age, medical history, and the lack of improvement with standard treatments… I think it would be prudent to order some blood work. We’ll check your liver function, kidney function, thyroid levels, and a complete blood count. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the itching. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s best, then let’s do the blood work. I just want to get to the bottom of this. It’s driving me a little crazy, as I said. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Okay. For this particular set of tests, no fasting is required. You can eat and drink normally before the blood draw. The lab is just down the hall. They'll give you instructions once you get there. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a stronger moisturizer, with ceramides. It’s a bit more potent than what you've been using, and may provide some relief while we wait for the results. It should take a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A stronger moisturizer, and the blood work… I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious. A few days is fine. I’ll head down to the lab now, then. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. If the itching becomes significantly worse, or you develop any other symptoms—fever, fatigue, weight loss, changes in urine or stool color—please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, we’ll see you in a few days. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Sham. I appreciate your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Ferneding. Get well soon.
