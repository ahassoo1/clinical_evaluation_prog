DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kreckel. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg has gotten quite swollen. It’s been happening on and off, but it’s worse now. The nurse mentioned something about my heart… something not beating right? I'm not entirely sure I understood.
DOCTOR: I see. Swelling in the left leg, and some concern raised about your heart rhythm. Let's start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? It wasn't too bad at first, just a little puffiness, really. But it’s gotten bigger each day. I noticed it most after I was on my feet for a long time grading papers. I teach computer science, you see.
DOCTOR: Computer science, excellent. And it's definitely worse after prolonged standing?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Standing for a long time makes it much, much worse. And… sometimes it feels a little achy, but mostly just swollen. It doesn’t hurt badly, if that makes sense. I can still walk, but it feels… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so swelling worsening with prolonged standing, some aching, but you're still able to ambulate. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg, Ms. Kreckel?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. It doesn't feel warm, and I haven't seen any redness. It's just… big. And a bit uncomfortable, really. Is that the… atrial fibrillation the nurse was talking about having something to do with it? I am terribly sorry, I don’t understand much of the medical talk.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Kreckel. Medical jargon can be confusing. The nurse may have mentioned atrial fibrillation as a possibility, and it can sometimes cause leg swelling, but we need to rule out other causes first. Before we get into that, can you tell me if you’ve experienced any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… shortness of breath, no, not really. I get a bit winded walking up the stairs sometimes, but I always just put that down to being out of shape. Chest pain, no. And dizziness… well, I felt a little lightheaded once a few days ago, but I thought it was just because I hadn't eaten. Is that… helpful? I truly hope I'm explaining myself clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly, Ms. Kreckel. That’s helpful information. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll examine your leg. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. And again… Okay. Lungs sound clear. Now, let's examine your leg. There is definite edema present in the lower left leg, and no significant tenderness to palpation. I’m also going to measure the circumference of both legs to compare. Right leg circumference is 23 centimeters. Left leg circumference is 26 centimeters. I'm also checking the pulses in your feet... good pulses bilaterally.
PATIENT: Okay. That all sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. Is 26 centimeters… bad? I don’t know anything about leg measurements. And I'm glad you checked my pulses. I did worry it might be something serious.
DOCTOR: 26 centimeters is larger than the right leg, which is 23 centimeters, indicating swelling. It’s not necessarily “bad” in isolation, but it’s a finding we need to investigate. Given your age and symptoms, and the fact that you're not currently on any medications—according to my chart—and haven't had any recent surgeries or trauma, I would like to order a D-dimer blood test to rule out a blood clot, and an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A blood test and a heart test… yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I haven't had any surgeries, no, and I don't take any pills. Just a lot of tea, if that counts. Please, go ahead with the tests. I just want to understand what's going on with my leg.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the nurse draw blood for the D-dimer now, and we can get the EKG done right here in the examination room. It's a simple, painless test. While we're waiting for the results, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. None at all. I eat everything put in front of me, practically. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. I do have a lecture to prepare for on Monday.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the allergies. We’ll get these tests done and see what they reveal. We'll start with the EKG. The nurse will be in shortly to get you set up. In the meantime, I want you to avoid prolonged standing or sitting for extended periods. And if you notice any new pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, please let us know immediately. Would you like me to write a note for your work explaining that you may need to take some time off, depending on the results?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be incredibly kind of you, Doctor. A note for work would be a tremendous help. I don't want to worry them unduly, but explaining the situation would be useful. Thank you. I do appreciate your care.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's a note for your employer. I’ll let the nurse know you're ready for the EKG. We'll take it one step at a time. We'll discuss the results as soon as they are available. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything for now. You've been very thorough and reassuring. I'm just a bit anxious, as you can imagine. But I feel much better knowing you’re looking into it. Thank you again for your time and care.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kreckel. It's perfectly understandable to be anxious, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. The nurse should be with you momentarily. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before then. I'll check back in with you as soon as the results come in. .
