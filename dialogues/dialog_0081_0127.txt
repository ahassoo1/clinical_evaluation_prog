DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a bit, I think. It’s noticeable, at least. It’s just… concerning.
DOCTOR: "Concerning" is a good way to put it. Weakness and drooping eyelids… hmm. And this has been going on for months you say?
PATIENT: Yes, months. I’d say… maybe four or five months now? It started slowly, just feeling a little more tired than usual. I thought it was just stress from work, to be honest. But it's gotten worse. It's… harder to do things now. Even things I used to do without thinking.
DOCTOR: And can you be more specific about the "things" that are harder to do?
PATIENT: Well… lifting things, for one. Carrying groceries is much more of a struggle. And I used to enjoy gardening, but even just weeding is tiring now. My arms… they feel so weak. It's not a sudden weakness, it’s just… gradually getting harder to use them. I also find myself blinking more, trying to keep my eyes open, I suppose. It sounds silly when I say it out loud.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly, Mr. Schaust. Gradual onset is… pertinent. And you’ve noticed no other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I've been a little more tired, like I said, but I attributed that to the weakness itself. I haven't noticed any… pain, or numbness, or anything like that. No trouble breathing or swallowing, either. Just… the weakness and the heavy eyelids. I haven’t been feeling unwell, other than that, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: And what sort of work do you do, Mr. Schaust?
PATIENT: I’m a facilities manager. So, a bit of everything, really. Mostly office work – paperwork, scheduling maintenance, that sort of thing. But there’s also some physical stuff involved – checking the building, fixing small things, walking around the property. It's… not terribly strenuous normally, but it requires being on my feet a lot. Lately, even that is tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to perform a quick physical examination. We’ll check your reflexes, strength, and take a look at your eyes more closely. Please have a seat on the table.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. That sounds good, Doctor. I’m ready whenever you are. I hope you don’t mind, but… is there anything particularly worrying you at this point? I always get anxious when doctors start asking questions.
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions. We’re simply gathering information. However, given your description – the weakness, the eyelid drooping, the gradual onset – we need to rule out several possibilities. I will need to assess your neurological function. Now, if you would just relax your arms at your sides.
PATIENT: Alright, neurological function… yes, of course. Is that… is that serious, Doctor? I apologize for asking, I just… I prefer to know what we’re looking at. And is it something I should have done anything about sooner? I haven’t seen a doctor in… well, quite some time.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are… slightly diminished. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Now, I want you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. And don’t hesitate to tell me if you experience any pain. Grip strength is…weak. Significantly below average for someone your age. It’s concerning. Now, please push your hands against mine. Resist my force.
PATIENT: I'm trying, Doctor. It is harder than it should be. It feels… like I'm pushing through something thick. Is that… normal? I apologize if I'm not doing it right. I haven't really done this before. It's like my arms just… give out.
DOCTOR: It's not a matter of doing it wrong, Mr. Schaust. The resistance is… inadequate. This, combined with the diminished reflexes and weak grip strength, suggests… potential neuromuscular involvement. Now, let's examine your eyes. Please look straight ahead. Pupils are… normal. However, there is some… ptosis – drooping – in both eyelids, more pronounced on the right side. Now, I want you to follow my finger with your eyes, don’t blink. Eye movements are… slightly restricted. Not dramatically, but noticeable. This is… not encouraging.
PATIENT: I'm trying, Doctor. It feels… a little difficult to keep my eyes open, to be honest. And… it feels like my eyes are tired, even though I haven’t been doing anything strenuous. Is it possible… could it be something like a vitamin deficiency? I've been eating mostly pre-prepared meals lately, I confess. Not a very balanced diet. I apologize for rambling. I just… I'm worried.
DOCTOR: While a vitamin deficiency could contribute, it’s unlikely to be the sole cause of these findings, Mr. Schaust. We need to rule out more serious possibilities. Now, I'm going to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and specifically, a test for acetylcholine receptors. It will help to determine if you have an autoimmune condition affecting the neuromuscular junction. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I also recommend an electromyography – an EMG – to assess the electrical activity of your muscles. It's the most definitive way to diagnose neuromuscular disorders. We’ll also want to perform a CT scan of your chest to rule out any underlying tumors that could be contributing. I'm referring you to a neurologist immediately. These tests need to be performed as soon as possible. I will provide you with a referral note. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A neurologist… and all those tests… CT scan… acetylcholine receptors… That sounds… very serious, Doctor. Is it… is it something like… muscular dystrophy? Or… something even worse? I understand you don’t want me to jump to conclusions, but it’s difficult not to. And… how long will it take to get the results? Will I… will I be able to work? I apologize for asking so many questions. I'm just… terrified.
DOCTOR: Let’s not resort to speculation, Mr. Schaust. It could be a number of things. We haven’t even diagnosed anything yet. Jumping to conclusions will only cause unnecessary stress. As for your ability to work, that will depend on the results of the tests. I will need to see the neurologist’s findings before I can advise you. I understand you’re anxious, but we need to remain pragmatic. I'm referring you to Dr. Anya Volkov, a highly respected neurologist at City General Hospital. She's excellent. The tests will take some time – a few days for the blood work, a week or so for the EMG and CT scan results. You’ll need to schedule the appointments as soon as possible. Here. This note contains all the necessary information. I’m not going to sugarcoat this, Mr. Schaust. These symptoms warrant prompt investigation. Delaying treatment could have serious consequences. I suggest you contact Dr. Volkov immediately. Now, do you have any other questions before I excuse you?
PATIENT: A week… a week to wait… No, I… I don't think so. Not right now. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I’ll contact Dr. Volkov immediately. I just… I hope it’s not anything too serious. Thank you again.
