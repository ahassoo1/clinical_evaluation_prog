DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Well… I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come and see what is happening. It’s… not a lot, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Weichers. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is definitely something we need to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it started maybe three days ago? At first, I just thought it was a really bad cough, but then I saw the… the red. It’s bright red, and it usually happens when I cough hard in the morning. Not every time, but most mornings now. It’s not a huge amount, like… maybe a teaspoon each time? I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A teaspoon is helpful information. And it's good you noticed it's primarily in the mornings. Has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been a little more tired than usual, yes. And maybe a little short of breath when I walk up the stairs. But I thought that was just because it is very hot lately. No fever, no chest pain, nothing like that. Just the tiredness and a little trouble breathing sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any weight loss recently, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: Weight loss… not that I have noticed, no. I haven't been weighing myself regularly. My appetite has been normal, I think. I eat about the same as always. But… my clothes feel a little looser, now that you mention it. But I thought that was just the summer heat making me sweat more.
DOCTOR: Alright. And in terms of your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any lung conditions, like asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I have been very healthy, usually. I had the flu a few times, like everyone, but nothing serious. And I had a broken arm when I was a child, but that’s it. My husband… he had some heart trouble, but that was many years ago. I haven't had any problems with my lungs before, Doctor. I don't smoke, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Weichers. And you've never been exposed to a lot of dust or fumes at work or at home?
PATIENT: No, not really. I am a physical therapist, so I mostly work with people, helping them with their exercises. Sometimes there is dust in the gym, but it’s not too bad. And at home… I keep things very clean. No, I don’t think I have been around anything that would bother my lungs. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is, Ms. Weichers, it helps us narrow down the possibilities. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: I only take one medication. It is for my blood pressure. The name is… Lisinopril, I think? And sometimes I take Tylenol for headaches, but that’s not very often. Otherwise, no, nothing else. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. Is that enough information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Weichers. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not have any allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My husband was allergic to bee stings, but I am not. No, I can eat anything, and I have never had a problem with any medicine. I hope that is everything, Doctor? I am a little worried, if you don't mind me saying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Weichers, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. Thank you for providing me with all of that information. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Please do. I trust you. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what is happening, and what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly. Good. Now another deep breath... and exhale. I'm listening to your lungs now. I do hear some mild wheezing in the lower lobes, particularly on the left side. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. Your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is within a normal range. I'm also going to check your lymph nodes. They feel normal. Finally, I'm going to percuss your chest to assess the resonance. There is some dullness in the lower left lobe. Based on this preliminary exam, there are some findings that warrant further investigation. The wheezing, dullness, and coughing up blood are concerning.
PATIENT: Oh dear. What does that mean, Doctor? What kind of investigation? Is it… is it something bad? I am a little scared now. The dullness… that sounds serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Weichers. It's natural to be scared when you hear things like that. The dullness could indicate fluid in the lung, or a possible mass, but it's important not to jump to conclusions. It could also be something less serious. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a chest X-ray and a CT scan of your chest. The X-ray will give us a basic view of your lungs, and the CT scan will provide a more detailed image. I’ll also order a sputum culture to check for any infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Please do whatever you think is necessary to find out what is happening. A CT scan… is that painful? Will it take long? And the sputum culture… what does that involve? I just want to know what I am dealing with, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining things to me.
DOCTOR: The CT scan is not painful at all, Ms. Weichers. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It's very similar to an X-ray, but it takes more detailed pictures. It typically takes about 15-20 minutes. We may ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds at a time during the scan. As for the sputum culture, it involves coughing up a sample of mucus from your lungs. A respiratory therapist will guide you through the process. You’ll take a deep breath and cough forcefully into a sterile container. It may take a few attempts to get a good sample. I'm going to write an order for these tests now, and the front desk will schedule them for you. The results will usually be available within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I would like to prescribe you an inhaler to help with the wheezing and shortness of breath. It’s an albuterol inhaler. It's a bronchodilator which will help open up your airways. Would you like me to explain how to use it?
PATIENT: Yes, please explain the inhaler. I have never used one before. And 24-48 hours… that seems like a long time to wait. Is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Any symptoms that mean I should come back sooner? Thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor. I am very nervous.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Weichers. It's perfectly normal to be nervous. The inhaler is quite simple to use. You'll shake the inhaler well, then take a deep breath and exhale completely. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth, creating a tight seal with your lips. As you start to inhale slowly, press down on the inhaler to release the medication. Continue inhaling deeply for about 5-10 seconds, then hold your breath for another 10 seconds. Repeat this process one or two more times as needed. It's important to rinse your mouth with water after each use to prevent thrush, a yeast infection in the mouth. Now, regarding what to look out for: If you experience any of the following symptoms, please come back to the emergency room immediately: worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, a high fever , or if you start coughing up a significant amount of blood—more than a few teaspoons. If your symptoms remain stable, you can follow up with me in a few days once we have the results of the tests. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that is very clear, Doctor. Thank you. More than a few teaspoons… I will remember that. And I will rinse my mouth. So, the tests, and the inhaler… and then we wait. It is a little scary, but I feel better knowing what to do. Thank you again for explaining everything so thoroughly. Should I go to the front desk now to schedule the tests?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I understand your apprehension, and I want to assure you we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Yes, please head to the front desk, and they will schedule your chest X-ray and CT scan. They may also need to collect a urine sample for a general health assessment. Here is a written prescription for the albuterol inhaler, and a summary of the instructions we discussed today. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You have been very helpful, and I feel much more prepared now. Thank you again for everything. I will go to the front desk now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I hope the tests provide us with some answers. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day as well. .
