DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe it’s a… a cosmetic procedure? My husband… he would have helped me remember the details, but… it’s for clearance, I understand? To make sure I’m healthy enough for it. It’s all a bit… hazy, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mackenzi, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like you're here for a pre-operative evaluation for an elective surgery. Do you recall what surgery you are considering?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… the part I struggle with most. I think it has to do with my face? Perhaps… lifting? Or tightening? It was something my husband and I discussed for quite some time. He did all the research, and honestly, I just… trusted his judgment. I’m afraid I wasn’t very involved in the specifics. Is that terribly unhelpful?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mackenzi. It's quite common for patients to have a leading partner in these decisions. Knowing it involves your face is a good start. Do you remember where the surgery would be performed, or the name of the surgeon?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… vaguely recall a name. Dr. Alvarez? Yes, that sounds right. Dr. Alvarez… and the clinic was… not too far from the city center, I believe? It was a very modern building, lots of glass. I went for a consultation… just the one, I think. He was very kind, explained everything… but again, I was mostly listening to my husband ask the questions. I'm so sorry I can’t be more precise. My memory has been… unreliable since… everything.
DOCTOR: Dr. Alvarez… okay, let me see. Ah, yes. Dr. Ricardo Alvarez, Facial Aesthetics Clinic. That matches your description. Okay, that's helpful. So, you've had a consultation with Dr. Alvarez regarding a facial procedure. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, Dr. Alvarez! Thank goodness you found him. As for my health… well, I try to eat a balanced diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. I walk a bit, not as much as I used to. I have… had some issues with my blood pressure in the past, but it’s been managed with medication for a few years now. Just a small dose, my regular doctor prescribes it. Other than that… I don’t really recall anything significant. Do you need to know about allergies or… anything else? I feel like I’m forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: Okay, managed hypertension is good to know. And yes, allergies are important, as are any medications you’re currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication. Have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… I think I’m allergic to penicillin, yes. I had a reaction as a child, a rash, I believe. As for surgeries… let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was young, and… and I had a C-section with my son, of course. Other than that… nothing comes to mind. It’s really frustrating, I apologize. I feel like my mind is… foggy. Everything before… well, it all feels distant now. Could the surgery be affecting my memory? I haven’t thought of that.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mackenzi. We'll take things slowly. Penicillin allergy noted, and the tonsillectomy and C-section are good to know. It is possible that stress or changes in your life could contribute to memory issues, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions. We will get to the bottom of this. Could you tell me what medications you are currently taking, including the blood pressure medication, and what dosage you take?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. The blood pressure medication… let me see if I have it written down. Ah, here we are. It’s Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, in the morning. And… that’s it, I think. Just that. I also take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s not regular. It depends if I’ve been eating well that week, truthfully. It's not prescribed, just over-the-counter.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. And the multivitamin, that's not a concern. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any family history of significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question. My mother… she had high blood pressure as well, later in life. And my father… he had something with his heart, I think. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to him. I believe he had a blockage, and needed… some sort of procedure? I’m terribly vague, I know. And my brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. He lives in Bogotá, we don't speak very often. I feel like I'm failing this examination. Is it alright if I call my brother later? Perhaps he can recall more details.
DOCTOR: You're not failing anything, Mackenzi. It's perfectly understandable that you don't have all the details readily available, especially given everything you've been through. Calling your brother later is a good idea, if you feel it would be helpful. Now, one last quick question before we move on to a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he tried it once, a very long time ago, but he didn’t enjoy it. As for alcohol… I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps once a month. And recreational drugs? Never. I… I’ve always been very careful about my health, even before… well, you know. Is that satisfactory? I hope I’m not being too much trouble. It’s just… difficult to think straight sometimes. .
DOCTOR: You are not being any trouble at all, Mackenzi. That’s very helpful to know. Just a glass of wine occasionally. Alright. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam to assess your overall health and ensure you're a suitable candidate for surgery. We'll just check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and take a quick look at your throat, just to be thorough. Is that alright with you?
