DOCTOR: Hi Manuel, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. My wife… she wants… a baby. We want to try, but we are… older now. I think we need to… check things? Maybe? I forget so easily these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You and your wife are thinking about starting a family, and you’re wondering if it's safe and healthy given your ages. That’s a very sensible thing to consider. I see you're 70 years old, Manuel. And your wife's age?
PATIENT: Seventy… yes, that’s right. My wife… hmm. She is… a little younger. Sixty-two, I think? Or maybe sixty-three? It's hard to remember exactly. We have been married a long time, you see. A very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that helps. Sixty-two or sixty-three. Alright, Manuel. Starting a family at your ages does come with some increased risks, for both you and your wife. It's not impossible, but we need to be very thorough. First, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor?
PATIENT: A doctor… yes. Sometimes. Not always regular. Mostly for… little things. A cough. A pain. Nothing big. I have Medicare, you see. They… they help. I forget the doctor's name… a nice woman, I think. I have not been very sick, though. Mostly just… old. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Manuel. And that's good that you haven't had any serious illnesses. Let’s try to get a more complete picture. Do you have any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else that you've been told you have?
PATIENT: Hmm… High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor said something about that… a long time ago. I take a little pill… a white one… every day. For my… pressure. Other than that… I don't think so. My heart… feels okay. Sometimes a little fast, but… old age, maybe? I do not have… what you said? Diabetes? No. I like sweet tea, but… no diabetes.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with a white pill. That’s good to know. And no diabetes. Do you know the name of the pill you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No… I don’t. It is… small and white. The doctor gives it to me. I just take it every morning. I… I am not good with names, Doctor. Never was. My wife remembers everything, but… she is not here now. I should ask her… but I forgot what the name of the pill is already! It is… frustrating, this getting old.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating, Manuel, and it's perfectly okay to not remember. We can look it up based on your Medicare records, don't worry. Let's move on to past surgeries. Have you ever had any operations or been hospitalized for anything other than a short stay?
PATIENT: Hospital… hmm. A long time ago… when I was younger. I broke my arm, playing football. They… fixed it. And… maybe my appendix? When I was a young man. That is all I remember, Doctor. Nothing serious since then. Just… a little cough now and then. And aches. Old man aches.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm and an appendectomy in your youth. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else that your parents or siblings have had?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That is a hard one. My parents… they are both gone now. A long time ago. My mother… she died young, I think. Something with her heart. I don't remember exactly. And my father… he was strong, but he had… trouble breathing when he got old. Maybe like asthma? I don't know. I didn't see my family much, you see. It’s… complicated. I don’t know much about their sicknesses, Doctor. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Manuel. It's perfectly understandable that you don't have a lot of information. We'll work with what we have. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. Never. Smoke? Terrible! Makes you sick. Alcohol… a little wine sometimes, with dinner. Very little. Just a sip. My wife likes it more than me. And… drugs? Never. I am an old man, Doctor. I like tea and… making things. That is all. A quiet life. No bad habits.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Manuel. Alright, before we move on to a physical exam, let's quickly talk about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I am in the garden, with the flowers… but that is just… bugs, maybe? I don't take many medicines. My wife is careful about that. I don’t think I have any bad allergies, Doctor. I eat most things. Just… not too much sugar. Makes my teeth ache!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… physical? Yes, alright. If you think it is important. I am an old man, Doctor. Not much to see, I expect. But… if it helps… yes. Go ahead. Be gentle, please. My bones are… not as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Manuel. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's just re-check your blood pressure… and it’s 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. And your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, I'm just going to listen to your belly. Sounds normal. Now let's check your reflexes... A little diminished, but that’s also common with age. I’m also going to take a look in your ears, nose and throat... Ears look clear, and your throat looks fine. Finally, I'm going to check your feet... Some mild swelling in your ankles, and slightly reduced sensation in your feet. It’s something we should keep an eye on. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Now, do you have any questions for me before we discuss next steps?
PATIENT: Swelling… in my ankles? I have noticed that, lately. I thought it was just… getting old. Diminished… sensation? I can still feel things, Doctor. I make things with my hands, you see. Tiny things! But… maybe not as well as before. Next steps? What does that mean? Are we… not going to have a baby? Is my wife too old too? I am worried, Doctor. We have waited a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand your worries, Manuel, and it’s good that you’re asking these questions. The swelling in your ankles and the reduced sensation in your feet are common with age and could be related to circulation. But it’s important to monitor it. As for having a baby… it’s not impossible, but it does come with increased risks, for both you and your wife, given your ages. There's a higher chance of complications during pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and genetic issues. It’s important to have a very thorough evaluation to assess the risks. I recommend you both see a specialist – a reproductive endocrinologist – for a full assessment. They can do specific tests to evaluate your wife’s egg quality and your sperm quality. They can also discuss the potential risks and benefits of trying to conceive with you both in detail. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: A… specialist? Tests? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. My wife… she will worry. She is very… practical. She will want to know all the risks. And if it’s too risky… she will be sad. A referral… yes, please. If you think it is best. But… what if it’s bad news, Doctor? What if we are just too old? I don't want to cause my wife any pain. She deserves happiness. I just want… a little family. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely not too much to ask, Manuel. And it’s very thoughtful of you to be so concerned about your wife’s well-being. It's completely understandable to be worried about potential bad news, but the specialist will provide you both with all the information you need to make an informed decision. They can also discuss alternative options, if necessary. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected reproductive endocrinologist in the city. Here is the referral form with Dr. Vance’s contact information. I’ll also have my nurse give you some information pamphlets about fertility and risks associated with later-in-life pregnancies. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden swelling in your ankles, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Dr. Vance… yes. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being so kind. Information pamphlets… yes, that would be good. My wife… she likes to read. Sudden swelling… chest pain? Oh dear. I will tell her. It’s… a lot to take in. I think… I think that is all, Doctor. Thank you for listening. You have been very patient.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Manuel. I’m glad I could help. Remember, taking things one step at a time is best. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself and your wife. Have a good day, Manuel. .
