DOCTOR: Alright, Yamir, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Good to meet you too, Doctor... Auelua, right? I here for… fitness check. For referee. I want to be referee, need check I okay. Quick check is good.
DOCTOR: Yes, Auelua is right. And a fitness check for refereeing, excellent! We can definitely do that. So, just to clarify, you're looking for a general health assessment to make sure you're fit to work as a referee?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. Work as referee. Not… bricklaying. That is old job. This… different. Need run, stand long time. No heavy lift, but… quick moves. Is that okay? You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. A very different physical demand than bricklaying! Running, standing for long periods, quick movements… That’s helpful to know. Let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries… yes. Old back pain. From bricklaying. Many years ago. Doctor fix it. Now okay, mostly. And… wife. She… sick. She passed last year. That is… big thing. No injury from that, but… makes me tired sometimes. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: That is important, Yamir. I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. Grief can definitely have a physical impact, and it's good you mentioned that. It absolutely affects your overall health. We'll factor that in. Regarding your back, "fixed" is good to hear, but can you tell me a little more about what happened with it?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Thank you. Back… many years. Heavy lift, wrong way. Doctor gave… pills. And… stretching. Then… surgery. Small surgery. Back is strong now. No pain when I walk, or… normal things. Sometimes, if I bend very far, I feel little… pull. Not bad. Just… reminder. Is that… enough detail? I no good at talking about this.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Yamir. And don’t worry about being “good at talking about it” – you're doing just fine. So, surgery, some stretching, and occasional mild discomfort with extreme bending. That gives me a good picture. Do you currently have any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else a doctor has told you about?
PATIENT: No. No high… what you say? Blood… pressure? No. And no sugar problem. Doctor check me after wife… passed. Everything normal. Just… sad. I think that is problem. Not… medical. I take some pills for sleep sometimes. But only when I cannot sleep. Small pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no ongoing medical conditions, and a recent check-up after your wife’s passing came back normal. The sleep medication is good to know – what’s the name of that, and how often do you find you need to take it?
PATIENT: Uh… name is… Zopiclone. Small white pill. I take… maybe two, three times a month? When I think too much. When I remember… things. Then I cannot sleep. Is not every night. Just… sometimes. I try not to take it. It make me feel… slow next day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zopiclone as needed, two or three times a month for trouble sleeping related to remembering things. And you’ve noticed it can make you feel a bit slow the next day. Good to know you’re mindful of that. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family… uh. Mother, she have… heart problem. Many years ago. She okay now. Take pills. Father, he… no problem. Strong man. Sister… she have… I think… nothing. Normal. We not talk much about… medical things. Is not… custom. Is enough detail? I not sure.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Yamir. It sounds like your mother had a heart condition, and your father and sister were generally healthy. It's very common for families not to discuss medical history much, so don’t worry about it. Just a couple more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I eat… everything. No problem with… plants, or… food, or… pills. I take pills when I sick. No reaction. Just… make me better. Is simple. Can we… finish now? I want to be referee. This check… long.
DOCTOR: That's excellent news about the allergies, and I understand your eagerness to get back to preparing for refereeing. We are almost finished. Just a quick physical exam to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. It won't take long, I promise. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Quick is good. Let's do. I ready. Where I… stand?
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just step onto the scale for me, please. Then we’ll take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It's all very straightforward. Okay, your weight is 134 pounds, and your blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is perfectly normal. Now, if you could just loosen your shirt, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. I breathe. Normal. Is… cold. I feel little… nervous now. Referee is important to me. I want to be good referee.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear and normal with your heart and lungs, Yamir. Your reflexes are good as well. Just a quick check of your range of motion… Can you reach for your toes?
PATIENT: A little… tight. Old back. Not bad. Just… feel it little. Can I… sit down now? Is… enough? I think I okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. A little tightness in your back is understandable. Overall, everything looks very good. Your physical exam is normal. Given your history and the exam findings, I think you're fit to work as a referee. However, given the occasional back discomfort, I recommend doing some gentle stretching exercises before and after any strenuous activity, and listening to your body. If you experience any significant pain, stop and rest. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Thank you, Doctor. Is… fast. And… good. I go now? I start… referee training. I happy.
DOCTOR: Excellent! I'm glad I could help, Yamir. You're very welcome. Yes, please go ahead and start your referee training. And remember to listen to your body. If you have any concerns in the future, don't hesitate to schedule an appointment. Take care, Yamir.
