DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Well, my tummy feels... big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. It’s just… not very good. I feel full quickly. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, “tummy feels big” and not much appetite… and feeling full quickly. Alright. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That's… a good question. It feels like a long time now. Maybe… a few months? Or was it longer? Everything feels a little blurry these days, you know. It wasn't sudden, not like a pain that just happened. Just… slowly getting bigger, and less hungry. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Soila. A slow change is helpful to know. And you haven't noticed any pain with this, just the fullness and less appetite?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. Sometimes a little… uncomfortable, maybe? When I lie down, it feels… heavy. But not painful. Just… there. And like you said, not much wanting to eat. Mostly just… tea. I like my tea. Is it okay if I keep drinking tea?
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just fullness and heaviness when lying down, and decreased appetite. Tea is fine, Soila. We just need to figure out why you're not feeling hungry and why your tummy feels big. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – constipation, diarrhea, anything like that?
PATIENT: Bowel… movements? Oh, dear. That's… a personal question, isn't it? Well… I go to the bathroom. Yes. But… is it different? Hmm… maybe a little less often than before? I used to… well, I don’t remember exactly how often, but it feels like longer now. Everything is just… slow these days. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Soila. Less frequent bowel movements can be a clue. And it’s perfectly okay to talk about this – it helps me understand what's going on. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea… vomiting? Oh… no, not really. I haven’t… thrown up. And I don't feel… sick to my stomach, not exactly. Sometimes a little weak, but that could just be… old age, you know? I get tired easily. I haven’t been sick, though. Not like with the flu or anything. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain... everything feels a little mixed up.
DOCTOR: Alright, no nausea or vomiting, just weakness, and decreased appetite with a feeling of fullness and less frequent bowel movements. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Oh, dear. I haven’t been weighing myself. I used to… when my husband was alive. But… it's been a long time. I suppose my clothes feel a little… looser? But maybe that's just because I'm not eating as much. I don't really know. It's hard to tell, isn’t it? Everything just feels… different these days. I'm not as strong as I used to be, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's helpful that you've noticed your clothes feel looser. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, dear. That was a long time ago. Let me see… I had… the usual things, I suppose. When I was younger, I had… I had a bad flu once, a very bad one. And my arthritis, it bothers me sometimes. My knees, mostly. And… oh, what else? I used to go to the doctor a lot more, but… it's all a bit blurry. I don’t think anything serious, not really. Just old age things, you know? I don’t remember any big diagnoses. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis and a bad flu in the past. And nothing major diagnosed. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh… let me see. I think… yes. When I was young, I had my tonsils out. A long, long time ago. And… oh, I think I had something on my eye once, a little growth, and they… took it off. But that was also a very long time ago. I don’t think anything else. Nothing big, not like a hip replacement or anything. Does that make sense? It's hard to remember all the details. Everything was so long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out and a growth removed from your eye. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any serious illnesses, like cancer or heart disease?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, dear. That was a long time ago, and my family… we didn’t talk much about illnesses. My mother… she died when I was young, from… something. I don’t remember exactly what. And my father… he had a bad heart, I think. He was always tired. And my sister… she had something with her stomach, a long time ago. But I don’t remember the details. We didn’t go to doctors much, back then. It’s all a bit blurry, I’m afraid. I wish I could remember more. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: Alright, mother died young from something, father had a bad heart, and sister had a stomach issue. Okay. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Not me. I never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink alcohol. Never liked it. And… recreational drugs? Oh, goodness no. I'm an old woman. I drink my tea, that's all. And maybe a little bit of soup sometimes. Is that alright? Do doctors not like tea?
DOCTOR: No, tea is perfectly fine, Soila. It’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medication in my life. A little bit for my arthritis sometimes, but nothing serious. I don’t get hives or anything like that. I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything. I think I’m pretty healthy, for an old woman. Do you think so?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, let me see. I take… a little pill for my arthritis, sometimes, when my knees bother me. It’s… a small white pill. I don't remember the name. And I take a vitamin, a multivitamin, every morning. Just to keep healthy, you know? That’s about it. Nothing else. Do you need to know what the arthritis pill is called? I can ask my neighbor, she helps me with things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small white pill for arthritis and a multivitamin. We can try to find out the name of the arthritis pill later. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Yes, that’s alright. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. My abdomen… is that where my tummy is? It feels a little… full, as I said. And I am a little bit tired, so if I close my eyes, don’t be alarmed. Just wake me when you’re finished. Do you need me to lie down?
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. No need to worry. We’ll just start with listening to your heart and lungs. You can stay seated for now. Take some nice, deep breaths for me… in and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs sound clear, but a little diminished breath sounds on both sides. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. Is this okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright. It's just a little… tender, maybe? On the lower part, where my tummy is. Not really painful, just… uncomfortable. Like a little pressure. It feels… bigger there, as I said. It’s probably just old age, isn’t it? Everything feels… different these days. Do you feel anything?
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. I'm feeling some fullness in your lower abdomen, and it’s a little tender to the touch. It doesn’t feel like anything acutely painful, but it’s definitely enlarged. No masses are immediately palpable, and it’s not rigid. I’m also checking for any rebound tenderness… I’m going to listen to your abdomen now. Bowel sounds are present, but a little quiet. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam for now. You can sit back up when you're ready. Everything is a little quiet, which could be normal. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, I want to order a couple of tests to get a better idea of what’s going on. How does getting some blood work and an abdominal ultrasound sound?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an ultrasound… Oh, dear. That sounds… complicated. But if you think it's best, Doctor, I trust you. I just… don’t like needles. And I’ve never had an ultrasound before. What will it show? Will it hurt? I just want to know what's wrong with my tummy. And… how long will it take? I have a tea appointment with my neighbor later…
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Soila. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about tests. The blood work will help us check your overall health and rule out any infections. The ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of your organs, and it doesn’t hurt at all – it’s similar to getting a pregnancy scan. It will show us what's causing the fullness in your abdomen. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. We can schedule the tests for tomorrow morning. It shouldn’t interfere with your tea appointment, unless it takes a very long time. While we wait for the results, I'm going to prescribe a stool softener to help with the constipation. And I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, even if it’s just your tea. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A stool softener… and more tea… Yes, that sounds… alright. As long as it doesn’t hurt. And if it won’t interfere with my tea… Tomorrow morning… Yes, that’s fine. I'll ask my neighbor to help me get there. Will you tell me what's wrong when the results come back? I just want to know what's happening to my tummy. And… thank you, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate your help. I'm a little scared, but I trust you. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. You're very welcome. We will definitely go over the results as soon as they are available, and I’ll explain everything to you in detail. It's perfectly normal to be scared, but we're going to figure this out together. I'll have my nurse schedule the tests for you and give you a prescription for the stool softener. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
