DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm one of the internal medicine physicians here. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. It's… well. My throat. It hurts. Very annoying, it is. I don’t have time for this, honestly. Is this going to be long?
DOCTOR: I understand, and I’ll certainly try to be efficient. Sore throats are definitely disruptive. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? It hurts when I swallow. And… it feels scratchy. Like sandpaper, maybe? I don’t know. It just hurts. I’ve had it for… a few days, I think. Not a lot of time to think about it, you understand. Work is busy.
DOCTOR: I do understand being busy makes it difficult to focus on these things. Okay, so it’s been hurting for a few days, and you’ve noticed pain with swallowing and a scratchy sensation. Has this been getting progressively worse, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Same, I think. It hasn't gotten better, certainly. But no… worse, either. Just… there. It’s… a nuisance. Honestly, I don’t know why I even bothered coming in. It’s probably just a cold. People get colds, don't they?
DOCTOR: You’re right, many sore throats are just from colds. We still want to take a quick look to be sure, just to rule out anything else. Have you noticed any fever, cough, or runny nose accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever… no. I don't think so. I didn't bother checking. I don't have time to sit around with a thermometer. Cough? A little, maybe? Just a small one, every now and then. Nothing important. And… no, not runny. Definitely not. Just the throat. And it’s irritating me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever or significant cough or runny nose. Just primarily the sore throat. Have you noticed any white spots or pus on the back of your throat, or any difficulty breathing or swallowing fluids?
PATIENT: Pus? Goodness. No, I haven't looked. I don't poke around in my own throat, doctor. That seems… unsanitary. And difficulty breathing? No. I'm breathing perfectly fine, thank you. I wouldn’t be here if I couldn't breathe.
DOCTOR: Of course, you're right. We'll certainly take a look then. I'm going to use a light and tongue depressor to examine your throat. Please just open wide and say “ah.” Okay. I see some mild redness in the back of your throat, but no visible pus or significant swelling. Your tonsils don't appear enlarged. It looks a bit irritated, but overall, it doesn’t seem particularly severe. Now, I'm going to feel your neck for any swollen lymph nodes.
PATIENT: Swollen… what? Nodes? You're poking around now? Honestly, this is taking far too long. I have things to do. Are you finding anything? Just tell me if it's serious or not. I really don't need a detailed explanation of my… nodes.
DOCTOR: I'm feeling a few slightly tender lymph nodes in your neck, but they’re not significantly enlarged. They’re often a bit swollen with any kind of throat irritation. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds most likely like a viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat caused by a virus. However, because you haven’t had a fever and I’m concerned about the duration, I'd like to do a quick strep test just to rule out a bacterial infection. It’s a simple swab of the back of your throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Swab? Oh, lovely. Another poke. Must you? I suppose if it gets me out of here faster… Fine. Just… be quick about it. I have important things to manage, you understand. And it had better be negative.
DOCTOR: Alright, this will only take a moment. Just open wide and say "ah." … Okay, all done. We'll have the results in a few minutes. While we wait, do you have any allergies to medications, and are you currently taking anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don’t have time for allergies. Never had them. And medications? No. I don’t take anything. Never needed to. A strong constitution, I have. And, honestly, doctor, how long is this going to be? I really can't sit here all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or medications. That’s good to know. Alright, the results are back… and it's negative. So, it doesn’t appear to be strep throat. As I mentioned before, it’s most likely a viral pharyngitis. Treatment is mostly supportive. Rest, drink plenty of fluids – warm tea with honey can be soothing – and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with the discomfort. Avoid anything too irritating to your throat. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Supportive? Meaning… it just goes away on its own? Well. That’s… disappointing. And I told you it was just a cold! No. No questions. Just… is there anything I need to avoid? Work is demanding, you see. I can't just stop everything because of a sore throat.
DOCTOR: You’re right, often it will resolve on its own. While you don’t need to stop working entirely, try to minimize straining your voice if possible. And definitely stay hydrated. Generally, viral pharyngitis lasts about a week to ten days. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within that timeframe, or if you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or severe difficulty swallowing, please come back in to see me, or go to urgent care. I'm going to give you a brief written summary of these instructions. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: A week to ten days? Honestly. Well. Very well. No. That is all. I really must be going. Thank you… I suppose. And please, try not to poke people in the throat for fun.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. I understand your frustration. Here's that summary. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
