DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's this pain I've been having. It's been bothering me for a little while now, and it just hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say "a little while," can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Probably... about three weeks now? Maybe a little longer. It started kinda slow, just a dull ache, and now it's... well, painful, like you asked. It's hard to keep track of time, you know? Especially when it's bothering you.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, alright. And where exactly is this pain located?
PATIENT: It's... mostly in my lower back, right here. But sometimes it feels like it shoots down my leg a little bit, on the left side. Not all the way down, just kinda in the upper part of my thigh. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Radiating pain. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It's not always hurting. But when I move a certain way, or if I'm standing for too long, that's when it really flares up. Sitting's not so bad, actually. But lifting things... forget about it. Ouch.
DOCTOR: So, worse with movement and lifting, better with sitting. Have you tried anything to relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit. My wife, she gave me some of that... what's it called? Bengay, I think? It helps a little, for a bit, but it doesn't really last. And I've been trying to take it easy, not do too much around the house. I don't know what else to do, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. No numbness or tingling, nothing like that. Just the pain. I sleep okay, I guess. Maybe a little restless sometimes because of it, but nothing too bad. I haven't noticed anything else being different.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's go over some general health questions. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never been diagnosed with anything like that. I try to eat pretty well, mostly rice and fish, you know, Filipino food. And I walk a little bit when the weather is nice. I haven’t really been to the doctor much over the years, to be honest. That's probably why I didn't mention anything sooner.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. Just the usual childhood illnesses, I think. Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago, but that’s about it. Honestly, I haven't been sick much in a long time. This pain is really… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family history... Let me see. My mother, she had arthritis when she got older, in her hands mostly. And my father, he had some problems with his heart, but that was when he was pretty old too. I don't know if any of that matters. It was a long time ago, and I don't really know much about the details. My wife might know more.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Just that Bengay, when it gets really bad. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. I try to avoid them as much as possible. I prefer to just tough things out, usually. It's probably why I waited so long to come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Mr. Way, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat on your back, and I’ll take a look. I’m going to gently press on your back in a few different places. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Alright, let’s start here. Does this hurt?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. That one hurts a little. Not terrible, but... yeah, definitely sore right there. It feels kinda tight, too. Like a knot. Is that... normal?
DOCTOR: Tightness and tenderness present in the lumbar region. And what about if I ask you to lift your leg straight up in the air while lying flat?
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go... Hmm. It's a little uncomfortable. Not a sharp pain, but it stretches something... down the back of my leg. It's not as bad as when I actually try to lift something heavy, but I can feel it. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Positive straight leg raise test on the left side, reproducing pain down the posterior leg. Now, can you try to stand up and lean forward and touch your toes, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Okay. Oof. That's... not good. It really hurts when I try to go further. It's mostly in my lower back, but I can feel it going down my leg again. Not terrible, but definitely there. I haven't been this stiff in a long time.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion with forward flexion, pain exacerbated with bending. Alright, Mr. Way. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain, possibly with some mild nerve impingement. The straight leg raise suggests some irritation of the sciatic nerve. It's not an emergency, but it is important to address.
PATIENT: Okay... a strain. That doesn't sound too bad. So, what does that mean? What do I need to do to get better? Will I need… medicine? I really don’t like taking pills, Doctor. And what about my wife? She's worried, you know. She's the one who made me come in.
DOCTOR: It means the muscles in your lower back are stretched or torn. The sciatic nerve irritation is what’s causing the pain down your leg. It’s common, especially as we get older. Now, about medication... While I understand your reluctance, a short course of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen or naproxen could help reduce the inflammation and pain. It’s not a long-term solution, just to get you over the hump. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. However, medication alone won't fix this. The most important thing is physical therapy. It will strengthen your core muscles, improve your flexibility, and teach you proper body mechanics to prevent this from happening again. I'm going to write you a prescription for the anti-inflammatory and a referral to a physical therapist. As for your wife, tell her to encourage you to actually do the exercises the physical therapist gives you. Compliance is key. It will take time and effort, but it's the best way to get you back to feeling yourself. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay... physical therapy. That sounds like a lot of work. And I guess I can try the pills, just for a little bit, if you think it will help. But I really don't want to get hooked on anything. My wife always worries about that, too. She's very careful about what we take. And how long will this take? Will I be able to get back to doing things around the house? I like to help my wife with the gardening, but I don’t want to make things worse. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like, are there any stretches I can do at home right now? I don’t want to just sit around and wait for the pills and the therapy to work.
DOCTOR: It won't be addictive if you take it as prescribed, Mr. Way. And the length of recovery depends on how diligent you are with the physical therapy. Most people see improvement within a few weeks, but it takes months for a full recovery. As for now, avoid heavy lifting, bending, and twisting. Don’t push yourself. I’m not going to give you a list of stretches right now. You’ll learn those from the physical therapist. Trying to do something on your own could actually make things worse. Frankly, I have other patients waiting. Here’s the prescription and the referral. Call the physical therapy office and schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Follow the instructions, and listen to your body. If the pain gets significantly worse, or you develop any numbness or weakness in your legs, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just... thank you, Doctor. I'll try to do everything you said. And I'll make sure my wife gets me to the physical therapy appointments. It's just… a lot to take in, you know? But I appreciate you explaining everything. I hope it gets better soon. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care, Mr. Way. Next! .
