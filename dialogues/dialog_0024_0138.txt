DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste any time. You're 83, which, frankly, is... a considerable age. So, tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Eighty-three years… seems like yesterday, honestly! Well, it’s… my legs, mostly. They just… sometimes feel weak. Not all the time, mind you. And my daughter, bless her heart, she worries something fierce. There's been… trouble like that in the family, you see. Headaches, and then… well, weakness on one side. It’s hard to remember exactly who it was, but it’s been a worry.
DOCTOR: "Trouble" is a rather vague descriptor, Ms. Tofani. And family history, while occasionally relevant, is often… overstated. Let's focus on you. You say your legs feel weak. Is this weakness constant, intermittent?
PATIENT: Oh, you're right, dear, "trouble" isn't very specific, is it? It comes and goes, the weakness. It’s not… every day. Some days I feel perfectly fine, walking around the house, doing my little chores. And then other days… well, it just feels like they aren’t quite mine. Hard to explain. It’s not pain, exactly. More like… heavy. And sometimes it feels like it’s just one leg, maybe? Honestly, it all blends together after a while. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: "Blends together," yes, unfortunately a common symptom of… advancing years. So, intermittent weakness, primarily in the legs, occasionally unilateral. Is this weakness associated with any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, well, sometimes… When my legs feel weak, I do get a bit of a headache. Not a terrible one, usually. More of a… pressure, behind my eyes. And… sometimes I feel a little dizzy. Not falling-down dizzy, just… woozy. It's hard to say if it's the legs making me dizzy, or the other way around, to be honest. Everything feels a bit connected, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Connected, yes, the human body is a remarkably… inefficient system. Headache and dizziness accompanying the weakness. Very well. Have you experienced any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… Well, now that you mention it… sometimes things look a little blurry. But I’ve always needed glasses, you know. I just… haven’t gotten around to updating the prescription. It’s probably just that. Old age, catching up with me, I suppose. I wouldn't know if it's new blurry, or just… regular blurry. It's all a bit of a haze.
DOCTOR: "A haze," predictably. Very well. Ms. Tofani, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Chronic conditions… Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, that was quite a fuss. And… the doctor said I had a touch of high blood pressure once, but it seemed to go away with a little bit of salt restriction. Nothing major, really. Oh, and arthritis, of course. All in my hands, mostly. Makes it hard to knit sometimes, which is a real shame. I don’t think that counts as a condition, though. More of an… annoyance.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, transient hypertension, and arthritis. Hardly a complicated case. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just this one, I think. The doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine, so he told me to take one of these every day. And… sometimes I take a little something for the arthritis, when my hands are really bothering me. Just ibuprofen, you know, the over-the-counter kind. Nothing special. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen. Excellent. Now, Ms. Tofani, I'm going to perform a brief neurological examination. Please just follow my instructions as best you can. Can you close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Just tell me what to do. I'll try my best. My eyes are a bit dry today, so bear with me if I blink a lot.
DOCTOR: Follow my finger with your eyes. Do not move your head. Good. Now, smile for me. And stick out your tongue. Alright. Now, I'm going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Is this alright? My eyes are feeling a bit tired. I'm trying my best! Here we go… Is that enough? It feels a bit difficult today, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's… adequate. Now, can you lift your arms?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Like this? It feels… heavy. It doesn’t want to stay up. Oh dear, it’s a bit wobbly, isn’t it? I'm trying my best, I really am.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that is… concerning. Ms. Tofani, I'm going to order a stat CT scan of your head to rule out any acute process. And I'm referring you to a neurologist immediately. It’s… imperative that we investigate this further. I suspect we're dealing with something more serious than simple age-related weakness. .
PATIENT: Oh dear. A scan? And… a neurologist? Is something very wrong, Doctor? Is it my legs? I just want to be able to walk around my house again… and maybe do a little knitting. Is it bad?
