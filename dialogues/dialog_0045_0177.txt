DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. Good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. It’s…something down there. A leak, you know? It’s been…a little bit. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. I don’t know what it is, exactly. It’s…well, it’s just wrong.
DOCTOR: "Down there," alright. And how long has this "leak," as you call it, been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Maybe…a month? Two? Time goes so fast, you know. I been busy with my art. Painting keeps me occupied. It's not like it's painful, just…annoying. And kinda embarrassing, to be honest. It’s not like a proper leak, more like…a drip. A small drip. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A drip, okay. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Definitely comes and goes. Mostly when…well, after I…you know. When a man visits. It’s been a little while since I had a visitor, mind you. Not that it matters! It just…happens sometimes after. And sometimes not. It’s very confusing. I don’t understand why it would do that. Is it…bad? It’s probably nothing, right?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. So, it’s associated with sexual activity. And you say it’s not constant, only after…well. Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I haven’t felt sick. No fever or nothin’. It doesn't hurt, like I said. Just…the drip. And it smells…funny. Not a good funny, you know? Like…old fish, maybe? Oh, and sometimes…sometimes it stings a little when I…when I go to the bathroom. But not always! It’s all very…unpredictable. I really don't like things being unpredictable. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no fever, occasional stinging with urination, and you've noticed an odor. "Old fish," you say. Okay. Now, have you experienced any changes in your…discharge, other than the dripping and odor?
PATIENT: Discharge? Oh, you mean…the leak? It's kinda…yellowish, I think. Not bright yellow, more like…old tea. And sometimes there's little…specks in it. Not big, just tiny. I don’t know what those are. Probably just…skin, maybe? I don't examine it too closely, you know. It’s…unladylike. I just wipe it up and forget about it. Mostly. But it keeps coming back! It’s very irritating. Are you sure it’s nothing serious? I been careful, I promise! Mostly.
DOCTOR: "Careful, mostly?
PATIENT: Well…I haven’t been with anyone regular. Just…occasional company. You know how it is. A lonely woman gets…lonely. And they all seem nice enough. I always ask them to…well, you know. To be careful. But you can’t always trust people, can you? It’s a dangerous world out there. And I'm an older woman, you know. They think they can take advantage. Not that I let them! But still…it’s worryin’. I just wish this would stop. It's undignified!
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, with all due respect, this sounds like a possible infection. And frankly, your…casual approach to safe practices is concerning. We need to get you tested. It could be something simple, but it could also be something more serious, and it's important to rule things out. Now, I'm going to need to perform a pelvic exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A test? Oh, goodness. A pelvic exam? That sounds…intrusive. I don’t like the sound of that at all. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, I told you, it's just a little drip! Maybe it'll go away on its own? I don't like doctors poking around. I'm an old woman, Doctor. It's…delicate. Can’t you just give me something for it? Some kind of cream, maybe? I’m sure it’s nothing serious. Honestly, I just want this over with. But a test…that sounds awful.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I understand your discomfort, but I'm not going to prescribe medication without knowing what we're treating. This isn't something I can just guess at. The exam will help us determine the cause of the symptoms, and we can then discuss appropriate treatment options. It is necessary. And it’s part of my job to ensure you receive the correct care. If you refuse the exam, I can't help you any further. Now, I assure you, I will be as gentle and professional as possible. Do you have any questions about the procedure?
PATIENT: Gentle? What does gentle even mean in this situation? It still sounds awful. I don’t like anyone poking around down there. I haven't had…anyone touch me like that in a very long time. And frankly, I'm embarrassed. A woman has some dignity, you know! But… …if you insist…I suppose…I suppose I have no choice. But you better be quick about it! And gentle, like you said. Very, very gentle. I don’t want any…unnecessary discomfort. And don’t look surprised if things are…a little out of shape. I'm an old woman! What do you expect? Just get it over with. But I'm warning you…I won't be happy if it hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table, and I’ll explain each step as I go. It will be as quick and comfortable as possible. Now, if you could just…remove your clothing from the waist down and cover yourself with the gown I’ll leave here. I will be stepping out of the room while you do that. I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, this is just humiliating. An old woman, exposed like this… It's a disgrace. But I suppose it's better than…than letting it go on, festering. Still… Hurry it up, Doctor. I haven’t got all day. And don't you go peeking!
