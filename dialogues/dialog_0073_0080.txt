DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, that's all. Medicare sent 'em, said I gotta have 'em done. Nothing’s wrong, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Forms, alright. Well, even with forms, I do like to have a brief understanding of a patient's overall health. It's just good practice. Though, if nothing's wrong, it should be fairly quick. Are you currently seeing any other doctors, or have you been hospitalized recently?
PATIENT: Nope, not seeing anyone else. And haven't been in the hospital… oh, goodness, not for years. Just a broken arm when I was a kid, I think. Everything's been pretty good, health-wise. Just regular check-ups, you know?
DOCTOR: "Right. A broken arm as a child. And regular check-ups... with whom, if you recall?
PATIENT: Let me think… Dr. Olsen, back on the reservation. He retired a couple years ago, though. That’s why I haven’t been in for a bit, honestly. Haven't really gotten around to finding someone new since then. Mostly been fine, though, like I said.
DOCTOR: Dr. Olsen… alright. And you said “mostly” fine?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. Just… getting older, I guess. Little aches and pains here and there. Nothing that stops me from working, thankfully. I do valve work, you know? Lots of bending and lifting, so my back sometimes complains. But nothing a little ibuprofen can't handle.
DOCTOR: Valve work… strenuous, as you say. And you self-treat with ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. I usually take it after a long day, or if I overdo it. It helps. My husband usually reminds me not to take too much, he worries. He's a good man. Is that something I need to… write down on these forms?
DOCTOR: It's helpful for me to know what patients are doing for themselves. Ibuprofen is… fine for occasional use, but regular reliance isn’t ideal. Do you know how much you typically take, and how often?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don't really measure it, to be honest. Usually two pills if my back’s really bothering me, and maybe… three or four times a week? Sometimes less, sometimes a bit more if I've had a really tough job. I know, I know, I should probably be more careful. My husband says the same thing all the time. He's really good with keeping track of stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides your back, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just…tired sometimes, but that's probably just from work, you know? Long hours. And, well, getting older, like I said. Nothing else I can think of right now. I'm usually pretty good at noticing if something’s off. My grandma always taught me to listen to my body.
DOCTOR: Listening to your body is… sensible. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. And no medical conditions…I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it went down with diet and exercise. Been good ever since, I think. Doctor Olsen kept an eye on it, but like I said, he’s retired now. I haven't really had it checked recently. Is that bad? I should probably get that done, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: It's… advisable to have regular blood pressure checks. Especially given your family history, if there is any. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of heart disease or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. My grandpa on my mom’s side… he had diabetes, I think. And my uncle, her brother, he had a heart attack a few years back. But other than that, not really. My mom was pretty healthy, thankfully. She always ate good food, lots of vegetables. Taught me a lot about that, too. Is that something I should write down on these forms? About my grandpa and uncle?
DOCTOR: Yes, family history is relevant. And finally, are you currently taking any medications besides the ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Nope, just the ibuprofen when I need it. Nothing else. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. My grandma always said natural remedies were the best, and I tend to agree. She knew a lot about plants and herbs. That’s another thing she taught me. But I don’t really have any of those around right now. Just the ibuprofen. Is that everything? I'm happy to fill out the forms now, if you're ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just one moment. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. I'd like to run some basic blood work, just to get a baseline. Routine things – cholesterol, glucose, kidney function. We’ll also check a complete blood count. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just want to make sure everything’s okay. Blood work sounds fine. My husband will be happy to hear I’m finally getting things checked out, he's always worried about me. He usually drives me to appointments, so he can take me, if that works?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly acceptable. I'll have the order sent to the lab now. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. After you get the results, you can schedule a follow-up with me to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your ibuprofen use, and if possible, increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables. Now, let’s finish these forms. Please complete these to the best of your ability.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll do my best. Just let me know if I need help with anything. Hopefully, this won't take too long.
DOCTOR: There's a pen available if you need one. And the nurse is available to answer any questions you might have while completing the forms. I’ll be back momentarily to review them.
