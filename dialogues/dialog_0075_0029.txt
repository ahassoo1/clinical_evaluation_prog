DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Norval. Well, it’s… it’s about my stomach, I guess. I just don’t seem to be able to eat much these days before I feel full. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to worry me. I used to have a good appetite, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Norval. It’s good to meet you. And thank you for sharing that with me. A change in appetite is certainly something we should look into. “A little while now…” can you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six, seven months ago? It wasn’t sudden, just… gradual. At first I thought it was just getting older, you know? Things slow down. But it hasn’t really gotten any better, and now I’m losing a bit of weight, which isn’t good. My wife, Elsie, keeps telling me I need to get it checked out. She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Alright, six to seven months of a gradual decrease in appetite and now some weight loss. Elsie sounds like a very wise woman! And you're right to get it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, can you describe the feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Well… it's not pain, exactly. More like… uncomfortable. Like I’ve eaten enough, even when I haven’t had a full plate. It’s kind of… a pressure, high up in my stomach, I suppose. And it happens pretty quickly. I used to be able to enjoy a good meal, you know, a couple of helpings. Now, just a small portion and I’m done. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not pain, but a feeling of pressure and fullness with relatively small amounts of food, and it’s developed over time. Has this affected what you're able to eat, or is it just the amount?
PATIENT: That's a good question. It's mostly the amount, I think. I still want to eat my usual foods – salmon, bannock, things like that. But I just can’t get much down before I feel full. I haven't really noticed any trouble with certain foods, just the overall quantity. Elsie makes a really good stew, but I can only manage a small bowl now, and that makes me sad. It used to be my favorite.
DOCTOR: Alright. No change in food preference, just reduced quantity due to early fullness. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this, Norval?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Now that you mention it, I have been a bit tired lately. Just generally feeling run down, you know? I put it down to getting older, but maybe it’s connected. And… Elsie says I’ve been a bit more quiet than usual. I don’t know if that counts. I haven’t been having any trouble with… well, anything else, really. No pain, no… changes in my bathroom habits, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue and Elsie has noticed a change in your energy levels as well. No changes in bowel habits or any pain. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, that’s about it. And I’ve got a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that's just old age creeping in. Nothing major, never really needed to see a specialist for anything serious. I try to stay active, go for walks when the weather's good. Elsie keeps me on the go, that's for sure. I haven't been hospitalized for anything in… well, decades.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal many years ago and some arthritis in your hands. No other significant medical history. Have you had any surgeries besides your appendix removed?
PATIENT: No, just the appendix. Never needed anything else. And I don't take any regular medications, just the occasional pain reliever for my hands when they're really bothering me. Nothing daily or anything like that. Elsie always says I’m too stubborn to go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. She’s probably right about that too.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries and only occasional pain relievers as needed. And I understand about being reluctant to visit the doctor! Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Elsie always asks when she buys new things, and I always say no. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, fish, berries, you name it. Never had a problem. I think I’d know if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you most likely would. Good. Now, let's talk a little about your family. Is there any history of stomach problems, like ulcers or cancer, in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a tough one. My mother, she had some stomach trouble when she was older, but I don't know exactly what it was. Just… complained about it a lot. And my grandfather, on my father's side, he died young, but I don't think it was anything to do with his stomach. He worked in the logging camps, rough life. Elsie’s family, they seem pretty healthy, as far as I know. Nothing major that I’m aware of. It's not something we talked about much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Some vague history of stomach complaints in your mother, but nothing definitive. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live with Elsie in a small house just outside town. We have a garden, I enjoy tending to it when I can. I used to fish a lot more, but it’s getting harder these days. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to enjoy a bit of beer with my friends, but I’ve cut back on that these last few years. Mostly just quiet evenings at home now, reading or watching TV with Elsie. I try to stay as active as I can, but I'm not as young as I used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Quiet lifestyle, gardening, and you've reduced your alcohol intake. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let me ask one last question. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Yes, Elsie's been saying I have. She’s always weighing me, that woman! It’s not a huge amount, but she says I’ve lost maybe five or ten pounds over the last few months. I haven't really noticed it myself, but she’s got a good eye for these things. She gets worried, Elsie. I try not to fuss, but she's right to keep an eye on things, I suppose. It's probably that lack of appetite, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Norval. Five to ten pounds of unintentional weight loss over the past few months. That's good information. Alright, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Elsie always says I need to listen to the professionals. I’ll just sit here, then?
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Good. Everything sounds clear there. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. This might be a little cool. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn't feel… painful, just… feels normal, I suppose. A little sensitive maybe, but I think that's just because I haven’t been eating much. Elsie always says I’m too thin. It doesn’t hurt when you press, just… aware of it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, aware of it, not painful. I do feel some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, and it does feel slightly… distended. Not a significant mass, but slightly full. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Everything seems normal there. Overall, Norval, your exam is relatively unremarkable, but the tenderness and fullness in your abdomen, combined with your weight loss and decreased appetite, do warrant some further investigation. I'd like to order some blood work, just to get a baseline and rule out any underlying issues. And I think a stool test would also be a good idea. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it helps figure out what's going on, I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. Blood work and a stool test, right? Elsie will be glad I'm finally getting it properly checked out. She worries so much. When do I need to come back? And where do I go for the tests?
DOCTOR: Alright. Yes, blood work and a stool test. I'll write you a requisition for both. You can go to the lab at the Suburban Medical Centre, just down the road. They’re open from 8 am to 4 pm, Monday to Friday. You don't need an appointment. As for when to come back, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today, August 9th, at 10 am?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. August 9th at 10 am. I’ll make sure to get those tests done right away. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. Elsie will be relieved. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Norval. I'm glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and please give Elsie my best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I'm sure she'd appreciate that. Have a good day yourself.
