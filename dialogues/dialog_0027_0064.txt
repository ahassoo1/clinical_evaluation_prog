DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the chest. My chest is hurting. It started a few days ago, maybe four? It’s not… a sharp pain, more like a heavy feeling, you know? Like someone is sitting on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy feeling in your chest for about four days now. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it comes and goes. Not all the time. When I walk up the hill to the store, it gets worse. And… when I’m worried about something. My daughter, she’s… she has some trouble with her car. Makes me nervous. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Chelberg. It's good you're telling me everything. So, it seems to be brought on by exertion – walking uphill – and also when you’re feeling anxious. Does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Let me see… When I sit down and rest, it gets better. And… if my husband, Ricardo, he rubs my back… that helps a little. But it doesn’t go away away. Just… not so bad. Also, sometimes I take a little sip of chamomile tea. It calms my nerves, maybe that helps too?
DOCTOR: Okay, resting, your husband rubbing your back, and chamomile tea seem to offer some relief. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, I get a little short of breath sometimes, when I’m walking. Not always, just… when it’s steep. And… I think I’ve been a little tired lately. More tired than usual, maybe? I just thought it was my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion and some increased fatigue. Have you had any cough, fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No cough. No fever. Not cold, not hot. And… no, I haven’t been sweating at night. Ricardo would notice, he always does! No, nothing like that. Just the chest pain and… feeling a little worn out.
DOCTOR: Okay. And Ms. Chelberg, do you have any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me see… My mother, she had… something with her heart, when she was older. I don’t remember the name. But I’ve never had problems, Doctor. The doctor always said my pressure was good. And… Ricardo, he makes sure I eat healthy. Not too much salt. No, I don't have… those other things you said.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod, making a note to review her mother’s records if possible. I really need to look at her chart again… but where was I?
PATIENT: Okay. And Ms. Chelberg, do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past? How about alcohol - do you drink, and if so, how much?
DOCTOR: Right, yes. Smoking and alcohol. Have you ever been a smoker, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor! Never. Ricardo, he doesn’t like smoking. And I… I don’t have the taste for it. Never even tried it! And alcohol… just a little glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. Very little. Maybe once a week? Nothing strong, nothing every day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. No, I don’t think so. I had a little rash once, when I was a little girl, from poison ivy. But… that was a long time ago. No allergies to medicine, no allergies to food. Ricardo always checks the labels. He's very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, Ms. Chelberg, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breath in… and out. Good. I'm hearing some… mild wheezing, but nothing too significant. Her heart sounds… regular, a bit fast, but not alarming. Blood pressure is 140/90 – a little elevated. Pulse is 88. No tenderness to the touch. Alright, Ms. Chelberg. Your blood pressure is a little high, and your pulse is a bit fast. I heard some mild wheezing in your lungs, but your heart sounds regular. I don’t feel any tenderness in your chest wall.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that… bad, Doctor? The pressure? Ricardo always says I worry too much. And the wheezing… what does that mean? I don’t want it to be something serious.
DOCTOR: It's good you're letting me know your concerns, Ms. Chelberg. The slightly elevated blood pressure isn’t immediately alarming, but we should monitor it. And the mild wheezing could be due to several things – a little inflammation in the airways, maybe even some allergies. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a few tests – a chest X-ray and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… an X-ray? Oh dear. What if it’s something bad, Doctor? But… yes, alright. If you think it’s best, do the tests. I want to know what’s going on. It's just… I don't like being sick. Can Ricardo come with me? I always feel better with him.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Chelberg. It's always good to have support. Yes, Ricardo is more than welcome to come with you. We'll get the order for the X-ray and EKG right away. The radiology technician will explain everything to you both. And once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on a plan. We'll rule out anything serious. In the meantime, if you experience any severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Emergency room… I’ll remember. Thank you, Doctor. Ricardo will be glad to hear that he can come. I… I hope it’s nothing serious. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: We'll do everything we can to figure out what's going on, Ms. Chelberg. Let's get those tests ordered. My nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to explain the process and get everything set up for you. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that's all. Just the tests. And… thank you again. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. We’ll take good care of you. Just relax, and try not to worry too much. Maria will be with you soon. .
