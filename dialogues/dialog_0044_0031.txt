DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, my left leg... it's gotten quite swollen. It's been a bit of a worry, to be honest. I know I have... a funny heartbeat sometimes, the doctors said it was atrial... something? And I thought maybe they were connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, a swollen left leg and a history of an irregular heartbeat – that is good information to start with. And you said the doctors mentioned “atrial… something”?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Atrial… fibrillation, I think they called it. It happens now and then. It doesn't hurt, just feels… fluttery, like a fish flapping about. I don’t really understand it much myself. Is it serious, Doctor? And could it be causing my leg to swell?
DOCTOR: Right, atrial fibrillation. It's an irregular rhythm of the heart – a bit like a disorganized electrical signal. It can be serious, but it’s very manageable in many cases. And you are right to wonder if it's connected to the leg swelling. It absolutely could be. Let me just take a quick look at your records to see what the previous doctors documented about the fibrillation… Okay, I see here you were diagnosed about six months ago. Have you been taking any medication for it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t been on any medication. They said to just… keep an eye on it, and come in if it bothered me. It usually stops on its own after a bit, so I haven’t needed to take anything yet. That’s why I waited so long to come in, really. Until this leg started swelling. It’s getting harder to walk with it being so big.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in now, especially with the walking becoming difficult. Not taking medication isn't necessarily a problem if it's been resolving on its own, but the leg swelling does change things. Now, tell me a bit more about the swelling itself. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started slowly, maybe a week ago. At first, I thought I’d just bumped it or something, but it hasn’t gone down. It’s gotten bigger each day, I’d say. It's mostly in my calf, and it feels… tight, like a band around it. It’s not painful to touch, exactly, but it aches when I stand for too long. I hope that makes sense, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Slow onset, calf swelling, tightness, ache with standing… those are all important clues. Alright, Nixon, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just so I can get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your leg, and check for any tenderness or warmth. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please do. I'm happy to do whatever you need me to. I just want to get this sorted out, if possible. It’s a bit worrying, being unable to walk properly.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Okay, I'm listening to your heart now. I do hear a slightly irregular rhythm, consistent with the atrial fibrillation you mentioned. Your lungs sound clear, though. Now, your left leg… I can definitely see some swelling in your calf compared to your right leg. It feels warm to the touch, and there is some tenderness when I press here. I’m also noting some redness in that area. Have you noticed any skin changes—like blistering or broken skin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t noticed any blistering or broken skin. It's just the redness and swelling, really. It feels a bit… tight, like my skin is stretched too thin. I’ve been trying to keep it elevated, like my grandmother used to do with her ankles, but it doesn't seem to make much difference. Is it… serious, Doctor? Could it be a blood clot, perhaps? I read something about those once, and it sounded quite frightening.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, and it's right to think about possibilities like a blood clot. Given the swelling, warmth, redness, and your history of atrial fibrillation, a blood clot is something we need to rule out. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clots forming, unfortunately. To be sure, we'll need to get some imaging done. I’m going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. This will allow us to see the blood flow and check for any clots. It’s a painless procedure. In the meantime, continuing to elevate your leg is good, as is avoiding prolonged standing or sitting. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, or any kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A blood clot… That sounds rather unpleasant. Thank you for checking, Doctor. I don’t think I’ve ever had any allergies, and my kidneys are fine, I believe. I had a check-up last year, and the doctor didn't mention anything. I'm not usually one for complaining, so I rarely go to the doctors unless something is truly bothering me. I suppose that’s why it’s taken so long to get this checked out. Will the ultrasound tell us for certain if there's a clot?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. The ultrasound is the best way to determine if there is a clot present. It provides a very clear picture of the blood flow in your leg. Alright, I’ve just sent the order through to the radiology department. They should contact you to schedule an appointment. It’s usually quite quick. While you're waiting for the ultrasound, I’m going to prescribe you a blood thinner to start as a precaution. This will help prevent any clots from getting larger, just in case. Now, do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh… a blood thinner? That sounds rather serious, doesn’t it? Is it… safe? I don’t want to cause any problems, Doctor. And… will it make the swelling worse? I’m a bit worried about the side effects, to be honest. I haven't taken many medications in my life.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Nixon, and I’m glad you’re asking. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about starting a new medication, especially one like a blood thinner. The blood thinner I’m prescribing is called rivaroxaban. It’s a relatively modern medication with a lower risk of side effects than some of the older ones. The most common side effect is bleeding, so you’ll need to be careful to avoid injuries and let me know immediately if you notice any unusual bruising, bleeding from the gums, nosebleeds, or blood in your urine or stool. We will start with a low dose, and we’ll monitor you closely. We'll also need to do some blood tests to make sure the medication is working correctly and to adjust the dose if necessary. It's important to follow my instructions carefully and keep all your follow-up appointments. And no, it shouldn’t make the swelling worse. In fact, it should help prevent it from getting bigger. Do you have any other concerns, or would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: No… I think that explains it quite well, Doctor. The bleeding does sound a bit worrying, but I understand it’s better to be safe than sorry. And it’s reassuring to know you’ll be monitoring me closely. I will be very careful to avoid any injuries, and I’ll let you know immediately if I notice anything unusual. Thank you, Doctor Asami. I feel much better now that I have a plan. When should I expect to hear from the radiology department to schedule the ultrasound? And… how long will the results take to come back?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. It’s always best to be informed and proactive. The radiology department should be contacting you within 24-48 hours to schedule the ultrasound. I’ve put a note on the request to prioritize it, so hopefully, you’ll get an appointment sooner rather than later. Once the ultrasound is completed, the results will be sent to me electronically, usually within a few hours. I’ll review them as soon as they come in and contact you immediately to discuss them and make a further plan. In the meantime, remember to elevate your leg as much as possible, avoid prolonged standing or sitting, and if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like pain, redness, or warmth—please contact me right away. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ll remember to elevate my leg, avoid standing for too long, and contact you if anything changes. Thank you again, Doctor Asami. You’ve been very helpful and patient with me. I appreciate your time and kindness. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Nixon. I am glad I could help. Remember, please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. I will be in touch as soon as the ultrasound results are available. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
