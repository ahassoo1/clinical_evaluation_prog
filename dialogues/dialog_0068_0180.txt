DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I’m Dr. Sham. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, can we just get this over with? I got things to do. It's this…tiredness. I'm always tired. And…well, it's embarrassing, but I been…eating dirt. Not a lot, just…a little. I don't know why. It started a few months ago, I think. Maybe longer. Honestly, time just…blurs.
DOCTOR: Okay, “always tired” and…dirt consumption. Right. Let's try to piece this together. A few months, you said?
PATIENT: A few…ish. Look, it's not like I’m shoveling it down, okay? Just…little bits. Like, if I’m outside gardening, I might…taste the soil. It's weird, I know. Don't judge me. I just…feel like I need it sometimes. Does that make any sense? It’s not like I plan it. I just…do it. And then I feel a bit better, but not for long. It’s a whole thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. No judgment here, Ms. Cantoran. It is unusual, and we need to figure out what’s going on. You mentioned feeling better briefly after…ingesting the soil?
PATIENT: Yeah, for a little bit. It's hard to explain. Like…a little boost, maybe? Not a big one, just…enough to get me through a few hours. Then it wears off and…I'm tired again. And sometimes I feel…sick to my stomach. It's not every time, just…sometimes. Honestly, I just thought I was getting old. My husband…he passed a few years back, and things just haven't been the same. I don’t know if that has something to do with it. But don't waste your time with that, I just...thought I’d mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Stomach upset sometimes, and…feeling tired, overall. A few years since your husband passed…I appreciate you sharing that. It's important. Let's just run through a little bit more to get a better picture. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Ugh. What kind of changes? I feel like everything's a change these days. My memory's awful. I forget where I put things, what I was saying…normal old lady stuff. I get headaches sometimes, but who doesn't? And...oh, my skin's been really dry lately. Like, peeling dry. But that’s the weather, probably. Look, am I supposed to list everything? This is taking a long time. Is this going to require a lot of tests? I don't have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the time and cost. We’ll try to be efficient. Just a few more questions. The memory problems…are they new, or have they been getting worse gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually. Definitely gradually. It’s not like I suddenly woke up one day and couldn't remember my name. It’s just…slowly getting worse. Little things at first. Now…now it’s embarrassing. I went to the store yesterday and forgot what I even went there for. It's…frustrating. And I don’t need you to tell me it’s probably just old age, okay? I already know that. Just…get to the point, please. Are you going to poke and prod me, or what?
DOCTOR: Alright. No poking and prodding right away. Let’s start with a quick physical exam. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin, if that’s alright. Then we can talk about some basic blood tests. It'll give us a starting point. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Honestly, I don’t see what looking at my skin is going to do. It's dry, like I said. Just… hurry up. I got a garden to tend to, you know. And a lot of weeds. Don’t take all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not critically high. Heart and lungs sound…normal. Skin is very dry, as you mentioned, with some flaking. I also notice some mild pallor. Your hands feel a bit cold as well.
PATIENT: Cold? Of course they're cold! It's air conditioned in here! Look, what does any of this mean? Are you going to tell me I’m dying or what? Just tell me straight. I don't have time for a lot of beating around the bush. And if it’s something serious, are there tests I can't afford that I should be worried about? Get to the point, doctor. I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I’m not going to tell you you’re dying. But the combination of the fatigue, the…soil ingestion, the memory issues, pallor, and the dry skin does raise some concerns. It’s unlikely to be one simple thing. I need to run some blood tests to check for iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, and thyroid problems. These are relatively inexpensive and would give us a better idea of what’s going on. We also need to rule out some more serious possibilities, but let’s not jump to conclusions. Given your history, and your…unusual presentation, I also want to get a referral for you to see a specialist in hematology. They can do a more in-depth evaluation of your blood and bone marrow. It's better to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hematology? Bone marrow? Look, I don't even know what that is. And it sounds expensive. I told you, I don't have insurance. Honestly, maybe I'm just getting old. Maybe I should just…rest more. It's probably nothing. I appreciate your…thoroughness, but I'm not sure I can afford all this poking and prodding. Just...give me something for the tiredness, okay? Something to get me through the day. A pill or something. Is that possible? Forget the rest. I'll just…deal with it. I don't need to know what's wrong with me. Just help me feel better. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your concerns about the cost and you wanting a quick fix. I can prescribe something for the fatigue temporarily. However, I strongly advise against ignoring these other symptoms. Trying to mask the problem without finding the underlying cause could be harmful. And regarding the hematology referral, I can help you find clinics that offer financial assistance programs or reduced rates. I will write you a prescription for a low dose iron supplement and a multivitamin. Start taking those daily. We will also call the clinic's financial counselor to see what options are available to assist with potential specialty care. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, especially if you experience any dizziness, shortness of breath, or bleeding, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
