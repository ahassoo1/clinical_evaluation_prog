DOCTOR: Right. Odell Tayar, 22 years old. Hello, Odell. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… hello. I… need… shots? For travel. My wife… she liked to travel. Now… I need to go. Somewhere. I don’t remember exactly where now. It was her plan, you see.
DOCTOR: "Shots for travel," alright. And you're not sure where you're traveling to?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Somewhere… warm, I think? She booked everything. I just… I just need what she would have gotten. For… safety. It's important. She was very careful.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "somewhere warm" is… not very specific, Odell. Travel vaccinations depend entirely on the destination. Do you have any paperwork at all?
PATIENT: Paperwork? Uh… maybe? I… I don’t know where she kept things. She had a… a box. Lots of papers. In the… the room. But… everything is… messy now. I didn’t really look. It's too… sad.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, we can't just guess what vaccinations you need. That's… irresponsible. Do you remember anything about the trip?
PATIENT: Hmm… she talked about… monkeys? And… spicy food. And a beach. A really, really nice beach. She showed me pictures… on the… glowing box. But… I don't remember where the pictures were from. Everything feels… blurry. It was before… everything happened.
DOCTOR: Alright. Odell, I'm going to need you to try and remember. Was it a country in Asia?
PATIENT: Asia…? Maybe. She liked… colorful places. Lots of people. Loud places. I… I think she said something about… temples? Big, gold temples. Is that… Asia? I don't know countries very well.
DOCTOR: Temples… okay. That does point towards Asia, yes. Specifically, countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam… Do any of those names sound familiar?
PATIENT: Thailand… that… that sounds right. Yes! I think she said… “Thailand!” Yes, that’s it. She was very excited about Thailand. Everything was for Thailand… the… the clothes, the money… Yes, Thailand! Finally.
DOCTOR: Okay, Thailand. Good. That's incredibly helpful. Now, have you had any vaccinations at all in the past?
PATIENT: Uh… I think so. When I was little… maybe? My… my mother took me to the doctor. But I don’t remember what shots I got. A long time ago… very long. I haven’t been sick… not really. Except for a cold, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll need to assume you're not up to date on anything, just to be safe. I’m going to need to ask you some questions about your medical history, and then we’ll do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No. Not that I know of. I eat anything. She liked to cook… lots of different things. Spicy things. I never had a problem… except sometimes my stomach hurt. But that was the spices, not… allergies. I don’t think I have allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Not since… well, not since. I don't… I don't need anything. I just want to go to Thailand. Like she wanted.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. No medications. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses…? No. I… I’ve always been healthy. Maybe a cold, sometimes. But nothing… serious. She always took care of me. She made me go to the doctor when I was sick. But nothing… bad. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I… I don't like hospitals. She had to go sometimes… for her… for her back. But I never had to. No surgeries. No hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to need to do a brief physical exam, just to make sure everything is alright before we discuss vaccinations. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. If you need to. Just… be quick, please? It makes me… nervous. Just… be quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I’ll listen to your lungs, and take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Nothing to worry about. If you could just have a seat here for me?
PATIENT: Okay… Be quick, you promised.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your arm for me, please. Blood pressure is good. Heart rate is good. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi. Ears appear normal, with no signs of infection or fluid. Throat is clear, no signs of inflammation. Everything appears normal, Odell. Physically, you seem healthy.
PATIENT: That… that was quick. Thank you. So… what shots do I need for Thailand? Like my wife would have gotten?
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. For Thailand, depending on your travel itinerary and activities, we need to consider several vaccinations. Based on what you've told me, and assuming you haven't had them before, I recommend the following: Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and a Tetanus booster. I also strongly recommend considering Japanese encephalitis, and depending on the region you’re visiting, Rabies. We'll also want to discuss malaria prevention, as it's a risk in many parts of Thailand. It’s a lot, I know, but it's important to be prepared. Do you have any questions about these vaccinations?
PATIENT: So many…? Typhoid… Hepatitis… Japanese… What is malaria? I… I don't remember my wife talking about all of these. She just… said “shots.” Is it… expensive? I don't have much money…
DOCTOR: It does sound like a lot, I understand. Malaria is a serious, potentially life-threatening disease transmitted by mosquitoes. It's preventable with medication. As for the cost, the price varies depending on the specific vaccine and your insurance coverage. You have private insurance, correct?
PATIENT: Yes… private insurance. But… I don’t know what it covers. She handled all of that. She always… took care of everything. I don’t even know what questions to ask. What if it's too expensive? Can I… can I still go to Thailand if I don't get all of them?
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. Let's take this one step at a time. We'll start by checking your insurance coverage for these vaccinations. I have a billing specialist who can assist you with that. As for whether you can go without all of them, it depends on the areas you plan to visit and your risk tolerance. Some vaccinations are more crucial than others. Typhoid and Hepatitis A are highly recommended for most travelers to Thailand. Japanese encephalitis and Rabies are more relevant if you’ll be spending extended periods in rural areas or engaging in activities like hiking or camping. We can discuss the specific risks and benefits of each vaccine and prioritize accordingly. It's important to be informed and make a decision you're comfortable with. We can also explore options like payment plans or assistance programs if cost is a significant concern. Do you want me to contact the billing specialist to check your insurance coverage?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Check the insurance. That would be… helpful. Very helpful. And… maybe… explain the… the Japanese one? And the Rabies. What kind of… risks are we talking about? Like… what happens if I don't get them?
DOCTOR: Alright, let me pull up your insurance information… Okay, here we are. It looks like your policy does cover most vaccinations, with a copay depending on the specific vaccine. We’ll need to confirm the exact amounts once we’ve determined which ones you’re getting. Now, regarding Japanese encephalitis and Rabies… Japanese encephalitis is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes, primarily in rural areas. Symptoms can range from mild fever to severe encephalitis, leading to permanent neurological damage or even death. The risk is relatively low, but it's higher if you'll be spending an extended time in agricultural areas. Rabies, on the other hand, is a viral infection transmitted through the bite of an infected animal – typically dogs, bats, or monkeys. It's almost always fatal once symptoms develop, so prevention is crucial. The vaccine is highly effective, but it requires a series of shots. The risk of rabies is higher if you plan to interact with animals or spend time in areas where stray animals are common. It's a difficult decision, Odell, and I want you to feel comfortable with whatever you choose. We can weigh the risks and benefits and prioritize accordingly. Does that explanation help?
PATIENT: Monkeys… So… if I stay in the city… just the city… then maybe I don’t need the monkey one? And the… mosquito one? And if I don’t get the monkey one… what if I do get bitten? What happens then?
DOCTOR: Okay, if you primarily stay in urban areas and avoid contact with animals or rural environments, the risk of rabies is significantly lower. The Japanese encephalitis risk is also reduced in cities. However, the risk of contracting malaria, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, remains a concern in many parts of Thailand, even in urban areas, especially during the rainy season. If you were bitten by an animal suspected of having rabies, it would be considered a medical emergency. You would require immediate post-exposure prophylaxis, which involves a series of painful injections and a potentially lengthy treatment course. It’s a stressful and expensive procedure. As for malaria, if you were to contract it, symptoms can include fever, chills, and flu-like illness. It can progress to severe complications, including organ failure and death, if left untreated. That’s why malaria prevention is so important, even in urban areas. We can discuss different preventative medications, and I can advise you on mosquito bite prevention strategies. Would you like to discuss the malaria prevention options now?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Tell me about the… the mosquito pills. Or… whatever they are. What are the side effects? And… are they expensive? I just… I just want to go to Thailand. Like she wanted. But… I don't want to get sick. Or… or die.
DOCTOR: Alright, there are several medications available for malaria prevention. The most common options include atovaquone-proguanil , doxycycline, and mefloquine. Atovaquone-proguanil is generally well-tolerated, with side effects like nausea and diarrhea being the most common. It’s taken daily, starting one or two days before travel and continuing for seven days after returning home. Doxycycline is another effective option, but it can increase your sensitivity to the sun and cause stomach upset. Mefloquine has a higher risk of side effects, including psychiatric symptoms, and is generally not recommended unless other options are unavailable. As for the cost, the price varies depending on the medication and the duration of your trip. Atovaquone-proguanil is generally the most expensive option, while doxycycline is the most affordable. With your insurance, Atovaquone-proguanil would have a copay of approximately $150 for a 28-day supply. Doxycycline would be around $30 for a 28-day supply. We can also discuss mosquito bite prevention strategies, such as wearing long sleeves and pants, using insect repellent containing DEET, and sleeping under a mosquito net. Would you like me to write you a prescription for Atovaquone-proguanil, or would you prefer to discuss other options?
PATIENT: $150… That’s… a lot. Maybe the cheaper one? The… the doxy-something? If it’s safe… I just… I don't know what to do. I just want to go. Like she would have wanted. Is the cheaper one okay? Will it protect me?
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. Doxycycline is a perfectly acceptable option, and it is effective in preventing malaria. It's a commonly prescribed medication, and it has a good safety profile for most people. The main side effects are stomach upset and increased sensitivity to the sun, but these can be minimized by taking the medication with food and wearing sunscreen. I recommend starting Doxycycline one to two days before your trip and continuing it for four weeks after you return home. It's important to complete the full course of medication, even if you don't experience any symptoms. I'm writing you a prescription for a 28-day supply of Doxycycline. With your insurance, the copay will be approximately $30. "It's important to take this medication as prescribed and to follow the mosquito bite prevention strategies we discussed. Do you have any allergies to sulfa drugs?
PATIENT: Sulfa… drugs? I… I don’t know. My wife… she always knew those things. I never had to remember. No… I don't think so. But I’m not sure. Is it… bad if I don’t know?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay that you don’t know, Odell. A sulfa allergy is relatively uncommon, but it’s important to rule it out before starting Doxycycline, as it can cause a severe reaction in people who are allergic. Let me ask you a few questions. Have you ever had a rash or allergic reaction after taking any antibiotics?
PATIENT: Uh… I think so. Once. A long time ago. When I was little. My face got… red. And itchy. But… I don’t remember what medicine I took. My mother… she gave it to me. It was… a pink pill, maybe? Just a little pink pill. That’s all I remember. It didn’t… it didn’t hurt. Just itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay. A history of a rash after taking an antibiotic is concerning. While it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re allergic to Doxycycline, it’s best to be cautious. To be safe, I recommend we avoid Doxycycline and switch to Atovaquone-proguanil. It's a slightly more expensive option, but it has a lower risk of causing allergic reactions. Would you like me to write you a new prescription?
PATIENT: $150… Okay… okay. If it’s safer… then fine. $150. Just… write the prescription. I just want to go to Thailand. Like she would have wanted. Just… write the prescription, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. Here's the new prescription for Atovaquone-proguanil. The copay will be approximately $150. "It’s important to start taking this medication one to two days before your trip and continue it for seven days after you return home. Make sure to follow the mosquito bite prevention strategies we discussed, and please contact me if you experience any side effects. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you… Dr. Murtic. For everything. I… I just hope I don’t get sick. Like she would have wanted… I just want to go.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Odell. I understand your concerns, and I'm here to support you if you need anything. Remember to take the medication as prescribed and follow the prevention strategies. I hope you have a safe and enjoyable trip to Thailand. "And Odell, please don't hesitate to contact the office if any questions or concerns arise before, during, or after your travel. Safe travels."
