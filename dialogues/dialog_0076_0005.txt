DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac, let's get this over with. You're 81, right?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Eighty-one years this last winter. A long time, wouldn’t you say? Though I feel…well, I feel alright for my age. I bake every day, you see. Keeps a man busy.
DOCTOR: Baking. Right. And what brings you in today?
PATIENT: They tell me it’s to make sure I’m fit to move into one of those…senior places. A nice place, they say. But I’m still quite capable, Doctor. I can still knead dough better than most folks half my age. But, if it’s required…I suppose I’m here for that checkup then.
DOCTOR: So, a pre-admission physical. Fine. Let’s just…get through the basics. Any major health problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. My bones ache a bit when the weather changes, same as anyone my age, I reckon. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, that’s why I brought my glasses. But I’ve never been one for sickness. Just…old age, mostly. Is that a problem, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “Old age” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Tkac. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not regularly. I had a visit with Doctor Miller a few years back for my heart, but he said it was just a bit of flutterin’ and told me to watch my salt. I’ve been careful with the salt ever since. Mostly just use it for the bread dough, and not too much of that. Is that important to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “Flutterin’"... Probably atrial fibrillation. And you said you bake every day?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Every day. It’s what I do. Been bakin’ since I was a boy with my grandmother. She taught me everything. Makes all sorts of things. Bread, mostly. But pies, cakes, cookies…whatever folks want. Keeps me busy, and I like busy. Does that…affect my health, Doctor? Is bakin’ bad for a man my age?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Tkac, I appreciate your…enthusiasm. But let’s focus. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies…let me think. I don't recall ever having a bad reaction to anything. I haven't taken much in the way of medicine, Doctor. A little something for a cold now and then, but that's about it. I mostly just rest and drink tea when I’m unwell. I don't believe I’m allergic to anything, no. Though, I don't care for licorice. Is that what you mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, not licorice. Medications. Penicillin, codeine, anything like that. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm…hospitalized. Let me see… once, when I was a young man, I broke my arm fallin’ out of a tree. Chasin’ a squirrel, I believe. And…oh, and when my son was born, my wife had to stay in the hospital for a bit. But me? Not really. Just the arm when I was a boy. A long time ago. Nothing serious, Doctor. A simple break, mended right up. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, heart, lungs…the usual. Sit back. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'll sit right here. Relax…I suppose I can try. Though it’s hard to relax when I'm thinkin' about all the bread I need to get bakin’ later. But I’ll do my best. Is there anything special I need to do while you check me, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Just breathe normally. And try not to talk. Heart rate is a bit irregular. Murmur present. Lungs are clear, but diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Blood pressure… 140/90. Not ideal. Reflexes are diminished, but present. Well, Mr. Tkac, it appears you have some age-related changes. Your heart isn’t as strong as it used to be, and your blood pressure is a little high. The diminished breath sounds aren't ideal, either.
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, that doesn't surprise me much. Eighty-one years is a long time for a body to keep workin’. I suppose things wear out eventually, like an old oven. But I still feel alright, you see. I can still bake a good loaf of bread. Does this mean I can’t go to that senior place? Will they not let me in if my heart isn’t “strong enough”? I was lookin’ forward to havin’ someone else mow the lawn. Is it…serious, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Tkac, it’s not about whether you can bake bread. It’s about managing your health. Your irregular heartbeat and blood pressure could lead to problems down the line. I’m not saying you’re on death’s door, but you need to take it seriously. I’m going to order an EKG and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your heart and lungs. And I want you to see a cardiologist. A specialist. They can properly assess the extent of the issue and recommend a treatment plan. And frankly, you should probably cut back on the salt. Baking notwithstanding.
PATIENT: An EKG and a chest X-ray… a specialist… that sounds…serious, Doctor. More tests, more folks lookin’ at me. I suppose if that’s what you think is best. Though I’m not sure I like the sound of it. I’ve never had much truck with doctors, to be honest. But…if it’s to keep bakin’…well, I suppose I can do it. I’ll go get the tests. And cut back on the salt, you say? That’ll be hard. It gives the bread a good flavor. But alright. I’ll try. Is there anything else, Doctor? Anything I should be doin’ now? Before the tests? Should I stop bakin’ altogether? That thought makes me feel a bit faint, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Tkac, I’m not telling you to stop baking completely. Just…be mindful. And I want you to start a log of your symptoms. Any dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain…write it down. The cardiologist will give you more specific instructions after they review the test results. I’m ordering the tests now, and my assistant will schedule the appointments for you. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Symptoms…dizziness, shortness of breath… alright. I can do that. I have a little notepad I use for my recipes. I’ll write it all down, just like you said. And…no, I don’t think I have any other questions right now, Doctor. Though…this cardiologist…is he a nice man? Is he…understanding? I’m a bit worried about meetin’ a specialist. They always seem so…serious. I suppose I just want to know…will this mean I have to stop livin’ my life? Stop bakin’? Stop enjoyin’ things? Is that what this is all about? I understand you’re tryin’ to help, Doctor, but it’s all a bit overwhelm’in’.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Tkac, I don't have time to discuss the personality of every doctor you might see. I'm a primary care physician. My job is to identify potential problems and refer you to specialists for proper treatment. The cardiologist will explain everything. And frankly, whether you continue baking is up to you. But you need to be realistic about your health. My assistant will be with you shortly to schedule the appointments and give you further instructions. I have other patients waiting. Have a good day, Mr. Tkac. And try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you. I suppose. I'll try not to worry. Though it’s hard, with all this talk of irregular heartbeats and specialists. Thank you again, Doctor. I'll see what your assistant says. …Perhaps I’ll bake a pie tonight. A nice cherry pie. That always makes me feel better.
