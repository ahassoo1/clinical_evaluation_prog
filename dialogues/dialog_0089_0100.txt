DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s this drug test thing. Medicare asked me to come in, I think. Honestly, things are a bit… fuzzy these days. I don’t really remember all the details. Something about making sure I'm okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright, Ms. Hughston. Medicare does sometimes require certain tests. It looks like this is a medication review and a toxicology screen, primarily to ensure there aren’t any interactions with your current medications, and to rule out anything that might be causing confusion. Can you tell me what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. Let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And… oh! There’s a thing for my arthritis, it helps with the pain in my hands. That one's pink. I really wish I could remember the names… My daughter usually keeps track of it all, but she’s away on a trip right now. Is it okay if I just… guess?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Hughston. We can work with what you remember. Any detail helps. Knowing the colors and what they're for is a good start. So, a white pill for blood pressure and a pink pill for arthritis pain. Do you know how often you take each of those?
PATIENT: The white one… I think it's every morning. Yes, with breakfast. And the pink one… hmm. Two times a day, I believe. One in the morning, and one before bed. Unless… did I start taking only one? Oh dear, this is hopeless. I really wish Marie was here. She’d know all this. Is it bad that I can't remember?
DOCTOR: It’s not bad, Ms. Hughston. Memory can be tricky, especially with multiple medications. Don't worry, we'll sort it out. Do you experience any side effects from either of those medications?
PATIENT: Side effects… not that I’ve noticed, really. Sometimes my hands feel a bit tingly, but that could just be the arthritis acting up. And… oh, sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. But I always just figured I was getting old! Is that a side effect? I honestly don't know what to expect from anything these days.
DOCTOR: Dizziness and tingling can be side effects, or they could be related to the arthritis. It's good you mentioned those. Now, besides those two medications, are you taking anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else… Oh! Sometimes I take something for sleep, if I can’t get to doze off. It's a little blue pill. But I don’t take it every night, only when I'm really restless. And… maybe some vitamins? I think my daughter buys me those, but I can’t recall what kind. Honestly, doctor, my memory is just… Swiss cheese. Is it alright if we just call Marie? She'd know everything.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Ms. Hughston. We can certainly try to reach Marie if you’d like. But let’s see if we can get a little more information first. A little blue pill for sleep, taken occasionally, and some vitamins. Do you remember what kind of vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… they come in gummy form, I think. Maybe orange flavored? Or… cherry? It’s been a while. They’re just… general vitamins. You know, for older people? They're nothing special, I assure you. I mostly just take them because Marie tells me to. She’s very good about my health. Is it bothering you that I can’t remember?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t bother me, Ms. Hughston. It's helpful that you’re telling me everything you do remember, and it’s common to have some memory lapses. Okay. To get a clearer picture, and to make sure everything is safe, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your blood pressure, pulse, and a few other basic things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to make sure I'm not causing any trouble. My daughter worries about me, you see. She's a good girl. Blood pressure, pulse… yes, of course. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just have a seat here, we'll get started. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. There is some swelling and tenderness in your hands, consistent with arthritis. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, which can be normal for your age, but we'll note it. Everything else appears normal on the basic exam. I think it's best to get a blood work-up, just to check your kidney function, liver function, and rule out any medication interactions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… oh dear. I don’t love needles, but… if you think it's necessary, then yes. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I just want to be sure I’m not a bother to anyone. Will it be much? I get tired easily these days. And… will it hurt a lot?
DOCTOR: It won't be a lot of blood, Ms. Hughston, just a few vials. And the discomfort is usually very quick, a small pinch. We'll have you sit comfortably, and the phlebotomist is very good at making it as painless as possible. While we wait for the results, I'm going to write a prescription for a refill of your blood pressure medication, just to be on the safe side. Do you remember the name of it?
PATIENT: The name… the name… No, I'm afraid not. It's a little white pill, like I said. I get it from the pharmacy down the street, you know, Miller's. They probably know what I take. I’m so sorry, Doctor. I really wish I could be more helpful. My mind just isn’t what it used to be. It's probably best to just call Marie, isn't it? She'll know everything. Perhaps I should just wait for her to get back.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. We can absolutely contact Miller's Pharmacy to get the exact name of your blood pressure medication. That’s a much better idea than waiting. I’m just going to call them now. While I do that, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, no. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Unless… I get a little itchy sometimes when I eat shellfish, but it's not a full-blown allergy. Just a little bit of itching. It's probably just my skin being sensitive. I haven't eaten shellfish in years, anyway. I don't think I have any serious allergies, Doctor. Thank goodness. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Hughston. It’s good to know about the shellfish sensitivity. Okay, I’ve spoken with Miller’s Pharmacy. They confirmed you’ve been taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for your blood pressure. I’ve sent the refill prescription electronically to your usual pharmacy. We’ll get the blood work results back within a few days. I'll have my nurse contact you with the results, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with me. I’m just glad we’re getting everything checked out. And thank you for calling the pharmacy. You’ve saved me a lot of trouble. I think that’s all for now. I suppose I should be getting home to rest.
