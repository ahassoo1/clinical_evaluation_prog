DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Sobkowicz, is it?
PATIENT: Yes. Sobkowicz. Henry Sobkowicz. Look, can we make this quick? I got things to do. Wife… she needs help with garden.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, let’s try to be quick. But I need some information first, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Ask. But no long words, understand? My English… not so good anymore. Just simple.
DOCTOR: Fine. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Chest… feels funny. Like bird flapping. And… head hurts sometimes when it happens. Doctor say blood pressure high before, too. Always bother me.
DOCTOR: "Bird flapping," you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Like… flutters. Quick, quick. Not steady. Makes me scared. And dizzy sometimes when it happens. Is bad, you know? Very bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. How long has this “bird flapping” been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… a month? Two months, maybe. Hard to remember. Old man problems, you know? Things… they all blur together. Wife says longer, but she always exaggerates.
DOCTOR: A month or two. And this dizziness… does it happen every time the “flutters” happen, or sometimes?
PATIENT: Not every time. Sometimes just the chest. Sometimes chest and head. And sometimes… nothing. Just feels like I ate too much. Which, you know, doesn’t happen often these days. Everything tastes like… nothing.
DOCTOR: “Nothing,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Like cardboard. No flavor. But that’s not important! The chest is important. The flutters! Are they dangerous, doctor? That's what I want to know. Don’t have time for long tests.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's see… Have you ever been told you have… arrhythmia?
PATIENT: Arrhyth… what-a? What does that mean? Look, just tell me if I’m gonna die, okay? No big words. Simple! Just yes or no.
DOCTOR: Fine. Have your doctors ever said your heart beats irregularly?
PATIENT: Yes! They said… something about fast, then slow. They gave me little pills. Didn’t help much. Makes me tired. But I still take them. Wife tells me to. She’s a very… determined woman.
DOCTOR: Okay. Little pills for… fast then slow heartbeat. And you're still taking them, even though they make you tired. Right. Let’s listen to your heart now. Sit back.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. And be quick about it! I don't like doctors poking around. And don't tell me nothing I don't need to know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Irregular, yes. Definitely irregular. Rate is… elevated. Around 98. And some extra beats here and there. I'm going to check your blood pressure now. Just relax.
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Again? Always too high. Maybe it’s the wife. She yells a lot. Is that bad for blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Let’s not get into the dynamics of your marriage, shall we?
PATIENT: Hmph. You don't understand. She's… a lot. Now, how high is it? Tell me the number. Quick. I have gardening to oversee.
DOCTOR: 150 over 90. Not ideal, Mr. Sobkowicz. Not ideal at all. Look, I'm going to order an EKG. Just a simple test to see what your heart is doing. And I want you to follow up with a cardiologist. A heart specialist.
PATIENT: EKG? More tests? Look, I already told you, I don't have time for this. A specialist? How much is that going to cost? My wife will kill me if I spend too much money!
DOCTOR: It's for your own good, Mr. Sobkowicz. And as for the cost...I can't give you an exact figure. It depends on your insurance. Look, let’s just focus on getting the EKG done, alright?
PATIENT: Insurance? Yes, I have… the good insurance. Private. But still! Money is money. Is this EKG gonna take all day? I swear, if I miss watering the tomatoes… .
DOCTOR: It won't take long. The nurse will take you right away. We need to rule out atrial fibrillation. And I'm writing you a prescription for a higher dose of your blood pressure medication. It's clearly not enough. Here. Take these to the nurse. And please, follow up with the cardiologist. Do you understand?
