DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Orwin, have a seat. Eighty-one, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Eighty-one come November. Don’t see much point in dwelling on it, though. Just want to get this… thing… sorted out and be done with it. Don’t have all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. And what thing would that be, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: It’s… my face. It’s sagging. It’s not a pretty sight. My wife… well, she always said I had a strong jawline. Now? Not so much. I want it fixed. Simple as that. Don't see why I need a whole lot of poking and prodding just to confirm what’s obvious.
DOCTOR: "Sagging," you say. And this has been bothering you for…?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Years, probably. But it’s gotten worse lately. I noticed it particularly in photographs. Can’t stand a bad photograph, you know. Ruins everything. Honestly, I don’t spend much time looking in mirrors, but others… they comment. And that's enough for me.
DOCTOR: Others comment. Right. And what exactly are they commenting on, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: Well, they say I look… tired. Old. Like I've lost my… vigor. It's insulting, really. I still feel perfectly capable. I just want to look the part, you know? I don't need a lecture about aging gracefully. I just want things… tightened up. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: "Tightened up," you say. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to… well, use the muscles in your face?
PATIENT: Muscles? What muscles? I smile, I frown, I eat. What more does a man need? I haven't been practicing facial exercises, if that's what you're getting at. I'm a terrazzo worker, not a… a performer. I use my hands, not my face. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Are we going to do this or not?
DOCTOR: Let’s just get a quick look, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect me to sit here all afternoon. And please, no unnecessary questions. I’ve already told you everything you need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Open and close your mouth for me. And smile. Yes, like that. Hmm. And now frown. Okay. Palpating… slight loss of muscle tone, as you might expect at your age. Skin elasticity is diminished, naturally. Any difficulty chewing?
PATIENT: Chewing? No. Never had any difficulty chewing. I eat steak, you know. A good, thick cut. Can't eat that if you can't chew properly. I suspect you're just trying to find something wrong with me. Is this standard procedure? Because it feels… intrusive. Really, I just want a price estimate and a date for the surgery.
DOCTOR: “Surgery” is a strong word, Mr. Orwin. We haven’t even discussed options. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I’m a robust Norwegian man. We don't have allergies. Maybe a bit of hay fever in the spring, but nothing serious. And I certainly don’t go around taking a lot of… potions and pills. Just a little aspirin now and then. Honestly, this is becoming a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: And what medications, exactly, "now and then"?
PATIENT: Just the aspirin. For headaches. And sometimes, if my back aches after a long day working. Nothing fancy. A couple of pills, that's all. Look, are we getting anywhere with this or not? I have appointments to keep. I don’t have time for a full medical history. A quick look, a price, a date. That’s all I ask. Is that too much?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Based on what you’ve told me, and my quick examination, it appears you’re concerned about facial laxity. However, before we discuss any procedures, I need a complete medical history. It's necessary to ensure your safety. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: A primary care physician? Really? At my age, you just take things as they come. No, I don’t have a… a 'primary care physician'. I see a doctor when I need to see a doctor. A cold, a flu, a broken bone. Not for… yearly check-ups and pointless questions. This is ridiculous. I’m starting to think I should have gone somewhere else. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, but I am obligated to ensure your well-being. I cannot proceed with any cosmetic procedures without a thorough medical evaluation. I strongly recommend you schedule an appointment with a primary care physician. I can provide you with a list of qualified doctors in the area. .
