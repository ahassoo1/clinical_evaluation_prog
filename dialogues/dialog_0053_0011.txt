DOCTOR: Right. Armando Honcoop, 64. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes, Honcoop. Armando Honcoop. Look, Doc, I ain't got all day. Just need a paper signed. A clearance, you understand? For… well, for somethin’ a fella wants done. Cosmetic, they called it. Don’t bother me with details. Just need to know if I'm… fit enough. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: A "clearance," you say?
PATIENT: Yes! A clearance. From a… a place. They need a doctor to say I’m alright. Before… before they do the thing. I don't know why I need a doctor, frankly. Seemed like a waste of time, but they insisted. Are you gonna sign it or not? I got errands.
DOCTOR: “Alright,” is rather subjective, Mr. Honcoop. I don't simply sign off on procedures I haven't assessed you for. What exactly is this “thing” they’re planning?
PATIENT: Assess? Look, I told you, I don’t know the details! They just said somethin' about… smoothin’ things out. On my face. It's… personal. And frankly, Doc, I'm not one for sharin'. I just want to know if my heart's still pumpin' and I ain’t gonna keel over on the table. That’s all you need to know. Can you check that or not?
DOCTOR: “Smoothin’ things out”... Right. Well, even for a cosmetic procedure, I need some information. It's irresponsible, frankly, to clear someone without knowing their basic medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Hmm… Let me think. Old age, maybe? I got a little ache in my back sometimes, and my knees ain't what they used to be. But diagnosed? No, nothin’ serious. I work hard, that’s all. Radio towers, you know? Climbin’ around. Tough work. I ain't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Don’t see the point, mostly.
DOCTOR: Radio towers, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Installin’ and repairin’. Been doin' it for… well, a long time. Cellular too. Up high, workin’ with wires and… things. It's honest work. But that ain’t why I'm here. Can we just get back to this paper? I got a schedule, Doc. And I'm startin' to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, “honest work” at height involving… well, anything really, requires a degree of physical fitness. And frankly, climbing towers regularly could be relevant to… a number of things. Do you experience dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Sometimes. Up high, naturally. It's windy! And the sun… gets to ya. Everybody gets a little dizzy up there. It’s not a problem, Doc. I always hold on tight. I ain't fallen yet, if that’s what you're askin’. Look, are you gonna sign the paper or not? I'm a busy man and this is holdin' up my whole day.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I’m going to need to do a basic physical examination before I can even consider signing this form. We need to check your heart and lungs, blood pressure, and a neurological assessment to rule out any underlying issues. You said you experience dizziness...that needs to be investigated. It’s about your safety. And frankly, my professional responsibility.
PATIENT: Hold on now! An examination? You’re tellin' me I need an examination? I came here for a signature, not a check-up! I ain't got time for all that. I'm a grown man, I know my limits. And frankly, Doc, I don't appreciate you wastin' my time. I think I’ll just go somewhere else. Somewhere that respects a fella’s privacy and doesn’t ask a bunch of silly questions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, you are attempting to undergo a potentially risky procedure – even if you're downplaying it – and refusing a basic medical assessment. That’s… frankly, irresponsible. And I won’t be complicit in that. I understand you may not be insured, but I can offer a reduced fee cash price for a basic examination. Otherwise, I recommend you seek a healthcare provider who will perform a thorough assessment before you proceed. I cannot, in good conscience, sign this form without it.
PATIENT: Look, I ain't tryin' to argue with ya! I just want a signature! You're makin' a mountain outta a molehill. And reduced fee? Cash price? What kinda operation are you runnin' here? Forget it. I'm leavin'. I'll find someone who understands a simple request. Don't bother callin' me. .
