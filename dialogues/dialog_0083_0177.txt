DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what did I come for again? It's somethin'… down there. It’s…leakin'. Not good, you know? It’s been happenin’ a little while now, I think. A few weeks, maybe? I don't really keep track of dates so well these days. It's just… damp. And kinda smells funny.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “down there,” are you referring to vaginal leakage?
PATIENT: Vaginal? Oh… no, no, not there. Down there. You know… there. Between the legs. It’s… him. My… friend. It’s comin’ from him. I don't know why you askin’ so many questions! It’s… a man thing. You should know these things.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, I apologize if my questions were unclear. As a physician, I need to understand exactly what's happening to provide the best care. When you say "him," are you referring to your husband or partner?
PATIENT: Husband? Partner? Heavens no! I ain’t been hitched in… well, a long, long time. It’s… a problem. A personal problem. He… well, he's got somethin' goin' on down there and it’s…leakin'. I don’t know what it is, and honestly, I don't wanna know too much. Just fix it, okay? It’s embarrassing, talkin' 'bout this with a lady doctor and all.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Ms. Genard, and I want to assure you that everything we discuss is confidential. It sounds like your partner is experiencing some leakage. To help me understand what might be going on, and to determine the best course of action, could you tell me a bit more about the leakage?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. It's… kinda yellowish, sometimes a little green. Not a lot, usually just a few drops after… well, after we… you know. And it smells. Like… old fish, maybe? It doesn't always happen, just sometimes. He doesn't complain, but I can tell it bothers him. He's a quiet man. And I don’t want him to… you know… be embarrassed.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Genard. That information is helpful. Yellowish or greenish discharge, especially with an odor, can indicate an infection. It's good that he hasn't been complaining, but it's important to address this to prevent it from worsening and potentially causing discomfort or complications. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if that's alright. Does he experience any pain or burning when he urinates?
PATIENT: Urinates? Oh, now you're askin' too much! I don't need to know about that. He’s a grown man, he can tell you if he’s hurtin'. Honestly, Doctor, I just want somethin’ for it. Some kind of cream, maybe? I don’t want to get into all the details. It’s just… unpleasant. And I don't want to be rude, but I really think he’d prefer you ask him yourself.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to share personal details, Ms. Genard, and I respect that. However, to provide the best possible care, even for a potential cream treatment, I need a clearer picture of the situation. It's important to rule out anything serious, and asking about pain or burning is a standard part of that process. Perhaps the best course of action would be for him to schedule an appointment with me directly?
PATIENT: That… that sounds best. Honestly, Doctor, I feel silly havin' to explain all this. He's a good man, quiet, but good. He can come see you. He’ll tell you everything. Just… don’t make him uncomfortable, alright? He doesn't like a lot of fuss. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Genard. I will do my best to make him comfortable. I’ll make a note to schedule an appointment for him as soon as possible. Here's my card with the clinic number. Please have him call when he's ready, and tell him to ask for me, Dr. Alanes. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
