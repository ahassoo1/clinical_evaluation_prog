DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. PaguiO. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. I'm here for a vaccination, I think? My Medicare paperwork said something about being due for one, but honestly, I don’t remember exactly which one. I just want to make sure I'm all up to date.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. We can definitely figure that out. Medicare does send out those notices, and it's easy to misplace them. Let me take a look at your record here… Just confirming your date of birth is… [pause, reading the screen] …August 12th, 1978?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. August 12th, 1978. You're very good at this, thank you. It's helpful to have someone keeping track of these things for me! I tend to forget what I had for breakfast, let alone what shots I've gotten.
DOCTOR: That’s what we’re here for, Mr. PaguiO. It’s my job to keep track of those details. Alright, looking here… it seems you are due for your annual influenza vaccine and are also a bit behind on your updated COVID-19 booster. You received your last COVID booster back in April of 2023. Have you had any adverse reactions to vaccines in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I recall, anyway. I've always gotten my flu shot, and the COVID ones when they were first available… just the usual little soreness in the arm, nothing serious. So, both the flu and the COVID booster, you said? That sounds right.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. So, no concerning reactions. Just to confirm, and for my records, do you have any allergies to eggs, latex, or any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat eggs all the time, no problems. Latex… hmm, I don’t think so, I've never had any trouble with gloves or anything. And no medications, unless you count the occasional pain reliever for a headache. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And are you currently taking any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just trying to eat healthy, mostly. I do take a multivitamin sometimes, but it's not every day. I've been a bit better about that lately, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. So, intermittent multivitamin use, no regular medications. Before we proceed, are you feeling well today?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Feeling perfectly fine, actually. A little warm from walking here, but that's about it. No fever, no cough, no aches... just a normal day.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's get you set up for these vaccinations then. We'll do the influenza vaccine in one arm and the updated COVID-19 booster in the other. Do you have a preference as to which arm for which shot?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not really, no preference. Whatever is easiest for you, Doctor. I guess my right arm feels a little stronger… maybe the COVID one in that one? Just so I can feel extra protected, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly. COVID booster in the right arm, flu shot in the left. We’ll get you comfortable here. I’m cleaning the injection sites now with an alcohol swab. You might feel a small pinch with each injection, but it should be quick. Try to relax your arm, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. Do you have any questions before we start?
PATIENT: No, that sounds good. No questions. A pinch is fine, I've had worse! Just do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright, all done. That was quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, very quick! Didn’t feel much at all, actually. Just a little… well, it doesn’t even hurt. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll have you observe for about fifteen minutes just to be sure there are no immediate adverse reactions. It's rare, but it's always best to be cautious. I'll also give you a printout with information about potential side effects – usually just some mild soreness, fatigue, or a low-grade fever – and what to do if you experience anything more concerning. Do you have any immediate plans after this appointment?
PATIENT: No, nothing planned. Just heading home. So fifteen minutes here, then I'm free. That’s perfect. And yes, I appreciate the printout, thank you. Mild soreness is fine, I can handle that.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. While we wait, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just wanted to get those shots taken care of. You've been very helpful and thorough, Doctor. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. PaguiO. That’s my job. Alright, it’s been fifteen minutes. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: I'm feeling perfectly fine, actually. No dizziness, no nausea, just a little… well, my arms feel a little bit heavier, but that's expected, I guess. Everything seems good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That slight heaviness is perfectly normal. It should subside within a day or two. Here's that information sheet again, just as a reminder. If you experience any severe or concerning side effects – like difficulty breathing, a high fever, or any allergic reaction – please don't hesitate to call the clinic or seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions before you head home?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m all set. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for making this so easy. Have a good day, Doctor!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. PaguiO. It was a pleasure meeting you. You have a good day as well, and please take it easy for the rest of the day. .
