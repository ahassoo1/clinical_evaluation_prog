DOCTOR: Hi Antoine, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s… bothersome. A bit embarrassing, frankly. I have… something in my mouth. It’s white, you see. Like a coating. And it’s not pleasant. I'd like to get this sorted quickly, if possible. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is good you came in to get it checked out, and I'll do my best to help you figure out what's going on and get it sorted. "White coating" is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? It’s white. It’s… on my tongue, mostly. And the insides of my cheeks. It doesn’t… bleed, if that’s what you were going to ask. It just… is. I haven’t changed anything in my diet, I assure you. I eat a perfectly reasonable diet.
DOCTOR: Okay, no bleeding is good to know. And you haven't noticed any changes to your diet or anything else that might have coincided with it appearing?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I already told you. Perfectly reasonable. I haven’t been… indulging in sweets, or anything of that nature. I maintain a certain standard, you understand. This is likely just… a nuisance. A temporary irritation, I hope. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Antoine. I appreciate you being patient with me. I just want to gather as much information as possible to help determine what's going on. So, no changes in diet, no recent illnesses, and you haven’t noticed any pain, burning, or difficulty eating or swallowing, correct?
PATIENT: No. None of that. It’s… uncomfortable, yes. A slight… film. But no pain. And I can certainly still eat. I had a perfectly good steak last night. Though I did have to… scrape a bit at it first, if I’m being honest. But that’s beside the point. Just get on with it, please. What is it, and how do I get rid of it?
DOCTOR: Okay, “scraping at it” is a useful detail, thank you. It sounds like this coating is somewhat physically removable. And you mentioned it's on your tongue and the insides of your cheeks. Have you noticed it getting worse at any particular time of day, or after eating certain foods, even if it’s not a change in your diet?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. It seems… constant. Perhaps slightly worse in the mornings. But that’s likely just… general morning unpleasantness. I don’t scrutinize my mouth all day, Doctor. I have more important things to concern myself with. Are you going to look at it, or are we just going to continue this pointless questioning?
DOCTOR: You're right, a quick look is a good next step. If you don’t mind, could you open wide and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Hmph. Get it over with. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see it. It appears to be a coating on your tongue and the insides of your cheeks, as you described. It doesn't look deeply embedded, and it scrapes off fairly easily. There doesn't appear to be any redness or open sores, which is good. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, it's most likely oral thrush, also known as oral candidiasis. It’s caused by an overgrowth of a fungus called Candida. It’s not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Fungus? In my mouth? Preposterous. I maintain impeccable hygiene. Are you certain? It sounds… unhygienic. Is there a cream, or something? Something quick and discreet. I don’t want to draw attention to myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s not a reflection of your hygiene. Candida naturally lives in the mouth, and sometimes it overgrows due to various factors, even with good hygiene. It's not uncommon. Some factors that can contribute to it are stress, changes in your immune system, or even certain medications. The good news is it's usually easily treated. A topical antifungal medication, like a mouthwash or lozenge, is usually very effective. We can definitely discuss options that are quick and discreet. There's Nystatin suspension, which you swish in your mouth for a few minutes several times a day. Or clotrimazole lozenges, which dissolve slowly. Both are available by prescription. Would you prefer a mouthwash or lozenges?
PATIENT: Lozenge. Definitely a lozenge. Less… messy. And faster, I presume? I haven’t time to swish things around. And is it… contagious? My wife would be most displeased to contract some fungal affliction.
DOCTOR: Lozenge it is. They’re quite convenient. And it's not highly contagious, but it can be spread through saliva, so avoiding sharing utensils, drinks, and close contact, like kissing, for a day or two after starting treatment is a good idea. Once treatment begins, the risk of transmission drops significantly. I'll prescribe clotrimazole lozenges, 10 lozenges, to be dissolved slowly in your mouth five times a day for 7 days. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I assure you, I’m quite robust. And will this… affect my steak consumption? I trust it won’t. Just write the prescription and let me be on my way. The sooner this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t affect your steak consumption at all. You can continue to enjoy your meals as usual. Here's your prescription. You can take it to any pharmacy, and they should be able to fill it right away. I'd like you to follow up with me if your symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if they worsen. Also, if you develop any new symptoms, like difficulty swallowing or a fever, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. None. Just… a waste of time, frankly. But thank you, Doctor. I suppose.
