DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cannington. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my foot. It’s been botherin’ me something awful. A sore, really. A nasty one. And it just…won’t go away. I’ve had diabetes for years, you see. My husband, God rest his soul, he had it too. Runs in the family, unfortunately. It’s on my left foot, and it’s gotten quite painful, even when I'm just sittin' still.
DOCTOR: Diabetes, yes. It always complicates things. And a sore… on the left foot, you say?
PATIENT: Complicates things? You think I don’t know it complicates things! I've been livin' with it for decades, dear. Don't you tell me about complications. It’s not just any sore, either. It's deep. And it smells… well, not pleasant, let's just say. I’ve tried putting ointment on it, but it doesn't seem to do a bit of good. Honestly, I'm starting to worry it'll have to be… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it’s my job to be aware of the potential issues. Deep, you say?
PATIENT: Deep as a well, practically! And red around the edges. It’s gotten bigger this past week, I’d say. I can barely put a slipper on anymore, let alone my good shoes. I used to love to go to church on Sundays, but I've had to miss the last few because I couldn't walk comfortably. It’s just… it’s a miserable thing. And I always try to keep things clean, believe me. A lady has to, even when she's feelin' poorly.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s have a look. Please, sit back and elevate your left leg. I need to examine it properly. Don’t fuss if it’s a little uncomfortable. I’ll need to check the circulation in your foot, as well.
PATIENT: Circulation? Oh, goodness. That sounds…serious. Well, alright. But be gentle, dear. My skin is thin, you know. And I bruise easily. It's the age, I suppose. There. Is that high enough? Just try not to poke around too much, alright? I don’t have the constitution for a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, skin is quite fragile. Pulse is…weak, but present. There is some redness and swelling, and the wound itself…appears to be fairly deep, as you said. There's a concerning odor as well. I'm going to check the sensation in your foot now. Tell me if you feel this.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s…that’s cold. And…I don't feel much. Not like I used to, anyway. A little…a little tingle, maybe? But it’s not sharp, and it’s not painful. It just…feels distant, if that makes any sense. Like my foot isn't quite there. It’s been that way for a while, truthfully. I figured it was just old age catchin’ up with me. But this sore…it’s different. It’s worrisome, yes, very worrisome.
DOCTOR: Weak sensation…combined with the poor circulation and the depth of the wound…this is concerning. You have neuropathy, which is common with diabetes, but this needs to be addressed immediately. I’m going to order some blood work to check your blood sugar and look for signs of infection. We also need to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any bone involvement. And frankly, you need to see a podiatrist. They specialize in foot care and can properly debride the wound and manage this infection. I’ll write you a referral.
PATIENT: Podiatrist? Oh, dear. More doctors. Honestly, I feel like I live at the clinic these days. But…bone involvement? That does sound serious. And infection… well, I suppose I should have known. It feels hot sometimes, now that you mention it. A little feverish, even. Alright. Do what you have to do, dear. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? And I'd appreciate it if you could explain everything in plain English. None of that doctor talk, if you don't mind. What exactly does “debride” mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it’s important we address this promptly. "Debride" simply means to clean the wound and remove any dead or infected tissue. It's like… scraping away the bad parts to allow the good tissue to heal. As for the bone involvement, we need the X-ray to determine if the infection has spread to the bone itself, which would require more aggressive treatment, possibly antibiotics or even surgery. I’ll order the blood work and X-ray now, and I’ll get the podiatrist’s referral sent over to your primary care physician. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. It's crucial you follow up with them immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Surgery? Oh, goodness gracious. Now you’re scaring me, dear. I am a very old woman, you know. I don’t think my heart could take a surgery. I’d rather just… manage it, if possible. And antibiotics? Those always give me a terrible stomach ache. I suppose I have to do what the doctor says, but I really, really hope it doesn’t come to surgery. Can’t you just… put something on it? A special ointment, perhaps? Is there nothing else?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Cannington, I understand your concerns, but we need to be realistic. This isn't a simple cut. With your diabetes and the loss of sensation, this wound is at a high risk of becoming a much more serious infection, potentially leading to amputation if left untreated. I cannot simply put an ointment on it and hope for the best. The antibiotics may cause a stomach ache, but they are necessary to fight the infection. Surgery is a last resort, and we will explore all other options first. But we need to get this under control, and the podiatrist is the best person to do that. I’ll write very specific instructions for your primary care physician, including a request for pain management if needed. But please, schedule that appointment with the podiatrist as soon as possible. It’s in your best interest. Do you have any questions about the blood work or the X-ray?
PATIENT: Amputation? Oh, Lord have mercy. Amputation? No. No, I absolutely will not have my foot amputated. That's… that's unthinkable. I’ve heard stories… terrible stories. I’ll just wrap it up nice and tight and keep it clean. I’ve done that before with little cuts and scrapes, and it’s always worked. And my primary care physician? Dr. Abernathy? He’s… well, he’s a bit dismissive, if you don’t mind me saying. He always tells me I worry too much. He won’t take this seriously, I just know it. But I suppose I'll try. But I am telling you, dear, if they even mention surgery… As for the blood work and X-ray… how long will that take? And will it be painful?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Cannington, I understand your fear, but you are not listening to me. This is not a simple cut. It is a potentially life-threatening infection, and ignoring it will only make things worse. I am not trying to frighten you, but I need you to understand the severity of the situation. The blood work is a simple procedure—a small needle prick in your arm, it will be a brief discomfort. The X-ray is also non-invasive; you'll simply need to stand still for a few moments while the machine takes a picture. Neither should be particularly painful. I will make a note in your chart requesting Dr. Abernathy to thoroughly review the results and take your concerns seriously. But ultimately, the podiatrist will be the one to determine the best course of action. And please, I urge you to be open to their recommendations. Their goal is to save your foot, not to remove it. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Save my foot… yes, that’s all I want. Just save my foot. But I still don’t like the sound of surgery. And Dr. Abernathy… well, I’ll try. I really will. But he has a habit of… dismissing things. He says I worry too much and that I need to “toughen up.” Will the podiatrist… will they listen to me? Will they understand that I don’t want surgery? And how long before I can get an appointment? I don’t want to wait weeks and weeks, and let it get worse.
DOCTOR: I will make a note in the referral requesting that the podiatrist be aware of your concerns and preferences. A good podiatrist will always listen to their patients and explain all treatment options thoroughly. As for the appointment, I cannot guarantee how quickly you will be seen. However, I will mark the referral as urgent, which should expedite the process. I will also give you the podiatrist’s number so you can call and check on the status of your appointment. Here is the referral and the podiatrist's contact information. I’ve also included a summary of our conversation for your primary care physician. Now, do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose not. Just… thank you, dear. For tryin’. And… please, write down the name of that ointment again? The one you said won’t help? Just in case. And maybe… a little somethin’ for the stomach ache? Just in case. You’ve been very patient with me, and I do appreciate it. I do. It’s just… this foot. It’s been botherin’ me for so long.
DOCTOR: Alright. The ointment you've been using is likely a topical antibiotic, which isn't sufficient for this type of infection. It won't be effective, and I wouldn’t recommend continuing to use it. And for the stomach ache, I can write you a prescription for a mild antiemetic to take as needed. It won’t eliminate the nausea entirely, but it should help to alleviate the discomfort. Here’s the prescription. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. I’ll… I’ll call Dr. Abernathy and that podiatrist right away. And I’ll try not to worry too much. But it’s hard, you know? It’s very hard. You take care now, dear. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mrs. Cannington. Please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, follow up with the podiatrist as soon as possible. .
