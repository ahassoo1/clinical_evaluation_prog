DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's this tiredness. It's just…getting worse. And it's embarrassing, but I've been…eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I crave it. Clay, mostly. Sounds crazy, I know. I don’t know why I’m telling you this. Just…please don't look at me like that.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Hardenburgh, it’s good you’re being honest with me. While…unusual, cravings aren't unheard of. Let’s try to unpack this systematically. When you say "worse," how long has this tiredness been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…it’s been building for… maybe six months now? It started as just feeling a little sluggish, you know? Like after a big meal. Now…now it’s hard to get out of a chair sometimes. And the dirt-eating? That’s been…three months, maybe? It comes and goes, but when it starts, I just have to have it. Don't ask me why. I’m a sensible woman. I don’t usually do things like this.
DOCTOR: Six months of progressive fatigue, and three months of…this pica, as we call it. And it’s an urge you feel you must satisfy. Alright. Let's try to rule out some common causes. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Oh, heavens, no. I eat the same things I always do. Toast for breakfast, a little soup for lunch, maybe some fish if I’m feeling fancy. Nothing exciting. I haven’t been trying any new diets or anything foolish like that. I can assure you. I'm not one of those people. Really, I don't understand what’s happening. I’ve always been strong, kept myself going. This is…undignified.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s not dwell on that. And, to be clear, I'm not questioning your…sensibility. Just gathering information. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…well, I’ve been a little breathless lately. Not like running a marathon breathless, but…getting out of breath walking up the stairs. And I’ve been feeling…sort of weak, I suppose. Not muscle weakness, exactly… just generally flimsy. And my skin feels…dry. Very dry. Though, to be fair, I’ve always had dry skin. It’s a woman’s curse, isn't it? Honestly, it's probably just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness, generalized weakness, dry skin…and the fatigue, of course. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Really, Doctor? Is that really necessary? I mean, honestly. It’s…normal. As normal as it’s ever been for a woman my age. Look, I came in here about tiredness and eating dirt, not to discuss…that. I’m a private person.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your discomfort. However, these questions are important to get a complete picture. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes indicate underlying issues that contribute to fatigue and…other symptoms. It doesn't have to be a detailed discussion, simply if you've noticed anything different than usual. Constipation?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Yes. Constipation, then. For…probably the last month or so. It’s not severe, but it’s…noticeable. I used to be so regular. It's just another thing, isn’t it? Everything seems to be failing at once. And frankly, I don’t need you writing it all down. It’s quite embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. A little ache in my joints sometimes, you know, like old age. But nothing…significant. Nothing that keeps me up at night or anything. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a sensible woman. I know when something is seriously wrong, and this isn't it. It's just…a slump. A bad patch. I’ve had plenty of those in my life.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, while I appreciate your…self-awareness, it’s my job to investigate all possibilities. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had the flu, probably twenty years ago. And a bad cold last winter. Nothing serious. My mother had…arthritis, I think. And she had a touch of the heart trouble, but that was a long time ago. I mostly stayed healthy. I didn’t believe in coddling myself. I've always been a strong constitution. Really, Doctor, I doubt it's anything complicated. It's just this tiredness. It's wearing me out. Can we just…get to the bottom of that?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Oh, heavens no. I wouldn’t dream of it! Too risky. A sensible woman avoids the knife whenever possible. Never had a need for one, thankfully. I healed quickly from everything. A good constitution, you see. Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to find something terribly wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I am simply gathering information. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I don’t believe in all that stuff. Just a little chamomile tea at night to help me sleep. And maybe a vitamin C tablet when I feel a cold coming on. That’s it. I’ve always prided myself on being drug-free. All those chemicals…terrible for the body. Honestly, I think this is all a waste of time. I just wanted to know why I was so tired. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Please, sit down. Now, one last thing. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any. A sensible woman builds up immunity, you see. I was always outdoors, strong and healthy. A little dust, a little pollen…never bothered me. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite insulted. Are you implying I'm a delicate flower? I came in here for a simple question, and you're treating me like a…a medical mystery. I think I’ve answered enough questions. Can we please talk about the tiredness now?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Hardenburgh, I've asked about your medical history, allergies, medications… all to rule out underlying causes. Given your symptoms – the progressive fatigue, the constipation, the pica – and your age, we need to consider several possibilities. I'm going to perform a brief physical exam, and then I'd like to order some blood work. It’s essential to check your iron levels, vitamin B12, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, is that absolutely necessary? I can assure you, I'm perfectly healthy. A little tired, maybe, but that's all. I've always been strong. It's probably just a phase. But… fine. If you insist. But I don't want a lot of poking and prodding. And I want the results quickly. I don't have time for this. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. I'll listen to your heart and lungs as well, and then a quick abdominal exam. It's standard procedure, Ms. Hardenburgh. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not concerning in itself. Now, breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss over a little tiredness. And my blood pressure is always a bit high when I'm nervous. I don't like doctors, you know. Too much poking and prodding. Just…get it over with. And don't tell me everything is wrong with me, alright? I don't need to hear about every ache and pain I might have.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Heart sounds…regular, but a slightly faster rate. Abdomen is soft, but…slightly tender in the lower quadrants. No masses palpable. And are you experiencing any pain with bowel movements?
PATIENT: A little discomfort, yes. But nothing terrible. Just…a bit of strain. It's probably just old age catching up with me. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a sensible woman. I know what I’m feeling. It’s not a medical emergency. Can we please just get to the blood work now? This is quite undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to draw a few vials of blood. Please extend your arm. This may sting slightly. I've ordered a complete blood count, iron studies, vitamin B12 levels, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. It should give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. The lab should have the results in about a week. Now, while we wait for the results, I recommend you increase your fluid intake and try to incorporate more fiber into your diet. We can discuss some options at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A week? Honestly, a week is far too long! I have things to do. And fluids and fiber? I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. Is this going to bruise? Honestly, Doctor, I'm a sensible woman. I don't have time for this. Just…call me when you have the results. And don't bother calling if it's nothing serious. I think I’ve had enough for today. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hardenburgh. I will contact you as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Have a good day.
