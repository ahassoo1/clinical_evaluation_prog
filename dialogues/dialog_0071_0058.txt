DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Osumi. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it plainly, I'm hoping to talk about losing some weight. It's… becoming a bit of a problem, and I was wondering if there might be some medicine that could help. I’m Vicent Osumi, by the way. Just in case.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Osumi, I see that here. Vicent Osumi, 63 years old. Weight loss is something we can definitely discuss. Can you tell me a little more about when you started noticing the weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It wasn't a sudden thing, Doctor. More… gradual. I'd say, maybe over the last year or so? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. My wife… she passed away about a year and a half ago, and things haven’t been quite the same since, if you understand. I just haven’t been eating like I used to, and it seems to be sticking a little more now. I've tried to pick it back up, but… it's not easy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Osumi. That's… a significant change, and it’s perfectly normal for appetite and eating habits to be affected by such a loss. It sounds like this has been a difficult time for you. So, over the past year, you’ve noticed a decrease in your appetite and some unintentional weight loss. About how much weight would you say you've lost, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I haven’t actually weighed myself recently, to be honest. I try not to. But… I’d guess maybe 15, 20 pounds? Perhaps a bit more. My clothes are definitely looser, and I can feel it, you know? It's not a comfortable feeling, not at all. I used to be a solid 180, maybe a bit over. Now… I’m probably closer to 160, 165.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around 15-20 pounds over the last year. And you mentioned you used to be around 180, now closer to 160-165. Besides the change in appetite, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weight loss?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. I still have my energy, I suppose. I still do my wood carving, though not as much as I used to. No trouble sleeping, nothing like that. I get tired easier, maybe, but that could just be my age, right? No pain, no dizziness… nothing that really stands out. It’s mostly just… the weight. And the feeling of not being myself.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Osumi. No other concerning symptoms. And you're right, fatigue can definitely come with age. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and maybe take a look at your reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, if you could just lie back for me?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation, good air entry bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to palpate your abdomen… any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing that stands out. It's… a little soft, I suppose. But no pain. It feels pretty normal to me. Ooh, maybe a little there, on the left side? But it’s not sharp pain, just… a bit of discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little discomfort on the left side. Noted. It could be a number of things. Now, just a quick neurological check. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes… and then I’ll check your reflexes. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Everything feels alright, though I always get a bit nervous with these tests! Old habits, I suppose. I used to work with wood all day, you know. Always worried about my hands.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Osumi. Working with wood all day certainly requires a lot of hand strength and coordination. Everything seems normal here as well, reflexes are intact. Now, to get a better picture of what might be going on, I’d like to order some basic blood work. It’ll check your thyroid levels, blood sugar, and some basic nutrients. That will give us a good starting point. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds very sensible. Blood work is fine. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? I just want to feel like myself again. When do I need to go for that?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll send an order to the lab here in the clinic. They can usually fit you in the same day, or tomorrow at the latest. The lab tech will give you instructions on whether you need to fast beforehand. It's usually a good idea to drink plenty of water, though. And while we’re waiting for the results, let’s talk a bit more about your diet… What does a typical day of eating look like for you now?
PATIENT: Well… that's the hard part, Doctor. It's not much, honestly. Breakfast is usually just a small cup of coffee and maybe a piece of toast. Lunch is often a sandwich, something easy. And dinner… sometimes I’ll cook something, fish or chicken usually, but a lot of the time it’s just… leftovers. Or nothing at all. I don’t really have much of an appetite. My wife used to do all the cooking, and… I just haven’t gotten back into it. It's silly, I know. But it’s true.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Mr. Osumi. Losing a partner is a huge change, and it's completely understandable that your routines, and even your appetite, would be affected. So, a relatively small intake throughout the day, mostly simple foods. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing or any pain when you eat?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no difficulty swallowing, and no pain. It's just… not enjoyable, you know? Food just doesn’t taste the same anymore. I used to love cooking, experimenting with new recipes… now it feels like a chore. It's hard to explain. It's not a physical problem, it's… something else. I’m hoping the blood work can tell us something, anything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Osumi. And you’re right to want to rule out any underlying physical causes first. While the blood work is being processed, and to address the emotional aspect of this, I’d like to recommend speaking with a therapist. Grief counseling can be incredibly helpful in situations like yours, and it can provide you with some tools to cope with the changes and regain your appetite, and your enjoyment of life. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: A therapist… Hmm. I hadn’t really thought about that. I always thought… well, I thought I could handle it myself. But… maybe you're right. Maybe I need a little help. Yes, Doctor. A referral would be… appreciated. I suppose there’s no shame in asking for help, is there?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Mr. Osumi. It takes courage to ask for help, and it’s a sign of strength, not weakness. I’ll get you a referral to a grief counselor I trust. In the meantime, let’s focus on getting those blood work results. Once we have those, we can formulate a more concrete plan. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you've covered everything. I’m just… relieved to be talking about it, to be honest. Thank you for listening, and for not dismissing it. It means a lot. I'll go get the blood work done as soon as possible. And I'll look into the grief counseling. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Osumi. I'm glad I could help. I'll have the lab order printed for you now, and a referral to the counselor. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and remember, it’s okay to ask for help.
