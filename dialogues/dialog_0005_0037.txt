DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kilton, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… how you say… wheezing. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Not every day, but more and more now.
DOCTOR: Wheezing, okay. And you say it’s been going on for a few weeks, getting worse… Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. When it happens… let me think. It seems to be worse when I am walking. Especially if I walk up a hill. And… sometimes at night. When I lie down. Not always, but some nights I wake up because I cannot get a good breath. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. So, exertion brings it on – walking, especially uphill – and it’s also bothering you at night when you’re lying down. Does anything relieve it?
PATIENT: Relieve it… oh dear. Let me think. Sitting down, yes. If I sit and rest for a bit, it gets better. And… if I use my little blue spray. The one the other doctor gave me. It helps, but not for very long. Then it comes back.
DOCTOR: A blue spray… do you remember the name of that spray, Ms. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh, I am so sorry. I do not remember the name. It is in a little blue plastic bottle. I keep it on my bedside table. My daughter helps me with my medicines, usually. She will know.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we can look it up. Okay, so it sounds like it's relieved somewhat by rest and this spray. And it's getting worse. Have you had a fever, cough, or chest pain along with the wheezing?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And not much cough, just a little one sometimes when the wheezing is bad. No chest pain, no. It just feels… tight. Like someone is squeezing my chest a little. Not very strong, but… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Tightness… alright. And has anything like this happened before?
PATIENT: Oh yes. Many years ago. When I lived in Bhutan. The doctor there said it was… the air. Something in the air. He gave me some medicine then, too. It was different medicine, though. And it was a long time ago. I was much younger.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, this has happened before, and you were told it might be related to the air quality. And you've had some changes in the medications you've used over time. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I do not think so. I eat everything. My daughter says I should not eat so much sugar, but that is not an allergy! And… no, I do not think I am allergic to any medicines. I have never had a bad reaction.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… The doctor said my blood pressure was a little high once, but he gave me a pill for it. I take that every day. And… my knees. They bother me sometimes. The arthritis, the doctor says. But that is all, I think. I am otherwise… healthy!
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and arthritis in your knees. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A long time ago. When I was very young, I had my tonsils out. And… when I broke my arm. When I was a girl. But that was very, very long ago. I do not remember much about it now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy and a broken arm, both in the past. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family members with lung problems – asthma, COPD, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, that is a good question. My mother… she had a cough all the time, when she was old. But I do not think it was asthma. Just a cough. And my brother… he smoked. He died young, from something else. But I do not think he had lung problems. It was his heart, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Never. I do not like smoking. It smells terrible! My husband, he used to smoke, but I made him stop. It is very bad for you.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright. Now, just a few more questions. Can you tell me a little bit about your daily life?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I live in a small house with my daughter and her family. I like to garden. I grow tomatoes and peppers. And I walk. When my knees allow. I also like to cook. Bhutanese food, mostly. And… I watch television. It helps me relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gardening, walking, cooking… Seems like you keep busy. Now, let's do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. I want to listen to your lungs and check your breathing. Then we can figure out what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I hope it is not too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit up straight and take a few deep breaths for me. Okay. I'm hearing some wheezing on both sides, as you described. And your breathing is a little faster than normal. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is… acceptable, but not ideal. A little tenderness here. Not alarming, but worth noting. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150/85. Pulse is regular, but a bit fast. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing an exacerbation of some underlying lung issue, likely asthma or COPD, though we need to confirm that. The wheezing and shortness of breath are consistent with that. The elevated blood pressure is also something we'll need to address. Now, I'm going to order a chest X-ray to rule out any other possibilities, like pneumonia or fluid in your lungs. I also want to check your oxygen levels overnight with a pulse oximeter to see how well you're breathing when you sleep. We'll get those results back quickly. In the meantime, I'm going to increase the dosage of your blue inhaler, and I'll prescribe a short course of oral steroids to help reduce the inflammation in your lungs. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Steroids? Are those safe? And… an X-ray? I do not like X-rays. But… if you think it is necessary, then I trust you, Doctor. So, you think it is my lungs? Like when I was a girl, in Bhutan? And the inhaler… more of it? Will that help me breathe? I am just a little worried. It is hard to breathe, and I do not want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s possible it's related to what you experienced in Bhutan. We need the X-ray to confirm the cause of the wheezing. And yes, the inhaler should help. Increasing the dosage will deliver more medication to your lungs, opening up your airways. As for the steroids… they do have side effects, but a short course like this is generally safe. You might experience some temporary mood changes, increased appetite, or trouble sleeping. But the benefits of reducing the inflammation in your lungs outweigh the risks in this case. We'll monitor you closely. I’m also going to prescribe a medication to help lower your blood pressure. It's important to keep that under control to protect your heart and kidneys. Here are your prescriptions. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to review your X-ray results and see how you're responding to the treatment. And I'm ordering the overnight pulse oximeter study. Do you have any questions about the medications or the study?
PATIENT: Oh… so many things. The pulse oximeter… what do I do with that? And… the steroids, how long do I take them for? And… will they make me feel different? I am a little worried about feeling different. I like to be myself. And the blood pressure medicine… will that make me tired? I like to garden, you see. I need to be strong.
DOCTOR: The pulse oximeter is simple. You clip it onto your finger before you go to bed, and it measures your oxygen levels overnight. It’s painless, and the results are automatically sent to my office. Don’t worry about it. The steroids are for five days only. Yes, they can cause some temporary mood changes or difficulty sleeping. If you experience those, just let me know. We can adjust the dosage or switch you to a different medication. And the blood pressure medicine can cause some fatigue in some patients, but that's not common. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If you feel tired, we can adjust it or switch you to a different medication. Look, I understand you’re worried, but these medications are generally safe and effective. We need to get your breathing under control and your blood pressure down. Don’t overthink it. Just follow the instructions, and we’ll monitor you closely. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It all sounds so… complicated. And so many medicines. I suppose… no. Not right now. Just… please be careful. I trust you, Doctor. But I am a little worried about feeling different. Thank you. I think… I will go home now. And try to rest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Try to rest, and follow the instructions carefully. My nurse will call you tomorrow to schedule the follow-up appointment and answer any further questions you may have. Next.
