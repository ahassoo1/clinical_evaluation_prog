DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 23 years of age. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well, I’ve been feeling… unsteady, I suppose. Like I can’t quite keep my balance. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it’s… well, I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. I just know it’s bothering me more recently.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Unsteady” can mean a lot of different things. And it's perfectly common for the timing of these things to be a little fuzzy. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe what you mean by “unsteady”?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… difficult to explain. It’s not a constant thing. Sometimes I feel perfectly fine, and then… suddenly, it’s like the room is swaying, or I’m swaying. Not dizzy, exactly, but like… off-balance. Like I might fall, but I haven’t yet. It happens when I’m standing, mostly. Walking is usually alright, but if I have to stand still for too long, that’s when it feels worse. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you're experiencing episodes of imbalance, rather than a constant feeling of dizziness. That’s helpful to know. And it's good that walking is mostly alright. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me if anything seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger… Oh, dear. That's a good question. I… honestly, I’m not sure. It doesn’t seem to be connected to anything specific. I've tried to think about it, but it happens randomly. Sometimes it's after I've been working, and sometimes it's when I'm just… relaxing. I work with… drills, you see. Rotary drills. Oil and gas. It's a lot of standing and moving around, though, so maybe that has something to do with it? I really don’t recall… is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Lilyanna. The information about your work is very relevant. Standing and moving around with drills…that could certainly contribute. It's good you’re thinking about potential connections. Now, let’s try to rule a few things out. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Oh, um… sometimes my ears feel a little… full? Not painful, just… blocked, like when you're on an airplane. And… I’ve been more tired lately, I think. Just generally… fatigued. It’s hard to say, though. Work is tiring, so it could just be that. I don't… I haven't really noticed anything else. Oh, and… this is a bit personal, but I've been a widow for a little while now, and… things haven't been the same since. I don't know if that matters. Does any of that sound… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, Lilyanna, all of that is important. The feeling of fullness in your ears, the fatigue, and certainly your personal history. It takes a great deal of strength to cope with loss, and stress can absolutely manifest physically. Now, regarding your ears, has this fullness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Mostly it's when I'm… standing still. Or maybe after I’ve been working for a long time. It's not terribly bothersome, just… noticeable. Like there’s pressure, but not a painful pressure. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t really affect my hearing, though. I can hear perfectly fine. It just… feels full. Does that clarify things at all? I’m sorry if I'm being vague. It’s just… difficult to remember everything precisely.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Lilyanna. You're describing things perfectly clearly, and it's very common to have difficulty recalling precise details, especially when dealing with subtle symptoms. The fact that it’s related to standing and is not accompanied by hearing loss is helpful. Now, let’s delve into your medical history a bit, if you don’t mind. Have you had any prior medical conditions or surgeries that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… difficult. I don’t really… remember much about medical things. I’ve been generally healthy, I think. I have private insurance, so I’ve seen doctors when needed, but… I don’t recall anything major. I think I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago. And… I've had the usual vaccinations, I suppose. Nothing recent that I can recall. I am able to provide my insurance information if that would be helpful. I'm just not sure about specific conditions or surgeries. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. We can certainly work with that. Knowing you've generally been healthy and had tonsillectomy as a child is a good start. I'll review your EHR to see if there's any further information available. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if you're comfortable sharing. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. Hmm. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he passed away when I was young. I don't recall… specific illnesses. They lived in Ethiopia, you see. It wasn’t really a… a place where people talked much about medical history. We just… dealt with things as they came. I'm sorry, Doctor. I’m not being very helpful, am I? It's just… difficult to recall those details. I don't want to forget anyone important. I'm unsure.
DOCTOR: You are being perfectly helpful, Lilyanna. Knowing your mother had high blood pressure is useful information, and it's perfectly understandable that details about family history are difficult to recall, especially given the circumstances. It's not a reflection on you at all. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I don’t smoke. I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine on a special occasion. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I work hard, and I need to be alert and focused, you see. I’m very careful about my health. I’m more concerned about getting better, honestly, and I don't partake in any of that. Is that… satisfactory? I want to be clear about that, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Lilyanna. That information is very reassuring. Now, I'd like to ask about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements.
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. I… I don’t really take any medications regularly. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, if I have them. And I take a multivitamin, just to stay healthy, you know? Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I don’t have any chronic conditions that require regular medication, as far as I’m aware. I’ve been lucky, in that regard, I suppose. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm hoping this isn't a sign of something… serious.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Lilyanna. Occasional ibuprofen and a multivitamin – that’s helpful. I understand your concern about it being a sign of something serious, and we're going to work through this systematically to figure out what's going on. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. This will involve checking your vital signs, looking in your ears, and doing a few simple balance and neurological tests. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel better, and I’m willing to do whatever it takes. I understand you need to do some tests to figure out what’s happening, and I’m happy to cooperate. Just… please be gentle? I sometimes feel a little… unsteady, even when I’m sitting still, you see. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilyanna. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll take everything at your pace, and you can let me know at any time if you feel uncomfortable. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is excellent. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let's take a look in your ears… Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums look normal. I don’t see any signs of infection or fluid buildup. Now, I’d like you to stand up for me, and I’m going to perform a few simple balance tests. Can you stand with your feet together, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. Oh… whoa. Excuse me. It’s… difficult. I feel a little… off-balance. I need to hold on just for a moment. Is that… normal? It’s worse with my eyes closed. I’m a little unsteady as it is, and closing my eyes makes it significantly harder. Perhaps we should… try something else? I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lilyanna, that’s perfectly normal. It’s good you’re letting me know. It’s very common to lose balance slightly when closing your eyes, but it sounds like you're experiencing a more pronounced instability. Let's not push it. We don’t want you to fall. Okay. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. That means they are within the expected range. Now, one final quick test. Could you try to walk a straight line for me, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can try that. Oh… that was… difficult. I’m not very good at that, I’m afraid. I had to really concentrate to keep from… well, from falling over. I tend to drift to the left, even when I’m trying to walk straight. It’s… a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’m not usually this clumsy. Is that… concerning? I’m very worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Lilyanna. In fact, it’s very helpful information. It sounds like you have some difficulty with balance and coordination, which explains the unsteadiness you’ve been experiencing. The drifting to the left is something we’ll need to investigate further. Okay. Based on what you've told me, and the brief examination I’ve conducted, I believe the most likely cause of your symptoms is a problem with your vestibular system – which is the part of your inner ear responsible for balance. However, there are other possibilities, such as neurological issues or vitamin deficiencies, that we need to rule out. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’m also going to refer you to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing and balance evaluation. They have specialized equipment that can help pinpoint the exact cause of your imbalance. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Blood tests and a specialist… that seems like a sensible plan. I want to know what’s happening, and I trust your judgement. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure out the cause of my imbalance. I just… I want to feel normal again. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, should I be avoiding anything, or taking any precautions? I'm a bit worried about working, since it seems like that might make things worse.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Lilyanna. I understand your concern. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid activities that could increase your risk of falling, such as strenuous exercise or walking on uneven surfaces. Be extra cautious when standing for long periods, and consider using a cane or walker for support if you feel unsteady. Regarding your work, it may be best to temporarily reduce your workload or modify your duties to minimize the risk of falls. Talk to your supervisor about potential accommodations. I’ll also provide you with a note for your employer explaining your condition. I'm going to write you a prescription for meclizine, which is an over-the-counter medication that can help reduce symptoms of dizziness and nausea. It may not cure your imbalance, but it can help make you more comfortable. Here are your instructions. Take one tablet of meclizine every 12 hours as needed. Do not take more than two tablets in a 24-hour period. Be aware that it may cause drowsiness, so avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking this medication. I’ll also give you a list of resources for balance disorders, including websites and support groups. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That… that’s very thorough. Meclizine, reducing my workload, the resources… it all makes sense. I’m a little worried about the drowsiness, since I need to be alert at work, but I suppose I can avoid driving for now. One question, though. How long will it take to get the results of the blood tests and the appointment with the audiologist? I'm anxious to know what's causing this, and I'd like to start treatment as soon as possible. Is there anything I can do to… speed things up? I just… I want to feel like myself again, and I’m worried about missing work, and… well, everything. I'm just a little overwhelmed, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed in this situation. I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get you a diagnosis and treatment plan as quickly as possible. The blood tests should take about 2-3 business days to come back. I’ll have my staff contact you as soon as the results are available. As for the appointment with the audiologist, I’m sending a referral over to them today. They usually schedule appointments within a week, but I’ll call them directly to see if they can expedite the process for you. In the meantime, try to stay calm and focus on taking care of yourself. Get plenty of rest, eat a healthy diet, and avoid activities that could worsen your symptoms. If your symptoms suddenly worsen, or you develop any new symptoms, such as headache, fever, or vision changes, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything. Thank you… thank you very much. I feel a little better just knowing that we have a plan. I appreciate your kindness and understanding. I’ll wait for the call about the blood tests and the audiologist. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. It was my pleasure to meet you. Remember, we’re in this together, and I’ll do everything I can to help you get back to feeling your best. Don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and please be careful.
