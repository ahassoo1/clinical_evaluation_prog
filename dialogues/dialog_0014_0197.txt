DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta, good to see you. Or… as good as can be, I suppose. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Osterholm. Yes, well, it’s this card I need. For the driving, you see? The ride-share thing. My daughter said I need a medical card to keep doing it, and I thought I’d just get it over with. It’s a bit of a hassle, but… well, a girl’s gotta do what a girl’s gotta do.
DOCTOR: Right. A…ride-share medical card. Yes. Those are becoming…common. So, it’s not so much what brings you in, but more a formality for your daughter, then?
PATIENT: Not just a formality, dear. They really do want the card now. I wouldn’t be allowed to pick up passengers without it, apparently. And I like picking up passengers. It keeps me busy, you know? And the money is… helpful. But yes, my daughter, bless her heart, made sure I scheduled this appointment. She worries so.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Well, we need to make sure you're fit to drive safely, naturally. Let's start with a basic history. Have you been seeing any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I saw Dr. Tanaka for my arthritis, maybe… six months ago? Just a check-up, nothing serious. He adjusted my medication. And before that… hmm. I had a little trouble with my blood pressure last year, but that seems to be under control now. My regular check-ups are with Dr. Lee, but it’s been a while, to be honest. I keep meaning to schedule something.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and blood pressure... alright. And are you currently taking any medications for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, for the arthritis I take… let me see… Naproxen, 500 milligrams, twice a day. And for the blood pressure, I’m on Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. I take them both with my breakfast. I’m very good about my pills, you know. My daughter would kill me if I wasn’t.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Consistency is important. Any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to eat a lot of shellfish as a child, and I’m fine. And I’ve had all my vaccinations, of course. My daughter made sure of that too! She’s very… thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my vision… it’s not what it used to be, naturally. I need reading glasses, and sometimes things are a bit blurry at a distance. But nothing drastic. My hearing is… okay. I sometimes have to ask people to repeat themselves, but I think that’s just because they mumble!
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about any recent episodes of dizziness, fainting, or problems with balance?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I haven’t felt dizzy or faint. My balance is… well, I’m 70, so it’s not perfect, but I can still walk without falling! I do my Tai Chi every morning, you know. Helps with the balance.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, before we do a quick physical exam, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations recently?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain, thank goodness. And I haven’t been short of breath. My heart feels… normal. Sometimes it races a little when I’m excited, but nothing to worry about. Like when my granddaughter visits! She’s a whirlwind, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There we go. A little creaky, but functional. Don’t mind my joints, they tell a story, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Pulse is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Lungs are clear, but a slight murmur… probably benign, given her age. Blood pressure is 130/80. Okay, stand still. Reflexes are a little slow, but within normal limits. Any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No numbness or tingling, Doctor. Not at all. Everything feels… well, like it should, for someone my age. A little ache here and there, but nothing new. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily wrong, Mrs. Sciarrotta. It's just… everything is a little slower. Your reflexes, your heart rate… it’s expected. We just need to make sure it doesn’t interfere with your driving. Have you ever had any problems with blackouts or seizures?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness, no! Never. I've always been very… steady. A little forgetful maybe, but not blackouts or anything like that. My daughter would have told me if I had. She remembers everything for me, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Considering everything, and given that your daughter seems to be very attentive to your health… I suppose we can proceed with the medical card. However, I do recommend a follow-up with your primary care physician, Dr. Lee, to discuss these slight changes and ensure everything is being properly monitored. Also, I suggest limiting your ride-sharing hours to no more than 20 per week, and avoiding driving during peak traffic times. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Twenty hours a week… and no rush hour. I can do that. Dr. Lee… I’ll call him. Honestly, it’s mostly just to keep my daughter happy. She worries so much. But thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you checking me over. So… do I get the card now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Here's the medical card. It's valid for one year, and you'll need to renew it then. Just remember my recommendations regarding your hours and the follow-up appointment. And try not to stress too much. Stress isn’t good for your blood pressure. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor. Twenty hours… I think I can manage that. And yes, I’ll call Dr. Lee. I really will. No, I don’t think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Drive safely, and take care. .
