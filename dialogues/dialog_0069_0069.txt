DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguioto. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. I'm here for a vaccination, I think? My doctor back home – well, he suggested I get a few updates while I’m visiting. I wasn’t quite sure which ones, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s good you’re thinking about staying up-to-date on your vaccinations. We can certainly figure out what you might need. Let me take a quick look at your chart here. I see you're 47 years old, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Forty-seven. Turning forty-eight in November, actually, but forty-seven for now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Alright, I see some basic information here… and that you have Medicare, which is helpful. It looks like we have a record of a tetanus booster from about ten years ago. Do you happen to recall any other vaccinations you've had – perhaps for things like influenza, pneumonia, or shingles?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Ten years ago for tetanus, yes, I remember that. I’ve definitely had the flu shot every year for as long as I can recall, usually in the fall. Pneumonia… I think I had one of those a long time ago, maybe when I was traveling? And shingles… no, I don’t think I’ve had the shingles shot. It sounds… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, regular flu vaccinations, a tetanus booster within the last ten years, and potentially a pneumonia vaccine in the past, but no shingles vaccine. Given your age and health history, and since it's August 2nd, 2025, it's a good time to consider the updated COVID-19 vaccine as well. Have you had any of the COVID-19 vaccines or boosters previously?
PATIENT: Oh yes, the COVID vaccine! I had the first couple when they first came out, and I think I had one booster after that, maybe two. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. It was all happening so fast.
DOCTOR: I understand, it was a lot to keep track of. Okay, I see records of the initial Pfizer series, and one booster dose in… February of 2022. Given the updated recommendations, you are eligible for another updated COVID-19 vaccine. To get a better picture, do you have any allergies to vaccines or any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Not to vaccines, not to medications… I get a little itchy sometimes with bee stings, but that's about it. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies is helpful. And just to cover all bases, are you currently experiencing any symptoms – fever, cough, shortness of breath, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all. Feeling perfectly fine, actually. Just a little warm from the walk over, but otherwise healthy as a horse, you could say.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear! Okay, Mr. Paguioto, based on what you've told me and your records, I recommend we go ahead and administer the updated COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine today. We can discuss the shingles vaccine on your next visit. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. COVID and flu today is fine. And we can talk about shingles later. I've heard enough about that one for now, thank you very much!
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Great. Before we proceed, I just want to quickly check your blood pressure and pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It's standard procedure, just to be sure everything is as it should be. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly sensible. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is a little elevated but within an acceptable range. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Everything sounds good. I'm going to clean the area on your upper arm with an alcohol swab. You may feel a small pinch.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. A little pinch is no problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. You may experience some mild soreness at the injection site, and possibly some fatigue or mild muscle aches for a day or two. Those are normal side effects and should resolve on their own. I'm going to have the nurse bring you a pamphlet with more information about the vaccine and what to expect. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all sounds pretty straightforward. Thank you very much, Doctor. You've been very thorough. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paguioto. I’m glad I could help. Just to recap, you received the updated COVID-19 vaccine today. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a few months to discuss the flu shot and potentially the shingles vaccine. The nurse will be with you shortly to provide the information pamphlet and schedule that appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor. And thank you to the nurse as well, when she comes. I appreciate all your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paguioto! It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a wonderful day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
