DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pavlovic… yes, that’s right. Hmm… well, it’s this cough. Been… a long time now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Gets worse when I… when I do things. Or maybe not. It’s hard to say, really. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that’s been going on for a while. And it seems to get worse with activity?
PATIENT: Activity… maybe. It’s just… scratchy. Like something’s stuck in my throat. Not painful, just… annoying. I try to ignore it, but… well, it doesn't always work. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. A few months, at least? Maybe longer. It feels like it's been a long time. I mostly just try to rest when it gets bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, I don’t think. Not that I’ve noticed. And… I get tired easily, but I’m ninety years old! I figure that’s just… old age. I haven't lost my appetite, still enjoy my food, thank goodness. No chest pain… no, nothing like that. Just the cough. And the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no chest pain, appetite is good, just the cough and tiredness. Have you noticed any shortness of breath with this cough, or even just generally?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Sometimes, yes. When I walk up the stairs, it feels like I’m not getting enough air. But I live on the second floor, you know? So stairs are always a little hard. It’s hard to say if it's just the stairs, or the cough… or maybe just me getting old. It’s not terrible, but I do have to stop and catch my breath sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, stopping to catch your breath with activity, especially stairs. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, COPD, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh dear. That’s a hard one. I saw a doctor many years ago, when my wife was still… well, never mind. He gave me some pills for my… blood pressure, I think. But I don’t really remember anything else. No asthma, no… what was that other one you said? COPD? Doesn’t ring a bell. I mostly just try to stay healthy, eat well, and take it easy. I don't think I've been told about any serious problems, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a little boy, climbing a tree. They fixed it, I think. That was a long time ago. And my wife… she had her gallbladder out, but that was her, not me. I don't think I’ve ever been in the hospital for anything myself, not that I remember. Just the broken arm, a long, long time ago. I mostly stayed out of hospitals, if I could help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, just a little something for my joints. The arthritis, you know? Keeps them from getting too stiff. Just a little white pill, I think. I get it from the drugstore. Can’t remember the name of it, though. Nothing else. I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife always said I had a cast iron stomach. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but… you know, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I could be forgetting something. But I don’t think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s a long story. My wife’s mother, she had… heart trouble, I think. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, like me. But… most of my family, they were healthy. Farmers, mostly. Strong people. They didn't go to doctors much. We didn't talk about illnesses much, back then. It wasn't something you boasted about. I… I don't remember a lot of specifics, to be honest. A lot of them have passed away now, too. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh no, never. My wife… she didn't like it. Said it was bad for your health. And I always listened to my wife. Never touched a cigarette in my life. No, never smoked. And I don't drink much either, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Go ahead. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle, please. I’m an old man, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m listening now. Your breathing sounds a little bit wheezy, and I can hear some crackling sounds, especially lower down in your lungs. Your heart rate is a little bit fast, but regular. I’m going to check your oxygen saturation now. Your oxygen level is 92%, which is a little bit low. I'm also going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated. Finally, I'm going to feel your legs to check for swelling. There's a little bit of swelling in your ankles.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… not good. Swelling in my ankles, you say? I thought that was just… old age. And a fast heart? I do get a little breathless sometimes, like I said. Is it something serious, Doctor? I just want to get this cough sorted out. It’s been bothering me for so long… What does all this mean?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve heard and felt during the exam, it sounds like you likely have some underlying congestion in your lungs, and possibly some early signs of heart failure. The crackling sounds in your lungs, the wheezing, the low oxygen level, the elevated blood pressure and the swelling in your ankles all point in that direction. Now, I want to be clear, I can’t give you a definitive diagnosis without further testing. We’ll need to get a chest X-ray to see what’s going on in your lungs, and I’d like to order a blood test to check your heart function and rule out other possible causes. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a diuretic, which will help to get rid of some of the fluid in your body and ease the swelling in your ankles. I’m also going to recommend that you limit your salt intake and try to rest as much as possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Diuretic… that sounds like a big word. And salt? I like salt! But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, I’ll try. I want to feel better. Is this… serious? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don't want to go to the hospital. Just want this cough to go away, and… feel less tired. Chest X-ray… that sounds scary. But… if it will help, I suppose I can do it. Tell me… what’s the worst that could happen? And will this medicine… make me sleepy?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovic, let’s take this one step at a time. The diuretic – it’s a water pill. It helps your kidneys remove extra fluid from your body. It's a common medication, and it’s generally very safe. As for the worst that could happen… if we don’t address this, the fluid build-up could worsen, making it harder for you to breathe and putting more strain on your heart. That's why it’s important to get the X-ray and blood tests. We need to know exactly what’s going on. The X-ray is very quick and painless. It doesn’t involve any injections or anything like that. And we’ll do it right here in the clinic. Regarding the medicine, some people do experience a little bit of drowsiness as a side effect, but it’s usually mild. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. I don’t think you’ll need to go to the hospital right now. But if your breathing gets significantly worse, or you develop chest pain, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. I want to assure you, we’re going to do everything we can to get you feeling better. We’ll monitor your progress closely and adjust your treatment as needed. We will start with the X-ray and blood work today and schedule a follow up appointment in one week to discuss the results. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: A plan… yes, that sounds… reasonable. One week… I can remember that. X-ray and blood work today. Then see you next week. And… try not to eat too much salt. All right. I trust you, Doctor. Just… please, no surprises. And… could you… maybe write all this down for me? My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Just so I don’t forget anything. And… thank you. For taking the time. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovic. Absolutely. Here's what we're doing. Today: Chest X-ray Blood work Medication: Diuretic - – take one pill each morning. Diet: Limit salt intake. Follow-up: One week from today. Important: If you experience worsening shortness of breath or chest pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Here you go. I’ve also scheduled the X-ray and blood work for you. The technician will explain everything. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: Chest X-ray… blood work… diuretic… limit salt… Yes, it’s all here. Thank you, Doctor. No, I think that covers everything… for now. I appreciate your patience with me. It’s not easy, being old, you know? But… thank you. Really. I think that’s all. I’ll see you next week, then. .
