DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Overgaard, it’s… difficult to explain exactly. I just… can’t seem to empty my bladder like I used to. It feels like there’s always something left in there, even after I try. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, maybe a month.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. And you feel incomplete emptying, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s a good way to put it. Incomplete. It’s… uncomfortable, not painful, really, just… frustrating. And I have to go more often, too. Seems like I just finished and then… not long after, I have to go again.
DOCTOR: More frequent urination and incomplete emptying. Right. And is there any burning or discomfort while you urinate?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No burning at all. Like I said, it doesn’t hurt. It just… doesn’t all come out. And it feels like I’m pushing a little harder than I used to, to get anything to go.
DOCTOR: Pushing… alright. Any changes in the stream itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… stream? You mean, how it comes out? Hmm. Let me think. It's not… weak, exactly. It’s just… it starts and stops sometimes. Not a steady flow, like it used to be. Does that make sense? I don’t know all the medical terms, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Hilber, it does. Intermittent stream. Have you noticed any dribbling after you finish urinating?
PATIENT: Dribbling… yes, now that you mention it, a little. Just a few drops, after I stand up. I thought it was just… old age, maybe. I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be, so I figured some might get on my clothes. But maybe it's more than that?
DOCTOR: “Old age” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Hilber. We need to figure out why this is happening. Any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills. My back feels a little stiff sometimes, but that’s just from working, I think. I work with the shoe machines, you see. It’s a lot of standing and bending. No pain in my side, though. I haven’t felt sick at all, just… this bladder problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, Mr. Hilber. Just a quick abdominal exam, and I’ll need to check a prostate exam. It’s…standard procedure, given your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A prostate exam? I… I’ve heard things about those. Not pleasant things. Is it… necessary, Doctor? I mean, if it’s just a little dribbling, couldn't we try something else first? Maybe some exercises, or… something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, with all due respect, "exercises" are not going to rule out potential serious issues. A prostate exam is necessary to assess the size and condition of your prostate gland, which is often the cause of these symptoms in men your age. It’s a quick exam, and it’s important for proper diagnosis. We need to rule things out. Are you going to let me do the exam, or are we going to continue guessing?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose you’re right. I don't want to ignore anything serious. It’s just… I’ve never had one before. And I don’t like doctors poking around, if you understand. But if it’s important… alright, Doctor. You can do the exam. Just… be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on your side on the examination table, knees bent. I’ll explain what I’m doing as I go, though it will be brief. And I will be as quick as possible, Mr. Hilber.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just… let me know when you’re ready. I’m not sure I’m very flexible anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. I’m going to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to assess the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Try to relax as much as possible. Alright. Your prostate is enlarged, and it feels a little firm. Not acutely tender, but definitely not normal. It’s likely contributing to your urinary symptoms. I’m going to need to order a urine sample to check for infection, and a PSA blood test to get a better understanding of your prostate health. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: A PSA test? What’s that for, exactly? I keep hearing about tests, but I don't know what they do. Is it something serious if it’s high? And what happens if it is an infection? I'm starting to get a little worried now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. It's a marker for prostate health. A higher level can indicate an enlarged prostate, inflammation, or even prostate cancer. It's not a definitive diagnosis, mind you, just a screening tool. As for the infection, if present, we’ll treat it with antibiotics. We need the results of the tests before we can determine the next steps. I’m ordering those tests now. The lab will call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids – water is best. And I’ll want to see you back here in a week to discuss the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Drink more water… and come back in a week. A week… that seems like a long time to wait, when you’re worried about… well, you know. Prostate cancer. Is it… is it likely, Doctor? I’ve heard terrible things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, let's not jump to conclusions. A high PSA does not automatically mean you have cancer. It could be a number of things. We need to get the results first. Worrying yourself sick won't help anything. I’ve ordered the tests. The lab will contact you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just… try not to worry, you said. That’s… easier said than done. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Get some rest, Mr. Hilber. And try to relax. The lab will be in touch. .
