DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I told the lady on the phone, it’s this…shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a bit now. Not sure how long, truthfully. Old age, I suppose. Let’s just get this over with, alright? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide, I understand you’re experiencing shaking, primarily in your hand, and you'd like to get to the bottom of it quickly. I appreciate your directness. “A bit now” is a little vague though – can you try to be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Goodness gracious. I…well, maybe six months? Could be longer, could be shorter. Time just…blurs, you know? I was still…with Eleanor then, definitely. Before…everything. Does that help? Honestly, I don’t remember noticing it until recently. It’s getting…worse. And frankly, it’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, and definitely before your wife, Eleanor, passed. That gives me a timeframe. And you've noticed it's getting progressively worse. Is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I try to do something. Like…holding a fork. Or trying to sign my name. That's when it's really bad. When I'm just sitting here, it's…less noticeable. Though sometimes I feel it, a little tremor, even then. It's annoying, that’s what it is. And frankly, it makes me look feeble.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's exacerbated by activity, especially fine motor skills like eating or writing. And you feel a tremor even at rest sometimes. Does anything seem to make it better or worse – caffeine, stress, certain positions?
PATIENT: Caffeine? I haven't had a decent cup of coffee in…well, since Eleanor. She didn’t like it. Stress? What doesn't stress me these days? Everything’s stressful. As for positions…I don’t know. Maybe when I’m tired it’s worse. Look, are we getting somewhere? I really don’t see what this little shake is going to kill me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no caffeine, generally high stress levels, and potentially worse when fatigued. You're right to question if this is serious, Mr. Baide, and I appreciate your candor. While it might not be life-threatening, we need to understand why it’s happening. Let’s move on to other things. Do you have any other medical problems that I should know about?
PATIENT: Other problems? Oh, where to begin. My knees ache, of course. What eighty-year-old doesn't have bad knees? And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, though I’ve got those thick glasses. The usual. Oh, and my digestion…well, let’s just say I’m not as regular as I once was. Though, that’s probably just old age too. I haven’t been to a doctor in…years, honestly. Eleanor always handled all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so knee pain, declining eyesight, and some digestive issues. And you haven't seen a doctor regularly in quite some time. Fair enough. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood…something? No, not that I recall. Eleanor always said my heart was strong. She was a nurse, you know. Always taking my pulse, checking things. No diabetes either, I don't think. I liked my sweets, but she kept me in check. Look, are we going to do an examination or what? I'm starting to feel a bit lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Yes, let's do a quick examination. We'll check your pulse, blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your hands and reflexes. That will give me a better idea of what's going on. Could you please sit up and extend your arms?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. Though I warn you, my arms aren't what they used to be. Don’t expect any impressive biceps, alright? This shaking makes it difficult to hold things steady, too, so be careful.
DOCTOR: Your pulse is a bit fast, 88, and somewhat irregular. I hear a slight murmur, which we’ll need to investigate further. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, but your hand tremor is definitely noticeable, even at rest. Is there any pain associated with the shaking?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. More…uncomfortable. Like a buzzing, a constant vibration. It doesn’t hurt, if that makes sense. It’s just…annoying. And distracting. Like someone’s got a little motor running in my hand. This is all very unsettling, you know? I haven't felt this weak in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, but a buzzing or vibration. I understand it's unsettling, Mr. Baide. Given your symptoms – the tremor, the irregular pulse, the murmur – and your history, I think we need to do some further testing. I’d like to order a blood test to check your thyroid function and rule out other causes of tremor, and an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for goodness sake. More poking and prodding? Look, I just want something to make it stop shaking. Isn't there a pill for that? Just something to calm it down? All these tests sound…expensive. And frankly, I’m tired of being a guinea pig. But...fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just get it over with, alright? And tell me how much this is going to cost.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. While I wish there was a simple “pill” to stop the shaking, it’s important to understand why it’s happening before we can determine the best course of treatment. The blood test and EKG will help us with that. The blood test is fairly standard and should be covered by Medicare. The EKG is also typically covered. I can have the billing department give you a more precise estimate, but it shouldn’t be a significant out-of-pocket expense. In the meantime, I'll write you a prescription for a low-dose beta-blocker. It may help with the tremor, but it's not a cure-all, and it won't address the underlying cause. We’ll see how you respond. I also recommend avoiding caffeine and managing stress as much as possible. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm…let me think. No, not that I recall. Eleanor always handled my medications. I never paid much attention. But…she once said something about a reaction to penicillin, a long time ago. Maybe. I really don’t remember. It was years ago. Just…be careful, alright? I don't want any surprises. And can we please just get this prescription and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible penicillin allergy – we’ll definitely make a note of that in your chart. We'll avoid penicillin-based medications, just to be safe. Here’s the prescription for the beta-blocker. Please take it as directed. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the blood test and EKG, and to see how you’re responding to the medication. If the shaking gets significantly worse, or if you experience any new symptoms, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Questions? No, not really. Honestly, I'm still not convinced all this poking and prodding is necessary. But…fine. I'll take the pill. And I'll come back in two weeks. Though I warn you, I’m not a patient man. Just get me out of here, alright? I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I understand your reluctance, and I appreciate you trusting me. The nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. If you have any concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call. Have a good day, and try to relax. .
PATIENT: .
