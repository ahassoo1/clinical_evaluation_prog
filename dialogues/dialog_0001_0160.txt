DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Candis Hardenburgh, 79… Yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing to even talk about. But I’m just… tired. So, so tired. And I’ve been… well, I’ve been eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I just… crave it. Clay, mostly. It’s awful, I know. Don’t look at me like that. I just feel… weak, and the dirt seems to help, a little. Though, it probably doesn’t, does it? I just want to know why I'm doing this. And why I’m so drained all the time.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt… Right. Look, I’ve seen a lot in my 17 years, but… Okay. Well, craving non-food items… that's pica. And the fatigue… could be a lot of things. We’ll need some bloodwork, of course. Let's start with the basics. Any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh, goodness. What kind of changes? My memory isn’t what it used to be, even though I remember things just fine, if you know what I mean. Let me think… Well, I haven’t been eating as much regular food, I suppose. Not because I don't want to, just… doesn't appeal to me. And my skin feels… dry. Very dry. Though, living out here in the country, that’s probably the sun. Is that what you mean by changes? Honestly, I’m not sure. It’s all just… blurring together.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite, dry skin… Memory issues, you said?
PATIENT: I said my memory isn’t what it used to be, not that I have issues! There’s a difference. I remember perfectly well what I had for breakfast 50 years ago, but remembering what I did yesterday… sometimes slips my mind. It’s frustrating. And no, I haven’t been feeling… down or anything. Just tired. Very, very tired. And this dirt thing. Really, it’s just the fatigue that’s bothering me most, and this awful craving is just… a symptom of that, right? It has to be.
DOCTOR: Right. A "symptom." Look, I'm not dismissing anything, but craving dirt isn’t exactly… common. And it can indicate deficiencies. Let's try to be thorough here. Any family history of… anything like this?
PATIENT: Family history? Goodness. My family came over from Ethiopia a long time ago. Back when things were… different. We didn't really talk about health things back then. Just… dealt with it. My mother was a strong woman, always worked the land. She was tired a lot, now that I think about it. But that was just… life. My father… well, he was a quiet man. Didn't really complain about much of anything. So, no. I don’t think so. Not that I know of. Honestly, this is all a bit silly. I'm a 79-year-old woman who eats dirt. It’s probably just old age. Can’t we just give me something for the tiredness?
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you're frustrated. But "something for the tiredness" isn’t a diagnosis. And dismissing this as "old age"… that’s not helpful. We need to rule things out. Has this dirt craving been going on long?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine, fine. It started… hmm. Maybe six months ago? It was just a little bit at first. A little pinch here and there. I thought it was just a strange craving, you know? Like when you’re pregnant or something. But it’s gotten worse. I find myself… seeking it out, almost. It's… unpleasant to admit. And the tiredness… it started around the same time. It's just… everything feels weak, if that makes sense. Even my bones ache sometimes. Is this going to take all day? I have errands to do.
DOCTOR: Six months… Okay. Bone aches… That's new. Look, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. And yes, it will take some time to get to the bottom of this. Let's start with your vitals. And then I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Don't worry, it won't be unpleasant. Could you please lie down on the exam table?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful. Just what I needed. More poking and prodding. Fine. But if you find anything… seriously wrong… I’m not sure what I’ll do. I’ve lived a long life. I don’t need a list of things that are going to fall apart. Just… quickly, if you could. I have a garden that needs weeding, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure first. 158 over 92… Elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Respiratory rate 16. Temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds… normal, but a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds. Abdomen is soft, non-tender… but some mild discomfort in the lower quadrants. Skin is dry and cool to the touch. Okay. Nothing immediately alarming, but we'll need those blood tests. And I want a complete metabolic panel, iron studies, and a vitamin D level.
PATIENT: “Murmur?” you say? Oh, goodness. See? This is what I mean! Always something. Vitamin D… I do try to get out in the sun, but… well, I’m not as young as I used to be. Is it something serious? Because honestly, I just want to know why I'm craving dirt, not a list of all my failing organs. Just... tell me if it's bad news. And can we get this over with quickly? I have to pick up my prescription later. And then the garden. And the weeds. I'm getting quite behind.
DOCTOR: Look, the murmur is mild. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we’ll need to monitor it. As for the dirt craving… the blood tests will help us determine if you have any deficiencies that could be causing it. Iron deficiency is a common cause, as is zinc deficiency. Low vitamin D can also contribute to fatigue and cravings. I'm going to order the labs now. The lab technician will draw your blood right here in the clinic. It shouldn't take too long. Here. Take this to the lab. They’re just down the hall. It will take a few days to get the results. Once we have those, we can discuss a plan. Any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? No, I think I’ve heard enough for one day. Deficiencies…murmurs… It’s always something, isn’t it? Just… get it over with. I'll go get the blood drawn. And then, hopefully, I can get back to my life before it falls completely apart. Honestly, it's just exhausting. Do try to be quick with the results. And please, don't tell me I need to change my whole diet. I've been eating just fine for 79 years.
