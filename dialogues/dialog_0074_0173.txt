DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Reisig, nice to meet you too! Um, well, I've just been getting these chills, and it's a bit worrying. It started a couple of days ago, and it just… hasn’t gone away. It's not a fever, I don't feel sick, just cold. Really cold sometimes, even when it's warm.
DOCTOR: I understand. Chills without a fever can certainly be concerning. To help me get a better understanding of what's going on, could you describe these chills a bit more?
PATIENT: Sure. Okay, so it’s not like… the shaking kind of chills, if that makes sense? It's more like a deep cold, you know? Like when you get goosebumps, but all over, and it lasts for a while. Sometimes it happens even when I'm wrapped up warm. And it’s not always all over, sometimes it’s just my arms or legs. Does that make any sense? I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things quite a bit, thank you. It sounds like you’re experiencing waves of cold sensations, not necessarily accompanied by shivering. And it’s intermittent, coming and going, and affecting different parts of your body. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if anything seems to trigger these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. I haven't really noticed a specific trigger, to be honest. It doesn't seem to be related to being cold, or being tired, or anything like that. It just… happens. Sometimes it’s when I’m relaxing, sometimes when I'm busy. I was trying to think about it on the way here, and I really can’t put my finger on anything. I did have a bit of stress at work last week, but I thought that had calmed down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear triggers that you’ve identified, and it occurs regardless of activity level. You mentioned some stress at work recently. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it wasn't major stress, just… a bit of a difficult project with a tight deadline. Lots of late nights, and a bit of pressure from my boss. But it finished on Friday, so I thought I'd be over it by now, you know? It's not like I'm still actively worrying about it. But maybe it's lingering? I don't know. It's probably nothing, really.
DOCTOR: It's good you brought that up, even if it seems minor now. Stress can absolutely manifest physically. Let’s move on to some other questions, just to rule things out. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with these chills?
PATIENT: Let me think... No fever, like I said. No cough, no sore throat. No aches or pains. I haven’t lost my appetite, and I’m sleeping okay, actually. I have been a little bit more tired than usual, maybe? But I always put that down to just being a bit run down. And, now that I think about it, my hands have been a bit pale sometimes. But I don't know if that's related or if I'm just imagining things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, cough, sore throat, or significant aches and pains. Increased fatigue and occasional paleness of the hands. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed anything else at all?
PATIENT: Um… well, this might sound silly, but I’ve been a bit… forgetful lately. Nothing major, just like, forgetting where I put my keys, or what I was saying mid-sentence. I always blame it on being busy, but it has been a bit worse than usual. And I'm not sure if it’s related, but I’ve been feeling a bit… disconnected, like I’m not quite fully present, if that makes sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That’s not silly at all. Changes in cognitive function, like forgetfulness and feeling disconnected, are important to note. It's good you mentioned those. To get a broader picture, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Um, nothing major. I had chickenpox as a kid, and I had my tonsils out when I was younger. Oh, and I was diagnosed with mild asthma, but I haven't had an attack in years, and I don’t use an inhaler anymore. Other than that, nothing, really. I usually get a check-up every year, and everything’s always been fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, chickenpox as a child, tonsillectomy, and a history of mild asthma that is currently well-controlled. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: No, just the tonsils. Never had any other surgeries. I’m not really a surgery person, if that makes sense! I try to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I haven't had any reactions to any medications in the past, as far as I can remember. My mum always said I was a pretty robust baby!
DOCTOR: That’s good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. I try to stay healthy through diet and exercise, so I haven't needed anything for a long time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... My mum has high blood pressure, and she’s being treated for it. My dad had diabetes, but he managed it with diet and exercise for a long time before he needed medication. And my grandmother, on my mum's side, had arthritis. Other than that, nothing major that I'm aware of. Everyone else seems pretty healthy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and arthritis. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a health education specialist, so I’m pretty active during the day, mostly talking and doing presentations. I try to go for a walk most evenings, and I eat a fairly healthy diet – lots of vegetables and fish. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol occasionally, like a glass of wine with dinner maybe once or twice a week. I wouldn’t say I do anything major for exercise, but I try to stay active. I do spend a lot of time on the computer though, for work.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful. Alright, Jailenne, thank you for that detailed history. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Your blood pressure is 118/72, which is within the normal range. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and coordination. Please follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll ask you to do a few simple movements. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Coordination appears intact. Skin feels cool to the touch. Capillary refill is slightly delayed. Okay, all in all, the examination is largely unremarkable, but the coolness of your skin and slightly delayed capillary refill are something I want to investigate further. It could be related to your symptoms, or it could be nothing. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. If you think it’s best to get some blood tests, then absolutely. I'm happy to do whatever you recommend. What kind of tests are you thinking of?
DOCTOR: Good. I’m thinking a complete blood count to check for anemia and infection, a thyroid panel to rule out thyroid issues, and a vitamin D level. I'll also check your iron levels, as low iron can sometimes cause fatigue and coldness. And to rule out any autoimmune issues, I'll order an inflammatory marker test, such as ESR and CRP. These tests will give us a more detailed picture of your overall health and help me determine the cause of your symptoms. They can be done at the lab just down the hall. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Wow, that's quite a few! No, I don’t think so. They all sound… thorough, which is good. I guess it's better to check everything. You said they can be done just down the hall? That’s convenient. Will I need to fast beforehand, or anything like that? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. You do not need to fast for these tests, so you can eat and drink as normal. The lab technician will just need a small blood sample. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to discuss them and create a treatment plan, if necessary. In the meantime, I'd recommend continuing to monitor your symptoms and let me know if anything changes. And please, if you experience any fever, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough and explained everything really well. Thank you, Dr. Reisig. I feel a lot better knowing we're getting this checked out. I'll head down to the lab now then, and I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before I get the results. And please, take care of yourself. We'll figure this out together.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again! I will. Bye!
