DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sieh. Thank you for seeing me. My head… the back of my head hurts. It started a few days ago, I think. Not a bad hurt all the time, but… it’s there. Like a pressure, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A pressure at the back of your head that’s been present for a few days. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… harder to sleep sometimes. Not because it really hurts, just… uncomfortable. And sometimes when I bend over, it feels a little worse. I work with the trains, you see. Lots of bending and looking up. Been doing that for… oh, a long, long time. Sixty years, maybe more. I forget the exact year.
DOCTOR: Sixty years with the trains is quite a career! That's a lot of physical work. So, the discomfort makes it harder to sleep, and bending over seems to aggravate it. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Mostly it’s just… there. A dull ache. But when I move my head too fast, or if I’m tired after work, it gets sharper. Not a bad sharp, like a knife, just… more noticeable. I also feel a little… dizzy sometimes. Not falling-down dizzy, but like the room is… swaying a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that worsens with movement and fatigue, and you've noticed some dizziness. Has anything specific seemed to trigger the dizziness, or does it happen randomly?
PATIENT: Hmm… random, I think. It doesn’t happen after I stand up too fast, or anything like that. Just… sometimes when I’m walking. Or even when I’m sitting. It doesn’t last long, maybe a few seconds. I don’t worry too much about it. Old man things, you know? But the headache… that’s new.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re paying attention to changes, even if you think they might be “old man things.” New headaches are always worth checking out. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the headache and dizziness?
PATIENT: No, not really. No blurry vision. No trouble talking. I eat okay, maybe not as much as I used to, but… that’s just getting older. No fever, no stiff neck. Just the headache and the dizziness. And… sometimes I forget things. But I always forget things!
DOCTOR: Okay, so no vision changes, speech difficulties, fever, or neck stiffness. And the memory issues are consistent with your age. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. The doctor, a long time ago, said my blood pressure was a little high once, but he gave me some pills and I took them for a while. I stopped taking them after a few months. I didn’t like taking pills. And no diabetes, no heart trouble. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. I never really got sick.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital. Never had surgery. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but the doctor just put it in a cast. That’s it. I always tried to be careful, you know? Working with the trains… you have to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or children – have had similar headaches, dizziness, or any neurological conditions like stroke or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she got headaches sometimes. Bad ones, she said. But she didn’t go to the doctor much. My father… he was a strong man, never sick. I had one brother, but he died a long time ago in an accident. I don’t remember him having headaches. No, I don't think so. Nobody in my family was… sick like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never liked it. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, when I was younger. But I stopped a long time ago. Maybe one or two on a special occasion now, but that’s it. No, I don’t use anything else. Just coffee in the morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, like I said, I don't like taking pills. Just coffee. And sometimes, my neighbor gives me a little something for my arthritis, but it doesn’t really help much. It’s just a cream you rub on. Nothing I take every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. It shouldn't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, Mr. Brum, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Alright, and now can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: The year… hmm… 2025, right? Yes, 2025. I think. Sometimes I get the years mixed up.
DOCTOR: That's correct, 2025. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Okay, Mr. Brum, everything seems a little slow, and your reflexes are a bit weaker than I'd expect. Your balance is also slightly off. I’m also noticing some mild stiffness in your neck. Do you feel any pain when I gently move your neck back and forth?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit. Not a bad pain, just… uncomfortable. Like it’s tight. I haven’t been doing my exercises like I should, maybe that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your age, history of headaches, dizziness, slightly reduced reflexes, and mild neck stiffness, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be something simple like muscle tension or age-related changes. However, given the dizziness and diminished reflexes, we need to rule out more serious causes, like a possible neurological issue or even a transient ischemic attack, also known as a mini-stroke. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a few tests. I recommend a blood test to check your overall health and rule out any infections or underlying medical conditions. I also think we should get an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what's going on and rule out any structural problems. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI…? That sounds… complicated. And expensive, maybe? I don’t have insurance, Doctor. But… if you think it’s important… I want to know what’s wrong. Yes, do what you think is best. Just… tell me how much it will cost, if you can.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brum. It is important to me that you feel comfortable and informed. I will be honest, an MRI can be expensive. I'm not certain of the exact cost here at the clinic, but I will have my staff look into it and give you a detailed estimate before proceeding with anything. We can also discuss potential financial assistance programs or payment plans if needed. I want to assure you, we will explore all options to make sure you can get the care you need. In the meantime, while we’re waiting for the test results and estimate, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity and be extra cautious. If you experience any new symptoms, like weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, or severe headache, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Thank you for explaining everything. And for looking into the cost. I appreciate that. I will be careful, and if something feels wrong… I will go to the hospital. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I’m glad I could explain things. For the blood test, you don't need to do anything special. Just try to drink plenty of water beforehand. For the MRI, you'll need to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, hearing aids – before the scan. The technician will give you detailed instructions before the procedure. It's also important to let them know if you have any metal implants, like a pacemaker or surgical clips. My staff will schedule both tests for you and provide you with all the necessary paperwork and instructions. They'll also answer any questions you may have. I'll review the results as soon as they’re available and we’ll discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think you’ve explained everything very well. I just need to remember to drink water and take off my watch. Thank you again for seeing me. It's a relief to have someone looking into this. I’ll go home now and try to rest.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Remember, if anything changes or you develop new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact us. My staff will walk you through everything, and we’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Please take care of yourself, and don't worry too much. We’ll figure this out together. Have a good day, Mr. Brum.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Sieh. You too. .
