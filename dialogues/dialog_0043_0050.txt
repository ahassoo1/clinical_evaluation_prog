DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re ninety years young. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor. Kalinski, you say? Yes, ninety… feels like yesterday, and feels like a lifetime ago, all at once. What was I saying? Oh, right. The cough. It’s been… a while now. A dry cough. Just… hacking away, you know? Not much to it, really. Just… dry.
DOCTOR: Yes, a dry cough. And how long has this cough been going on, Mr. Pavlovic?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a hard one. Seems like… a long time. Maybe… a few months? Longer? Everything blurs together after a while, you know? I… I really can’t say for sure. It just… started. And hasn’t really stopped. It’s not bad, bad, just… persistent.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when things started. A few months, persistent… alright. Has the cough been getting worse over these months, staying the same, or perhaps even improving at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't think it's gotten worse. Not noticeably, anyway. Maybe… a little more when the weather changes? Cold air… that makes it tickle more, I suppose. But mostly, it’s just… there. Steady. Like an old friend, if you can believe it. Not a good friend, mind you. Just… familiar.
DOCTOR: “Familiar” is a good way to put it, Mr. Pavlovic. And does anything specifically trigger the cough, besides the cold air?
PATIENT: Well… dust, I think. Always been sensitive to dust. Used to work with cars, you see. Body work. Lots of sanding… lots of dust. I try to keep the house clean now, but it still gets in. And… sometimes when I lie down flat. That makes me cough a bit more too. I don’t smoke, if that matters. Never have.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the dust and lying down, and thank you for mentioning you've never smoked. It certainly matters. Now, aside from the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m ninety! I figure some tiredness is to be expected. And… my appetite isn't what it used to be. But I haven't lost any weight, not that I've noticed. Oh… and I get a little short of breath sometimes, walking up the stairs. But I always have. Or… maybe I’m just noticing it more now. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Alright. A little tiredness, decreased appetite, and some shortness of breath with exertion. You're right, it can be difficult to distinguish what’s new versus what’s been ongoing. Now, have you had a fever, chills, night sweats, or any chest pain at any point along with this cough?
PATIENT: Fever… no. Not that I remember. Chills… not really. Though it gets cold here in the winters, you know? But not a shaking chill. Night sweats… no. And chest pain… no, thankfully. No pain. Just… the cough. And the… everything else. Getting old ain’t easy, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It certainly isn’t, Mr. Pavlovic. And you’re doing very well to be as observant as you are. Now, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh, boy. Where to begin? I’ve lived a long life, you see. I… I had my appendix out when I was young. And… I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder. Nothing too serious. And… my wife, bless her soul, she had a lot of problems, so I spent a lot of time at the doctor with her. I… honestly, I can't remember all the details. It was a long time ago. I don’t… I don’t think I’ve had anything major wrong with me, besides the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendix removal, a broken arm, and supporting your wife with her medical needs. That's helpful to know. And any surgeries besides the appendix?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, I don't think so. Just the appendix. Maybe a few stitches here and there over the years, cuts and scrapes. But no… no other surgeries. I remember my wife always being the one needing the procedures. I was usually just the driver and… the worrier.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other surgeries. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… just a little something for my blood pressure. A small white pill. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. And… sometimes a multivitamin, just to be safe. That’s about it. Nothing fancy. I try to avoid taking too much if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a multivitamin. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication you are taking?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. My wife used to handle all of that. I just… take the pill the doctor gives me. It’s… a little white one. I think it starts with an ‘A’… or maybe a ‘B’? I really can't recall. I apologize, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s common to forget details like that. We can look it up in the clinic records if you'd like. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything my mother put in front of me, and that’s saying something! And I've never had a reaction to any medicine. No, I don't think I have any allergies. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Pavlovic. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I'm retired now, you see. Used to work on cars, like I said. Body work mostly. Spent a lot of time on my feet. Now… I mostly stay home. Read the newspaper. Watch a little TV. I have a small garden, I grow some tomatoes and peppers. It’s… quiet. I don’t get out much anymore. And… my wife passed away a few years ago, so… it’s just me now.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Pavlovic. It sounds like you enjoy keeping busy with your garden and reading. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked. And… I used to have a beer with my wife sometimes, on a Saturday night. But I haven’t had a drink since she passed. It just doesn’t… taste the same without her. No, I don’t drink anymore. Just… tea. Lots of tea. Keeps me warm.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Pavlovic, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's going to be… uncomfortable. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in for me… and out… good. And again… I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds, particularly at the bases of your lungs. Nothing immediately alarming, but we’ll want to investigate further. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Everything looks clear in there. Finally, I'm going to check your extremities for swelling. No significant swelling. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Well, it wasn’t too bad. Diminished breath sounds… that doesn’t sound good, does it? I figured something was up. I’ve been feeling a little… weaker lately, I suppose. Just put it down to getting old. What do you think it is, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's good that we're investigating, Mr. Pavlovic. Diminished breath sounds can have several causes, and it doesn’t necessarily mean something serious. It could be related to fluid buildup in the lungs, a mild case of bronchitis, or even changes related to age. Given your history of a persistent cough, your age, and the diminished breath sounds, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your lungs. And I’d also like to do a blood test to check for any signs of infection or other underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… an X-ray and a blood test. Alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s going on. I don't want to be a bother, you know? I've lived a long life, and I don’t want to take up too much of your time. But… if it will help me figure out what's wrong, then yes, let’s do it.
DOCTOR: You are not a bother, Mr. Pavlovic. Your health is my priority, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. We'll get those tests ordered right away. The X-ray can be done here at the clinic, and we'll draw the blood sample as well. It typically takes a couple of days to get the results back. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us then to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, fever, or chest pain – please call the clinic immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good, Doctor. Rest and fluids… I can do that. And I will call if anything gets worse. Thank you… thank you for taking the time to listen to me. It's nice to have someone… looking out for me. My wife… she always took care of everything. This is… different. But… good different.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s my pleasure. And it sounds like you had a wonderful partner in your wife. It's completely understandable that things feel different now, but I'm here to help you every step of the way. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment and get those tests ordered. Do you have any other questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again. You've put my mind at ease a little bit. Just… getting some answers is… helpful. Yes, very helpful. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. We’ll get those tests done and I’ll see you soon. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day, and try to rest.
PATIENT: .
