DOCTOR: Right, Adyn Swaby. Nineteen years old. Okay. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, well, it's my speech, Doctor. It's been…slurred, I think is the word. It’s just…not clear, like I'm having trouble getting the words out right. I don't really know when it started, to be honest. It just…sort of is.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Slurred speech… okay. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. You said you don't really remember when it started… can you give me a rough idea?
PATIENT: A rough idea… Honestly, Doctor, it feels like a few weeks, maybe? Possibly longer. It’s difficult to say, really. Things have been…busy. I'm working, you see, and... it just sort of faded into the background, this feeling. I didn't think much of it at first.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. A few weeks, give or take. Busy… I understand. And is it constant, this slurring?
PATIENT: Not…always, no. It seems to be worse when I’m tired, definitely. Or if I’ve been talking for a long time. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, and other times…well, it’s harder to get my point across, if that makes sense? It's frustrating, mostly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Worse with fatigue or extended talking… okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed… Not that I can recall, Doctor. I've been working on the construction site, same as always. My husband, he’s been…well, he’s been himself. Nothing different at home, not that I remember. We haven’t really…travelled or anything. Just…work and home.
DOCTOR: Okay. Work and home… Alright. Before we get too far, are you having any trouble with anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else…? No, not really. I mean, I get tired, obviously, from the job. But no headaches, no dizziness… no weakness in my arms or legs. Nothing like that. Just the…speech. It's mostly just the speech.
DOCTOR: Right. No headaches, dizziness, or weakness. Good. Any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Fever or chills…? No, Doctor, I don’t think so. I haven’t been feeling sick, not like with a cold or anything. I’m usually pretty healthy, to be honest. I can’t remember being ill recently at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Um, not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never really had to go to the doctor much. Just regular check-ups, I suppose. Nothing serious. I have Medicare, so they’d have a record if there was anything, wouldn’t they? I don't really know, to be honest. I’ve always been pretty…robust.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me just pull up your records here… hmm. Yes, it seems fairly minimal. Routine childhood vaccinations, a sports physical in high school… nothing significant. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? No, no surgeries, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. Definitely not. I've never been in the hospital, not even as a child. I’m pretty lucky, I think. I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's…a little tricky, Doctor. My mother… she passed away when I was young, so I don’t really know much about her medical history. My father, he’s doing alright, as far as I know. He's…he’s not very talkative, you see, so we don’t discuss these things much. I don't recall anyone in my family having speech problems, but I wouldn’t be certain. It’s…not something we talked about.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Now, are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't take any pills or anything. I don’t really like taking medication if I can avoid it, to be honest. Just…water and a good night’s sleep, usually. And lots of food, of course. My husband's a very good cook.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I remember. I can eat anything, and I haven't had any trouble with insect bites or anything like that. I’m pretty open, I think, when it comes to food and…things. Nothing I'm afraid of.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just want to check a few things. I’ll need you to follow my instructions. Can you open your mouth and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Ah… is that alright? It doesn't feel any different to me, but…I'm not sure what I'm looking for.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. Tongue looks normal. Palate looks good. Now, can you stick your tongue out for me?
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. Is everything alright? It feels a bit strange, having someone look at it. I hope it's not too…messy.
DOCTOR: Everything looks normal so far. Now, let's check your reflexes. I'm going to gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. Just relax your legs.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Reflexes, you say? Just let me know if I need to do anything, Doctor. I'm not very good with these things. It’s probably been years since anyone checked my reflexes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good response on both sides. A little asymmetrical, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Breathing normally… I hope you can hear everything alright. Sometimes I feel a bit…shallow when I'm nervous. Is everything okay so far?
DOCTOR: Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds regular. Now, I'd like to quickly check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that alright? I work with my hands all day, so they’re usually pretty strong. I hope I'm not squeezing too hard.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Strength seems equal on both sides. Okay. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing the slurred speech. It could be a number of things…stress, fatigue, even something neurological. Do you have any history of headaches or vision changes?
PATIENT: Headaches…no, not really. I get a bit of tension sometimes from work, but not proper headaches. And no, no vision changes. Everything looks normal to me. I mean, I don’t wear glasses, so I’ve never had my vision checked properly. But I can see perfectly fine, as far as I’m aware. It’s just…the speech. It’s worrying me, Doctor. What could it be?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, because it's new and we haven’t identified a clear cause, and because slurred speech can be a sign of something more serious, I'm going to recommend an MRI of your brain, just to rule things out. Also, I’m going to refer you to a neurologist. They are the specialists in this area. It’s better to be safe than sorry, okay?
PATIENT: An MRI…? And a…neurologist? Is it…serious, Doctor? What are we looking for? I mean, I feel fine, apart from the speech. Is it something I did? I've been working very hard, perhaps I’m just…overtired? This is all a bit…overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Adyn. It’s not necessarily serious. We want to rule out anything serious, which is why I’m recommending these tests. An MRI will give us a clear picture of your brain. The neurologist will do a more thorough examination. It could be something simple, like muscle fatigue or even a mild nerve issue. But it's best to get it checked out by a specialist. I’m going to give you a referral order for the MRI, and the neurologist’s contact information. They will call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to get some rest, and if the slurring gets significantly worse, or if you experience any new symptoms like weakness or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that…that makes a little more sense, Doctor. An MRI and a neurologist. And to rest. Okay. I suppose that’s…sensible. I just…didn’t expect all this. Will the MRI…hurt? And what kind of questions will the neurologist ask? I'm not very good at remembering things, so I'm worried I'll forget something important.
DOCTOR: The MRI itself isn’t painful, Adyn. You’ll lie on a table, and the machine makes a lot of noise, but it doesn’t hurt. You'll need to lie very still during the scan. As for the neurologist, they will ask you about your medical history, your symptoms, and do some tests to assess your reflexes, coordination, and speech. It’s okay to be nervous, and it’s perfectly fine to bring a friend or family member with you to the appointment. And don’t worry about forgetting things – you can always write down your questions beforehand, or bring someone to help you remember. Here’s the referral order and the neurologist’s information. I’m going to also write down a summary of what we discussed today for your records. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay. That…that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Writing things down. Yes. Um… Will this affect my work? I mean, I need to keep working, I have bills to pay. And…will I be able to drive? It’s a long way to the construction site. I don’t want to lose my job. It's…very important to me.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Adyn. Whether or not it affects your work or your ability to drive will depend on what the neurologist finds. It's possible that you'll be able to continue working as usual. However, it's best to discuss it with the neurologist. They will be able to assess your situation and advise you accordingly. I would recommend not driving until you've had the neurological evaluation, just to be on the safe side. It's better to err on the side of caution. I will also write a note for your employer, explaining that you are undergoing medical evaluation. Don’t worry, we’ll figure this out. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
