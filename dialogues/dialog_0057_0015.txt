DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um... my nose. It feels… bad. Like, stuffy. And a little pain, sometimes. I don't remember exactly when it started, but it's been a little while, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a stuffy and painful nose. And you said it’s been going on for a little while. Can you tell me a bit more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It's not… a bad bad pain, Doctor. More like… pressure. Behind my eyes, sometimes. And across my cheeks. It comes and goes. I work outside a lot, maybe that has something to do with it? I operate… big drills. For oil. It’s dusty work.
DOCTOR: Dusty work, alright. That could certainly be a factor. And the pressure you're feeling, is it constant, or does it flare up with activity?
PATIENT: It… flares up, I think. When I'm working, it gets worse. When I rest… it's better. Not gone, but… not so bad. I try to drink a lot of water, but it doesn't always help. Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining. It's hard to remember all the details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mikeisha. You’re doing fine. It’s helpful to know it’s worse with work and improves with rest. Do you have any fever, headache, or facial swelling along with the pressure?
PATIENT: Fever… I don't think so. I haven’t checked. Headache… sometimes, a little. Not a big one. And… swelling? No, I don’t think so. My face feels normal. I don't know, Doctor. It’s just… uncomfortable. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes, when I lay down.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any discharge from your nose – is it clear, colored, or thick?
PATIENT: Um… yes. Sometimes. It’s… clear, I think. Or maybe a little white? Not much. I just… blow my nose. It doesn’t come out a lot. I don't really pay attention, sorry. It's not… a lot of anything. Just a little.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mikeisha. We’ll figure it out. Let's do a quick examination, if that's alright with you. I'll take a look at your nose and throat, and listen to your lungs just to be sure.
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I hope it's not something bad. I need to work, you see. My husband… he needs me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Alright, Mikeisha. Your lungs sound good. Your nose does have some swelling and a little discharge, and your frontal sinuses are a bit tender. It doesn't sound like anything immediately serious, but it could be a sinus infection – sinusitis. Have you had sinus infections before?
PATIENT: Sinus… infection? No, I don’t think so. I get colds sometimes, but… I don't know what a sinus infection feels like. Is it… bad? I have never been to the doctor much. My mother always took care of things, but… she is not here anymore. Sorry. I am getting upset.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your mother, Mikeisha. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling upset. It takes courage to come in, especially after a loss. Sinus infections are very common, and usually not serious, but they can be quite uncomfortable. They happen when the sinuses – the air-filled spaces in your face – get inflamed and blocked, often after a cold or allergies. The tenderness you’re feeling is from the inflammation. It sounds like you likely have acute sinusitis. We can manage it with some supportive care. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um… I don’t know. Maybe dust? From the work. Sometimes my eyes itch. And I sneeze. But everyone sneezes, right? I don't take any medicine for it. I just… try to ignore it. My husband says I’m stubborn.
DOCTOR: Your husband sounds like he knows you well. It’s good you’re aware of the dust as a potential trigger. Given the dust exposure at work, your symptoms, and the examination findings, it does sound like we’re dealing with a possible allergic reaction contributing to sinusitis. I recommend we start with some over-the-counter treatments. I suggest a saline nasal rinse twice a day to help clear the nasal passages. You can find those at most pharmacies. Also, an over-the-counter decongestant might help with the stuffiness, but be careful to follow the directions on the label, especially if you have any other medical conditions. And for the allergy symptoms, an over-the-counter antihistamine could help. Do you have any other medical problems or take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have… other problems. And I don’t take any medicine. Just… sometimes, when my back hurts from the work, I take a little bit of… I don't know the name. A white pill. But not often. It helps with the pain, but I don't like taking pills. My husband buys it for me. I really don’t like going to the doctor. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. We’ll try to keep things as minimal as possible. It’s helpful that you remember the white pill for your back pain. If you can bring that with you next time, we can look up what it is. It’s important to know what you’re taking, even for occasional pain. Okay, so let’s focus on the saline rinse and antihistamine for now. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they get worse – like if you develop a fever, severe headache, or facial swelling – it’s important to come back in. We might need to consider antibiotics if it’s a bacterial infection. Given you're uninsured and working in a rural area, are you able to easily access a pharmacy?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There is a small pharmacy in town. Old Man Hemandez owns it. He’s a nice man. He knows everyone. I can get there. It's… not far. And my husband can help if I need him to. I just… I hope this works. I need to go back to work. We need the money.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mikeisha. Old Man Hernandez sounds reliable. Alright. We’ll start with the saline rinse and an over-the-counter antihistamine. And please, don't hesitate to come back if things don't improve or get worse. I’ll write down the instructions for you, and a note for your husband explaining what we discussed. And I'll also give you a work note excusing you from heavy lifting for the next few days, just to give your sinuses a chance to recover. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: A work note? That is… very kind. Thank you, Doctor. Um… no, I don’t think so. Not right now. I am a little overwhelmed, I think. But I will… try to remember everything. And I will go to the pharmacy. Thank you again, Doctor Sieh. You have been very helpful. I hope I don’t have to come back. But if I do, I will.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. It was my pleasure. Don’t worry about remembering everything – that’s what the notes are for. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon. It was nice meeting you.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again. Goodbye.
