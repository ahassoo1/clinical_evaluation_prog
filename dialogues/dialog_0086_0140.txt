DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Schieber, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. And please, Doctor… Muretic, is it? Let’s not waste time with formalities. I have a rather… unpleasant issue to discuss and a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Doctor Muretic will be just fine, thank you. And while I appreciate your… efficiency, a proper consultation requires a bit of detail. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s… a soreness in my mouth. White patches, mostly on my tongue. It’s quite bothersome, and my wife insisted I come. Honestly, I assumed it was just something I ate. It’s probably nothing. I don't have time for… frivolous complaints.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” rarely walks through my door, Mr. Schieber. White patches on the tongue… how long have these patches been present?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Perhaps… a week? Maybe a little longer. It’s difficult to say precisely. I don't spend a great deal of time examining my mouth, if you understand. It hasn't interfered with my work, not significantly, at least. Just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: “Unpleasant” can become serious quickly. Has the soreness changed at all since it started?
PATIENT: Well, it is a bit more… widespread now, I suppose. And eating is… less enjoyable. Certain foods, particularly acidic ones, cause a rather sharp pain. But I manage. I always manage. It’s hardly debilitating, Doctor.
DOCTOR: “Manage” and “worsening symptoms” are not compatible, Mr. Schieber. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No, not really. A bit of fatigue, perhaps, but that's likely from the long hours I work. It’s… demanding, my profession. I doubt it’s related to this… mouth issue. It's just a bit of discomfort, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you’ve noticed no fever, no difficulty swallowing, no swollen glands in your neck?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Swallowing is… normal, I suppose. And I haven't checked my glands. Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? I am a busy man. If it's nothing serious, I'd prefer to simply receive a… reassurance and be on my way.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I assure you, I am trying to be efficient. But I need a complete picture. Let's just do a quick exam. Open wide, please. And try to relax. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Fine. But do hurry. I have important matters to attend to. This is… undignified.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes. The patches are… quite extensive. And there’s some redness along the edges of your tongue. No obvious ulcers, thankfully. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. I’ve never had any issues with medications. Though, I try to avoid them whenever possible. Unnecessary chemicals, if you understand. A strong constitution is preferable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications, if any, are you currently taking?
PATIENT: None. Absolutely none. I prefer natural remedies, if needed. A bit of rest, a strong tea… that sort of thing. I don't believe in burdening my system with… pharmaceuticals.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, based on what you've told me, and the examination, it appears you likely have oral thrush – a fungal infection in the mouth. It’s not usually serious, but it can be quite uncomfortable. Given your lack of medications, it’s a bit unusual, but not unheard of. Do you have any underlying health conditions that you haven’t mentioned?
PATIENT: Underlying conditions? No. Absolutely not. I’m perfectly healthy. As I said, a strong constitution. I work long hours in demanding conditions. If I were ill, I wouldn't be here. Perhaps it's the water? Or the stress of my profession? Surely there's a simpler explanation than… an infection.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I understand your preference for avoiding medical intervention, however, dismissing potential causes without proper consideration is not advisable. While stress can weaken the immune system, it rarely manifests as such a pronounced fungal infection. Given your insistence on avoiding medication, we can try a few things, but I need you to be diligent. I'm going to recommend a strict oral hygiene regimen – brush your teeth after every meal, floss daily, and rinse your mouth with a salt water solution several times a day. Avoid sugary foods and drinks, as they can exacerbate the infection. If your symptoms worsen or don't improve within a week, you must return. And then, we’ll discuss antifungal medication. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Brush, floss, salt water, avoid sugar. It sounds… tedious. But fine. I will attempt your regimen. However, I expect improvement. And I assure you, if this becomes significantly more bothersome, I will not hesitate to seek a second opinion. Now, if you'll excuse me… I have matters to attend to. Is there anything else?
DOCTOR: Here's a handout outlining the oral hygiene instructions. I'm also going to write a note for your employer explaining that you may need brief periods to rinse your mouth throughout the day. I would advise you to monitor your temperature and, if you develop a fever, seek immediate medical attention. And Mr. Schieber, I must stress the importance of returning if your symptoms worsen. Dismissing a potentially serious issue can have consequences. Now, if you have no further questions, you are free to go.
PATIENT: Very well. I understand. Thank you, Doctor. Though I still maintain this is likely a minor inconvenience. I will, of course, return if absolutely necessary. Good day. .
