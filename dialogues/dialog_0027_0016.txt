DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s this bruising. It’s… concerning. I’ve been on this blood thinner for a while now, since the, you know… the incident. And normally, a little bump, a little scrape, fine. But lately, just touching myself feels like I’m turning purple. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising… and it seems more pronounced recently, even with minor contact. You mentioned being on a blood thinner since “the incident.” Could you tell me a little more about that incident, if you’re comfortable?
PATIENT: Comfortable is a strong word, Doctor. It was… a fall. A rather nasty fall down the stairs. Broke a few things. They put me on this stuff to prevent clots, naturally. And for a long time, it worked. No problems. But now… I’m starting to wonder if maybe the dosage is too high? I read something online, you know, about side effects. Not that I believe everything I read, but… it got me thinking.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re paying attention to your body and noticing these changes. And it’s wise to be aware of potential side effects. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Just to confirm, what blood thinner are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Warfarin. That's what they told me at the hospital, and it’s what the pharmacy always gives me. I’ve been very careful about taking it at the same time every day, and with food. I really have been. It’s just… this bruising. It's not normal. My wife… well, she would have known what to do. She always kept track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin. And you've been diligent about taking it as prescribed. That's good to hear. It’s important to keep track of these things. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Farson. It sounds like she was very supportive. Now, aside from the bruising, have you noticed any other unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: Unusual symptoms… let me think. Well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But at my age, who isn’t? And… hmm. Oh! There was that nosebleed last week. Nothing terrible, just a little trickle that took a while to stop. It hadn't happened in years, though. I just figured it was the dry air. We haven’t had much rain lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and a nosebleed… those are important things to mention. And it is good you're telling me everything, even if it seems minor. Just to get a better understanding, can you describe the bruising a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m covered in black and blue, Doctor. It’s just… easier. A little bump against the doorframe, a slight scrape while shaving… normally, maybe a tiny little mark. Now, it’s… substantial. Like someone punched me. And it stays for a long time. Longer than it used to. And it’s not just on my arms and legs, either. I noticed a little bit on my back the other day, just from leaning over to pick something up. It’s ridiculous. I feel like an old tomato.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like the bruising is more pronounced and widespread than it used to be. And that’s concerning. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a clearer picture. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and look at the areas where you’ve been bruising. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. I suppose it makes sense. I just… I don’t want to be a bother. You’ve got other patients, I'm sure. Important patients. I just want to get this sorted out. This worrying is… exhausting.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Mr. Farson. It's my job to assess these things, and I want to make sure we’re addressing your concerns properly. And it’s perfectly reasonable to want to get this sorted out. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Pulse is 72, regular. These bruises do appear more extensive than one might expect from minor trauma. And they are tender to the touch. I'm going to look at your back now, if that's alright. Just lean forward slightly.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Lean forward… there. It’s mostly just… a dull ache, really. Not sharp pain. But there it is. You can see? It’s not from anything I did. Honestly. I’ve been very careful. This whole thing is just… unsettling. I haven't felt this vulnerable in years.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the bruising on your back as well. And I believe you when you say you’ve been careful. It’s clear something is going on. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like your Warfarin dosage may need to be adjusted. It's also possible there's another underlying issue contributing to this, so we're going to need to do some blood work to investigate further. We'll check your INR – that's the test that measures how long it takes your blood to clot – as well as a complete blood count to rule out any other problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, blood work is fine. Whatever it takes, really. I just want to feel normal again. I don't like feeling like I'm going to shatter at the slightest touch. Is this going to be painful? Will they need to take a lot of blood? My wife… she always hated getting blood drawn.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about blood work, especially if your wife had a difficult time with it. The blood draw itself is usually quick, and most people don’t find it very painful – just a brief pinch. They’ll only need a few vials of blood, and we’ll send it to the lab right away. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend avoiding any activities that could cause injury, and let me know immediately if you experience any unusual bleeding, like nosebleeds that won’t stop, blood in your urine or stool, or severe headaches. Do you have any questions about the blood work or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No… no, I think I understand. Avoid injury, watch for bleeding… and wait. It’s just… waiting is the hardest part, isn’t it? My wife always said patience was a virtue. I never was very good at it. But alright. I'll try to be careful. And I'll let you know if anything… unusual happens. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Farson. And you’re right, waiting can be difficult. But we’re going to get to the bottom of this. The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours, and my nurse will call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. We're here to help. Do you have any trouble getting home, or would you like me to write a note for a ride?
PATIENT: No, no, I drive myself. I'm perfectly capable. Though, perhaps I should ask my neighbor to pick up groceries for me for a few days. Just in case. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. It’s… comforting to know someone is actually listening. I think that’s all. I’ll… see you soon, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Farson. That's what I'm here for. And a good idea about asking your neighbor for help. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Goodbye.
