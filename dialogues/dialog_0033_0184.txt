DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Humph. Good morning to you too. Look, I don't have all day. It’s about… well, it’s about this. It's too much. Too much for a man my age, you understand? I need somethin’ done about it. And quickly.
DOCTOR: "Too much," you say. Could you be a bit more specific, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean, specific? It's fat. Plain and simple. Too much fat around the middle. I used to be… well, I used to be lean. Like a… like a proper man. Not… this. You doctors should be able to see these things without me having to spell it out! Honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. And has this weight gain been recent, or has it been gradual over time?
PATIENT: Gradual. Mostly gradual. Though I reckon it got worse after… after my wife passed. Didn’t have the appetite for much after that, then suddenly… well, suddenly everything tasted good. And I started eatin’. Now look at me. It's a disgrace, really. A disgrace.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No, no sickness. Just… uncomfortable. Clothes don't fit. Can't move as quick. It's… it’s gettin’ harder to bend down, that’s all. I used to be able to lift anything, you know. Pile drivin’ is a strong man’s job. Not for… well, not for someone lookin’ like this.
DOCTOR: Pile driving?
PATIENT: Yes! Pile driving! What part of that is confusing? I operated the pile driver. For forty years! Big machine, strong work. Needed a strong body, you see? Now... Now I just sit. And eat. It's not a good combination. Look, are you gonna help me or just ask questions? I haven't got all day, you know. This clinic is way out in the sticks.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I’m just trying to get a complete picture. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite besides it simply tasting better?
PATIENT: Changes? Humph. I eat when I'm sad. I eat when I'm bored. I eat when I'm… well, I eat. It's just... more. Always more than I used to. My wife, God rest her soul, she used to keep me in check. Proper portions, she had. Now it's just... whatever I want. And I want a lot. It's a bad habit, I suppose. A very bad habit.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little somethin’ for my blood pressure. The doctor back in town gave it to me. Small white pill, once a day. That’s it. Nothing fancy. And I haven’t been sick enough for anythin’ else, thank you very much. A strong constitution, that's what I have. Or had, anyway. Before all this…
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. I eat everything. Always have. My wife tried to get me to eat more vegetables, but… well, let's just say I wasn't always compliant. No allergies. Strong stomach, remember? Everything goes down just fine. It's just... too much of everything now. Honestly, are we gettin’ anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of things. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Palpate my… what now? Look, I don't need you pokin’ and proddin’. I know I've put on weight. You've got eyes, haven't you? Just tell me what can be done about it. Pills? Surgery? I don't care. Just get on with it. I’ve got a dominoes game to get to this afternoon. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand your frustration. However, a basic exam is necessary to rule out other potential issues. It’s standard procedure. I'll start with your heart and lungs. If anything unusual is detected, I'll explain it to you. It will only take a moment. Please take a deep breath…
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to lie there like a… like a log. I’ve got things to do. Deep breath… Hurry up now. My time is valuable. And be gentle, you hear? This old body isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear, but breathing sounds are a little diminished. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any abnormalities. This may be slightly uncomfortable. Do you feel any pain here?
PATIENT: A little bit. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a full stomach, you know? Which, to be fair, it usually is. Stop pokin’ so hard! It’s not a stone, it's just… well, it’s just fat! Don’t need to dig around for it. You're makin’ me nervous now. Just tell me what you think, will you? Before I get completely agitated.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to be alarmed, Mr. Trendler. I'm just noting some slight tenderness in the upper part of your stomach. It could be related to the weight gain, but it's also possible there’s some mild inflammation. I recommend a blood test to check your liver function and rule out any underlying issues. We should also check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, given your weight and lifestyle. It’s standard protocol. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More pokin’ and proddin’? Honestly! Fine. Do what you have to do. But I don’t want to spend the whole day in this clinic. And don't tell me I need to eat any vegetables, either. I’ve had enough of that in my lifetime. Just get it over with. And make sure that nurse knows how to handle a needle. I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. I'll have the nurse draw the blood. It will only take a few minutes. I’ll also print out a requisition form for the tests. While we're waiting for the results, I suggest… …making small changes to your diet and incorporating some light exercise. But I understand your reluctance. We'll discuss the results when they come in and formulate a plan together. .
PATIENT: Humph. Small changes. Light exercise. Sounds exhausting. Just get me the results. And hurry up. I’m wasting precious dominoes time. .
