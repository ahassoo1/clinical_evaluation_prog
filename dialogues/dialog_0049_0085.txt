DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s this…patchiness on my skin. It’s quite bothersome, really. I noticed it a few weeks ago and it just…doesn’t seem to be going away. It’s not painful, thankfully, but it’s unsightly. I’ve always taken very good care of my skin, so I’m quite perplexed by it.
DOCTOR: Patchiness, you say. And how long exactly has it been a few weeks?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think…it was right after the garden party. July 12th, I believe. Yes, July 12th. We were outside for quite a long time, but everyone had hats and parasols, you know. It wasn’t a scorching day, but the sun was certainly out. I always use a high SPF, of course, but perhaps it wasn’t enough. It started as just a few little spots, and now…well, now it's more noticeable.
DOCTOR: July 12th. Alright. And where on your body is this patchiness located?
PATIENT: Oh, it's mostly on my arms, actually. The outsides, where the sun would have hit. And a little bit on my décolletage, right here. It's not all over, thankfully. Just those areas. I do try to keep my shoulders covered, you know. One must be sensible.
DOCTOR: Sensible, yes. And are these spots…raised, flat, itchy, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, no, they’re not itchy at all. Thank goodness. They’re…flat. Very flat. And they’re a bit lighter than the rest of my skin. Not dramatically, but noticeable, especially in the sunlight. It’s a rather…uneven tone. It’s just not…refined, you know? I’ve tried a few creams, but nothing seems to be doing anything. Honestly, I expected better results.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in these spots?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… they haven't gotten bigger, exactly. But they haven't faded either. They're just… there. Persistent. It's quite frustrating, really. I did try a new body lotion around that time, a mango scent. Perhaps that had something to do with it, although I can't imagine why. It was from a reputable brand, of course. Not some drugstore rubbish.
DOCTOR: Reputable, yes, that’s good. Let’s have a look. Please, if you don’t mind, roll up your sleeves and perhaps loosen your collar a bit. I need to examine the areas you mentioned.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Here you are. Be careful, please. I have rather delicate skin. I do hope it’s nothing serious. It would simply ruin my summer wardrobe, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes. I see. They appear to be hypopigmented macules. No erythema or scaling. And no evidence of active blisters or lesions. Skin turgor is normal. Do you have any history of autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Autoimmune conditions? Heavens, no! Absolutely not. My family has a history of…well, good health, mostly. My grandmother lived to be ninety-two! I eat very well, I exercise regularly, and I avoid stress whenever possible. I take very good care of myself. I simply can’t understand what could be causing this. It’s very…unsettling. I’ve never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any new medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just my regular vitamins. A multivitamin, Vitamin D – the doctor recommended it last winter, you know, with the shorter days – and a little fish oil for my joints. Nothing new, absolutely nothing. I'm very careful about what I put into my body. It's just as important as what I put on it, I always say.
DOCTOR: Alright. It could be post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, perhaps from a mild sunburn that you didn't fully realize at the time. Or it could be pityriasis alba, which is more common in younger individuals but can present similarly. We can do a skin scraping to rule out fungal infection, though I don't strongly suspect that's the case. I’m not overly concerned at this point. I recommend a topical corticosteroid cream, a mild potency one, for a few weeks. We'll see if that improves the appearance.
PATIENT: A skin scraping? Oh, dear. That sounds…rather unpleasant. And a corticosteroid? Isn’t that…strong? I prefer natural remedies whenever possible, you know. Perhaps a good aloe vera cream would suffice? I've heard wonderful things about its healing properties. I'm not sure I'm comfortable putting something… chemical on my skin unless it's absolutely necessary. Is there really no other option? It's just… I'm rather particular about what I use.
DOCTOR: Aloe vera is…pleasant, certainly. But unlikely to be effective in this case. A mild corticosteroid cream, used as directed, is generally very safe. It’s not a “strong” medication. It reduces inflammation. And the scraping… it’s a very quick procedure. Just to rule things out. But very well. We can try a bland emollient for a few weeks, if you insist. But if there’s no improvement, we’ll need to revisit the corticosteroid option. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A bland emollient. That sounds… acceptable. As long as it doesn’t have any… fragrances. Or parabens. Or anything artificial, really. I have very sensitive skin, you see. And if it doesn’t work, I suppose I can consider the…corticosteroid. But only as a last resort. Could you recommend a specific brand, perhaps? One that is… reputable, of course. I wouldn't want to use just anything. And how long should I try the emollient before we reconsider other options? A week? Two? I wouldn't want to waste my time on something that isn't going to be effective.
DOCTOR: Vanicream is generally well-tolerated. It's fragrance-free, paraben-free…all the things you’ve mentioned. Apply it twice daily. Let's say four weeks. Four weeks of consistent use. If there's no noticeable improvement after four weeks, then we'll discuss the corticosteroid cream. Understand?
PATIENT: Four weeks. Very well. Vanicream it is. I suppose that's…reasonable. I do wish there was a simpler solution, though. It’s just… such a bother, all this. Is there anything else, Doctor? I have a luncheon appointment at one o'clock, and I wouldn't want to be late. It’s with the garden club, you see. We’re discussing hydrangeas. It’s rather important.
DOCTOR: No, I don’t believe so. Just consistent application of the Vanicream. And if you see any worsening, or development of any itching or redness, contact the office immediately. Enjoy your luncheon. .
