DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, my face gets very red. Like, flushing. It happens sometimes, and I wanted to check what it could be. It’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be unsettling when your body does something unexpected. And it’s good you're getting it checked out. "Flushing," you say. Can you tell me a bit more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It doesn’t seem to be after eating anything special. Not spicy food, not anything like that. Sometimes it happens when I am… talking to people. Especially if I feel a little shy, maybe? Or if I have to explain something difficult. But not always. Sometimes it just happens… for no reason. It lasts maybe five, ten minutes, then goes away. It’s not painful, just… warm and red.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be triggered sometimes by social situations, but not consistently. And it's not related to food, and it doesn’t cause any pain, just warmth and redness that lasts a few minutes. Do you notice anything else happening when your face flushes?
PATIENT: Let me see… Sometimes my heart beats a little faster. Not racing, just… aware of it, you know? And maybe I feel a little lightheaded, but it goes away when the red does. Oh! And my hands get a little sweaty sometimes. But not always with the face, either. It's very… mixed up, I guess. It doesn't happen every time, and not all the things happen together. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It sounds mixed up, yes, but that’s helpful information. So, increased heart rate, sometimes lightheadedness, and occasionally sweaty hands alongside the flushing. It sounds like we’re dealing with something that involves more than just your skin. Have you experienced this flushing for a long time, or is it a recent development?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not new. It’s been happening… well, for years, I think. Maybe since my wife… passed. It wasn’t so bad then, just sometimes. But lately, it’s been more often. Maybe once a week, sometimes more. That’s why I thought I should get it checked. I don’t want it to be something serious. It just… worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Withycombe, and it’s good you came in to discuss it. It’s helpful to know it’s been a long-term issue, and that it’s become more frequent recently, especially given the difficult time you've been through. Before we go any further, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. I haven’t been to a doctor much, to be honest. I always tried to stay healthy. I used to walk a lot with my wife, but… not so much now. I had… the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox. Nothing serious. No big illnesses, no operations. I take a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor gave it to me a few years ago, but that’s it. I don’t remember the name right now. A small white pill. And… oh, I had my flu shot last year. That’s about it, I think. I don't have insurance, so I try to avoid the doctor if I can. It's expensive.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Withycombe. We’ll do our best to keep things as straightforward and cost-effective as possible. So, you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication—a small white pill, you said. Do you know the dosage?
PATIENT: No, I don't, Doctor. I just take one every morning. The doctor told me to. I don't really remember much about it. She just said, "Take this for your blood pressure." I am not good with remembering things like that. My wife used to keep track of everything. Now… it's harder. Sorry. I really don’t know the dosage. I just have the bottle.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Withycombe. We can figure things out. It looks like you're taking Lisinopril 10mg daily for your blood pressure, which is good. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I eat everything. My wife always said I had a cast iron stomach. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Never. Not even when I was a child. I think I'm pretty lucky that way. No allergies at all.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father… he had heart problems. He had a bad heart attack when he was older. He didn’t take care of himself, smoked too much, drank too much. He died when I was young. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. She took pills for it, like me. But that was a long time ago. I don't really know much about her medical history. My wife’s family… they were mostly healthy, I think. She didn't talk about it much. So, mostly just my father’s heart and my mother’s blood pressure, I guess. Nothing else I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart disease on your father’s side and high blood pressure on your mother's. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I never smoked, never drank much, and definitely no drugs. My wife didn’t like any of that. And I don’t need it. I get enough trouble just worrying, you know? I used to enjoy a little tea, but not so much now. It reminds me of… never mind. So, no. No alcohol, no smoking, no drugs. Just tea sometimes. A very quiet life.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Withycombe. And thank you for sharing that with me. Alright, let's move on to a quick physical examination. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs, if you don’t mind. It's just a routine check to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust you. I haven’t had a proper check-up in years, so it's probably a good idea. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/92. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal—no murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear—no wheezing or crackles. I'm also going to take a quick look in your throat and check your skin. Your throat looks fine, and your skin feels normal, although I do notice some redness on your cheeks. It's subtle, but it's there. It’s consistent with what you described—the flushing. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions as I examine your face. Does your face feel warm right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. It doesn't feel warm at the moment. It feels… normal. It’s usually worse when I am talking to people, or feeling stressed. It hasn’t happened yet today, thankfully. Sometimes it comes on suddenly, like a wave. But right now… just normal.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm also going to check your neurological function quickly - just a few simple tests to ensure everything is working as it should. I'll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, squeeze my hand, and stand up and walk a few steps. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe. Your eye movements are normal, your grip is strong, and your gait is stable. Everything seems to be functioning as it should. Based on what you've told me, the physical examination, and your medical history, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your flushing right now. However, several possibilities come to mind. It could be rosacea, although your symptoms don't quite fit the typical presentation. It could also be related to anxiety or stress, especially given the timing of the flushing and the history of increased frequency after your wife’s passing. Another possibility is medication-related—although Lisinopril doesn’t commonly cause flushing, it’s always good to consider. It’s also possible this is a symptom of something else entirely. Do you have any other symptoms that you haven’t mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but that’s probably just getting older. I haven't noticed anything else. It's just the redness, the warmth, and sometimes the fast heart. And the sweat. But not always. And it comes and goes. It’s very… confusing.
DOCTOR: It is confusing, Mr. Withycombe, and I understand your frustration. Given the uncertainty and the possibility of several underlying causes, I’d like to recommend a few tests to rule out any serious conditions and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I recommend a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. I also think it might be helpful to consult with a dermatologist to get a professional opinion on whether this could be rosacea or another skin condition. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I want to know what’s going on. And a dermatologist… yes, if you think it’s a good idea. I don’t mind. I just want it to stop. But… the cost. I don’t have insurance, you know. It’s expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Withycombe. We'll do everything we can to keep it as affordable as possible. I can order the blood tests and EKG and see if the lab offers a discount for self-pay patients. I'll also reach out to a few dermatologists in the area to see if they offer a sliding scale fee or accept payment plans. Let me also see if we can get a referral from a local charity that helps cover the cost of medical tests for uninsured patients. As for the dermatologist, I can write a detailed referral letter explaining your symptoms and medical history, which might help lower the consultation fee. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the tests and contacting the dermatologists and the charity?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. That would be… very kind of you. Anything you can do to help would be wonderful. I trust your judgment. Just… let me know what I need to do. I’ll do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. I've just ordered the blood tests and EKG. The lab is located just down the street at 123 Main Street. They’re open Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm. You don't need an appointment, but it's always a good idea to call ahead to confirm their hours. I'll also print out a referral letter for the dermatologist and a list of local charities that might be able to help with the cost. I’ll have my nurse give you the paperwork before you leave. I’ll also give you a copy of your test results when they come back, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen—if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or severe headache—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you… thank you very much for your help. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, just knowing we’re trying to figure it out. I appreciate you taking the time, and for being so… understanding. I’ll go to the lab tomorrow. And I’ll see about the dermatologist.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, if your symptoms worsen, don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Take care, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment.
