DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I wish I didn't have to be here. It's quite obvious what's wrong – I can’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels like it’s drooping. Is that all you need to know? Because I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. While it sounds fairly straightforward, it’s important for me to gather a bit more information to ensure I understand the complete picture and provide you with the best possible care. It's essential to rule out other potential causes, even if it seems obvious. Could you tell me when you first noticed the hearing loss and facial drooping?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Fine. It started… let me think… Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. I was having my tea, and things just sounded… muffled. Then, while I was brushing my teeth, I noticed the corner of my mouth wasn't moving quite right. It’s been getting worse each day, naturally. Honestly, it's a bit frightening, but I don't see what a lot of questions are going to do about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum, and you are right to be concerned with a new onset of these symptoms. Tuesday morning...and it's been progressively worsening since then. That's helpful to know. Just to clarify, was there anything specific happening at the time you noticed the changes – any illness, injury, or unusual activity?
PATIENT: Unusual activity? Really, Doctor? I had tea. Is that what you want to know? No, nothing unusual. I haven't been sick, haven't bumped my head, haven't been wrestling alligators, if that's what you were thinking. I simply woke up and noticed something was wrong. It’s rather… disruptive, to be honest. I have engagements, you know. Important ones.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question seemed…unfocused, Ms. Nissenbaum. I simply want to gather as much information as possible. And I absolutely understand your concern about your engagements. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the hearing loss and facial drooping?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… My head has been a bit achy, but I always get headaches. Nothing remarkable. And I've been a little more tired than usual, but frankly, who isn't these days? No dizziness, no nausea, no strange visions, if that's what you're after. Look, Doctor, is this going to take much longer? I really don't have time for a lengthy medical history. It’s a deaf ear and a drooping face – can we just fix it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I assure you I’m trying to be as efficient as possible. However, a few more questions will help me determine the most likely cause and the best course of action. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never had a deaf ear or a drooping face in my life. I take very good care of myself, you know. Good diet, regular exercise... I haven't even had a cold in years! This is… unexpected. Frankly, it’s rather alarming. Are you going to do anything, or are we just going to talk about it all day?
DOCTOR: I apologize again for the delay, Ms. Nissenbaum. You’re right, it’s time to move towards an examination. Based on what you’ve described—sudden onset hearing loss and facial drooping—my initial concern is Bell’s palsy. However, other possibilities need to be ruled out. I'd like to perform a brief neurological exam to assess your facial muscle function, reflexes, and sensation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Bell’s…what now? Look, Doctor, I appreciate you wanting to give it a fancy name, but I just want to know if you can fix it. And yes, examine away. Just… try to be quick, alright? I have people waiting. And please, don't poke me too much. This is all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concern and will be as efficient and gentle as possible. "Bell’s palsy" is a condition involving inflammation of the facial nerve, causing weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. It's often temporary, and treatment is most effective when started promptly. First, I’m going to check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll gently assess your facial muscle strength by asking you to perform a few simple movements – close your eyes tightly, raise your eyebrows, smile, and puff out your cheeks. I will also need to check your reflexes and sensation. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get on with it. I suppose simple movements are alright. But do be careful. Honestly, I haven't felt this vulnerable in years. And please, try not to make small talk. I'm really not in the mood. Do whatever you need to do, and let's get this over with. The sooner you tell me what’s wrong and how to fix it, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, could you please close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Done. It’s…difficult, actually. The left side feels… weaker. Is that what you wanted to know? Can we just skip to the part where you tell me what’s wrong? This is quite tedious, honestly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Nissenbaum. I do notice some weakness on the left side, as you mentioned. Now, if you could try to raise both eyebrows as high as you can. Alright, good. Now, can you give me a big smile?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It feels… strange. Like half my face isn't cooperating. Honestly, Doctor, I don't need a medical degree to tell you something is wrong. It’s glaringly obvious. Are you going to actually do something, or are we just cataloging the obvious?
DOCTOR: You are right to point that out, Ms. Nissenbaum. The left side of your face is noticeably weaker. Finally, if you could puff out your cheeks. Okay. Based on this brief exam, the findings are consistent with left-sided facial nerve weakness, strongly suggesting Bell's palsy. However, to rule out other possible causes, such as a stroke or tumor, I would like to order a CT scan of your head. It's a precautionary measure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh, good heavens. More waiting, more poking, more… everything. Honestly, this is becoming quite the ordeal. A tumor? Now you're just trying to frighten me. Look, Doctor, I haven't got time for elaborate tests. Can’t you just give me something for the weakness? Some sort of… injection, or a pill, or something? I have commitments, you know. Very important ones. Are you absolutely certain this CT scan is necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I apologize for the inconvenience. You are right to ask about alternatives, and I want to assure you that a CT scan is not something I recommend lightly. However, while Bell’s palsy is the most likely diagnosis given your symptoms and initial examination, it’s crucial to rule out other, more serious possibilities before starting treatment. A stroke, for example, would require immediate and different management. The CT scan will allow us to visualize the structures of your brain and rule out any other underlying cause for your facial weakness. It is a quick and relatively painless procedure. Regarding treatment for Bell’s palsy, the standard approach involves a course of oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone, which can reduce inflammation and improve recovery. In some cases, antiviral medications are also prescribed. Would you be willing to proceed with the CT scan so we can get a definitive diagnosis and start the appropriate treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Fine. Do the scan. But I expect it to be quick. And I expect the results to be… reassuring. And then you’d better have those pills ready, because I haven’t got all day. Honestly, this is a complete disruption. I need a referral to a very good neurologist afterwards, as well. I'm not trusting this to just anyone. And please, no more questions unless they’re absolutely essential. I'm starting to feel quite lightheaded. Just get it done.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concerns, and I will do everything I can to expedite the process. I’ll order the CT scan immediately and will make arrangements for a referral to a qualified neurologist for follow-up care. I will also prepare a prescription for prednisone, which you can start once we confirm the CT scan results. A nurse will be in shortly to escort you to the radiology department. It should take approximately 30 minutes. In the meantime, please let me know if you feel worse or experience any new symptoms, such as dizziness, severe headache, or difficulty speaking. To reiterate, we’re proceeding with a CT scan to rule out other causes for your facial weakness, and I will keep you informed of the results as soon as they become available. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s quite enough for now. Just… get the scan done. And try to be efficient, alright? I really must get back to my schedule. Honestly, this whole ordeal has been… rather unsettling. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will ensure everything is expedited. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please don't hesitate to let us know if you experience any discomfort or have any concerns. Thank you for your patience. .
