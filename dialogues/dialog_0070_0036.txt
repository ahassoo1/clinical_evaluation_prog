DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… necessary that I have this check-up. For the… the papers. The insurance papers, you understand? I need to be sure everything is… correct before they will give me the coverage. It is a bit of a bother, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Barban. Insurance requirements can certainly be… involved. We’ll do our best to make this as straightforward as possible. So, to clarify, you're here for a general check-up to fulfill requirements for your insurance coverage?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A general check-up. To make sure… I am healthy enough for them. It is… foolish, really. I feel perfectly fine. But they require it. Do you understand? It is simply paperwork, isn’t it? I do not think they actually care about my health, just that I meet the boxes.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Barban. While paperwork is often a large part of it, a check-up does allow us to establish a baseline of your current health, and identify any potential issues, even if you're feeling perfectly well. It's a good practice, regardless of the insurance requirement. Let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly, or have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No. No doctors. I am a healthy man. Yemenis are… strong people. We do not get sick easily. As for illnesses… perhaps a small cold, sometimes. Nothing serious. No hospitals. Never. I do not… need doctors, usually. This is just for the… the form. It is all very unnecessary. Do you need to know about childhood things? Because it was a long time ago and… I do not remember much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to hear you've been generally healthy. We can certainly focus on the present, then. Just to be thorough, could you tell me if there’s any family history of serious illness – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer – that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he was strong too. Worked very hard. He lived a long life, I think. But… he did have… problems with his stomach, near the end. Old age, I believe. My mother… she died young. A sickness, but I was a small boy. No one talked about it much. It was… a long time ago. I don’t know specifics. Most of my family is… still in Yemen. It is difficult to keep track. Is this important? All this talk of sickness is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Barban. We don't need to dwell on unpleasant topics. Knowing a little about family history can sometimes be helpful, but it’s not essential. Let’s talk about your lifestyle for a moment. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I do not smoke. Alcohol… no. Haram. And… those other things… disgusting. I am a respectable man. I work hard, I pray, I eat good food. Simple life. I do not need… vices. These are… bad habits. I do not partake. Is this what you want to hear? That I am a good man, living a proper life? It shouldn’t matter, surely. This is about the form, not my character.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Barban, but only in the context of your overall health. It helps me get a complete picture. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. Alright. Let's move on to any current medications or allergies you may have. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No medications. Never. I do not believe in them. They are… chemicals. Bad for the body. Vitamins… sometimes, my sister sends me some from America. But I do not take them regularly. Just when I feel a little… tired. And allergies… no. I have never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. We eat a lot of spices in Yemen, you see. Strong spices. No allergies here. You can write “none.” That is accurate.
DOCTOR: Alright, "none" it is. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Typical diet… hmm. I eat rice. A lot of rice. With meat, usually lamb or chicken. And vegetables, when they are available. We use a lot of yogurt. And spices, of course. Very important. Curry, cumin, coriander… I cook most of my own food. It is healthier that way. I do not eat… fast food. Or processed things. That is not good for you. Simple food. Like my mother made. Is this enough detail? I do not know what you need to know exactly. It is rice, meat, and spices. A good, honest diet.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Barban. Thank you. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Must you? It seems… unnecessary. I told you, I am a healthy man. But… if it is required for the papers, I suppose. Very well. But please be quick. And do not… touch me unnecessarily. I am not comfortable with… excessive examination. Get it over with. Quickly. And tell me when you are finished.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Barban. I understand your discomfort, and I will be as efficient and respectful as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Be gentle. I do not like… tight things. And do not take too long. This is… a waste of time, honestly. But I need the insurance, so… proceed. But quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relaxing your arm for me. It might feel a little pressure… there we go. 130 over 80. Not bad. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: That is… cold. And uncomfortable. Are you finished? I do not like things touching me. Hurry, please. This is… unsettling. Is something wrong? You are frowning. Tell me if there is a problem. This is why I do not trust doctors. Always poking and prodding. It is unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that was uncomfortable, Mr. Barban. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I was simply listening to ensure everything sounds as it should. I also checked your pulse – 72 and regular. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Could you open your mouth and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Finished. I do not see the point of this. It is… invasive. Is everything alright? You are looking… concerned again. Tell me, Doctor. Is there something wrong? I told you I am a healthy man. This is a waste of time and… dignity. Just tell me if there is something to worry about. I need to know. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, everything appears normal. Your ears and throat look healthy. However, I noticed your weight is a bit higher than it should be for your height. Your height is 188 centimeters, and you weigh 90 kilograms. This puts your Body Mass Index in the overweight category. This isn’t necessarily a cause for immediate alarm, but it does increase your risk for certain health problems, like heart disease and diabetes. We can discuss strategies to help you manage your weight if you’d like. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Overweight? I am strong. I am a Yemeni man! We are built differently. This… BMI, you say? Is this some Western… invention? I do not need your Western measurements to tell me how healthy I am. I feel perfectly fine. And no, I do not want to discuss strategies to… change my body. I am perfectly content. This is ridiculous. Are you trying to tell me I am unhealthy? After all this poking and prodding? This is… insulting. I came here for a paper, not a lecture on my weight. Just give me the form, Doctor. I have wasted enough time here.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Barban. I apologize if I’ve caused any offense. My intention was not to insult you, but to provide a complete picture of your health based on standard medical assessments. As you requested, I won't delve further into weight management at this time. I will complete the necessary form for your insurance requirements based on the findings of this examination – normal heart and lung sounds, healthy ears and throat, and noted height and weight. It will take a few moments. Once completed, I will review the findings with you, and you can submit it to your insurance provider. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… acceptable. Just finish the form. Quickly. And do not add any… notes about my weight. I do not want that on the paper. It is unnecessary and… I do not want them questioning my health. Just the basic findings, as you said. Heart, lungs, ears, throat. That is all. No extra commentary. And then I will leave. This has been… unpleasant. I do not look forward to repeating this experience. Just… finish the form.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Barban. As you requested, it only includes the basic findings of a normal heart and lung examination, healthy ears and throat, with your height and weight noted. There are no additional comments or recommendations. Please review it to ensure everything is accurate. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: It is… acceptable. It will do. Thank you. I will leave now. Good day, Doctor. I do not expect to see you again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Barban. I wish you good health. If you change your mind about discussing any health concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. .
