DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’d like to explore mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I've heard it can be helpful, and I'm hoping you could tell me a little bit about it, and if it might be a good fit for me.
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful idea, Ms. Sugino. It’s great you’re being proactive about your well-being. Mindfulness and meditation can be very beneficial for a lot of different things. To get a better sense of whether it would be a good fit for you specifically, could you tell me a little bit more about what's prompting you to explore these options right now?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. It's not really one big thing, you know? Just… life. Work can be stressful, even though I mostly enjoy it—fixing signals and switches isn’t always easy! And being single for so long… sometimes I just feel a bit…scattered, I guess. Like my thoughts are always running. I'm hoping something like mindfulness could help me feel a little more grounded and calm. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Sugino. “Scattered” is a very common feeling, and it sounds like you’re very self-aware, recognizing those feelings and wanting to find healthy ways to cope. Stress from work and navigating life changes are definitely things mindfulness can address. Before we dive deeper into mindfulness techniques, I'd like to get a broader picture of your overall health. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your medical history, just to rule out anything else that might be contributing to how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. Please do. I don't think there's anything major, but I'm happy to answer whatever you need. I have Medicare, if that helps? I try to stay on top of my check-ups, but… well, you know, life.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. And I understand completely about “life” getting in the way. Let's start with any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, that’s about it, really. And I broke my wrist a few years ago, slipping on some ice, but it healed completely. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy. I've always been lucky that way. I do get the occasional headache, but nothing I can’t usually manage with some rest and ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, a healed wrist fracture, and occasional headaches managed with rest and ibuprofen. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven't had any reactions to any medications I’ve taken in the past. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. I'm really pretty simple when it comes to all that. Do you need to know about anything specific? Sometimes I forget things… even important things. But usually not allergies!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Sugino. No, we're just covering the basics. Knowing about any reactions, even minor ones, is helpful. Okay, so no known allergies. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tougher one. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather, on my father's side, had some kind of heart trouble when he was older. But other than that, not really. My family wasn’t really one for talking about health much. They were more practical people, focused on getting things done. I don't really know a lot about their medical histories, if I’m honest. It's a bit of a blank, really. Does that make it harder for you? Should I try to remember more?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Sugino. Family history can be tricky, and it’s common not to have all the details. We can work with what you know. High blood pressure in your mother and heart trouble in your grandfather are helpful to note. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… okay. Well, I live alone in a small apartment. I work a pretty regular schedule, usually five days a week. I like to garden when the weather is nice - I have a small balcony with some flowers and vegetables. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to walk when I can, but it’s hard to find the time sometimes. I mostly enjoy my own company, to be honest. I don't have many hobbies, other than gardening. And... I spend a fair bit of time thinking, maybe too much time! Does that give you a good idea?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you have a fairly healthy routine, despite feeling a bit scattered at times. It’s wonderful you enjoy gardening; that’s a great stress reliever. Now, before we discuss mindfulness techniques specifically, I want to quickly assess your current mood and any symptoms of anxiety or depression. Have you been feeling particularly down, hopeless, or losing interest in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Well, “down” is a good way to put it sometimes. Not constantly, but… a sort of low-level sadness. I wouldn't say hopeless, exactly, but… not really excited about anything. It’s just that things don’t feel as…bright, I guess. And I do find myself thinking a lot about the past, wishing things were different. It’s not crippling, I still go to work and take care of myself, but it's there, a quiet weight. I don't really talk about it with anyone, to be honest. It just feels…silly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Sugino. It doesn't sound silly at all. It sounds like you're describing some symptoms of mild depression, and it’s very brave of you to share that with me. Many people experience similar feelings, and it’s important to address them. Given what you've told me about your low mood and tendency to dwell on the past, I think it's a good idea to do a brief screening questionnaire to get a clearer picture. Would you mind answering a few questions about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks?
PATIENT: No, not at all. If it helps, I'm happy to answer whatever you need. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Two weeks sounds manageable. I hope it doesn’t take too long though, I have a bit of a memory problem, as you know. Just in case I forget things!
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It shouldn't take long, and we can take it at your pace. If you do forget something, that’s perfectly alright. We can always revisit it. Let’s start with this first question: Over the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's not every day, but… probably a few days a week. Maybe three or four? It comes and goes. It's not overwhelming, but it's definitely there, a sort of quiet sadness lingering in the background. Like a grey cloud, maybe. Is that too vague? I'm not very good at putting things into words.
DOCTOR: No, that's not vague at all. "A grey cloud" is a very good description, actually. Three or four days a week is helpful to know. Now, the next question: Over the past two weeks, how often have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: That's... harder to answer. I still go to work, and I enjoy gardening, but... it's not the same. Like something's missing. I don’t get the same joy from things I used to. Maybe… a couple of times a week? I force myself to do things sometimes, which isn't a good sign, I suppose. It feels like effort, rather than enjoyment. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain. I feel a bit silly talking about this, honestly. Is this what everyone talks about in therapy?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Sugino. You’re not silly at all for talking about this, and it’s very common for people to experience a diminished enjoyment in things they used to love. And yes, this is exactly the kind of thing people often discuss in therapy. We'll just continue with a few more questions, then we can discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt tired or had little energy?
PATIENT: Oh, that one is easy. Quite a lot, actually. Most days, I think. I sleep okay, but I wake up feeling… drained. Not physically exhausted, exactly, but… mentally tired. Like I haven’t rested properly. I try to drink coffee, but it only helps a little. Maybe five or six days a week? It's hard to get going in the morning, to be honest. I just feel… sluggish. Is that too vague? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at this. It’s hard to put these feelings into words.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Ms. Sugino. You're explaining everything very well. "Drained" is a very accurate description. Five or six days a week is helpful. One more question, and then we can review everything. Over the past two weeks, how often have you had trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good one. Quite often, actually. My mind just wanders. I’ll be reading something, and suddenly I’m thinking about something completely different. Or I’ll be watching television, and I realize I haven’t actually absorbed anything. I have to rewind things constantly. It’s frustrating. Probably four or five days a week. It feels like my brain is just… foggy. I forget things easily too, which you know already. It’s just… a lot. Is that too vague? I feel a bit silly talking about this, honestly. Are you finding all this useful?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sugino, this is very useful. You are not silly at all for talking about this; you’re being very brave, and I appreciate you being so open with me. Based on your answers, it appears you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with mild depression. It's important to remember this isn’t a formal diagnosis; it simply means further evaluation and support may be beneficial. Before we discuss options, do you have any thoughts or feelings about this?
PATIENT: Well… it doesn’t really surprise me, to be honest. I’ve been feeling… off, for a while now. I just thought it was… life. Getting older, being alone, work stress. I never really considered it might be something… more. A little unsettling, I suppose. But also… a little bit of relief, knowing it’s not just me. Does that make sense? I'm a bit overwhelmed now, to be honest. What are my options? I'm not really keen on taking medication, if that's what you're going to suggest. Is there anything else I can try?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Sugino. It’s very common to feel overwhelmed after learning this, and it’s good you’re feeling a bit of relief too. It's important to remember you are not alone in this. And you're right to ask about options. Medication is one possibility, but it's certainly not the only one, and I completely respect your preference against it at this time. Given your feelings and the mild nature of the symptoms, I think several approaches could be beneficial. We could explore psychotherapy—talking to a therapist—which can provide coping strategies and support. Mindfulness and meditation, which you already expressed interest in, are also excellent options, and I can provide resources for guided practices. Additionally, lifestyle adjustments—focusing on regular exercise, a healthy diet, and social connection—can make a significant difference. I'm also happy to recommend a support group, where you can connect with others who are experiencing similar challenges. What are your thoughts on these options?
PATIENT: Hmm… psychotherapy sounds… daunting, to be honest. I'm not really one for talking about my feelings. But mindfulness and meditation definitely appeal to me. And I suppose I should try to be more active and eat better, although that's easier said than done. A support group… maybe. I'm not really a group person, but it might be helpful to know I'm not alone. Could we start with the mindfulness and meditation? And maybe you could give me some resources for that? I’m happy to try on my own for a while before considering anything else. And maybe some tips on staying active? I walk when I can, but I need some motivation. Does that sound reasonable? I'm a bit overwhelmed now, to be honest. And... thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Ms. Sugino. Starting with mindfulness and meditation is a great step, and you’re right, you can definitely try it on your own for a while. I have a list here of several reputable apps and websites that offer guided meditation practices. I'll print that out for you. They range in length and focus, so you can find something that suits your needs. I'll also include some information on local walking groups and resources for staying active. As for staying motivated, setting small, achievable goals can be helpful. Instead of aiming for a long walk every day, start with a 15-minute walk a few times a week. And remember to be kind to yourself. It's okay to miss a day now and then. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you’re doing and discuss any challenges you may be facing. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much. A month sounds good. And thank you for being so patient and understanding. It really means a lot. I feel… a little bit better already, just talking about it. I think I can do this. Hopefully, these mindfulness exercises will help me feel a little more grounded. And maybe I'll even join a walking group. Although, don't hold me to that!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I’m glad you’re feeling a little bit better already. And absolutely, no pressure about the walking group! Here are those resources, and my card with the clinic number if you have any questions before your follow-up. Remember, taking care of yourself is a process, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Have a wonderful day, Ms. Sugino. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
