DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, I believe. Lower part. It’s been… troublesome. Honestly, it’s a bit difficult to explain, as things haven’t been terribly clear lately. I do know the other doctors have mentioned something about… a condition I have? Something with my immune system? It’s just… hard to keep track of everything, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. “Something” isn’t very helpful, is it?
PATIENT: Oh, you are quite right. I apologize. It’s… SLE, I think? Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. That’s what I recall them saying. And these pains… they come and go, but lately they’ve been… rather severe. It feels like… a strong cramping, deep inside. And it’s been happening more often. I'm not entirely sure when it started, precisely, but probably within the last month, maybe a little longer. It's all a bit… blurry.
DOCTOR: SLE… yes, I see that in your records. And you’re saying these abdominal pains are new, or at least significantly worse than usual?
PATIENT: Worse, definitely worse. I’ve had… discomfort before, a little ache here and there. But this… this is different. It’s not just an ache. It’s a gripping sort of pain. It makes me… hesitant to eat, sometimes. And it keeps me awake at night. It's not constant, thankfully, but when it is there, it’s quite… noticeable. I haven’t been able to pinpoint anything that makes it better or worse, either. Though, I think… perhaps it’s worse when I’m stressed? But truthfully, I’m often a little stressed these days. It’s difficult to say for certain.
DOCTOR: Right. And any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… oh dear. Let me think. Not… dramatically, no. Perhaps a little… looser, sometimes? But I haven't kept particularly close track, if I’m honest. It hasn’t been… alarming, exactly. Just… not as regular as it usually is. Is that important, Doctor? I apologize for being so vague. It’s difficult to recall the specifics. Everything seems to run together, these days.
DOCTOR: It can be. Lupus can affect the gastrointestinal system. We need to rule things out. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, no, thankfully not. I don't believe so. I… I would certainly remember that, wouldn’t I? No, no blood. Just… the discomfort, and the irregularity. And the pain, of course. A rather sharp pain, at times. It's not a constant ache, but it comes in waves. And it’s been… unsettling, to say the least. I haven't felt well. Perhaps a little tired, as well, but that could be anything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick abdominal exam. Just lie back on the examination table for me, please. We'll see what we find.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m just hoping we can figure out what’s causing this discomfort. It’s been… worrisome.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph. I'm going to press here and here. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. And I'm listening to your abdomen as well. Hmm. There's some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants, particularly on the left side. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. Bowel sounds are… normal. It's not an acute abdomen, thankfully. But we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: That… that’s about right, I think. A little discomfort there, on the left. Not sharp, but… noticeable. It's good to know it’s not… acute, as you say. I’m relieved to hear that. What sort of investigation did you have in mind, Doctor? Would a scan be helpful? Or perhaps some blood tests? Whatever you recommend. I’m happy to cooperate. I just want to feel better, you see. This uncertainty is rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Blood tests are definitely in order. We need to recheck your inflammatory markers – ESR, CRP – and a complete blood count to assess for anemia. Also, let’s check your liver and kidney function. A stool sample to rule out infection would also be prudent. As for a scan, I’m not convinced it's necessary at this moment. We’ll see what the blood work reveals. Lupus can mimic so many other conditions, and often the results are the key to figuring things out. We need a solid baseline first, before we expose you to unnecessary radiation. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. Blood tests and a stool sample… that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand about the unnecessary radiation. You’re quite right to be cautious. And yes, Lupus is rather… complicated, isn't it? It’s difficult to keep track of everything. So, what do I need to do? Do I need to go somewhere else for these tests, or can I do them here? And will you explain the results to me when they come back? I apologize for all the questions, but I do like to understand what's happening. It helps me feel a little more… in control, you see.
DOCTOR: We'll do the blood work here in the clinic. The lab technician will come in shortly. You’ll need to collect a stool sample – I’ll have the nurse provide you with the necessary container and instructions. As for explaining the results…yes, I will go over them with you. Though, frankly, I doubt you’ll understand all the technical details. But I will certainly try my best. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today to discuss them. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A week from today sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, even if I don’t grasp all the technicalities. I trust your expertise. And I'm sure I can manage the stool sample. I’m just glad we’re getting to the bottom of this. It’s been… a worrying time. I'm happy to let you take the lead, and I'll simply do as you advise.
DOCTOR: Good. The nurse will be in shortly with the instructions for the stool sample. I’ll see you next week, Ms. Glymph. Try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
