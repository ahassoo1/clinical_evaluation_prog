DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to Clarke Internal Medicine. I'm Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's these bumps on my legs. They're really bothering me, you see. On my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda…hard.
DOCTOR: I see. Bumps on your shins that are red and hard. Okay. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed them?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…oh, maybe a month or so ago? I wasn’t sure what they were at first, figured I bumped ‘em somehow. But they haven't gone away, and now there’s more of ‘em. They kinda hurt, especially if I brush against something.
DOCTOR: A month ago, and they’ve been increasing in number, and causing you pain when bumped. Alright. Have you noticed anything that seems to make them worse, or better?
PATIENT: Well, nothing really makes them better, to be honest. Wearing long pants helps a little, so I don’t bump ‘em as much. But I haven’t really tried anything special. Does that make sense? I just kinda ignore ‘em ‘til they bother me too much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Avoiding bumping them seems to be the only thing providing any relief. Have you had any other symptoms alongside these bumps, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. Just the bumps and the pain. No fever, no tiredness…nothing else feels different. I eat okay, sleep okay...old man stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. And that’s good information to know. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, skin conditions, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with pills. I stopped taking ‘em a few years ago, though, and it’s been okay since. Other than that… not much. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension that’s currently well-controlled without medication. Excellent. And have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Years ago, I had my appendix taken out. That’s about it, I think. A long, long time ago. Everything went fine, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my wife, she's healthy as a horse, thankfully. My mother had…arthritis, I think. And my father, he had some heart trouble when he got older. But nobody that I remember ever had anything like these bumps on their legs.
DOCTOR: Alright, no family history of similar skin issues. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to eat a good diet, so I don’t really need anything extra. Mostly just rice and fish, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. My wife makes a lot of different foods, and I’ve never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'd like to take a look at those bumps on your legs, if you're comfortable with that. Could you please sit up on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, no problem. Let me just… Here you go, Doctor. Take your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a look. I see several raised, reddish bumps on both shins. They appear to be somewhat firm to the touch. Are they itchy at all, besides being painful?
PATIENT: Mostly painful, Doctor. Not too much itchy. Sometimes a little bit, but not often. They feel…hard, like little pebbles under the skin. And see, this one right here… That one hurts the most. It gets really sore if I press on it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that one is particularly tender. It does feel firm and slightly raised. I don't see any signs of infection – no pus, no excessive warmth. Based on what you've told me and what I’m seeing here, these bumps could be shin splints, or more likely, stasis dermatitis. It’s common in people with a history of high blood pressure, and can be related to circulation issues. But to be sure, I'd like to order a simple blood test to rule out other possibilities, and potentially a venous Doppler ultrasound to check the blood flow in your legs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Venous…what now? Ultrasound? I don’t know…that sounds complicated. What would the blood test be for? And is this…serious? I mean, are these gonna keep getting worse? I just want to make sure it's not something too bad. I'm not good with all the medical stuff.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask questions, Mr. Aluia, and it's good you're voicing your concerns. A venous Doppler ultrasound is a painless test that uses sound waves to look at the blood flow in the veins of your legs. It helps us see if there are any blockages or issues with circulation. The blood test will help us rule out things like inflammation or infection that could be causing the bumps. And to answer your question about seriousness – they can get worse if left untreated, but they're usually manageable with proper care. It’s good we are addressing them now. They are not an emergency, but we want to get a clear picture of what’s going on so we can treat them effectively. Does that explanation make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… a little bit better. So, the ultrasound just looks at the blood flow? No poking or anything? And the blood test is just to make sure it’s not something else? Okay… I guess that doesn't sound too bad. Alright, Doctor, if you think it’s best, go ahead and do the tests. But please, no poking!
DOCTOR: Excellent. No poking, I promise. The ultrasound is completely non-invasive, just a gel and a probe on your skin. The blood test is a standard draw, and the nurse will take care of that for you. I’ll write the orders now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and explain the ultrasound scheduling. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, and avoiding prolonged standing or sitting. We'll have a better idea of the best course of treatment once we have the results back. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I think that covers everything for now. Elevate my legs, you say? I can do that. My wife always tells me to put my feet up! You've been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a lot better knowing what's going on, and what we're gonna do about it.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Aluia. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. The nurse will be in shortly. We'll get those tests ordered, and we’ll follow up with you once we have the results. Here’s a printed summary of our discussion and the ordered tests for your records. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Aluia.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor Reisig. You too. I appreciate your help. Bye now.
