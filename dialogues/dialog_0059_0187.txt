DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Perhaps you could tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Chest… feels funny. And my heart… bang-bang sometimes. Doctor, I no have time for long talk. Just fix it, okay? Blood pressure, you say? It high. Wife tell me. She always telling me something.
DOCTOR: I understand you're experiencing some discomfort in your chest and noticing your heart beat irregularly, and your wife has mentioned your blood pressure is high. I assure you, we will get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. It's good that your wife is keeping an eye on things. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe what you mean by "funny"?
PATIENT: Funny… like… tight. Squeeze. Not always tight. Sometimes just… flutter. Like bird in my chest. I eat kimchi, you know? Maybe kimchi do it? I like kimchi. Very good kimchi. Don't tell me no eat kimchi!
DOCTOR: I certainly wouldn't dream of telling you to stop eating kimchi, Mr. Sobkowicz! It sounds delicious. A squeezing tightness and a fluttering sensation—that’s helpful to know. And it happens sometimes, not all the time?
PATIENT: Yes. Not all time. When I… when I walk fast. Or… after argument with wife. She always… complain. About TV. About kimchi smell. Everything. It happens then. Mostly then. And… and I get… dizzy little bit. Maybe. I no remember so good. Old man, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, the sensation seems to be triggered by exertion, like walking quickly, or when you're feeling stressed – perhaps during a disagreement. And you sometimes feel a little dizzy with it. That's all very useful information. Do you ever feel any pain in your chest with this, or does it just feel uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Not pain pain. Like… heavy. Like someone sitting on my chest. Not sharp. Not… like broken bone. Just… heavy. And sometimes, arm feel… numb. Left arm. Just little bit numb. Not always. And… and I sweat. Little bit sweat. Even when not hot. Wife say so. She notice everything.
DOCTOR: Heavy, like pressure on your chest, and numbness in your left arm occasionally, with some sweating even when you’re not warm… Thank you, Mr. Sobkowicz. Your wife is very observant, and these details are important. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doctor told me… long time ago. Many years. Take pills. Blue pills. Sometimes I forget. Wife remind me. Cholesterol… maybe? I don't remember. Old man, like I say. No heart problem. Doctor never say heart problem. Just blood pressure. And… and I have bad back. That’s all. Bad back. From farm work. Long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you’ve been diagnosed with high blood pressure in the past and take blue pills for it, though you sometimes forget. And you have a history of back problems from farm work. That’s good to know. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Name? Hmm. No. I just take blue pills. Little blue pills. Small. Wife get them. She go to… pharmacy. I no remember name. Too many pills these days. For everything. I just… take them. Okay? Just fix chest, Doctor. I have TV show start soon. Very important show.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s alright if you don’t remember the name of the medication. We can look it up in the pharmacy records later. To get a better understanding of what’s going on with your chest, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, and check your blood pressure again. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Quick, okay? I no have all day. And not too cold, your… thing. My chest is sensitive. Just quick. And tell me fast what wrong. I want to watch TV show. Very important show about… about generals! Very good show.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, I'm listening now... Your heart sounds a little bit irregular, and I can hear some mild crackling in your lungs. Your blood pressure is elevated, 160/90. That's higher than we'd like. I'm also noting some slight swelling in your ankles. Do you experience any shortness of breath, or notice your ankles swelling up at the end of the day?
PATIENT: Shortness…? Sometimes. When walk up hill. Or… when wife yell at me. She make me… breathless. Ankles… maybe. I no look at ankles. Wife notice everything. She say ankles puffy sometimes. After… after sit long time. Okay? Just fix chest, Doctor. I want to know what wrong. And I want to watch generals! Very important!
DOCTOR: I understand. So, shortness of breath with exertion or stress, and your wife has noticed some swelling in your ankles, particularly after prolonged sitting. Given your symptoms - the chest tightness, irregular heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, crackling in your lungs, and ankle swelling - it sounds like you may be experiencing some fluid buildup due to possible heart failure. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better picture of your heart and lungs. We’ll also do a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? EKG? Blood test? More tests! Hmph. This take long time! Wife will be mad. She say I need to take care of myself. Always telling me something. Okay, fine. Do tests. Quick, okay? But I want to watch generals tonight. Very important generals! If I miss show, you… you responsible!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'll do my best to expedite the process. The tests shouldn't take too long, and I’ll have the results as quickly as possible. I'll have the nurse draw your blood and get you scheduled for the chest X-ray and EKG right away. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a mild diuretic—a water pill—to help reduce some of the fluid buildup. It might help with the shortness of breath and swelling. The nurse will explain everything to you. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. No. I think not. Never had problem with pills. Except blue ones, sometimes I forget. Wife say I allergic to… to arguing! She always say that. No, no allergies to pills. Just fix chest, Doctor. And let me watch generals! Very important! If I no watch generals, my life not worth living! Okay? You understand? Generals!
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Sobkowicz. No known allergies, and the generals are of utmost importance. Alright, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule your tests. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available, and we’ll discuss the next steps then. In the meantime, please try to rest and avoid strenuous activity. If you experience any severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… fix chest. And let me watch generals! That all. Go now. I… I tired. Old man, you know. Just… go. Thank you. Maybe. Now, where is nurse? I want to watch generals! .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. I will do my best to get you back to your show as soon as possible. Please call if you need anything at all.
