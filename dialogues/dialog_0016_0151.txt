DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I figured I should get it checked out. I don’t want it to get worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It's good you're getting it checked out. “A little while” can mean different things to different people, so could you tell me roughly how long you've been experiencing this tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? It comes and goes, mostly. Some days I barely notice it, and other days it's… well, annoying. Not painful, just… like pins and needles, you know? It’s mostly in my fingers and toes, but sometimes it goes up my arms a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months. And it's not painful, just a pins-and-needles sensation, coming and going, mostly in your fingers and toes, but occasionally up your arms. That's helpful. Does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t seem to happen after any specific activity or anything. I do a lot of walking for my job, delivering the mail, but it doesn’t seem to be worse after a long day. And it's not like it's worse in the cold or anything like that either. It just… happens. I wish I knew why.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not consistently related to activity or temperature. That helps narrow things down. And you mentioned you deliver mail – is that a physically demanding job, besides the walking?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. Lots of bending, lifting… carrying those bags all day, you know? It's not super heavy, but it adds up. Been doing it for… oh, goodness, almost 30 years now. My husband, God rest his soul, he used to worry about it, but I always said I was tough as nails. But maybe he was right, maybe it’s finally catching up to me.
DOCTOR: Thirty years is a long time delivering mail! It sounds like it is a physically demanding job, despite not being extremely heavy at any one time. Okay, let's talk a little more about the sensation itself. When it happens, is it just tingling, or do you experience any other symptoms—like numbness, weakness, burning, or changes in skin color?
PATIENT: Well, mostly just the tingling. Sometimes… sometimes it feels a little bit numb, but it doesn’t last long. Just for a few minutes, maybe. And I haven’t noticed any changes in my skin color, no. No burning either. It’s really just this annoying pins and needles feeling… and the occasional little bit of numbness. It doesn’t happen at the same time, though. Usually just the tingling. It’s hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: It is hard to explain sometimes, and you’re doing a great job. Okay, so primarily tingling, occasionally a brief numbness, no burning or color changes. Now, let's broaden the picture a bit. Have you noticed any similar symptoms anywhere else in your body?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just my hands and feet, like I said. I’ve had a little bit of aches and pains in my back sometimes, but I figure that’s just from the job. And I’m getting older, you know? Everything creaks a little bit more these days. But nothing like this tingling. It’s very specific to my extremities, thankfully. I don’t want it spreading, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about it spreading. Okay, so it’s localized to your hands and feet. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, but the doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise. Nothing major. I haven’t been to the doctor in a few years, to be honest. Just for check-ups, nothing serious. And my husband… well, he handled all the paperwork and remembering appointments. After he passed… it just wasn’t the same. I’m not one for complaining, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of controlled high blood pressure, but otherwise generally healthy. It’s perfectly understandable about the appointments. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but that’s it. I always figured I was better off just eating healthy and getting enough sleep. My mother always said that was the best medicine. And I try to do that, as much as my job allows. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, thankfully. My husband used to joke I had a cast iron stomach. He was always the picky eater. I haven’t had any problems with allergies, though. Never even had poison ivy, believe it or not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, or children—who have experienced similar symptoms, like tingling or numbness, or conditions like diabetes or neuropathy?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother… she had some problems with her hands later in life. She used to complain about them being numb sometimes. But I don’t know if it was the same thing as this. She never really went to the doctor much, either. And my father… he was healthy as a horse, never had a day’s illness in his life. As for my siblings, they’re both fine, as far as I know. No one really talked about medical problems much in my family. It wasn't really something we did.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some hand numbness, but otherwise no significant family history related to this. Now, just a couple more questions before we do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband smoked for a while, but I always hated it. Made the house smell awful. I always told him it was bad for his health, and eventually he quit. Thankfully. I’ve always been a healthy eater, and I don’t drink much either. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, could you tell me a little about your typical daily diet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of fruits and vegetables, you know? I make a big salad most days for lunch. And for dinner… usually something with chicken or fish, and a side of potatoes or rice. I like to cook, so I try to make things from scratch whenever I can. I’m not a big fan of processed foods. And I drink plenty of water, of course. Nothing fancy, just good, wholesome food. It’s what my mother taught me.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful. Thank you for all that information, Teretha. It gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I just want to figure out what’s causing this tingling, you know? It’s starting to worry me a little bit.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm going to start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll take a look at your hands and feet, and do a few simple neurological tests to assess your reflexes and sensation. It won't take long. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Pulse is good. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Are there any visible changes—rash, swelling, discoloration?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just my hands, you know? They look normal. A little bit rough, maybe, from the cold weather, but that’s it. I work with my hands a lot, so they’re not exactly delicate. I’ve never noticed anything unusual about them, except for this tingling, of course.
DOCTOR: Pulses are good and strong. Now, I'm going to check your sensation. I'm going to lightly touch different parts of your hands and feet with this cotton swab. Can you tell me when you feel it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Just let me know if it’s too hard or too soft. I can usually feel things pretty well, but sometimes my fingers get a little numb, like I said. Hopefully it won't be a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, your sensation is generally intact, but it is slightly reduced to light touch in the fingertips of both hands and feet. And you have a little difficulty discerning two points in those areas as well. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, the exam suggests some mild peripheral neuropathy, most likely affecting the distal nerves in your hands and feet. It’s not severe, but it's enough to explain the tingling and occasional numbness you're experiencing.
PATIENT: Peripheral… what now? Is that… bad? Is it from the job? Or something else? I just want to know what this means and what I can do about it. I don’t want it getting worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Peripheral neuropathy simply means there's some damage to the nerves outside of your brain and spinal cord. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including tingling, numbness, pain, and weakness. It’s not necessarily “bad,” but it can be a sign of an underlying condition. It could be related to your job, given the repetitive hand movements and potential for nerve compression. However, there are many other possible causes, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and even certain medications. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your blood sugar, vitamin levels , thyroid function, and kidney function. We'll also check for inflammation. That will help us rule out some of the more common causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to know what’s going on, and if it’s something I can fix. I don’t want it to get worse, like you said. Blood tests are fine. When will I get the results? And will they hurt?
DOCTOR: Alright. The blood tests shouldn't hurt at all—just a quick prick of the finger or arm. The lab usually gets the results back within a few days, usually 3-5 business days. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a plan. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms. If your tingling becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like weakness or pain, please give us a call right away. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… try not to worry too much? Is that right? You’ll call when the results are back. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It makes me feel a little bit better, knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Try not to worry too much. We're just gathering information at this point. It's good we caught it early. I'll have the nurse draw the blood tests for you now. She'll give you instructions on fasting if any are needed. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Have a good day, Teretha. And please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you again, Doctor. You too.
