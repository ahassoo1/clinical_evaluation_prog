DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, I seem to be going to the bathroom rather a lot, if I'm being frank. It's been happening for a bit now, and it’s a bit disruptive, you see. I don't recall precisely when it started, to be honest. A few weeks, perhaps? It’s just… frequent urination.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination… Right. And when you say "rather a lot," can you give me a sense of how many times you're going in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. I don’t really count, you understand. I suppose… more than usual. I used to be able to go through the day without thinking about it, and now… well, I find myself seeking it out quite often. Perhaps every couple of hours? It could be more, I truly don’t know. I apologize for the vagueness, Doctor. My memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Verbos. We can work with what you remember. Do you find yourself needing to go during the night, as well?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. That’s… that’s a new development, I believe. I used to sleep through the night quite soundly. Now, I’m up… oh, I’d say once, maybe twice, to use the restroom. It doesn’t keep me awake completely, but it’s… unsettling. I prefer a good, uninterrupted sleep, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is it a full emptying of your bladder each time, or just a small amount?
PATIENT: That’s a… a good question. I believe it’s a full emptying. Although, sometimes… sometimes I feel like there’s still a little left, but then again, perhaps I’m mistaken. It’s difficult to say with any certainty. It’s usually a rather normal stream, if you don’t mind my saying so. Not weak, not… forceful, just normal.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all, Doctor. That's a relief, at least. It doesn’t hurt. Just… the frequency, you understand? And waking up at night. It’s more of an inconvenience than anything. I wouldn’t describe it as painful, no. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your thirst recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a thoughtful question. Now, let me consider… I suppose I have been drinking a bit more water lately. It's rather warm, you see, and I always try to stay hydrated. But whether it’s more than usual… I’m not certain. It’s difficult to say. I do find myself reaching for a glass of water more often, if that helps.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think... well, now that you mention it, I do feel a bit more tired than I used to. But, at my age, one tends to feel a bit fatigued, wouldn’t you agree? I wouldn’t necessarily attribute it to anything specific. I also… sometimes feel a bit hungry, but that could be anything, really. No, I can’t say there’s anything glaringly obvious. Just the… the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Verbos, given your age and symptoms, it could be a number of things. It could be simply a change related to aging, or it could be something else, such as an enlarged prostate, which is common in men your age. We should rule out a urinary tract infection as well. I’m going to order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel. We'll also do a quick prostate exam. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. A urinalysis and a panel… and the prostate exam, you say? Very well. I trust your judgment, completely. I would just like to get to the bottom of this, you understand? The nighttime trips are… unsettling, as I mentioned. So, yes, please proceed with those tests.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will come in shortly to collect a urine sample and draw some blood. For the prostate exam, I’ll need you to lie on your side. It’s a quick exam, but you may feel some slight discomfort. It's important to rule things out. We'll get the results back within a few days, and we can discuss them then. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe I do. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness. A quick exam, you say… I suppose I’m prepared for a bit of discomfort, if it’s necessary. I trust you’ll be gentle. I just… want to feel like myself again, you understand? So, thank you. I’ll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. She'll explain the procedures in more detail. Have a good day, Mr. Verbos.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
