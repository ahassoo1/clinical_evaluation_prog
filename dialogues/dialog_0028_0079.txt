DOCTOR: Right. Courtnye Hainley, 47. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hi Doctor Memmolo. It's… bruising. I've been bruising really easily lately, and it’s… worrying me a bit, to be honest. I'm on a blood thinner, so I figured I should get it checked out. It just seems… more than usual.
DOCTOR: A blood thinner, yes, I see that. And "more than usual"… that’s helpful. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Like… normally if I bump into something, maybe a small bruise will show up. But now? Even a gentle touch seems to leave a mark. And they’re bigger, darker… they stick around longer. I noticed it about a week ago, but it feels worse the last couple of days. I tripped over the rug last night – nothing major, barely a tumble – and I’ve got a bruise on my hip the size of my hand now. It’s just… not normal for me.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said a week ago… so it’s a fairly recent development. Do you recall anything specific that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? Not really. Nothing I can think of. I haven’t started any new medications, haven’t changed anything in my diet… I definitely haven't hit myself anywhere I can remember. I was helping my niece move some boxes last weekend, but it wasn't heavy lifting. Honestly, I'm racking my brain and nothing jumps out. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are these bruises appearing spontaneously, or are they all related to some sort of trauma, however minor?
PATIENT: Definitely not spontaneous. I haven't just woken up with them. Always from bumping into something, or… well, the rug last night. But like I said, small bumps. It shouldn’t be this bad. I’m not falling down or anything, Doctor. It’s just… everyday stuff.
DOCTOR: Everyday stuff. Hmm. And you're currently taking…?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Warfarin, 5mg, once a day. And… that’s it, as far as regular meds go. I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, but that’s just when I remember. I haven't taken it in a few days, actually. Why? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It could be. We need to be sure your levels are stable. Do you regularly have your INR checked?
PATIENT: INR? Yeah, I get it done. Every… well, usually every month. I was there three weeks ago, and the doctor said it was good. Right in the range, she said. I have the paperwork somewhere at home, if you need the exact number. It’s just… this bruising started after that check-up.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "in range" isn't very specific. Let’s just move on. Any family history of bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. That's a good question. My mum… she bruised easily too, now that I think about it. She was Tongan, like me, and always had little marks on her arms. But she just put it down to getting older, you know? She never really got it checked out. My dad… he was fine, no problems with bleeding or anything. I don't know about anyone further back, to be honest. We didn’t really talk about medical history much. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Possibly. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. No, not really. No nosebleeds, no bleeding gums, no… weirdly heavy periods, I guess. Just the bruising. I'm tired, but I'm always a little tired. I work long hours, so… I thought that was just normal. I haven't noticed anything else that seems off. No dizziness or anything like that. Just… the purple. Lots of purple.
DOCTOR: Let me have a look. Roll up your sleeve, please. I'll need to assess the bruising directly. And please tell me, is there any pain associated with these bruises?
PATIENT: Okay, here you go. And no, not really. They're not painful, exactly. More… tender, if I press on them. Like a normal bruise, you know? It’s just… the size and the color are what’s worrying me. I haven’t felt like I’ve done anything to deserve this many. It feels… different.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, they are extensive. And the coloration is… concerning. We’ll need to rule out some things. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a coagulation panel – just to confirm your INR and check for other deficiencies – and a metabolic panel.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. How long will that take? And… will I need to do anything special beforehand? I have to work tomorrow, you know. I really can’t afford to miss too many shifts.
DOCTOR: The lab work shouldn't take long. Results usually come back within 24-48 hours. Fasting isn't required. Just… try to avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, 24-48 hours. I can manage that. No strenuous activity… got it. So, should I, like… cancel my plans for the weekend? Or is it just… be careful? Because I promised my niece I’d help her paint her living room. She’s really relying on me.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not going to tell you what to do with your weekend. Just be mindful. Avoid bumping into things. We need to rule out more serious causes, and frankly, the fact that you’re bruising like this, even with a therapeutic INR, is… unusual. We’ll discuss further once we have the results. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, right. Be careful. No bumping. Got it. No, I think that's everything for now. Just… what if it's something really bad? You're not… worried, are you? I'm probably just being silly, but… this is kinda freaking me out.
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions. We're being proactive. Most likely it's a minor adjustment needed with your medication, or a vitamin deficiency. But we’re running tests to be sure. Now, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay, proactive. That sounds… better. Yes, that’s acceptable. Follow-up appointment with the nurse. Alright. Thanks, Doctor Memmolo. I really appreciate you seeing me. I’ll… try not to bump into anything.
