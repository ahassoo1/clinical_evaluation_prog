DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Rowbottom, yes. Arbie Rowbottom. It's about my… well, it's not pleasant to talk about, frankly. But I noticed something in the, uh, commode yesterday. Blood. Streaked through it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to bother a man my age. I've seen things, you understand. Things a young doctor like yourself couldn't possibly imagine. And this… this isn’t right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand it's not easy to talk about these things, and I appreciate you being so direct with me. Seeing blood can definitely be concerning. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Direct? I'm just stating facts. Don’t need to sugarcoat things. It was… bright red. Not dark, not old. Fresh, I’d say. And it wasn't just a drop or two. A streak. Like someone took a paintbrush to it. I haven’t changed anything in my diet, haven't bumped myself or anything. It just… appeared. Honestly, I’m starting to think it's something serious. Things just don’t happen like that for no reason.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, and you’re very observant noticing it was bright red. That does suggest it's likely coming from closer to the end of your digestive tract. And you’re absolutely correct – things usually have a cause. Let’s try to narrow it down. Have you had any pain in your abdomen, or with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? Well… not pain, exactly. More of a… discomfort. A little cramping, maybe. And it takes a bit longer than usual to… you know. Get things moving. Not agonizing, mind you. I’m a tough man. But it's noticeable. Always have been regular as clockwork, you see. This is… unsettling. I used to be able to predict the tides better than the weatherman, and now this. Honestly, it's probably just old age catching up to me. But a man's gotta be sure, doesn't he?
DOCTOR: I understand. Change is unsettling, especially when it involves your body. The cramping and difficulty you're describing are good information. And you’re right to want to get it checked out. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or consistency of your stool besides the blood?
PATIENT: Consistency? Good Lord, Doctor, are you trying to make me a stool inspector? Look, it's generally… normal. Brown. You know, the usual. Maybe a little… softer than it used to be. But nothing alarming. It’s not watery or anything. Just… not as firm. And the color is… well, brown, with the unfortunate addition of red. I haven't noticed anything else peculiar. Though, now that you mention it, it smelled a bit… different yesterday. Hard to explain. Not bad, exactly, just… not my usual smell. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Rowbottom, thank you for telling me. Changes in stool odor can be a clue. Okay. Now, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or fever recently?
PATIENT: No, no sickness at all. Not a bit. I haven’t had a proper cold in years. Toughened up my immune system flying around the world, you see. Been everywhere, done everything. Strong as an ox, usually. And definitely no vomiting. I haven’t lost my appetite either. Still eat like a horse. Steak and potatoes, mostly. Good, solid food. Though… come to think of it, I have been a little… tired lately. Just a general weariness. But that's probably just my age, isn't it? Getting old takes it out of a man.
DOCTOR: It certainly can. But we need to consider everything. Now, do you have any history of constipation, or have you ever had polyps or anything removed during a colonoscopy or other procedures?
PATIENT: Constipation? Never in my life. Regular as I said. Clockwork, Doctor, clockwork. I’ve never needed… assistance, if you catch my drift. And a colonoscopy? Good heavens, no. Never had one of those. Sounds… unpleasant. I've had enough poking and prodding in my lifetime, thank you very much. Never had anything removed either. I'm a healthy man, or was, before this whole… business started. I keep myself to myself, mostly. Steak and potatoes, a bit of fresh air, and leave the medical fuss to those who need it. I've always said prevention is better than cure, and I've done alright for 88 years, haven't I?
DOCTOR: You have, sir, you absolutely have. Alright, Mr. Rowbottom, given your history, the bright red blood, and the slight change in bowel habits, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Exam, eh? Well, I suppose. Can’t hurt to have a look, I guess. Though I doubt you'll find anything. I'm telling you, it’s probably just a fluke. A bit of irritation. But alright. Get on with it. Just… be gentle, Doctor. I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. And keep it brief. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then I'll gently palpate it to check for any tenderness. After that, I’ll do a rectal exam. It's important to rule out any obvious sources of bleeding. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Rectal exam?! Good heavens, Doctor. Is that absolutely necessary? I mean… couldn’t you just… give me something for it? A pill, perhaps? Or some advice? I've dealt with worse in my life, but that… that feels a bit excessive, doesn't it? I thought you were a professional, not a… well, never mind. But honestly, I’m not thrilled about this. Are you sure there's no other way? I’m an 88-year-old man, Doctor, not a young recruit!
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if I haven't adequately explained the importance of a rectal exam in this situation. Given the bright red blood you’re experiencing, it’s the most direct way to identify potential sources like hemorrhoids, fissures, or to detect any masses. It’s a standard part of evaluating rectal bleeding and is crucial for an accurate diagnosis. However, I completely respect your concerns. We can proceed cautiously, and I will explain every step before I do it. We could start with a less invasive external examination and discuss the next steps afterwards. Would that be more comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Well… that's… slightly better, I suppose. An external examination. Yes, that I can tolerate. Just… please be quick. And explain everything. I don’t like surprises. I’ve had enough surprises in my life, thank you very much. Mostly unpleasant ones. But alright. An external examination first. Let's get it over with. And try not to poke too much. I'm a delicate flower, you know. Despite appearances.
DOCTOR: Of course, sir. I’ll be very gentle and explain everything as I go. I’m just going to examine the skin around your rectum and anus visually and palpate it gently to feel for any abnormalities. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort. I’m not seeing any obvious hemorrhoids or fissures externally. The skin appears normal in color, but there is a small area of tenderness when I press here on the left side. And I can feel a slight firmness just beneath the skin. It's not large, but it’s there. Given these findings, I still recommend a brief internal exam to get a complete picture. It will allow me to assess the rectum and rule out any other potential causes of the bleeding. I understand your hesitation, but it's important for an accurate diagnosis. Would you be willing to reconsider?
PATIENT: Firmness, you say? Good Lord. What does that mean? Is it… serious? You’re not telling me something, are you? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t like being kept in the dark. Is it… is it cancer? I've seen things, you know. Lost friends… Don’t tell me it’s that. An internal exam… I… I suppose. If you insist. But be quick, and gentle. And tell me what you’re doing as you go. Every step. I want to know exactly what’s happening. And if it's… if it’s something bad, just tell me straight. I'm an old man, Doctor. I can handle it. But don’t sugarcoat things. Just… get it over with. Quickly. And gently. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rowbottom, and I assure you I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. It’s too early to say definitively what it is, and it may not be anything serious. However, the firmness I felt warrants further investigation. Before we proceed, I want to explain exactly what I will do. I will apply a small amount of lubricant and gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel for any abnormalities, such as polyps, masses, or sources of bleeding. It may feel slightly uncomfortable, but I will stop immediately if you experience any pain. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Just… get on with it. The sooner it's over, the better. But be careful. And… tell me if you find anything. Don't spare my feelings. I've lived a long life, Doctor. I can handle the truth. Just… hurry. And be gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ve completed the exam. I did feel a small, firm mass located on the left side of your rectum, consistent with what I felt externally. It’s approximately one centimeter in size and feels somewhat irregular. There was no active bleeding observed during the exam, but there was a small amount of dried blood present. The surrounding tissues also feel slightly tender. Based on these findings, I am concerned about the possibility of a rectal polyp or, less likely, a more serious condition such as a tumor. I recommend a colonoscopy to visualize the entire colon and obtain a biopsy of the mass to determine its nature. It’s the most accurate way to diagnose the cause of your bleeding and guide further treatment. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Tumor…? You said… tumor…? Good Lord. I knew it. I just knew it. I’ve seen enough friends… lost enough people… to cancer… A colonoscopy… a biopsy… What does that mean? Will it hurt? Will I have to… have surgery? I’m an old man, Doctor. I don’t bounce back like I used to. Tell me straight, Doctor. How bad is it? Am I… am I going to be alright? Just… tell me the truth. Even if it's… bad. I need to know. I need to prepare. What are my options? Just… tell me everything. Quickly. Before I… before I fall apart.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, please try to remain calm. It’s understandable to feel frightened and overwhelmed, and I want to assure you that we will take this one step at a time. At this stage, it’s too early to say definitively whether it's a cancerous tumor or a benign polyp. A colonoscopy and biopsy are necessary to determine the exact nature of the mass. A colonoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It's typically performed with sedation, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. If a mass is found, a small tissue sample will be taken for analysis. The results will help us determine the type of cells present and guide further treatment. If it’s a benign polyp, it can usually be removed during the colonoscopy with minimal recovery time. If it's a cancerous tumor, treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, depending on the stage and severity of the cancer. We would discuss all options thoroughly and create a personalized treatment plan that’s right for you. It’s important to remember that early detection significantly improves treatment outcomes. We will work together to get you the best possible care. Do you have any questions about the procedure or treatment options?
PATIENT: Chemotherapy… radiation… surgery… Good Lord. It sounds… awful. And you said… early detection…? So… it could be serious…? What are the chances…? What are the chances it’s… bad? Give me a number, Doctor. I need to know. I need to prepare myself… and… and my affairs. I don’t want to be caught off guard. And… the sedation you mentioned… will it… will it make me sick? I’ve always been sensitive to… medications. I don’t want to… lose control. Just… tell me the truth, Doctor. Even if it’s… not what I want to hear. I need to know what I’m facing. Before… before it’s too late.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your anxiety and your need for honest answers. It's difficult to give you exact probabilities without the biopsy results, but I can offer some general information. Rectal cancer is often curable, especially when detected early. The five-year survival rate for localized rectal cancer is around 90%. However, the survival rate decreases as the cancer progresses. The biopsy itself is typically painless, as it's performed during the colonoscopy. As for the sedation, it's generally very safe. Most patients experience only mild side effects, such as drowsiness or bloating. We will monitor you closely throughout the procedure to ensure your comfort and safety. I want to emphasize that we haven't confirmed a diagnosis of cancer yet. The colonoscopy and biopsy will provide us with the information we need to make an accurate assessment and develop a personalized treatment plan. I recommend scheduling the colonoscopy as soon as possible. Would you like me to assist you with that?
PATIENT: 90%... That’s… something, I suppose. Better than nothing. But… still a chance. A chance it could be bad. Alright. Yes. Schedule the colonoscopy. Get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the sooner we’ll know. But… can you… can you recommend a good hospital? A good surgeon? Someone… experienced? I don’t want some young doctor practicing on me. I need someone… reliable. Someone who knows what they're doing. And… is there anything I should do to prepare? Anything I should eat… or avoid? I want to be… ready. As ready as I can be. Just… tell me everything. Before… before it’s too late.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I’ll be happy to provide you with recommendations and preparation instructions. I recommend Dr. Eleanor Vance at City General Hospital. She's a board-certified colorectal surgeon with extensive experience in diagnosing and treating rectal cancer. She comes highly recommended by her peers and patients. Here’s her contact information. To prepare for the colonoscopy, you'll need to follow a clear liquid diet for 24 hours before the procedure. This means no solid foods, milk, or anything red. You’ll also need to take a bowel preparation medication to empty your colon completely. I’ll provide you with detailed instructions on how to do this. I’ll also schedule a pre-colonoscopy appointment with my nurse to review the instructions and answer any questions you may have. If you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We have a support group for patients undergoing similar treatments. Is there anything else I can do to help you prepare?
PATIENT: Dr. Vance… Thank you. I’ll… I’ll look her up. And the support group… Perhaps. I’m not one for… groups, usually. Prefer my own company. But… it’s good to know it’s there. No… I think that’s all. For now. Just… the clear liquid diet… and the bowel preparation. Sounds… unpleasant. But… I’ll do it. I’ll do whatever it takes. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. You’ve… you’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your honesty… and your patience. I’m an old man, and… I’m not used to this. I suppose… I’ll be seeing you again. After the colonoscopy. Hopefully… with good news. Thank you again, Doctor. I… I’ll be in touch.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll do everything we can to get you some answers, Mr. Rowbottom.
