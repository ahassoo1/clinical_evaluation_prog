DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my wife, actually. She’s been on that blood thinner for a while now, you know, since the… incident. And she’s been bruising like crazy lately. It’s getting a bit concerning. She’s usually so careful, but it seems like every little bump leaves a mark.
DOCTOR: Right, blood thinner… I see here you’re referring to Warfarin. And bruising… Okay. Can you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Yes, Warfarin, that’s it. Look, I’m not a medical man, Doctor. I just… notice things. She’s getting them on her arms mostly, and a couple on her legs. They’re… bigger than usual, I think. And they seem to show up so easily now. Before, a little knock, okay, maybe a small bruise. Now? It’s like she’s made of glass. She hasn't fallen or anything, mind you. She's careful. Really careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this increased bruising been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. Let me think… It started… probably about a month ago, maybe a little less. At first, I didn't think much of it. Just figured she bumped into something. But it’s been getting worse each week. It's not like overnight, Doctor. It’s been… gradual. A slow creep, really. It’s unsettling, to be honest. She's worried, and frankly, so am I.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month… gradual onset. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… not that I'm aware of. She's been taking the same dose of the Warfarin, same time every day. She hasn’t started any new medications, that I know of. Her diet… she still cooks the same things. Honestly, Doctor, she's a creature of habit. Very particular, you could say. That's why this is so strange. Nothing should be different! It’s… perplexing.
DOCTOR: Right. And is she experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… she has been a bit more tired lately, now that you mention it. But she's getting older, so I just figured that was… old age. And she’s complained a little about feeling weak, but again, could be anything. No bleeding gums or nosebleeds, thank goodness. She’s not complaining of any pain, just… general malaise, I suppose. She’s not herself, Doctor. Not quite as… sprightly as usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, weakness, and malaise… No signs of active bleeding. Has she had any recent illnesses, even a cold?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, actually. She did have a bit of a cold about three weeks ago. Nothing major, just a sniffle and a cough for a few days. She mostly stayed in bed and rested. I don't think it was the flu, just a common cold. She seemed to recover fully, though. Or at least, I thought she did. Maybe that’s something? I hadn't even thought about it until you asked. Old age, you know, things just slip your mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cold three weeks ago. Alright. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to check things out. I'll listen to her heart and lungs, and take a look at her skin, particularly where she’s been bruising. Then we can discuss some possible blood tests. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam is fine. She’s in the other room, getting settled. Just… please be gentle with her. She gets a bit nervous around doctors, always has. And she doesn’t like being poked and prodded too much. You'll have to be patient. She's a good woman, but a bit… delicate.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. I understand. Please, bring her in when you're ready. I'll be in the exam room.
