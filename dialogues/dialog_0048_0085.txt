DOCTOR: Right. Gabbrielle Bartock, 31 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s this…patchiness, really. On my arms, mostly. It’s just…not right. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it’s not getting better, that’s for sure. It’s quite…unseemly.
DOCTOR: Patchiness…unseemly. Okay. And where exactly on your arms are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… there. And there. On both, actually. It’s not…all over, thankfully. More on the backs, I think. It’s hard to say precisely. I don’t really examine myself closely, if you understand. It just…stands out. Like someone took a paintbrush to my skin. A very bad painter.
DOCTOR: Right. Backs of the arms. And it's…new?
PATIENT: Newish. A few weeks, like I said. It wasn't there before, I know that. I would have noticed. I keep things…very tidy, generally. And I certainly pay attention to how I look. It's… distressing, frankly. It’s not a colour one chooses, you understand.
DOCTOR: Any itching, burning, or pain associated with these patches?
PATIENT: Oh, no, thankfully. Nothing like that. It’s purely…visual. Which, I suppose, is bad enough. It doesn't feel awful, just… looks rather dreadful. It’s not as if I can go around with discoloured skin, is it? Especially not in August. It clashes with everything.
DOCTOR: Clashes… right. Have you tried any creams or lotions on these areas?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Several. My husband, he's a pharmacist, you see. He gave me…well, a selection. A very hydrating one, a brightening one, one for sensitive skin… Honestly, I’ve lost track. They haven’t done a thing, naturally. It’s not something you can just cream away, is it? It requires…proper attention.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Let’s have a look. Please, roll up your sleeves. And try not to be alarmed if I need to examine other areas, we need to rule things out.
PATIENT: Oh. Other areas? Well, I suppose if you must. But really, it’s here that’s the problem. I don’t see why you need to look anywhere else. It’s quite…personal, you understand. There. Now, hurry up. I have a luncheon to get to.
DOCTOR: Alright. The patches are slightly hypopigmented, irregularly shaped, and appear to be…scaling. No active inflammation noted. Now, have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses? No. Not a thing. I’m very careful. I avoid crowds, I wash my hands constantly… My husband is obsessive about my health. He makes me take all sorts of vitamins. I haven’t even had a cold in years. It’s really quite remarkable, actually. I attribute it to good genes and…discipline. It certainly isn’t anything contagious, I assure you.
DOCTOR: And any family history of skin conditions?
PATIENT: Skin conditions? Oh, goodness. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she had…something. A rash, I think. But it was decades ago. And she lived in the countryside. Everything was different then. Probably just dirt, honestly. She wasn’t a particularly…clean woman. My mother never had anything. And I certainly didn’t inherit it from her. It’s more likely…stress, I suspect. All this planning for the charity gala. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me, and the appearance of the patches, it could be pityriasis alba. It's a mild form of eczema, often seen in children and young adults. Though, I'd like to rule out other possibilities. We'll need a potassium hydroxide preparation to check for fungal infection, and possibly a skin biopsy if it doesn’t improve with treatment.
PATIENT: Fungal infection? Biopsy? Good heavens. That sounds…dreadful. Is that…painful? And what does all this mean? I just want a cream, a nice, simple cream. Is that too much to ask? I haven’t got time for…tests. Honestly. I'm starting to think this is rather unnecessary. Is it contagious, at least? I absolutely cannot risk infecting anyone.
DOCTOR: It's not contagious, thankfully. The KOH prep is a simple scrape – minimal discomfort. And a biopsy… well, it’s a small sample, sent to the lab. A minor procedure. But, frankly, based on the appearance, it’s likely pityriasis alba. We can try a topical corticosteroid cream for a few weeks. If it doesn’t improve, then we discuss further investigation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A cream, finally. Yes, that sounds…reasonable. But not one of those sticky creams, mind you. I have a luncheon, as I’ve mentioned. And it absolutely must be fragrance-free. I'm very sensitive. And what strength? I don't want to overdo it. My skin is quite delicate. Honestly, sometimes I think doctors just like to make things complicated.
DOCTOR: Fine. I'll prescribe hydrocortisone 1% cream. Apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice daily for two weeks. If there's no improvement, or it worsens, schedule a follow-up and we'll revisit the biopsy. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Hydrocortisone…1%. Very well. And do I need a special bandage or anything? I wouldn't want to get it on my clothes. This is silk, you know. It stains so easily. And… no, that's all. I think. Just… make sure it's a reputable brand. I don't trust those generic things. Honestly, the things one has to worry about these days. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose.
DOCTOR: The prescription is ready. A reputable brand, of course. Have a good day. And try not to stress, alright?
PATIENT: Stress? Honestly. As if. Yes, well. Thank you. Goodbye.
