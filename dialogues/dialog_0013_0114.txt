DOCTOR: Hi Maribeth, it’s so nice to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Chriselda. It’s… polite to meet you as well. I’m here because of my breathing. It’s been… troublesome when I try to lie flat. It feels like I’m… suffocating, almost. It’s not comfortable at all. I’d like to get it sorted, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, troublesome breathing when lying flat… that’s definitely something we want to look into. And “suffocating” is a really helpful way to describe it – gives me a good starting point. Just to clarify, how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started, I believe, about three months ago. Maybe a little longer. It wasn’t constant at first, just… sometimes when I’d try to rest. Now, it’s nearly every time. It’s quite bothersome, honestly. Makes getting a good night’s sleep… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three months ago, starting intermittently and now nearly every time you lie down. And it’s impacting your sleep, which is important. Is it worse with any particular activity before you lie down?
PATIENT: Hmm… activity. Let me see. No, not that I’ve noticed. Eating doesn’t seem to make it worse, and I don’t do much… strenuous activity these days. Perhaps if I’ve been talking a lot? That’s the only thing I can think of. I used to be quite the storyteller, you see. But now… not so much. It doesn’t always happen after talking, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially worse after talking, but not consistently. That's good to know. Besides the feeling of suffocating, can you describe how it feels?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not exactly a pain, you understand. More like… a tightness in my chest. And it feels like my lungs aren’t… filling up properly. Like there isn’t enough air. It makes me a little anxious, to be honest. I don't like feeling like I can't breathe. I suppose that makes it worse, the anxiety. It’s a vicious cycle, I imagine.
DOCTOR: That sounds really unsettling, Maribeth, and a vicious cycle is a perfect way to describe it. Tightness in the chest, feeling like lungs aren’t filling up, and the anxiety definitely makes sense. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not really. No coughing, no wheezing. My ankles do swell a little sometimes, but that's been happening for years. The doctor before… said it was just my age. I don’t have any… dizziness or anything like that. I suppose I’m just… tired more easily. But that could be anything, couldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no cough, no wheezing, ankle swelling that’s been present for years, and just general fatigue. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. And I’ve always had a bit of… high blood pressure, but it’s been controlled with medication for quite a while now. Otherwise, not much. I’ve been… fortunate, I suppose. Nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. I do hope this breathing isn't something… serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and controlled high blood pressure. That’s good to know. And I understand your concern about the breathing – we'll get to the bottom of it. And what medications are you currently taking for that high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s… Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. And… sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, but only when it flares up. Ibuprofen, usually. But not every day, certainly not. I try to avoid it when I can. It doesn’t agree with my stomach. That’s all, really. Just the Lisinopril regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. My mother… she was allergic to everything, poor woman. But I seem to have escaped that fate. I'm thankful for small blessings, you know?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, no known allergies. Okay, Maribeth, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your ankles, and a few other things. It’ll just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go ahead. I’d like to get this sorted, if possible. The quicker the better, frankly. I have a luncheon with some friends next week, and I’d like to be able to enjoy it without… worrying about my breathing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll do our best. Okay, if you could just take a deep breath for me… and another one… good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Okay… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs… I do hear some… faint crackles in the bases of both lungs. Not terribly pronounced, but they're there. And your ankles do have some mild swelling, as you mentioned. No significant redness or warmth. Okay, I’d like to order a chest X-ray just to get a better look at your lungs, and a basic blood workup to check your kidney function and rule out any other issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An X-ray and some blood work. Fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have that luncheon… and I’d prefer not to cancel it. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… will I hear from you soon?
DOCTOR: I understand, and we'll get the orders in right away. The lab and radiology should be fairly quick. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available – usually within 24-48 hours. I’ll give you a call as soon as I’ve had a chance to review them. In the meantime, if your breathing gets significantly worse—meaning you're having trouble speaking in full sentences, or you feel like you’re gasping for air—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… please call me as soon as you have the results. I appreciate you taking this seriously. It’s… unsettling, feeling like you can’t breathe properly. I suppose that’s all. Thank you, Chriselda. I’ll… wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Maribeth. I absolutely understand your concern, and I will call you as soon as I’ve had a chance to review the results. We’ll figure this out. It was nice meeting you. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before I call you.
