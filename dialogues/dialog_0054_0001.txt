DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Well, I am here about the smoking, you see. I’ve been… at it for a very long time, and I think it is finally time to try and put an end to it. It’s become quite a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's excellent that you're taking this step, Mr. Knoch. It's never too late to quit, and it’s one of the best things you can do for your health. To get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a little more about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Where shall I begin? I started when I was… oh, seventeen, I believe. Back in Lithuania, it was very common, you understand. Everyone smoked. A pack a day was… normal. For many years, it was a pack a day. Then, as I got older, it drifted up to perhaps a pack and a half. Now… well, now it varies. Some days less, some days… more. I mostly smoke these days while having my tea, or after a meal. It's become quite a habit, as you might imagine. I’ve tried to cut down a few times, but… it’s difficult. Very difficult.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Knoch. That’s a significant smoking history, and it’s understandable that it’s been difficult to quit. It sounds like it’s very ingrained in your routine. Just to clarify, when you say “now,” roughly how many cigarettes would you say you smoke in a typical day?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, a good question. “Now” is… unpredictable. But if I had to give a number, I would say… perhaps fifteen to twenty cigarettes on a typical day. Some days fewer, maybe ten. Other days, if I am feeling… unsettled, perhaps twenty-five. It truly depends. I do not smoke as much when the weather is poor, though. I prefer to sit outside with my tea when I smoke, you see. It’s more enjoyable then.
DOCTOR: Okay, fifteen to twenty cigarettes a day, with some variation. And you’ve noticed it’s linked to your routine and your mood, particularly when you're feeling unsettled. That's helpful information. Have you experienced any symptoms related to your smoking, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. Mostly… a cough. A persistent cough, especially in the mornings. It’s not terrible, but it is… annoying. And I get… short of breath sometimes, particularly when I climb stairs. It wasn’t so bad when I was younger, but now… it is noticeable. And, I must confess, sometimes I feel a tightness in my chest. It comes and goes, but it is there. I haven't spoken to anyone about it, I just assumed it was… old age. Perhaps I was wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, a persistent cough, especially in the mornings, shortness of breath with exertion, and occasional chest tightness. Those are definitely symptoms we need to address. It's good you're telling me about them. Now, aside from these symptoms, have you had any other health concerns?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I have some… arthritis in my hands. It’s not debilitating, but it makes certain things difficult, like opening jars, or… writing. I also had my gallbladder removed many years ago, perhaps twenty years ago now. Other than that… I believe I am reasonably healthy for my age. I do get tired more easily these days, but I attribute that to… well, to getting older, of course. I try to stay active, I walk in the park when the weather permits, but I tire quickly. And I have never been a fan of doctors, so I rarely bother them. Until now, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your hands and a gallbladder removal twenty years ago. And you've noticed some fatigue. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My father, he smoked as well, you see. He lived to be eighty-two, but he suffered a great deal in his later years. He had… problems with his lungs, I believe. My mother, she did not smoke. She lived to be ninety, quite a remarkable woman. She had high blood pressure, I recall. And my sister… she passed away when she was quite young, from an illness, I’m afraid. Not lung related. I don't believe there’s much else to report, to be honest. My family was… not particularly healthy, on the whole. A lot of aches and pains, mostly. And early deaths, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knoch. That gives me a better picture. So, a history of smoking in your father, and high blood pressure in your mother. Now, let’s talk a little about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do live alone. I never married, you see. I had… opportunities, but I was always rather focused on my work. I suppose I dedicated too much of my life to it. Now, I live in a small apartment, thankfully it is quiet. I have a few acquaintances, but no close friends, I’m afraid. I enjoy my own company, mostly. I read a great deal, and I listen to the radio. And, as I mentioned before, I enjoy my tea… with a cigarette, of course. I do have a neighbour, Mrs. Petrova, she is a very kind woman, she checks on me from time to time. But mostly, I keep to myself.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knoch. That’s helpful to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I have never had any allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I have never had a reaction to any medication I have taken. I have taken very little medication in my life, to be honest. A painkiller for my arthritis from time to time, but that is all. And I remember a course of antibiotics when I was a young man, but I don’t recall any problems with that either. I am quite fortunate, in that regard. Is that all the questions you have, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Excellent. That completes my initial questions, Mr. Knoch. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re agreeable. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your throat. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall health and assess the impact of your smoking. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I understand it is necessary. Please, proceed. I am not particularly fond of doctors, as I have mentioned, but I am willing to cooperate. I trust your judgement. I will do my best to remain still. Just… try to be quick, if you would be so kind?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knoch. I'll do my best to be as quick and comfortable as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Your heart sounds regular, but I am hearing some… diminished breath sounds, especially at the bases of both lungs, and some mild wheezing. Your throat looks clear. I also notice some swelling and mild tenderness in the joints of your hands, consistent with arthritis. Based on what you've told me and what I've heard during the exam, your smoking has likely contributed to some lung changes, and it's also important to manage your elevated blood pressure and arthritis. We should also consider further testing to assess the extent of the lung changes. Would you be agreeable to a chest X-ray and a blood test?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If you believe it is necessary, then I trust your judgement. A chest X-ray and a blood test… certainly. I would prefer to know what is happening, rather than remain in the dark. I understand that it is all part of the process. And, if you think it is necessary to get a clear picture, then I am willing to cooperate. Just… let me know what is involved. I am not a fan of hospitals, you see. Are these tests easily available?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Knoch. They are readily available. The chest X-ray is a quick and painless imaging test that allows us to visualize your lungs. It doesn’t involve any radiation exposure of significant concern. The blood test will help us assess your overall health, including your kidney function and any potential inflammation. We can arrange both tests to be done here at the clinic, in the lab just down the hall. It should take about an hour or so total, including waiting and the tests themselves. While we wait for the results, let’s talk about options for quitting smoking. Have you ever used any aids to help you quit, such as nicotine patches, gum, or medication?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have never used any such aids. I have always tried to quit… cold turkey, you see. I simply… stopped. But it never lasted very long. I would manage a few hours, perhaps a day, but then… the craving would return, and I would find myself reaching for another cigarette. I have a strong will, or so I thought, but it seems this habit is stronger. I have heard of these patches and gums, but I have never tried them. They sound… complicated, frankly. And I am rather hesitant to take any medication, if I can avoid it. But I am willing to listen to your advice, Doctor. What would you recommend?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Knoch. Quitting smoking is incredibly difficult, and trying to do it alone is often the hardest approach. There are several options available, and we can tailor a plan to fit your preferences. Nicotine replacement therapy – the patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays – can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms by providing controlled doses of nicotine without the harmful chemicals in cigarettes. Medication like bupropion or varenicline can also help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and have been shown to be quite effective. Another option is behavioral therapy, which can provide you with coping strategies and support to overcome your habit. We have a smoking cessation counselor here at the clinic who could provide valuable assistance. Given your history and concerns, I would recommend starting with a combination of nicotine patches to manage the physical cravings, and scheduling a session with our counselor to discuss behavioral strategies. We can also consider medication if the patches aren't sufficient. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: That… sounds rather sensible, actually. The patches… I suppose they are less intrusive than medication. And the counselor… yes, perhaps someone to talk to would be helpful. I have always been a rather solitary person, and I rarely share my problems with others. But I can see the benefit of having someone to guide me through this process. So, the patches and the counselor… yes, let us start with that. And if it proves insufficient, then we can discuss medication. Is that possible, Doctor? To try the patches and the counselor first? And what about the X-ray and the blood test? When will the results be available?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Knoch. That's a perfectly reasonable approach. We can get you started on the nicotine patches today, and I'll schedule an appointment with our smoking cessation counselor for you as soon as possible – likely within the next few days. Regarding the X-ray and blood test, the results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available to discuss them and formulate a more comprehensive plan. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for the nicotine patches and give you some information about our smoking cessation program. Please let the front desk know you’d like to schedule an appointment with the counselor before you leave. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have covered everything quite thoroughly. You have been most helpful, and I am grateful for your patience. I will speak to the front desk about the counselor. And I will await your call regarding the X-ray and blood test. Perhaps… perhaps this will finally be the end of it. It seems a long road, but I am willing to try. Thank you again, Doctor Dashevsky. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knoch. It takes courage to take this step, and I have every confidence you can succeed. Remember, I’m here to support you throughout this process. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Knoch. And please, take care of yourself.
