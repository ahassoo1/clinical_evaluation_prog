DOCTOR: Hi Tammie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now, I suppose. Not a serious pain, you understand, but… bothersome. I just want to get this over with quickly, if we could.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Bothersome” is good to know – we’ll figure out what’s going on. When you say “a little while now,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I am terrible with dates. Maybe… a week? Or two? It all blurs together, you see. Since… well, since Harold passed. Things aren’t as… clear anymore. It's just a scratchy feeling, really. Not like a proper sickness.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about Harold. It’s completely understandable that things feel a bit off right now. A week or two of scratchiness is helpful to know. And it's good you're getting it checked out. Could you describe the scratchiness a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What is there to describe? It… feels rough. Like sandpaper, almost. Especially when I swallow. And it’s worse in the mornings. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t understand why we’re going into such detail about a little throat scratch. It's not like it’s life-threatening. Are you sure you can’t just give me something for it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie, and I apologize if I'm being too detailed. It probably isn't anything serious, but asking questions helps me rule things out and make sure we get you the right treatment. It’s good that it’s worse in the mornings. When you swallow, is it painful, or just uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Painful! Of course it's painful. Not excruciating, mind you. But definitely… unpleasant. It feels like something is stuck, and I have to force it down. And sometimes… sometimes my ears ache a little with it. But again, it's nothing dramatic. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Okay, painful swallowing and ear ache along with the scratchiness. That gives me a little more to work with. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches with this?
PATIENT: Fever? Goodness, no. I don’t do fevers. I’m a very healthy woman, despite… everything. Chills? No. Body aches? Certainly not. It’s just my throat. A simple throat irritation. Are you going to examine it or just keep asking questions? This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: You're right, let's take a look. If you could just open wide and say "ah," that would be great. I'm just going to shine a light in your throat and take a quick peek.
PATIENT: There. Get it over with. Honestly, I haven’t felt this uncomfortable since… well, never mind. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Okay… I see some mild redness in the back of your throat, and your tonsils are a little swollen. No white spots or pus that I can see right now. Your ears look clear. Hmm… Have you had any cough, runny nose, or congestion with this?
PATIENT: A little sniffle, maybe. But nothing to speak of! I don't do 'colds'. I haven't been sick in years. It's just... this throat. I’m telling you, Doctor, it’s a minor irritation. Please, let's just get something for it and be done. I have errands to run. Are you absolutely certain you can't just prescribe something?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant cough, runny nose or congestion. And you haven't been feeling generally unwell – no body aches or fever. It does sound like it could be a mild irritation, potentially viral. However, given the pain with swallowing, even if it’s not severe, and the fact that it's been going on for a week or two, I'd like to rule out strep throat just to be safe. It's a quick test. Would you be okay with a rapid strep test?
PATIENT: Strep? Honestly, Doctor, you're going to stick a swab down my throat for this? It sounds… unpleasant. I suppose if you insist. But if it's negative, I want something for the pain immediately. I don’t have time to be sick, even with a minor irritation. Hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: It's a quick swab, and it doesn't usually hurt too much. It’ll give us peace of mind. Just open wide, and I’ll be very quick. Deep breath…
PATIENT: Get it over with. Honestly, you young doctors and your… procedures. It wasn’t like this in my day.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. It’ll take about 5-10 minutes to get the results. In the meantime, let's talk about some things you can do at home to help relieve the pain while we wait. Have you been drinking plenty of fluids?
PATIENT: Fluids? Of course I drink fluids. Water, mostly. I'm not a fool. Is there anything else I should be doing, or are we just going to sit here and talk about obvious things while my throat aches? Honestly, I am losing patience. .
