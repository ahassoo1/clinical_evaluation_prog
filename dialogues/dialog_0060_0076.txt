DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs, see? They’re really bothering me. On my shins, mostly. Red and… kinda hard. Been there a little while now, and they hurt. Not all the time, but especially when I’m walking.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Bumps on your shins, you say. And they’re painful, particularly with walking. Alright. How long exactly have they been there, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… maybe three, four months now? Started small, I didn’t pay much attention at first. Thought it was just a bruise or something from work. I do a lot of lifting, you know? But they haven’t gone away, and they’re getting… well, more noticeable. And more sore.
DOCTOR: Three to four months… and getting more noticeable and sore. Okay. And what sort of lifting do you do at work, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Mostly boxes, Doctor. Different sizes, different weights. Nothing too heavy, but it adds up over the day, you know? I'm a mover, so… everything from furniture to, uh, appliances. And sometimes we have to carry things up and down stairs. It’s a physical job. I've been doing it a long time though, so I thought I was used to it!
DOCTOR: Right, a mover. A very physical job indeed. Have you noticed any other changes to your legs, besides these bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Not really, I don’t think so. Maybe a little swelling sometimes, especially at the end of the day, but I figured that was just from being on my feet so long. Nothing major. No changes in color, no itching, no… uh… pus or anything like that. Just the bumps and the pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, no itching, no pus, just the bumps and pain. And have you tried anything to treat them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. I put some ointment on them, you know, like for bruises. Didn't really do much. And I tried wrapping them with bandages, but that just made them uncomfortable when I was walking. I figured it was best to come see a doctor, honestly. I'm not good at guessing what things are.
DOCTOR: Sensible. Alright, Mr. Aluia, I'm going to take a look at these bumps now, if that's alright with you. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. No problem. Go ahead, take a look. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see them. Several raised, firm nodules on both shins. They are tender to the touch. No warmth or redness extending beyond the nodules themselves. Skin appears otherwise normal. They do appear to be quite hard. Mr. Aluia, have you had any recent injuries to your legs, even minor ones you might not have thought much of?
PATIENT: Injuries? Not that I recall, Doctor. Maybe a few little bumps and scrapes over the years, working, but nothing serious. Nothing that needed a doctor. I'm pretty careful, you know? I try to be, anyway. I’ve definitely knocked my shins on things a few times, but that’s just part of the job. I don’t remember anything specific, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms at all, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, no chills. No pain anywhere else. No… uh… I haven't lost any weight, and I'm eating okay. My wife makes sure of that! No problems with my feet, other than being tired at the end of the day. Honestly, Doctor, that’s about it. Just these bumps and the pain. It’s just… worrying me a little bit. They just don’t seem to be going away.
DOCTOR: Right. No fever, no weight loss, no other pain. Just the persistent bumps and discomfort. Mr. Aluia, given your occupation and the nature of these nodules, my initial thought is that these are likely shin splints with some associated inflammation. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a simple blood test to check your inflammatory markers. Just to be certain. It's standard procedure, really. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Shin splints? Inflammation? I’ve never had shin splints before, but… yeah, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. If it helps figure out what's going on, that's good. Blood test sounds fine. I don’t mind that at all. What do I have to do?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write you a lab requisition. You'll need to go to the lab down the hall – they take walk-ins. Just tell them Dr. Nooruddin sent you. It's a standard blood draw, nothing too complicated. It should take about fifteen minutes, and the results usually come back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible, avoiding strenuous activity, and applying ice packs to the affected areas for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can also help manage the pain. Do you have any questions about that, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Rest, ice, pain relievers… yeah, that sounds doable. I can manage that. Ibuprofen, naproxen… I think we have some ibuprofen at home. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now, Doctor. Just… hopefully, it’s not anything too serious. When will I get the results? You said 24-48 hours? Will you call me?
DOCTOR: Yes, 24-48 hours. My office will call you with the results. If anything concerning shows up, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss it further. Otherwise, if the results are normal, you can continue with the rest and ice. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of, anyway. My wife always asks me that before I take anything new, and she’d definitely remember if I had one! She’s pretty good at keeping track of things like that. Just a little bit of a worrywart, she is. But it’s good, you know? Makes sure I take care of myself.
DOCTOR: That’s… good. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. Nothing else. My wife says I need to make sure I get enough vitamins, especially now that I’m getting older. She gets them delivered every month. That’s it. No prescriptions, no anything else. Pretty healthy, I think, for my age. Apart from these bumps, of course!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia. So, to recap: no allergies, just a multivitamin, and these bumps on your shins. We’ve ordered a blood test to rule out any underlying inflammation. In the meantime, rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Do you have any further questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you for taking the time to look at them. I appreciate it. I’ll go get the blood test done and wait for the call. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Thank you again, Doctor Nooruddin.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get the blood test done as soon as possible. And if the pain worsens significantly, or you develop a fever, don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. Have a good day, Mr. Aluia.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Will do. Thank you. Have a good day too.
