DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Bakan, you said? Yes… well, it’s… the waterworks, really. Been a bother. A long bother, if I’m honest. I keep getting… infections, down there. It’s quite unpleasant, you understand. I just want it fixed, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that certainly does make sense, Ms. Wease. Recurring urinary infections can be very disruptive. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about these infections?
PATIENT: Oh dear. More… details? It’s just… they come and go. Burning when I… go to the toilet. And a pain, low down. It’s hard to explain… it feels like a constant ache, sometimes. And I have to go so often. I… I don’t remember exactly when it started, truthfully. A while ago. A long while. Is this going to take long, Doctor? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Wease. We’ll take our time and gather the information we need. It’s important to understand the full picture. You mentioned burning with urination, pain low down, and frequent trips to the toilet. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go with the urge to urinate?
PATIENT: Oh… comes and goes, I think. Mostly when I have to go. It’s… hard to be certain, you know? My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s a dull ache most of the time, just… there. But when I feel the need… it’s sharper. And I do try to drink lots of water, Doctor. I really do. Does that make sense? I just… want to be rid of it. It’s terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Wease, and you're doing the right thing by staying hydrated. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any fever or chills accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I don’t think so. Not that I recall. It’s been a while, you see. Fever… sometimes I feel a bit warm, but I put that down to the weather, mostly. It’s been so hot lately! Chills… no, I don’t think so. I'm not usually cold. Honestly, Doctor, I’m just tired of it all. It’s a constant worry, if I’m being truthful. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: We are indeed, Ms. Wease. Every piece of information helps. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s… a long time ago now. Let me think… I had my gallbladder removed, years and years ago. And… I think I had high blood pressure, once. But it was managed with… pills, I think. I don’t take anything regularly now. And… no, nothing else comes to mind. I was divorced, a long time ago. Does that count? I'm not insured, if that's important. It's all very confusing, honestly. I don't remember details well. Are we… finished soon?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Wease. We'll take our time. Your divorce doesn't directly relate to your current concerns, but thank you for sharing. And knowing you are uninsured is important, as we’ll discuss options accordingly. Now, regarding your past medical history, do you recall approximately when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That was… a very long time ago. Maybe… thirty years ago? Or more? It was after my divorce, certainly. I remember it being… unpleasant. I was in the hospital for a few days. But the exact year… no, I couldn’t tell you. I really can’t. It feels like a lifetime ago. Are we… getting closer to a solution, Doctor? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Ms. Wease. It's alright if you don't recall exact dates; approximations are helpful. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you have any family history of kidney problems, bladder issues, or frequent urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh… family. My mother… she had problems with her waterworks when she got older, I think. She was always complaining. But it was a long time ago, and I don't recall the specifics. My brother… he was always healthy, as far as I know. No… I don’t think anyone else had similar issues. Honestly, Doctor, I didn’t pay much attention to those things. I just… want this sorted. I’m tired of feeling unwell. Is there a test we can do?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wease, there is. A urine test – a urinalysis – would be a good starting point. It can help us determine if you have an infection and identify the type of bacteria causing it. We can also do a urine culture to confirm the results and guide treatment. Before we proceed with the test, may I ask about any allergies you have to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any problems with medication in the past. Though, as I said, I don’t take anything regularly. Honestly, Doctor, I just want this over with. A test sounds… good. Anything to get this sorted. Are you sure you can help me? I’ve been to doctors before, and they haven’t been able to fix it. It’s been a long struggle.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wease, and I assure you I will do my best to help. Many things can cause recurring urinary tract infections, and it’s important to identify the underlying cause. Now, let’s proceed with the urine test. I'll have the nurse prepare a sample cup for you. Please try to collect a midstream sample – that means you start urinating, then collect a sample mid-way through. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh… midstream? That sounds… complicated. I’m not sure I understand. I just… go to the toilet, normally? Will the nurse explain? I’m not very good with instructions, you see. And… will it hurt? I always worry about things hurting. Honestly, Doctor, I just want this over with. Please just tell me what to do, simply. And quickly, if you don’t mind. I have… appointments later.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. It’s quite simple. You start urinating as you normally would, and then, without stopping the flow, collect a sample in the cup. That helps to get a cleaner sample. The nurse will explain it thoroughly and answer any questions you have. It shouldn’t hurt at all – it’s just a normal urination. I'll have the nurse come in with the cup right away. While she prepares that, let me just quickly examine your abdomen, to see if there's any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… examine my abdomen? That sounds… invasive. Is it necessary? I don't like being touched. Honestly, Doctor, I'm getting a little anxious now. I just want the test. Can’t we just do the test? I'm not sure I want someone poking around. I'm… a bit sensitive. Perhaps we could skip that part? I'm not feeling very well, and I just want to get this over with. Please?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I completely understand your anxiety, and we can absolutely skip the abdominal exam. Your comfort is my priority. We can proceed directly with the urine test. I apologize if I made you feel uncomfortable. I'll have the nurse come in with the cup immediately. Just let me know if you have any questions or need anything at all. It's important to me that you feel as comfortable as possible throughout this process.
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I appreciate that. Yes, just the test would be… wonderful. Honestly, I’m just relieved we can skip the poking. I'm a bit of a worrier, you see. I just want this sorted. Please just tell me when the nurse is ready. And… thank you again for being so understanding. I’m… ready when you are.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wease. I’m happy to accommodate your needs. I'll let the nurse know you’re ready. She should be in shortly with the sample cup and instructions. Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or concerns while you're waiting. I'll be just outside, reviewing your chart. We’ll get this sorted, Ms. Wease.
