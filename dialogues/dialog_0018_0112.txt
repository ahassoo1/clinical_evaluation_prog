DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s…rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom quite often, lately. More often than usual, certainly. I’m not entirely sure why… it just feels like I need to go all the time. It’s… disruptive, to say the least. I apologize for being vague; it’s difficult to explain properly.
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize at all, Ms. MacVittie. It's perfectly alright. These things happen, and it's important to discuss them. It takes courage to come in and talk about these matters, and I appreciate you doing so. “Quite often” is rather subjective, of course. Could you give me a rough estimate of how many times you find yourself needing to urinate in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is a good question. Let me see… it’s… more than eight times, I believe. Perhaps ten? It's difficult to be precise. Before, it was usually… six, maybe? And now it seems like I barely finish one cup of tea before I need to go again. It’s mostly during the day, though. Nighttime isn't too bad, thankfully. I do apologize for the imprecision, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. MacVittie. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Ten times a day is certainly a change from six. And it’s helpful to know nighttime isn’t affected. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the frequent urination?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think. No… not really. I haven't noticed any pain, thankfully. No burning sensation or anything unpleasant like that. Just… the constant need to go. Occasionally, I feel a little… incomplete, like I haven’t quite emptied my bladder, but it’s not severe. And perhaps a little more tired than usual, but that could be…well, everything, really. I truly don’t recall anything else that seems relevant. Is there anything specific I should be looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. MacVittie. The feeling of incomplete emptying is something we should definitely consider. And, as you mentioned, the increased fatigue. Now, let’s move onto some more general questions. Have you noticed any changes in your thirst lately?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I don’t know, actually. I drink tea throughout the day, as you know, and water with meals. Perhaps I’m drinking a little more water than usual, but I haven't been consciously keeping track. It could be the weather, really. It's been rather warm lately, and I always drink more when it's hot. I am terribly sorry for being so vague, Doctor. I wish I could be of more assistance.
DOCTOR: You are providing me with valuable information, Ms. MacVittie. Don’t apologize. It's perfectly normal to not be certain about these details. Increased fluid intake with warmer weather is certainly plausible. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a bit difficult. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I was divorced a few years back, and the stress of that… well, it wasn’t good. I haven’t been to the doctor in quite some time, I’m afraid. I tend to avoid it, if I’m honest. I don’t… I don’t recall any major illnesses or operations. I’m not insured, so I mostly try to handle things myself. I wish I could be more helpful, but my memory is… patchy, at best.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. MacVittie. It’s perfectly alright. Avoiding medical care due to financial constraints and a reluctance to seek help are unfortunately common. And it’s completely understandable that past stressors might affect your recall. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. I occasionally take a paracetamol for headaches, but that’s it. Nothing regular. I used to take something for my… well, for anxiety, but that was years ago, before the divorce. I stopped taking it a long time ago, and I can’t even recall the name of it now. I truly try to avoid medication whenever possible, Doctor. I prefer natural remedies, if I can. Mostly just tea and rest. But honestly, I’m not taking anything currently, as far as I know. It’s difficult to be certain, with my memory being what it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MacVittie. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, or grandparents—who have experienced any medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. My mother passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t really know much about her medical history. She… she wasn't very forthcoming, if I recall correctly. My father was relatively healthy, I believe, although he did have some problems with his… his heart, towards the end. And my grandmother… she had something with her bladder, I think. Perhaps an infection? It was a long time ago, and I was quite young. I don’t recall the details, unfortunately. I wish I could be of more assistance, Doctor, but my memory is so patchy. It’s terribly frustrating, both for you and for me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. MacVittie. You’ve provided me with valuable information. It’s not uncommon to have limited knowledge of family history, especially with passing time and limited communication. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if you are comfortable with that. I’ll need to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. And, of course, I'll need to perform a simple urine test to help determine the cause of your frequent urination. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. I suppose it’s necessary, if you think it will help. I’m not particularly fond of examinations, if I’m honest, but I trust your judgement, Doctor. The urine test… will it be uncomfortable? I apologize for asking, but I’ve always been a little… squeamish. I’ll do whatever is necessary to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Not at all uncomfortable, Ms. MacVittie. It’s a very straightforward procedure—simply providing a sample in a sterile cup. I’ll provide you with detailed instructions and ensure your privacy. First, let’s check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 78 beats per minute, and temperature is 98.6°F. Everything appears within normal limits. Now, if you'll excuse me for a moment, I’ll prepare the materials for the urine sample. I’ll leave you some privacy in the restroom, and I’ll be right outside when you are finished. Please let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That sounds… manageable. I’ll be as quick as possible. Please, just let me know if you require anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. MacVittie. I’ll send this off to the lab for analysis, which should take a few days. The initial dipstick analysis shows no evidence of infection—no white blood cells or nitrites present. Glucose levels are within the normal range. However, there is a small amount of protein detected. Now, let's listen to your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t detect any masses or abnormalities. Bowel sounds are present and normal. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not pain exactly… more of a… pressure, perhaps? A dull ache, if I’m honest. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. Mostly when I feel the… urgency. When I need to go frequently. Is that… normal, Doctor? Is it something serious? I apologize for my anxieties, I’m just… prone to worrying.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, Ms. MacVittie. It's good you're expressing your concerns. The mild pressure you’re experiencing, coinciding with the urgency, is something we should investigate further. The small amount of protein detected in your urine is also something to address. Based on your symptoms – frequent urination, feeling of incomplete emptying, mild fatigue, slight abdominal pressure, and the small amount of protein in your urine – several possibilities come to mind. One potential cause is an overactive bladder. Another could be a mild urinary tract irritation, despite the initial dipstick analysis being negative. Less likely, but something we need to rule out, is a kidney issue. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis with a microscopic examination to check for any hidden signs of infection or abnormalities. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Whatever is necessary to find out what’s happening, Doctor. I’d prefer to know, even if the news isn’t good. A complete blood count… and a comprehensive metabolic panel… and a urinalysis… Will those tests be… expensive? I apologize for bringing it up, but as you know, I don’t have insurance. I’m worried about the cost. I’ll do whatever is necessary, of course, but I need to be aware of the financial implications.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. MacVittie, and I commend you for bringing it up. I understand that the cost of medical care can be a significant burden, especially without insurance. Let me explain the costs as clearly as possible. A complete blood count typically costs around $20-$50. The comprehensive metabolic panel is usually around $40-$80. And the urinalysis with microscopic examination will be approximately $30-$60. These are estimated prices and can vary slightly depending on the lab. I also want to assure you that I will do everything I can to help. We can discuss potential payment options or explore resources in the area that may offer financial assistance. I can also write a request for a reduced bill if necessary. I don’t want financial concerns to prevent you from getting the care you need. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the tests, and then we can discuss payment options in detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Proceed with the tests. I trust your judgement, Doctor, and I need to know what’s happening. Financial assistance… that would be wonderful. Even a reduced bill would be a tremendous help. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll do whatever is necessary to cover the costs, and I’m grateful for your willingness to help. So, the tests… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. I’m happy to help in any way I can. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I’ll call you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend drinking 6-8 glasses of water a day, unless you have any medical conditions that restrict fluid intake. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate your bladder. And try to urinate whenever you feel the urge, rather than holding it in. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly, Doctor. The water, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and urinate when needed… I can manage that. Thank you again, Doctor Stilaire. I’m truly grateful for your kindness and patience. I'll await your call. And please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen before your follow-up appointment. I'll be in touch soon with the lab results. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Have a good day. .
