DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor Pitmon. It's nice to meet you. Well, it's this itch, you see. Just… driving me crazy. It's all over, really. Not painful, just… persistently itchy. Been going on for a little while now, maybe a couple of weeks? I'm not sure exactly. It's hard to keep track sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, alright. And “all over”… can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started on my arms, I think. The insides of my elbows, mostly. Then it spread to my legs, kinda like little bumps, but not always. Sometimes it's just… a dry, scratchy feeling. And now… well, it seems to be everywhere. Even on my back, which is hard to reach! My daughter tried to help, but even she couldn't get back there very well. It's just… annoying. Really annoying.
DOCTOR: “Annoying” is one way to put it. Alright. And have you noticed anything specifically that makes it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… You know, I haven't really noticed anything specific. I've been trying different lotions, you know, the kind for dry skin. Doesn’t seem to help much, to be honest. I used a new laundry detergent a while back, maybe around the same time it started? But I switched back to my old one, and it didn’t get better. I really don't know, Doctor. That's why I came in. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any other symptoms alongside the itching?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, not really. I mean, I'm my age, you know? A little achy sometimes, but that's just getting old. No fever, no rash exactly, like I said, just… bumps sometimes, and mostly just the itch. I sleep alright, eat alright… I guess I feel okay, besides this constant scratching! It's just… distracting. And I’m worried it’s something serious, you know? Getting older makes you think about things like that.
DOCTOR: Well, “something serious” is… unlikely. But we'll take a look. Let’s do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I appreciate you taking a look. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you don’t mind, I’m going to need you to go ahead and remove your sweater and bra, and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs first, then take a look at your skin. I'll need to examine your back as well, so you may need to bend forward a bit. We’ll just get everything checked out, alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, my. Well… alright. I suppose so. It's just… I haven't… done that in a long time. But if that's what you need to see, then okay. Just… let me know when you're ready. And maybe… could my daughter come in for a moment? Just for… company? I didn’t realize it would be so… thorough.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cassimatis, with all due respect, this is a medical exam. Your daughter is not required, and frankly, having another person in the room complicates things. We can certainly proceed with the examination, or we can reschedule if you’re uncomfortable. But I assure you, this is standard procedure. We need to see the affected areas to properly assess the situation. We're trying to figure out what's going on with your skin, and I can’t do that without a proper examination.
PATIENT: You're right, Doctor. You're absolutely right. It’s just… I get flustered easily these days. And I haven't… been to the doctor in a while. I apologize. No, you're right, my daughter doesn't need to be here. It’s just me. Alright. Let's… let's just get it done. I'll take off my sweater. Just… please be gentle? It's been a long day already.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll lie down on the table face down, we'll start with your back. I will auscultate your lungs first and then palpate your back for any abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. We'll move quickly.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’m ready. Just… let me know what you're doing, if you don't mind? It helps me relax. And yes… my back is a little tender. Especially on the left side. It's been bothering me on and off for months, actually. But I never really mentioned it to anyone. It just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me. And again. Your lungs sound clear. I'm feeling some muscle tension on your left side, as you mentioned. It’s not…remarkable. Any pain radiating down your leg?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain in my leg. Just the tightness in my back. It feels… like a knot, almost. And sometimes it's just a dull ache. It doesn't really shoot down my leg or anything. It's just… uncomfortable. Like I need a good massage, you know? Is there anything else you're feeling? Anything I should be telling you? I always worry I'm forgetting something. Ooh, that's a little sore. Right there.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your arms… some dry skin, as you mentioned, but no obvious rash. No excoriations. A few scattered age spots, which is… normal. I'm not seeing anything particularly concerning. Now, let me take a look at your legs.
PATIENT: Doctor? You haven’t… asked much about the itching. Does that mean it’s not important? Or… is it something you can’t see? It's just… it’s so uncomfortable. It feels like tiny little bugs crawling all over me sometimes. And it’s been getting worse, even though it doesn't look that bad. I just… I’m worried it’s something serious, you know? Like… something inside?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cassimatis, with all due respect, you’ve been describing a generalized itch, and frankly, it’s… common. Dry skin, age, stress… there are a multitude of reasons why someone might experience an itch. You’re focusing on what isn’t there—no rash, no lesions, no obvious signs of anything serious. We’ve ruled out anything immediate, and you are otherwise in stable condition. It is unlikely to be “something inside,” as you put it. I recommend a good moisturizer, and if it persists, an over-the-counter antihistamine.
PATIENT: But… you haven’t even looked closely. You haven't asked about… anything personal. Like my laundry detergent, or what kind of soap I use. Or if I'm stressed… which, yes, I am, now! I just… I feel like you’re not listening to me. And I’m worried. I just want to know what’s wrong, and you’re telling me it’s nothing when I feel like it is something. Couldn't you… just run one more test? Just to be sure? Or maybe… refer me to someone else? Someone who will… listen? I don’t want to be dismissed. I just want to feel better.
