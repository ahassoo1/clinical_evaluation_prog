DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Shaub. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Overgaard. Thank you for seeing me. I… well, I asked to come in for an HIV test. I wanted to get checked, just to be sure, you understand. It's a… a personal matter, but I thought it best to know.
DOCTOR: Right. “Just to be sure.” Well, that’s… sensible, I suppose. Though frankly, at your age, it’s a rather unlikely concern. Still. We'll proceed. Have you had any… exposure to anything that would necessitate this test?
PATIENT: Exposure? Doctor, I’ve been married for forty years. A very long forty years! My husband and I… we’ve always been careful. But… one never knows, does one? There’s a lot of things going around, and I read things in the paper… It’s better to be safe than sorry, I always say. I haven’t… been with anyone else, if that's what you mean. But I wanted a test, regardless.
DOCTOR: Forty years. Yes, well. Long-term monogamy does reduce the risk, naturally. Though, as you say, one can never be entirely certain. And the newspapers… they exaggerate everything. Still. We'll do the test. Have you ever had one before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. This is… a first for me. I always thought… well, I suppose I always thought I wouldn’t need one. But things change, don’t they? I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. What does it involve? Is it… painful? And how long before I get the results?
DOCTOR: Nervousness is understandable. It’s a simple blood draw, Mrs. Shaub. Not painful, though you may feel a brief pinch. Standard procedure. We send it to the lab, and typically results are back within five to seven business days. Now, before we proceed with the bloodwork, let’s get a bit of your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that’s all. A small dose, prescribed by my previous doctor, Dr. Adebayo. He retired last year, you see. A very good man. But… no allergies. And I’ve never been seriously ill, thankfully. Just the usual colds and flu, like everyone else. Nothing that required a hospital stay.
DOCTOR: Very good. And this blood pressure medication… what’s the name of it?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a small white pill. Oh dear, my memory isn't what it used to be. It begins with an 'A', I believe. Amlodipine, perhaps? Yes, that sounds right. Amlodipine. Five milligrams, taken every morning. I keep it right here in my handbag, if you’d like to see the bottle.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes. Quite common. Alright. Now, let’s move on to family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she had high blood pressure, like me. And she passed away from a stroke, when I was quite young. Perhaps in her seventies. And my father… he had diabetes, but it was well-managed. He lived a long life, thankfully. My sister is healthy as a horse, if you ask me, but she doesn’t talk to me much anymore. A long story. Nothing else springs to mind, Doctor. We didn't have much in the way of serious illness in our family, really. Mostly just old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your husband?
PATIENT: My husband, Charles? He’s… he’s a bit frail these days, but otherwise healthy. He has some arthritis in his knees, which slows him down, but he’s still very sharp, mentally. No major illnesses, thankfully. He’s always been a strong man, my Charles. He watches his diet and gets a little exercise when he can. He's… he's very good to me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's a brief overview of your medical history. Now, before we proceed with the blood draw, I'm going to need to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that’s all. And recreational drugs? Heavens no! I was raised properly, Doctor. My husband and I are… very respectable people. We go to church every Sunday. We wouldn't dream of such things.
DOCTOR: Very good. Just standard procedure, Mrs. Shaub. Now, let’s get this blood draw done. Nurse Fatima will be in shortly to take a sample. It will only take a few minutes. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Just… just hoping everything will be alright, you understand. It's silly, I know. But one does worry, doesn't one? Is there anything… anything I should be aware of while I’m waiting for the results? Any symptoms I should look out for? I'm not sure what to expect.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Shaub, the likelihood of a positive result is extremely low, given your history. However, if you experience any unexplained fever, fatigue, or swollen lymph nodes, consult a physician immediately. But frankly, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. Nurse Fatima will be with you momentarily. She'll explain the process and answer any further questions you may have. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your time. And… thank you for being honest with me. I’ll… I’ll wait for the nurse. I do hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll do our best. .
