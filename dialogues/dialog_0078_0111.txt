DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Frankly, I haven’t much time for pleasantries. It’s this… discoloration. My skin, you see. And the fatigue. It’s quite bothersome, and my wife insisted I come. Though I fail to see the point, honestly. It’s probably just old age.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. We’ll get right to it then. Could you tell me more about this discoloration?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… darker. My hands, mostly. And my face, I suppose. It wasn't like this before, naturally. It’s a gradual thing, you understand. I work with iron, reinforcing bars… quite a strenuous profession, even at my age. Though I’ve been doing it a long time. Decades, really. It’s… difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started. It just is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the discoloration is primarily on your hands and face, and you've noticed it gradually over time. You also mentioned working with iron. Is the discoloration a uniform darkening, or are there specific patches or areas that are more affected than others?
PATIENT: Patches, you say? Hmm. I hadn't considered… patches. No, I wouldn't say patches exactly. It’s… more consistent on the backs of my hands, I think. And around my knuckles. My wife does complain about my face looking… “shadowy”, as she puts it. Women and their dramatics. It’s a general dullness, more than anything. A sort of… greying. Is that helpful? Honestly, I don't pay much attention to such things.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. A general dullness and greying, more prominent on the backs of your hands and knuckles, and your wife has noticed it on your face. Has this discoloration been accompanied by any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What sort of changes are you referring to? My fatigue, of course. That’s why I'm here, isn't it? I tire easily, even with minimal exertion. A simple walk leaves me winded. And my hands… they ache sometimes. Not constantly, but frequently enough to be annoying. No… rashes, or… bleeding. Nothing like that. Just… tired and… discolored. It's all rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're experiencing fatigue and occasional aches in your hands along with the discoloration. And to clarify, the fatigue is new, or has it been developing gradually as well?
PATIENT: Gradually, naturally. Things don’t simply appear overnight, Doctor. It’s been… a slow decline, I suppose. Perhaps six months, maybe longer. It’s difficult to say precisely. My wife keeps track of these things; I certainly don’t. She’ll tell you, if you ask her. Though I doubt her memory is any better than mine. It’s just… less energy. And these aches. And now this… skin business. It’s all very tiresome.
DOCTOR: I understand. Six months or longer of gradual fatigue, hand aches, and now this discoloration. Do you notice the aches in your hands at any specific time of day, or after particular activities?
PATIENT: Specific times? No, Doctor, I don't keep a log of my aches and pains! They come and go as they please. Though, I suppose… they're worse after a long day at work. When I've been handling the iron all day, bending and twisting… then they really begin to throb. It’s the nature of the profession, I suppose. A man uses his hands, they get worn. It’s common sense. Honestly, I’m not sure why we’re discussing this in such detail. It's just… old age.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I appreciate you explaining this to me. While it could be related to age and your profession, it’s important to rule out other potential causes, even if it turns out to be something simple. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Good heavens, no. I've been a perfectly healthy man for eighty-five years, thank you very much. A few minor ailments here and there, a cold, the occasional flu… nothing serious enough to warrant a doctor's visit. I’ve always been strong, resilient. I’ve never been one to complain. No, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. And frankly, I’d be surprised if I ever am. A waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Drahota. And I appreciate your strength and resilience. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Really, Doctor? Are you suggesting I'm a fragile old man? No. Absolutely not. I've never had a surgery. A few stitches when I was a boy, climbing a tree and falling… but nothing that required a hospital stay. I've always been able to handle things myself. A bit of antiseptic, a bandage, and I was right as rain. No, no surgeries, no hospitalizations. It's a simple life, a healthy life. Or, was a healthy life… before this… discoloration. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite foolish sitting here.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I apologize if my questions feel unnecessary. I'm simply gathering information to ensure I have a complete picture of your health. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Doctor, I barely remember what I had for breakfast. Expecting me to recall the ailments of distant relatives is… preposterous. My parents… they lived long lives. Healthy lives, as far as I recall. My siblings… a few passed away in their old age. Standard things, I suppose. Heart trouble, a bit of arthritis… nothing remarkable. Honestly, it's all a blur. And frankly, I fail to see how any of this is relevant to my… darkening skin. It’s a waste of my time. And, if you don’t mind, I have an appointment I need to get to.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Drahota, and I apologize for pushing. Let's move on then. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I'm a man of simple habits, Doctor. I eat well, I work hard, and I avoid those… potions and pills as much as possible. A bit of ginseng occasionally, for a little energy boost… but that's it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, nothing regular. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. All those medications just have side effects, you know. I’d rather suffer a bit than risk becoming dependent on something. No, I take nothing. Absolutely nothing. This is getting quite ridiculous, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or other substances?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, Doctor, are you quite finished? I’ve lived eighty-five years without being allergic to anything, so I rather doubt I’ll start now. A bit of a stuffy nose during pollen season, perhaps, but nothing serious enough to warrant an… allergy test. No, I have no allergies. None. And if you'll excuse me, I really must be going. My time is valuable, and frankly, this interview is getting us nowhere.
