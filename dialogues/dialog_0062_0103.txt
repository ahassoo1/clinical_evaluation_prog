DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Vankampen, welcome. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back… it hurts. Lower back, mostly. Been hurting for a while now, but it’s getting worse, you see? Feels like… old wood creakin’. And the bones… they feel kinda weak, if that makes sense. It’s just not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, “old wood creakin’,” I understand. And you’re feeling some weakness in your bones as well. That's helpful to know. Let's talk about this back pain a little more specifically. When did it start, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, maybe six months ago? A little at a time, you know? Didn't pay much attention at first. Just thought I was getting old. But then… about two months ago it really started bothering me. Hard to stand for long, and lifting things… forget about it. Hurts too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it was a gradual onset about six months ago, but it’s significantly worse over the last two months. Standing and lifting are particularly difficult. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a sharp pain, Doctor. More of a… dull ache. Like someone’s sitting on my back. Sometimes it goes down my legs a little, but not always. And it's worse in the mornings. Really stiff, you see? Takes a while to get going.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, worse in the mornings with stiffness that improves as you move around, and sometimes radiating down your legs… okay. Does anything specifically make it better, or worse, besides moving?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. Laying down helps, you know? Flat on my back. But getting up from laying down… that's awful. Really hurts. And… sitting for too long is bad. Gotta keep movin’ a little, even if it hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, laying flat relieves it, but getting up is difficult, and prolonged sitting worsens it. You find staying active, even with some discomfort, is helpful. Now, I see here you're not currently covered by insurance. That's alright, we can work with that. Before we get into a physical exam, let's go over some general health questions. Have you had any other medical problems in the past, like diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin’ like that. Always been pretty healthy, I think. Had a bit of trouble with my stomach when I was younger, but that cleared up years ago. Never been told I had diabetes or anything serious. Just… old age pains, mostly. And a bad divorce, if that counts!
DOCTOR: Well, I’m glad to hear you’ve generally been healthy. We won't count the divorce! Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Never needed it, thank goodness. Always tried to avoid hospitals if I could. Not a fan, you see?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. Many people feel that way. Alright. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother, she had trouble with her hips when she got older. Real bad pain. And my brother… he had some problems with his back too, but I don’t remember exactly what. Something about a disc, I think? But he’s gone now, God rest his soul.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hip problems in your mother and some back issues, possibly a disc problem, in your brother. That's helpful to know. And just to finish up with the background information, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I used to be very active. Worked hard all my life, you see? Sold rugs, mostly. Lots of walking, lifting. But now… I mostly stay home. Read a lot. Watch TV. Don't get out much anymore. And I don't eat as good as I should. Too much sweets, not enough vegetables, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a previously active lifestyle with a physically demanding job, now more sedentary with a diet that could use some improvement. Alright, Mr. Vankampen. Now I think it would be good to do a quick physical exam. I just want to check your range of motion, feel your back, and do a few simple tests to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. Just be gentle, okay? Old bones, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. Okay, Mr. Vankampen, can you tell me if this is tender?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right there… that's sore. And a little bit to the left too. Feels… bruised, almost. But I haven't hit myself or anything. Just… always a little bit achy. But poking it like that… definitely sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, noted. And can you bend forward for me, just as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Ooh… that's… not good. Can’t go very far. It hurts right in the middle of my back. Feels like somethin' is gonna snap.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion with pain. Now, can you stand on your tiptoes, if you're able?
PATIENT: Oh… that's hard. Can't really do it. Feels… unsteady. And it makes my back hurt even more. Maybe I shouldn’t be doing this.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s enough for now. Don’t push yourself. Alright, Mr. Vankampen, based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing lower back pain, potentially with some muscle strain or a disc issue. The limitations in your range of motion and the discomfort with standing on your tiptoes are concerning. However, we need to rule out anything more serious. Given your age and symptoms, I’d like to order some X-rays of your lower back to get a better look at the bones and discs. We should also check your reflexes and sensation to make sure there’s no nerve involvement. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-rays… hmm. I don’t like radiation, Doctor. But… if you think it’s necessary, then okay. Gotta know what’s wrong, I guess. And checking my reflexes… okay, fine. Just be gentle, please. I’m an old man, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Vankampen. I understand your concerns about radiation, and we’ll use the lowest dose possible. And I promise to be very gentle with everything. Okay, I’m going to write an order for the X-rays. The radiology department is just down the hall. They’ll get you set up. After the X-rays, I’d like you to come back to the room, and we’ll do a quick neurological exam – check your reflexes and sensation. That will help us determine if there's any nerve compression. In the meantime, to help with the pain, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as long as you don't have any kidney problems or stomach ulcers. Also, applying heat or ice to your back can sometimes provide relief. Avoid any heavy lifting or bending for now. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… I think I have some of that at home. Okay, good. Heat or ice… I'll try both, see which one feels better. And no lifting… that’s no problem, I don't feel like lifting anything anyway! Just… how long will this take, Doctor? I don’t want to be here all day. And… will the X-rays show everything?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question. The X-rays shouldn't take too long – probably 15-20 minutes, including the wait time. And the neurological exam will be quick, maybe another 5-10 minutes. So, all in all, I'd estimate another 30 minutes or so. As for the X-rays, they’ll give us a good look at the bones and discs. They can help us identify things like fractures, arthritis, or disc degeneration. However, they don’t show everything. If the X-rays aren’t conclusive, we might need to consider further imaging, like an MRI, which gives us a more detailed picture of the soft tissues. But let’s start with the X-rays and see what they show. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. X-rays first, then maybe an MRI if needed. Okay. Sounds… reasonable. Alright, Doctor. Let's get these X-rays done. I just hope they don't find anything too bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Vankampen. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’m going to print out the X-ray order for you, and I’ll also have the nurse come in and give you some instructions on where to go and what to expect. In the meantime, do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies. Never had any trouble with medications. Just… sometimes I get a little bit of heartburn, but that’s all. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Alright, here's your X-ray order. The radiology department is down the hall, just past the waiting room. The nurse will be in shortly to escort you. Once you’re done with the X-rays, come straight back to the room, and we’ll proceed with the neurological exam. Please don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I'll try not to worry too much.
