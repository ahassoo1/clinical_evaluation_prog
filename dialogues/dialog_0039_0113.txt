DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Segretto. Welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Doctor… Kamahele, is it? Well, it's this… business with the waterworks, you see. Going a bit too often, if you catch my drift. It's a nuisance, really. Not a big deal, probably, but my wife, bless her heart, she insisted I come. Women, always fussing.
DOCTOR: It’s good of your wife to encourage you to come in. It’s always best to get these things checked out. "Waterworks," you say… meaning you're urinating frequently?
PATIENT: Frequently… yes, that’s a good way of putting it. All day, really. And sometimes at night, too. Wakes me up. Not every night, mind you, but enough to be bothersome. Used to be, I could sleep through anything. Now… not so much. It’s probably just old age creeping in, honestly. Everything goes with age, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It's true, things can change with age, but frequent urination can have several causes, so it's good we're looking into it. And waking up at night is something we definitely want to address. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradually getting worse over time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… gradual, I think. It’s hard to say exactly. Time… it all blurs together after a while, you know? But I'd say it started… maybe six months ago? Perhaps a little longer. It wasn’t noticeable at first, just a little more trips to the… you know. Then it got… more frequent. Like I said, it's a nuisance. Not painful, thankfully. Just… inconvenient. My wife makes me get up every couple of hours, just to be sure. Drives me a bit mad, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating, especially with your wife keeping watch. No pain is good, that's a positive sign. So, six months of gradually increasing frequency… Do you notice any urgency when you need to go, like you really have to go right away?
PATIENT: Urgency… hmm. Sometimes, yes. Not always, but… sometimes it hits you rather quickly. Like a switch flips. Then you’ve got to go. Other times it’s a bit more… manageable. It’s funny, isn’t it? The body is a strange thing. One day everything works perfectly, the next… well, you know. Honestly, I’ve always been a healthy man. Worked the farm my whole life, ate good food, never smoked. This whole thing is… unexpected. Do you think it could be… something serious? Don't tell me it's cancer, my brother had that, terrible thing.
DOCTOR: It is good you've been healthy overall, that’s helpful. And it's perfectly normal to be concerned about something serious. We'll do some checks to get a better idea of what's going on, and I want to assure you we'll rule things out systematically. We definitely don’t want to jump to conclusions. For now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, never. High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned it once, years ago, but it was never bad enough to need pills or anything. Just told me to watch my salt intake. I try to, but my wife, she loves to cook, and she puts salt in everything. Bless her heart, again. Other than that… I had a bad knee a few years back, had to have it replaced. That was a rough patch. But otherwise… nothing major. I take a little something for arthritis, helps with the joints, you know? Old age, again. Everything's falling apart. Do you need a list of these things? I doubt I can remember them all.
DOCTOR: It's alright, don't worry about remembering everything perfectly. I can look up some of your records in the computer as well. Knowing about the knee replacement and the arthritis medication is very helpful for now. What is the name of the arthritis medication you are taking?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's a little white pill. Comes in a small bottle. My wife handles all the pills, she’s very organized. I think… it starts with an ‘I’… Ibuprofen? No, that’s for aches, isn’t it? It’s something stronger… for the joints. Doctor gave it to me a few years back when my knees were really acting up. Honestly, I just ask my wife what to take each day, and she gives me the right pills. I'm not good with names, never was. Is it important? It's probably not a big deal, is it?
DOCTOR: It's alright, it's perfectly fine that you don't remember the name. It’s common for patients to not remember the names of their medications. Knowing you’re taking something for arthritis is helpful. I’ll check your electronic records to find the exact name. Now, before we go further, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always asks when she gets a new prescription, but the pharmacist always says I'm clear. Maybe once, a long time ago, I got a little rash from a cream… but it went away on its own. Nothing serious. Honestly, I’m a pretty tough old bird. Never been one to get sick easily. I think all the hard work on the farm built up my immune system. Do you need to know what kind of cream it was? I doubt I can remember that either. It was years ago, a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: It's good to know you haven't had any significant allergic reactions. Okay, let's move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, terrible habit, always coughing. I swore I’d never go near them, and I haven't. My wife… she tried it once or twice when she was younger, but she didn't like it. Said it made her feel sick. No, smoking has never been a problem in our household. Always believed in fresh air and hard work. That’s what keeps you healthy, you know? Not those nasty cigarettes.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Good for you and your wife. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, now, that's a bit different. I wouldn’t say I drink regularly. But I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner now and then. A small glass, mind you. Red wine, usually. My wife and I, we used to have a bottle with dinner most nights, but now we just have it on special occasions. Maybe once or twice a week? It helps us relax, you know? After a long day. Nothing heavy, just a small glass. Is that a problem? I don’t get drunk or anything. I’m a very responsible drinker.
DOCTOR: No, a small glass of wine occasionally isn't a problem at all. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, children—who have had any significant medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father, he had a bad heart, passed away when he was in his seventies. My mother, she had arthritis, just like me. Terrible pain, she suffered for years. My brother, he… well, he had that cancer, as I mentioned before. Very sad. My sister, she was healthy as a horse, lived to be ninety. As for my children… my son, he has high blood pressure, I think. And my daughter… she’s always been a bit delicate, has some stomach problems, but nothing major. Is that helpful? Family history… it’s a long story, you know? Lots of people, lots of problems.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful. Knowing about the heart disease, arthritis, cancer, and high blood pressure is important. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just hope you don't find anything too dreadful. My wife will be all over me if you find something wrong! She worries so much. Go ahead, do your work. I'm a tough old bird, remember? I’ve survived a lot worse than a little physical exam. Do I need to take off my shoes?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No, you don’t need to take off your shoes just yet. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear. Now, let's gently feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I feel a slight fullness in your lower abdomen. Not painful, just… noticeable. Is this something you've felt before?
PATIENT: A fullness… hmm. Now that you mention it… yes, maybe. I thought it was just my old age catching up with me. A little bit of a… bulge, I suppose. Not painful, as you said. Just there. It comes and goes, really. Sometimes it’s more noticeable than others. I just figured it was my stomach, you know? I do enjoy my food. My wife makes a wonderful stew. Is it something serious, Doctor? Please tell me it's not something serious. I'm starting to worry now.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’ve noticed it comes and goes. The fullness could be due to a number of things, and it's not necessarily serious. However, given your age and the frequency of urination you've been experiencing, I think it's important to investigate further. I'd like to order a couple of tests: a urine analysis to check for infection, and a blood test to check your kidney function and prostate-specific antigen level. The PSA level can help us assess your prostate health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I don't like the sound of it, but I trust your judgment. Prostate… is that something I should be worried about? My brother… he had some problems down there, if I recall correctly. Very unpleasant. But I suppose tests are better than just sitting here worrying. Urine analysis… that sounds simple enough. And blood test… well, I've had those before. A little pinprick, right? Just tell me what I need to do. I’ll do whatever you say. Just want to get this sorted out, you know? My wife will be relieved.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s good to be proactive. The urine analysis is very simple, you'll just need to provide a sample in a cup. As for the blood test, it is just a small pinprick, and it shouldn't take long. The nurse will draw a few vials of blood. I'll give you a lab order to take to the lab, and they'll take care of everything. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. It's possible the fullness is just age-related, or it could be something more. I want to rule out any serious causes. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Let me think. Well… how long will it take to get the results? I don't like waiting around, you know? And… will it be painful? The blood test, I mean. I've always been a bit squeamish around needles. And… will I need to change anything about my diet or routine before the tests? Should I stop drinking my small glass of wine? My wife will be furious if I stop drinking my wine! Just want to be prepared, you know? Don't want to mess anything up. And… is it likely to be… serious? You said you want to rule things out, but… is it likely? Oh dear. I'm probably being a bit of a worrywart, aren't I?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be anxious and ask questions, Mr. Segretto. You're not a worrywart at all. The results should be back within 3-5 business days. The blood test is usually quick, and the discomfort is minimal—just a brief pinprick. As for your routine, no, you don't need to change anything specific before the tests. You can continue with your normal diet and continue with your small glass of wine, for now. We'll discuss any necessary changes once we have the results. Regarding the likelihood of it being serious… it’s too early to say. We're running these tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It could be something minor, or it could be something more. It’s important to remember that these tests are simply a starting point. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly and create a plan tailored to your specific needs. For now, try not to worry too much. We’re taking all the necessary steps to get you diagnosed and treated. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all for now, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me, and you’ve answered all my silly questions. I appreciate it. I'll go get the tests done as soon as I can. And I'll try not to worry, like you said. My wife will be relieved to hear I’m getting it checked out. She's been nagging me about it for weeks. Just one last thing… who should I call if I have any problems after the blood test? Like, if it starts bleeding or something? I've always been a bit of a bleeder. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, somewhat.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease, even a little. If you experience any excessive bleeding or develop any signs of infection—such as redness, swelling, or pus—at the blood test site, please call my office immediately at 555-123-4567. We'll be happy to help. Otherwise, just follow up with us once you have the results, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them.
