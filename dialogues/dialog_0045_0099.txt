DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Minatra. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Billman. It’s about a test I had done recently. An examination of my… insides, I believe they called it – a GI Endo Test. The results weren’t quite what I expected, and honestly, a little worrying. I was hoping you could explain them to me.
DOCTOR: A GI Endo Test… right. And you're worried about the results. Well, a lot of people get unnecessarily anxious about these things. Let's have a look. So, according to the report here… you had an upper endoscopy done on July 18th. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. July 18th. I remember distinctly; it wasn’t a pleasant experience, though the nurses were very kind. It was Dr. Hernandez who performed it, if that’s relevant. And, yes, I do feel anxious, Doctor. It’s not every day one has a camera go inside of you, and then receives results I don’t understand. Could you perhaps explain what was found?
DOCTOR: Dr. Hernandez… yes, he’s… adequate. Look, Mrs. Minatra, I appreciate you're feeling anxious, but getting worked up before we even discuss the findings isn’t helpful. The report indicates some mild inflammation in your esophagus and stomach. And a small hiatal hernia. It's quite common, really. Have you been experiencing any heartburn, indigestion, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I am trying to be helpful by expressing my concerns. It’s just… inflammation and a hernia sound serious, even if you say they’re common. And yes, actually. I have been having some… discomfort. A bit of burning in my chest, especially after I eat. And sometimes, food feels like it… catches. Not all the time, but often enough to notice. Is that the inflammation, do you think? I haven’t mentioned it to anyone before, to be honest. I didn’t want to bother anyone with what seemed like… old age complaints.
DOCTOR: “Old age complaints.” Right. Well, everything gets a little slower as we get older, that's a fact of life. The burning in your chest and the sensation of food getting stuck could be related to the inflammation and the hernia, yes. The hernia allows stomach acid to reflux into the esophagus, causing irritation. Have you been taking anything for it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. As I said, I haven’t taken anything at all. I tend to… avoid medication if possible. My late husband, bless his soul, always said it just creates new problems. So I’ve been trying to manage it with… diet. Smaller meals, avoiding spicy foods, that sort of thing. But it hasn’t really helped much, to be honest. That’s why I came in. Is there something… serious going on, Doctor? Or is this something that can be managed with… pills?
DOCTOR: “Managing” is always the goal, Mrs. Minatra. And frankly, diet alone often isn't enough, especially when you’ve already let it progress. The report doesn’t indicate anything alarming – no signs of Barrett's esophagus or anything like that, which is good. However, ignoring this will just make it worse. We can try a proton pump inhibitor, a medication to reduce stomach acid. But you need to understand, this isn’t a cure. It’s symptom management. Are you willing to at least try medication?
PATIENT: A proton pump inhibitor… that sounds… chemical. But if it will help, and if it's not a… permanent solution, then I suppose I’m willing to try. I just… I don’t want to become reliant on something. Could we perhaps discuss… lifestyle changes again? Are there specific foods I should avoid completely? And is there anything I can do to… prevent the acid from coming up? Perhaps sleeping at an angle? I’ve read things, but I don’t know what’s reliable. And what about the hernia itself? Is that something that requires… other intervention?
DOCTOR: Lifestyle changes are always good in theory, Mrs. Minatra, but they rarely fix things completely. Avoiding caffeine, alcohol, fatty foods, and chocolate is a good start. Don't eat anything within three hours of lying down. Elevating the head of your bed is a good idea, yes – six to eight inches. But a hiatal hernia… it's a structural problem. The medication will help with the symptoms caused by the hernia, but it won't shrink the hernia itself. Surgery is an option, but frankly, at your age, the risks often outweigh the benefits. Let's start with the proton pump inhibitor – I’ll prescribe omeprazole, 20mg daily. See how that goes for a month. If your symptoms don’t improve, we can talk about further testing. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe I have any allergies. My husband always took care of remembering those things, and I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. Omeprazole, you said? 20 milligrams daily? And just to be clear, this is to help with the… burning and the feeling of things getting stuck, and not to fix the hernia itself? It's just… I want to be certain I understand. And what should I do if… if it doesn’t work? Or if I have side effects? I don't want to just be left in discomfort.
DOCTOR: Yes, omeprazole is to manage the symptoms – the burning, the difficulty swallowing – not the hernia. It reduces the acid that's irritating your esophagus. And yes, you're right to ask about side effects. Common ones are headache, diarrhea, nausea, but they’re usually mild. If you experience anything more severe – severe abdominal pain, black stools, vomiting – stop the medication and contact me immediately. If it doesn’t improve your symptoms after a month, we can consider an endoscopy to re-evaluate the situation. And yes, it’s always good to be cautious. Anything else?
PATIENT: One more thing, Doctor. I… I haven’t got insurance, you see. My late husband had a good policy, but it ended with him. Will the medication be… expensive? I wouldn’t want to cause myself financial hardship trying to feel better. It's just… things are tight as it is. Perhaps there’s a generic option? I wouldn’t want to be a bother, but it’s a concern.
DOCTOR: Yes, omeprazole does have a generic version, lansoprazole. It's significantly cheaper. I’ll write the prescription for lansoprazole. However, I have to be frank, Mrs. Minatra. I can’t control the price of medication. You’ll need to check with the pharmacy. And frankly, without insurance, ongoing treatment will be a cost. It's something you need to consider. Now, do you have any other questions, or can we finish this consultation?
PATIENT: Right. Of course. I understand. I'll check with the pharmacy, then. Thank you, Doctor Billman. I think… that's all for now. I appreciate your time, and for explaining everything so clearly, despite my… anxieties. Hopefully, the lansoprazole will help. And if not… well, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let the pharmacy know if you have any issues. And remember, if your symptoms worsen, don't hesitate to contact me. Have a good day, Mrs. Minatra. .
