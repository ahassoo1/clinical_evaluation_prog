DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It's been… oh, let me think… more than two days now, I think. It’s really getting annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: More than two days, alright. That is rather persistent. Can you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Well, they’re just… hiccups! You know, that little jerk of the chest, and you gasp in? They aren’t painful, exactly, but they’re strong. And frequent. Like… every few minutes, maybe? Sometimes a little longer between, but not much. I haven’t been able to get a full breath in ages, it feels like.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Strong and frequent hiccups for over two days. Have you noticed anything that specifically triggers them, or seems to make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. I was doing some gardening yesterday, but I hiccuped before that too. I had a big glass of water earlier, trying to make them stop, but that didn’t help. I ate lunch like normal. No spicy food or anything. Honestly, it feels random. I wish I knew what was causing it!
DOCTOR: Alright. Random onset. And you've tried water, which is… standard, I suppose. Let’s go through a bit more detail. Have you had any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… No fever, no cough. My stomach feels… okay. Maybe a little gassy, but I usually am, to be honest. No heartburn. I haven’t lost my appetite. I’ve been a little tired, but that’s just normal for me, I think. No dizziness or anything like that, thankfully. It's just… the hiccups. They’re exhausting!
DOCTOR: Exhausting, I can imagine. Alright. No fever, cough, appetite change, dizziness...let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been controlled with medication for a while now. Just a little pill every morning. And I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. Apart from that… not really. Nothing major, I don’t think. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful. Controlled hypertension and a cholecystectomy ten years ago. And what medications are you currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill, Doctor. It’s Lisinopril, I think that's the name. One tablet every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes I take something for aches and pains, just over-the-counter ibuprofen, but not regularly. Maybe once or twice a month if my knees are acting up. I don’t take a lot of medication, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril daily and occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to worry about bee stings, but I’ve never been stung, thankfully. My mother was allergic to shellfish, but I love it and I’ve always been fine. No, no allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My father had heart problems, that’s why I’m so careful with my blood pressure. My mother had diabetes, but she managed it with diet and exercise. And my sister… she has arthritis, I think. Apart from that, nothing really springs to mind. We don’t have a lot of serious illnesses in the family, to be honest. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. History of hypertension and diabetes in the family, arthritis in your sister. Finally, a few lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, absolutely not! I used to smoke, years ago, when I was younger and foolish, but I quit a long time ago. I don’t drink alcohol either, never really liked it. And definitely no drugs! I'm a perfectly ordinary woman, I assure you. Just plagued by these hiccups!
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Okay, Ms. Redeye, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. Just to rule out anything obvious. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. No problem at all. Oh, there it is again! It's embarrassing, honestly. Let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses or organomegaly. Alright, Ms. Redeye, everything feels normal to the touch. No immediate concerns there. Now, I’m just going to check your neurological reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to hear. It’s just… frustrating, you know? I can’t even have a proper conversation without hiccuping! I'm just hoping you can figure out what's going on. Go ahead with the reflexes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. No signs of any neurological deficits. Alright, Ms. Redeye. Everything appears normal on the physical exam. Given the persistent nature of your hiccups – over two days, no obvious triggers, and a normal physical – we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be something benign, like a minor irritation of the phrenic nerve, but prolonged hiccups can sometimes indicate an underlying issue. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a few blood tests, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Also, an EKG would be prudent to rule out any cardiac abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Blood tests and an EKG. It’s a little scary, but if it will help figure out what's wrong, then yes, that sounds alright. I just want it to stop, you know? I trust your judgment, Doctor. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Good. I understand. The blood work is standard, and the EKG is quick and painless – just some stickers on your chest. I’ll write you a lab requisition and an EKG order. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will take care of you. Once the results are back – usually within 24 to 48 hours – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and avoid carbonated beverages. If the hiccups become severe – if they're interfering with your breathing or sleep, or if you experience any chest pain – go to the emergency room immediately. Here's the paperwork for the lab and EKG. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. Stay hydrated, no fizzy drinks… and go to the ER if it gets worse. I can remember that. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… hoping for some good news, I suppose. Thank you for taking me seriously, Doctor. It's been really annoying, and I appreciate you running tests to figure it out.
DOCTOR: Good. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have my nurse come in and assist you with getting dressed and provide you with directions to the lab. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. I'll see you in a few days, Ms. Redeye.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Versace. I will. Oh, still hiccuping!
