DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my chest... it's been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels like... a tight squeezing, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight squeezing in your chest. That is concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? It was just a little thing at first, I thought it was just… gas, maybe? But it’s been happening more and more. I remember the first time was after I was doing some gardening.
DOCTOR: Gardening, okay. And does it only happen with activity, like when you’re gardening, or does it happen when you’re resting too?
PATIENT: It's mostly when I do something, yes. Like walking up the stairs, or… carrying groceries. It hasn’t happened when I’m just sitting, watching TV, thankfully. But even just a little bit of effort makes it come on.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you feel this squeezing, where exactly in your chest do you feel it?
PATIENT: It's… right here. Not on the side, but right in the middle. It feels like someone is hugging my chest too tight. And sometimes, it goes up to my shoulder a little bit, on the left side. But mostly here.
DOCTOR: Okay, center of the chest, sometimes radiating to the left shoulder. Does anything make it better when you’re experiencing this?
PATIENT: Yes! When I stop what I'm doing, and just… sit down and rest, it goes away pretty quick. Maybe five or ten minutes. And if I take a few deep breaths, that helps too. It doesn't completely go away right away, but it gets much, much better.
DOCTOR: Good to know that rest and deep breaths help. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been a little… more tired lately, I think. But I'm getting older, so I thought that was just… old age! And maybe I've been a little short of breath sometimes, when I'm walking up those stairs, but not a lot. It's hard to say if that's new, or just… me. No other pains, no dizziness, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased fatigue and mild shortness of breath with exertion. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… my doctor, back in Colombia, he told me I had a little bit of high blood pressure, years ago. He put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it when I moved here. It wasn't bothering me, and it was hard to get it filled here, you know? And my cholesterol… he said that was a little high too, but I don't remember any special medicine for that. Nothing else, I think. Just… getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol. And do you know if you've ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes. A long time ago, when I was maybe forty, I had my gallbladder taken out. It was very painful, but the surgery went okay. And… no, I don't think I’ve been in the hospital for anything else. Just the gallbladder, a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder surgery in the past. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of! I can eat anything, take any medicine. My mama always said I had a strong stomach. I’ve never had a problem with anything. No itching, no swelling, nothing like that. Not that I remember, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Not even vitamins. I used to take a little something for my joints, but I stopped that a long time ago. It didn't seem to be helping much, and I didn’t want to take too many pills, you know? Just… nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, to get a better picture of things, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit up here for me, and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then I’ll feel your chest a bit. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some slight crackling in the lower part of your lungs on both sides. I’m going to gently palpate your chest now. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little high? I didn't know. And the crackling… that doesn’t sound good, does it? Yes… that makes it a little sore, right here. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like it’s bruised.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with palpation in the center of your chest. The crackling in your lungs, along with your elevated blood pressure and chest pain, suggests a few possibilities. Given your history of high blood pressure, we need to rule out some cardiac concerns. To help me get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I want to get an EKG to look at your heart’s electrical activity, and a chest X-ray to see what's going on in your lungs. I also want to check your cholesterol levels and some other blood work to see how everything is functioning. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh… tests? Well, if you think it’s important, Doctor, then yes. I trust your judgment. It sounds… a little scary, but I want to know what's going on. So, yes, let’s do the tests. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: No, the tests themselves shouldn’t hurt. The EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs – it doesn’t cause any pain at all. And the blood work is just a quick needle stick. It might sting for a moment, but it's very quick. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and get you set up for the EKG and chest X-ray. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity, and if you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds clear, Doctor. No strenuous activity, and go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I understand. Stickers and a little poke, okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. It's my job to help. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. She’ll be in shortly. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Don't hesitate to ask if any questions come to mind while you wait.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I won’t. Thank you again.
