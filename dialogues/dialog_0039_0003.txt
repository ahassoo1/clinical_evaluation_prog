DOCTOR: “Good afternoon, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, it’s this…shaking. My hand, mostly. It’s been going on, oh, I don’t know, a while now. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly. It’s just…annoying. Can we just get this sorted quickly? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: “Of course, Mr. Baide. We’ll do our best to figure things out quickly. “Annoying” is a perfectly good description – it’s good to know how it’s affecting you. When you say ‘a while now’, would you say weeks, months…longer?
PATIENT: Months, I suppose. Maybe longer. Look, I used to be a very important man, you know. A producer. Directors, the whole nine yards. I don’t have time to sit around remembering when my hand started to tremble. It just…did. Is there a fix for this or what?
DOCTOR: “I understand, Mr. Baide. Being a busy person certainly makes it harder to keep track of things. And absolutely, we’ll focus on finding a solution. Just to get a clearer picture, has the shaking been getting worse over these months?
PATIENT: Worse? I don’t know. It comes and goes. Sometimes I can hold a glass, sometimes I spill my coffee all over myself. It's embarrassing, frankly. People stare. And it’s not like I need this… aggravation. Honestly, I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: “That sounds very frustrating, Mr. Baide, especially with coffee involved! It’s good you’re telling me about this. Does anything seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Better? Nothing makes it better! Unless maybe… a stiff drink. But I don't really drink much anymore, the doctor said… something about my stomach. No, nothing really helps. Except maybe when I'm just sitting still, doing nothing. But what good is that?
DOCTOR: “Okay, that’s helpful. And you mentioned your stomach – do you remember what your doctor said about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, something about ulcers, I think. Years ago. It was a whole thing. I had to take pills and eat bland food. It was dreadful. Look, I'm not a doctor, alright? I just know it makes me feel poorly sometimes, and the shaking feels… worse when my stomach isn't happy. Can we just… skip the history lesson?
DOCTOR: “Of course, Mr. Baide. No need to dwell on the past if it’s uncomfortable. We can certainly focus on the present. So, aside from spilling coffee, have you noticed the shaking anywhere else besides your hand?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, my leg sometimes. Just a little twitch, really. Nothing major. But it happens. And… sometimes my voice shakes a bit when I'm talking to people. It’s subtle, but I notice it. It makes me sound… weak. And I hate sounding weak.
DOCTOR: “Thank you for telling me, Mr. Baide. It’s good we’re getting a complete picture. Okay, to get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a look and feel, check your reflexes, things like that. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. I have a luncheon to get to, you know. Important people. Can’t be late. Just… try to be quick about it.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Mr. Baide. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. First, let's just check your blood pressure and pulse.” “Blood pressure is 140 over 85. Pulse is 78. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you?
PATIENT: Ugh, alright. Just… don't poke too much. I bruise easily, you know. I'm an older man.
DOCTOR: “I’m being very careful, Mr. Baide. I see a slight tremor in both hands, more pronounced on this side.” “Now, if you could tap your feet for me, and then try to touch your nose with your finger.” “Reflexes are a little brisk, but within normal limits for your age. Now, if you don't mind, I'll listen to your heart and lungs.” “Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles.” “Okay, that gives me a little more information. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it could be a few things, including essential tremor, which is common, or something related to your stomach issues. It's also possible there's another cause.”
PATIENT: Essential… what? Look, I don't need a lot of medical jargon. Is it serious? Will I have to go to the hospital? I have important meetings! Just tell me if there’s a pill I can take to make it stop!
DOCTOR: “No, Mr. Baide, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, and I don’t believe a hospital stay is needed at this time. Essential tremor is a common condition that causes shaking, and often it doesn’t worsen significantly over time. There are medications that can help control the shaking, but they all have potential side effects, and we need to consider those carefully. Before we jump to medication, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out other possible causes, like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… fine. As long as it doesn’t take all day. And as long as it doesn't interfere with my luncheon. Just… get it done. I have people waiting for me. And if those tests show something awful, just… tell me straight. I don't like beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Mr. Baide. We’ll get those tests done as quickly as possible. The phlebotomist should be able to get them drawn within the hour. And I promise to be upfront with you about the results, whatever they may be. The tests will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and a few other things to give us a clearer picture. We will also need to order a neurological consultation to see if they think it could be something more serious. Would you be willing to see a neurologist?
PATIENT: A… neurologist? What’s that? Is that someone who’s going to poke around in my brain? Look, I'm not sure about all this. I just want the shaking to stop. If those tests are going to take weeks, forget it. I don’t have time for all these specialists.
DOCTOR: “A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the brain and nervous system, Mr. Baide. It's just a precaution to rule out anything more serious. They won’t poke around in your brain unless there's a very specific reason to do so – mostly, it's just a detailed neurological exam, checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. And I understand your concern about time. We can schedule the appointment for as soon as possible, and I’ll make sure the results are expedited. The tests themselves shouldn’t take long, and the appointment can be scheduled for next week. If the tests come back normal, we can discuss medication options to manage the shaking. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Next week, then. But I’m telling you, if this interferes with my schedule… and if I have to wait around all day for tests… I’m not a happy man. Get it done quickly, alright? Now, can I go? I’m late as it is.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Mr. Baide. I’ll have the paperwork for the blood tests and the neurology consultation ready for you. And I’ll make sure everything is scheduled as quickly as possible. My nurse will come in and explain the post-visit instructions before you leave. Here's a list of the instructions, as well. Please let her know if you have any questions. Thank you for your patience, and please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms. Now, you are free to go. And I hope you enjoy your luncheon.”
PATIENT: .
