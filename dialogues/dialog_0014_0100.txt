DOCTOR: Alright, Lytisha Hughston, 51 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… right. The… the test. For… well, they said I need a drug test. Something about work, I think? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right, a drug test. Okay. And this is… required by your employer?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Something to do with the… the machines? I operate one of those big paving things, you know? They… they want to make sure I’m alright to do it. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I don't really remember why exactly, just that I need the test. Is that alright? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It's… adequate. It sounds like a return-to-work screening, perhaps following some sort of incident or policy change. But we'll get to the bottom of it. So, you operate heavy machinery. Any recent changes at work that prompted this test?
PATIENT: Heavy machinery, yes. That’s right. Changes… hmm. Now that you mention it… there was a new supervisor. A younger fella. Seemed… strict. Maybe it was him? I really don’t know. Everything feels so… distant. It was maybe a month or so ago when he started, I guess? It's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: A new supervisor… alright. Well, it's good to be thorough, I suppose. Regardless of the reason, we need to fulfill the requirements of the test. Do you have any concerns about the test itself?
PATIENT: Concerns? Not… really? I mean, I don’t like needles, but… it’s gotta be done, right? I just… I don’t want to get in trouble at work. I need the job, you know? Medicare helps, but it’s not enough. Is it a blood test? Or… something else? I’m a little worried about what they’ll be looking for, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It's usually a urine test for these types of screenings, though sometimes they do oral fluid tests. It's standard procedure, nothing to worry about unduly. They’ll be looking for illicit substances, as you might expect. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of that might affect the results, or make giving a sample difficult?
PATIENT: Illicit substances… Oh, no, no! Nothing like that. Never. I just… I take some medicine for my arthritis, that’s all. And… I drink a lot of water. Does that matter? I’m always thirsty. And… sometimes I have trouble… going to the bathroom, if you know what I mean. Especially if I’m nervous. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Arthritis medication, and occasional difficulty with urination… noted. The arthritis medication could potentially interfere with the test, depending on what it is. What medications are you currently taking for your arthritis, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… let me think. It’s… a little white pill. I think the name starts with an “M”? Or maybe a “P”? I get it refilled at the pharmacy down the street, you know, the one near the bakery? I… I’m really bad with names. I just tell them the usual arthritis one. I'm sorry, I really don’t know what it’s called. Is that… helpful? I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal. We really need to know what you’re taking. Do you have a list from the pharmacy, or perhaps the bottle itself?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… I think I have a receipt somewhere… No, that’s just for the bakery. I got a croissant this morning… Oh! Here! Yes, this is it. Meloxicam. 7.5mg. Does that… help? I usually take two a day. Is that the important bit? I hope so. This whole thing is making my head spin.
DOCTOR: Meloxicam, 7.5mg, twice daily. Yes, that's more like it. Meloxicam is an NSAID; it shouldn’t directly interfere with a standard drug screen, but we need to be aware. Now, let’s proceed with the urine collection. I’ll have the nurse explain the process. Do you have any… issues with mobility that might make it difficult for you to get to the restroom?
PATIENT: Mobility… not really. My arthritis slows me down a bit, mostly in my hands, but I can walk just fine. I have a cane sometimes, but I don’t need it all the time. The restroom is… not too far, is it? I can manage. I think. As long as I’m not rushed, I should be alright. Is it… private? I get a little embarrassed, you know, with things like this.
DOCTOR: It's a standard restroom. Private enough. The nurse will provide a cup and instructions. Just try to relax, and let me know if you have any trouble. We’ll get this done. I'll have her come in now. Nurse, could you please assist Lytisha Hughston with the drug screen?
PATIENT: Thank you. That would be… lovely. I appreciate it. Hopefully, this won’t take too long. I have a baking class this afternoon, you see. Croissants, again! It’s… very therapeutic.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll get you sorted. Let me know if anything comes up. I’ll be reviewing your chart while you complete the collection. Is there anything else you'd like to mention before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Um… Oh! My husband… he passed away a few years ago. That's probably why my memory isn't so good. It's been… difficult. No, that’s… that’s probably it. Just… it’s nice to be understood, I guess. It's just… a lot to keep track of sometimes. I don't want to cause any trouble.
