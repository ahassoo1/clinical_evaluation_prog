DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rakosky, you say? Hmm. Yes, well. New here, you see. Just... the social thing, I think? The papers said I needed to come. Old bones, mostly. Not much to tell, really. A little check-up, I guess. Don't remember much about why, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. A general check-up then, as recommended. That's perfectly alright. It's quite common for things to be a little unclear when scheduling routine appointments. No worries at all. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… hmm. Let me think. I used to… work with faces, you know? Makeup. Theatrical stuff. A lot of standing. My back… maybe something about my back, a long time ago. But nothing serious. I think. Divorced wife always complained about something, but she complained about everything. Not sure that counts as a diagnosis. Honestly, doctor, I don’t really keep track of these things. It's all a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to not remember details from the past, especially if it wasn’t a significant issue at the time. Your work sounds interesting – a lot of standing can certainly contribute to back discomfort. Just to clarify, was the back discomfort ever formally diagnosed by a doctor – perhaps a muscle strain, or something like arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis… no, I don’t think so. Muscle strain… maybe. Yes, I think so. A younger doctor… years ago. Said I needed to… stretch more. I did not stretch enough. Too busy. Always busy. Mostly just rubbed some cream on it. The cheap kind. It helped a little. Honestly, it’s not bothering me now. It's just… old. Everything is just old, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. "Old" can certainly cause its fair share of aches and pains. And it sounds like you managed it with over-the-counter remedies, which is good. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… hmm. Let me think. When I was a boy… very young. My tonsils. Took them out. That's all I remember. And… maybe a broken arm? Playing football with my friends. A long time ago. Other than that… no. Never needed anything serious. I'm a strong man. Well… was a strong man. Now I just sit. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and possibly a broken arm. Thank you. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family… sigh. That’s… complicated. Mother… she lived to be very old, I think. Ninety something. Complained a lot. Like the wife. But healthy, mostly. Father… heart trouble, I think. Yes, definitely heart trouble. Always smoking. Terrible habit. Brothers… one died young. Something with… his lungs. The other… lives in Russia. Don't see him much. No idea what he’s got. A mess, really. A whole mess of problems.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like there's a history of heart trouble and some respiratory issues in your family. That’s good information to have. Now, would you mind telling me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that mean? I sit. I watch television. I eat… okay. Sometimes. Mostly I just sit. Used to be busy, you know? Traveling with the theater. But those days are gone. Now… quiet. Very quiet. I drink tea. A lot of tea. And… sometimes I call my sister. She lives in… somewhere. Don't remember where exactly. Not a very exciting lifestyle, doctor.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Szmyd. It's important for me to get a full picture of your daily habits. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I take something for… the waterworks. Gets a bit… troublesome. Old age, you know? The cheap kind from the drugstore. And… sometimes a painkiller for my knees. When they ache. Also cheap. Other than that… no. Just tea. Lots and lots of tea. I don't trust those fancy pills. Always have side effects.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to be mindful of what you're taking. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don't think so. Never had much trouble. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when the pollen is bad. But everyone gets itchy, right? I don't go near cats. They make me sneeze. And my wife… she was allergic to everything. But that's not me. I’m a strong man. Well… was. I don't think I have allergies, doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just some sensitivity to pollen and cats. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Physical exam… hmm. Always disliked those things. But… alright. If you must. Just… be gentle, please? Old bones, you know. And… don't take too long. I have tea waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and we won't take long. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not critically high. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not alarming at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. No swelling or redness noted in the extremities. Okay, everything seems generally alright, Mr. Szmyd, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur are things we should monitor. I'd like to order some routine blood work and an EKG to get a clearer picture of your cardiovascular health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an… ECG? What is that? Sounds… complicated. Monitor… you mean… keep an eye on it? Alright. If you think it’s necessary. But… will it take long? I have tea waiting, you know. And… is it expensive? I’m on a fixed income.
DOCTOR: An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a simple, painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t take long – just a few minutes. We'll attach some small stickers to your chest, and a machine will record the readings. As for the blood work, it will help us check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and other important indicators of your overall health. That will also take just a few minutes of your time. Regarding cost, we will bill Medicare, and I believe the co-pay should be minimal. We can also check with the billing department to give you a more accurate estimate before proceeding, if you'd like. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Medicare… yes, good. Minimal… that’s good. I don't want any surprises. Hmm… alright, schedule it. But… not too early. I need my tea. And… can you tell me when I’ll get the results? I don't want to keep waiting around.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. I’ve scheduled you for blood work and an EKG next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. That should give you plenty of time to enjoy your tea. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. Once they are available, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. You can purchase a blood pressure cuff at most pharmacies. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Monitor… always monitoring. Alright. Tuesday, 10:00. I’ll try to remember. And… a nurse will call? What is her name? I like to know who I’m talking to. And… is there anything I should do before the tests? Anything I need to avoid? I don't want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. The nurse who will be contacting you is Nurse Davies. She’s very good and will be happy to answer any questions you may have. As for preparation for the tests, there are a few things. For the blood work, it’s best to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand, so you may want to schedule your appointment first thing in the morning. You can drink water, but avoid food and sugary drinks. For the EKG, just make sure your chest is clean and dry. You don’t need to do anything special otherwise. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Fasting… 8 hours… hmm. That’s a long time. Alright, I'll try. Nurse… Davies, you say? I'll remember that. No… I think that’s all. Just… don’t want any surprises. And… thank you. For not making me wait too long. I have tea waiting, you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. We try to be as efficient as possible. I understand the importance of your tea! We’ve scheduled your tests for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Nurse Davies will be in touch once the results are available. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. It was nice meeting you. Have a good day, and enjoy your tea.
PATIENT: You too, doctor. And… tell Nurse Davies to be gentle. And… thank you again. Tea… must remember the tea…
