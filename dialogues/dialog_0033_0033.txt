DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie, good to meet you. Though, honestly, these appointments are always so… packed. So, let’s try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Concise is good. Very good. Well, it's… it's my vision and hearing. They’ve just… gone. Not gradually, you understand. Just… poof. Happened a few days ago. It's terribly inconvenient, naturally. A woman in my profession needs her senses. Though I suppose you have all that written down.
DOCTOR: “Poof,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, “poof.” Is that… unclear? It was quite sudden. One moment I was perfectly fine, the next… nothing much to see or hear. Really, it's rather disruptive. I had a perfectly good schedule planned. A very good one. I don't appreciate disruptions.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sudden onset of both vision and hearing loss is… unusual. Let’s try to establish some specifics. Do you recall anything before this “poof” happened?
PATIENT: Before? Hmm. Let me think. Honestly, my days rather blend together these days. I was likely at the hospital, I suppose. Seeing patients. Though, I can’t recall anything specific. Was I stressed? Probably. Running a pediatric surgery ward is never not stressful. Is that what you're looking for? Some sort of… dramatic event? I assure you, my life isn't a soap opera.
DOCTOR: Not a dramatic event, no. Just trying to understand the context. Any headache, dizziness, weakness, numbness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking all sorts of questions. A headache… perhaps? I get those frequently. From the stress, naturally. And dizziness… well, I am getting on in years, you know. A bit wobbly from time to time. Weakness… no, I wouldn’t say I feel weak. More… tired. Exasperated, really. This entire situation is… quite exasperating. Are we getting anywhere? It feels like you're fishing for something.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, these things require… thoroughness. Any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Oh, dear. Let me see… I think I had a bit of a cold last winter. Nothing serious, just a sniffle. And… I believe I had the flu shot. Yes, I'm quite diligent about those sorts of things. Though, it clearly didn’t prevent… this. Frankly, I find modern medicine…overrated. You poke and prod and ask endless questions, and yet here I am. Losing my senses. It's quite ironic, wouldn't you say?
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really. Are you quite sure you need to know everything about my entire medical history? It’s… tedious. Well, I suppose I’m mildly allergic to dust. And cats. But who isn’t? Honestly, I spend my days in a sterile hospital environment. I don't have time for seasonal sniffles and such. Do you think allergies could cause… this? It seems rather far-fetched, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s move on. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Just the usual things, really. A little something for my blood pressure, I suppose. And a vitamin D supplement. The doctor insisted. Something about the lack of sunlight. Honestly, I barely have time to see the sunlight, let alone soak it up. And… a small thing for my arthritis. It flares up now and again. Is that all relevant? It feels like you're compiling a novel.
DOCTOR: I'll need the names of those medications, Ms. Julie. Dosage as well, if you recall. It's important.
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. This is… trying my patience. Names, dosages… Honestly, I leave all of that to my assistant. She handles the details. Let me see… the blood pressure one… is a little white pill. Yes, a small white pill. And the arthritis one is… yellow. A capsule, I think. As for dosages… absolutely no idea. I simply take what I'm given. Is this truly necessary? It's all so… bureaucratic.
DOCTOR: Let me check your records. Perhaps we can find something there. One moment.
PATIENT: Honestly. This is taking far too long. I have patients waiting, you know. Important patients. I really don't have time for this endless… questioning and searching. Perhaps I should have gone to a specialist directly. This general practice approach seems… inefficient.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your records indicate Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension, and… Meloxicam 15mg daily for osteoarthritis. And a Vitamin D supplement, 2000 IU. Correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds right. Finally! See? Everything is perfectly documented. I really don't understand why I was made to repeat it all. It's simply a waste of time. Now, can we please get to the bottom of this… predicament? My vision and hearing are not improving with all of this interrogation, you know. I suspect there’s something seriously wrong. And frankly, I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sudden sensory loss like this… warrants further investigation. I'd like to perform a brief neurological exam. And I'll need to order an MRI of the brain, just to rule out anything serious. But frankly, I suspect it may be stress related. A prolonged period of… overwork, perhaps?
PATIENT: Stress related? Honestly! Are you suggesting I'm imagining this? That decades of dedicated service, of saving children's lives, has somehow… caused me to lose my senses? It’s… insulting! An MRI, very well. Though I must say, I find your initial diagnosis… rather dismissive. And frankly, if it is stress related, I'd like to know how one is supposed to simply… stop being stressed when one is responsible for the well-being of others. It’s absurd! But fine, let’s get the MRI done. The sooner this is over, the better. Now, where exactly do I go for this… scan? And will it interfere with my schedule? Because I assure you, I have a very busy week.
DOCTOR: The order for the MRI has been sent to City Imaging, on Elm Street. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. It will take approximately 45 minutes, and you will need to fast for at least four hours beforehand. As for interfering with your schedule… That's something you'll have to work out with your assistant. And frankly, I suggest you consider taking some time off. A vacation, perhaps?
PATIENT: A vacation?! Absolutely not! Do you have any idea how impossible that is? Children need surgery, lives are on the line. I do not simply take vacations. Honestly, this is becoming increasingly frustrating. Very well, I’ll contact City Imaging. But I highly doubt a scan will reveal anything. It's likely something… more unusual. I expect a thorough examination, and I expect you to take my concerns seriously. Now, is there anything else? Because I really must be going. I have a waiting room full of anxious parents, and frankly, I don’t have time for speculative diagnoses and unsolicited vacation advice. .
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Julie. That will be all. Please contact my office if you have any questions regarding the scan. Have a… productive day. though, I doubt that's going to happen.
