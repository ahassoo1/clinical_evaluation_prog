DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. A confirmation that I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I recently lost my husband, and the airline needs something official saying I'm fit to travel, you know? Just to be sure.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sayar. I am very sorry for your loss. That must be incredibly difficult. A fitness-to-fly letter is certainly reasonable in your situation. To complete this accurately, I’ll need to gather some information from you. Let’s start with your recent medical history. Have you seen any other doctors recently, or been hospitalized for anything in the past few months?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just my usual check-ups with my primary care doctor, Dr. Lee. Nothing in the hospital. I had a bad cold back in April, but that was it. Honestly, I’ve been pretty healthy. It’s more… the emotional stress of everything, I think. But physically, I’m okay. I really don't want to hold up your time with this.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Sayar. And please, don't worry about taking up my time. Your well-being is my priority. Just to be thorough, and to document everything properly for the airline, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you had any significant medical conditions diagnosed in the past – things like heart problems, lung disease, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never had any problems with my heart or lungs. My blood sugar is always normal, Dr. Lee checks it every year. I’m pretty active, I walk a lot, and… well, my husband and I used to travel all the time. So I've always been in decent shape. I’m really just trying to get this letter so I can… well, so I can get back to that, eventually.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know, Ms. Sayar. It sounds like you’ve been quite proactive about your health. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just Medicare, honestly. I don't take anything regularly. Maybe an occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that's it. Really. Nothing prescribed, nothing daily. I haven't needed anything. My husband always took care of all the medication stuff when he needed things. This is still… new, figuring it all out. Sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Ms. Sayar. It’s perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed during this time. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I eat everything. My husband always joked I had a cast iron stomach. He'd try all sorts of weird street food when we traveled, and I always ended up fine. I've never had a reaction to anything. He really loved to travel.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you both had wonderful adventures. Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Sayar. Now, before we proceed with the letter, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to ensure there are no underlying concerns. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this letter and… move forward. I’m ready whenever you are. It's probably silly, but I keep imagining the airline asking a million questions.
DOCTOR: Not at all silly, Ms. Sayar. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to be prepared. Let’s start with your vital signs. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is 122/78, which is excellent. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, if you’ll take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are normal, regular rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No masses or organomegaly. Everything sounds and feels good, Ms. Sayar. Based on this brief examination, and your medical history, I don't see any contraindications to air travel. I can certainly write you the letter stating you are fit to fly.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… that’s wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. It’s such a relief to hear. You have no idea. Will it be ready today?
DOCTOR: Yes, it will be, Ms. Sayar. I’m completing it now, and the nurse will print it out for you before you leave. It will state that you have been evaluated and are cleared for air travel. I will also include a statement about your recent bereavement, should the airline require additional documentation. Just one final question, Ms. Sayar. Do you have any concerns about your emotional well-being following your loss?
PATIENT: That's very kind of you to ask. Honestly… it’s hard. Some days are better than others. I have a good friend who checks on me a lot, and I’m trying to keep busy. I haven’t really thought about… needing extra help, if you know what I mean. I’m trying to be strong. But thank you for asking. It's nice to know people care.
DOCTOR: It is perfectly normal to experience a range of emotions after such a profound loss, Ms. Sayar. And it takes strength to acknowledge those feelings. If you find that your grief is becoming overwhelming, or interfering with your daily life, please don’t hesitate to reach out for support. I can provide you with a list of local grief counseling resources, if you’d like. The nurse will be in shortly with your letter, Ms. Sayar. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Shely. You’ve been very helpful, and very kind. It means a lot. I really appreciate you taking the time. I should probably let you get back to your other patients.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Ms. Sayar. I’m glad I could help. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Here is a list of resources, should you want them. Have a good day, Ms. Sayar.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
