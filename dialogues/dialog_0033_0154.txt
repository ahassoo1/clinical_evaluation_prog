DOCTOR: Right. Claudene Wease, 66 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Doctor… Dech-ene, is it? Yes. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I keep getting… trouble. Down there. With my waterworks, you see. It happens again and again. I don’t… I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been a bother for some time now.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” alright. And how long is “some time now”?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… difficult to say. Months, I suppose. Maybe longer? Everything feels a bit… blurry these days. It comes and goes, you understand. Not constant, thankfully. But when it does come… it’s unpleasant. Very unpleasant. I just want it to stop happening, if you follow.
DOCTOR: Months, blurry… Right. And when you say “unpleasant,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh… well. It burns, mostly. When I… go to the bathroom. And it feels like I need to go all the time, even when there isn't much there. Does that make sense? It's… a stinging feeling. And sometimes a little… ache. I don't like talking about this, if I'm honest. It's… private.
DOCTOR: Burning, frequent urination, ache… We'll get through this. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I don’t think so. I… I don’t really look, if you understand. I just… try to get it over with. It's a quick glance, mostly. No, I don’t recall seeing any blood. But… it was a while ago, the last time I really paid attention. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It can be. Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I haven’t felt hot or cold beyond the usual. And my back… well, my back always aches a bit. Old age, you know. But not… pain pain. Just the usual stiffness. No, I don’t think I’ve had a fever or chills. I’m quite certain. Is this taking long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: We're getting there. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Bowel habits? Doctor, are you asking about… that? I… I don’t really want to discuss that. It's a bit too personal. Everything's… normal, I suppose. As normal as it gets at my age. Really, I just want to know what's wrong with my waterworks. Is it serious? Will I need… tests?
DOCTOR: Fine. Let's focus on the waterworks. Any previous urinary tract infections, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it… I think I had something like that, years ago. A long time ago. A doctor gave me some pills, I recall. Pink pills, maybe? But I can’t be certain. It was… a very long time ago. Before I got divorced, I think. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. Did it help? I… I don’t remember. I just remember feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill. And sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re acting up. But… that’s it, I think. I don’t take much. I try not to. I don’t like pills. I… I don’t remember the names, I’m afraid. Is that a problem? I really must get going soon.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's do a quick exam. It’s necessary to rule things out. Can you lie down on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Now? Well… I suppose so. If it’s necessary. It’s just… I wasn't expecting that. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? I don’t… I don’t like being poked and prodded, if you understand. But… alright. I’ll lie down. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: I will be as efficient as possible. Just relax. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay. No significant tenderness to palpation. External genitalia appear normal, though slightly red. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. It’s a bit cold, isn’t it? Just… be quick, please. That tickles. Is that normal? It’s just… I don’t like being touched. It’s very kind of you to check, though.
DOCTOR: Normal bowel sounds. Okay. Based on what you've told me, and the limited exam, it sounds like you likely have a urinary tract infection, or possibly cystitis. The redness is consistent with that. However, given your age and lack of a definitive fever, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a urine analysis to confirm.
PATIENT: A urine analysis? Oh… alright. That sounds… sensible. Is it painful? Will it take long? I really must get home soon. I have… appointments, you see. And things to do. So, it's an infection, you think? Is it… serious? Will I need strong medicine? And how much will this cost? I’m not insured, you know.
DOCTOR: The urine analysis is simple. You’ll just need to provide a sample in the cup I’ll give you. It shouldn’t be painful. As for the cost… I don’t have that information readily available. The receptionist will need to assist you with that. As for the severity, it’s usually treatable with antibiotics, but without the analysis, I can't be certain. I’ll write the order now. Go to the lab window and they will give you a cup. Bring the sample back as soon as possible. We'll take it from there. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A cup… I see. Well… I suppose not. Just… tell me, is it… catching? Will I pass it on to anyone? And… will I feel better quickly? I really must get home now. Thank you, Doctor. .
