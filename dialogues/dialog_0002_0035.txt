DOCTOR: Hi Mirriam, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Lovely to meet you too. It’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, a good few days now. Quite persistent, they are. Not painful, just… annoying!
DOCTOR: Annoying is a good word for it! A few days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, started… let me think… Tuesday, I believe. Tuesday afternoon, after I had my tea. Now, I can’t rightly recall what I had with my tea, but it was a nice biscuit, I’m sure of it. A ginger snap, maybe? Oh dear, getting old, you know. Details just… slip away. But the hiccups started shortly after.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mirriam. It happens to the best of us! We can figure this out even without remembering the exact biscuit. So, they started Tuesday afternoon and have been pretty consistent since then?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty consistent. Not every second, mind you. They come and go. But they're there, lurking, you know? Especially when I try to relax. Trying to watch my stories on the telly, or have a nice cup of chamomile… hic! There they go again. Just when I get comfortable.
DOCTOR: That sounds frustrating, especially when they interfere with things you enjoy. And it sounds like they might be triggered by relaxing, which is… not ideal. Have you noticed anything else that seems to bring them on, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now, I did have a bit of a fright on Wednesday. Young Timothy – that’s my grandson – he decided to “help” me with the gardening. Nearly knocked over my prize-winning hibiscus! Gave me quite a jump, it did. Hic! Perhaps that had something to do with it? It certainly made my heart race.
DOCTOR: That could very well be a factor, Mirriam. A sudden fright can certainly cause hiccups. And a racing heart is a common reaction. Aside from the fright and relaxing, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, no other symptoms, Doctor. Just the hiccups. No heartburn, no trouble breathing, no feeling unwell. I've been eating normally, sleeping alright… well, as alright as an 86-year-old can sleep! A little creaky in the mornings, but that's just the bones, I reckon. Hic! Honestly, they’re just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No other symptoms is helpful. And yes, a little creakiness is perfectly normal at 86! Let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline and make sure everything sounds clear. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just a quick look, you say? Alright then. Go right ahead. Hic! Though I warn you, I'm a bit bony these days!
DOCTOR: A little bony is perfectly fine. It just means I might need to listen a bit closer. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, heart sounds good, regular rhythm. Lungs are clear on both sides. No wheezing or crackles. Now let's take a peek at your ears and throat… Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Throat is a little dry, but no redness or swelling. Everything sounds and looks good so far.
PATIENT: Well, that’s good to hear, Doctor. I always worry it’s something serious when these things happen. Old bones, you know, they feel like they’re falling apart sometimes! Hic! So, what do you think is causing these pesky hiccups then? Is it something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: It's good you came in to get it checked out, Mirriam. Most of the time, hiccups are completely harmless and go away on their own. Given your history, and the physical exam, I suspect these are likely just a case of benign, persistent hiccups. Sometimes a fright, like with Timothy, or even just a change in routine can trigger them. However, because they have been going on for a few days now, and to be on the safe side, I'd like to run a quick blood test to check your electrolyte levels and rule out anything unusual. It's a simple procedure, and it will help give us a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a blood test. Well, alright then. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I’ve had those before, haven’t I? A little prick, and then it’s done. It’s just… I hate needles, you know? Hic! But if it will put my mind at ease, then yes, let’s do it. What exactly are you looking for in the blood? Just curious, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mirriam. Needles aren’t anyone’s favorite. It’s a quick prick, and the phlebotomist is very good. We’re just looking at a few things – your potassium, sodium, and calcium levels. Sometimes imbalances in those electrolytes can cause persistent hiccups. We’ll also check your kidney function, just to be thorough. It’s really just routine, and it will help us rule out any underlying causes. While we're waiting for the results, let’s try a few things to see if we can get them to stop. Have you tried holding your breath?
PATIENT: Oh, holding my breath? Yes, I’ve tried that! Old wives’ tale, you know. My mother used to tell me to hold my breath and drink a glass of water upside down. Didn't work then, and it doesn’t work now! Hic! Though I must admit, it did make a mess. And I’m a bit unsteady on my feet these days, so that wasn’t very wise. What else is there? I've heard about sugar… but I’m trying to watch my sugar intake, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, the upside-down water trick is a bit tricky! And wise of you to avoid the sugar. Let's skip that one. Sometimes a teaspoon of vinegar diluted in water can help stimulate the vagus nerve, which can calm the hiccups. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Vinegar, you say? Oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. I don’t much care for vinegar, Doctor. Makes my mouth pucker! Hic! But… if it might help… alright. I suppose I can try a little bit. Just a little bit, mind you. I don’t want to ruin my tea!
DOCTOR: Just a teaspoon in a glass of water, Mirriam. It’s worth a try. If that doesn’t work, and the blood tests come back normal, we can discuss a few other options, but often hiccups resolve on their own. Let's get that blood draw done, and then we can see if the vinegar helps. While we wait for the results, just try to relax, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid any sudden changes in temperature or activity. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, Doctor. Thank you for listening to me. It's just nice to talk it through, you know? Hic! And I appreciate you not thinking I'm completely silly for worrying about hiccups. Let's get this blood test done, and hopefully, these pesky things will go away soon.
DOCTOR: You're not silly at all, Mirriam. It's always best to get things checked out, and I'm happy to help. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood. She’ll explain the process, and it won’t take long. We’ll get those results back to you as soon as possible. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. You have a lovely day now. And thank you again for everything. .
