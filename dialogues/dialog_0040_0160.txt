DOCTOR: Right. Candis Hardenburgh. 79. Okay. Well, don't just sit there, dear. Tell me what brings you in today. And try to be concise, I have a waiting room full of people.
PATIENT: Honestly, it's this tiredness. It's just… getting worse. And it's embarrassing to even say, but I've been… eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you, but enough that I figured I should probably get it checked out. It sounds ridiculous, I know.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt. Clay, really. I find it… soothing. Don't look at me like that, doctor. It's not like I'm munching on rocks, it's just… earthy. And it started a few months ago, but now I feel weak and I have this craving all the time. It’s a bit unsettling, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Soothing?
PATIENT: Well, it is. It's hard to explain to someone who hasn't… experienced it. It’s a texture thing, mostly. And a… a feeling. Look, are we going to sit here dissecting my personal habits, or are you going to find out why I'm suddenly exhausted and craving things I shouldn't be eating? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Let’s just get through this. Exhaustion and…pica, I suppose we'll call it. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, let me think… everything feels a bit… sluggish, if that makes sense. My stomach hasn’t been right, either. Not pain, exactly, just… unsettled. And I’ve been more irritable than usual, which, believe me, is saying something. My granddaughter keeps telling me I need to slow down, but honestly, who has time for that? It’s probably just old age.
DOCTOR: "Sluggish"…Irritability… Alright. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in my… what now? Oh. You mean… going to the bathroom? Look, doctor, I'm 79, not a medical textbook. It's been… normal, I suppose. A little… different, maybe. Harder to… go, sometimes. And I've been a bit more… blocked up than usual. Is that what you wanted to know? Honestly, these questions are a bit personal.
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a complete picture, dear. Alright. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. And I haven’t felt sick to my stomach, not really. Just… off. Like something isn’t quite right. I keep trying to brush it off as getting older, but this tiredness… it’s really interfering with everything. I used to be so active, and now I can barely make it through the garden without needing a nap. It's infuriating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen to your tummy and feel around a bit. Tell me if anything feels painful. Just… relax.
PATIENT: Honestly, you're poking around quite a bit. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it's… uncomfortable. And I can feel my stomach rumbling. It’s probably just the dirt. Is it even possible to be deficient in… earth? This is ridiculous. Just get on with it, please. I haven't got all day to be prodded and poked.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Bowel sounds are… diminished. And a little sluggish, just as you said. No masses that I can feel. But your abdomen is… tender in the lower quadrants. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I feel hungry, which isn’t as often as it used to be. Everything just tastes… bland, now. Even my granddaughter's cooking, and she’s a very good cook. It's probably just old age affecting my taste buds. Look, are you going to tell me what's wrong, or are you just going to keep poking and prodding and asking silly questions? I’m starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Faint?
PATIENT: Yes, faint. A little dizzy, definitely. And weak. Honestly, doctor, this is getting ridiculous. I came here because I'm tired and eating dirt, not to be interrogated and prodded and left feeling even worse. Are you even listening to me? I need answers, and I need them now. I haven't got time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Look, your weight is a bit low for your height. And the history, coupled with the exam… it could be iron deficiency anemia. The dirt eating is… unusual, but sometimes people with deficiencies crave strange things. But we need to run some blood tests to confirm. And frankly, given your age, we should also rule out other possibilities. I’ll order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel.
PATIENT: Finally! Blood tests. That’s sensible. And what exactly does “rule out other possibilities” mean? I don’t want to be subjected to a battery of unnecessary tests. I just want to know why I’m tired and craving dirt, not have every organ in my body examined. And how long will these tests take? I have a garden to tend, you know. Honestly, the inefficiency of this whole process is appalling. .
DOCTOR: The lab work should take a couple of days. "Other possibilities" means things like…malabsorption issues, or other underlying conditions. Don't worry, dear. It’s standard procedure. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood before you leave. And please, try to avoid eating any more dirt until we have the results. It won't help. Now, if that’s all… I have other patients waiting. .
