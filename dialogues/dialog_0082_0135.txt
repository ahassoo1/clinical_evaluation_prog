DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is good to meet you too. I have… problem with my ear. It… how you say… discharge. Coming out. Been happening for… maybe three days now. Not much pain, but… wet.
DOCTOR: Okay, a discharge from your ear for about three days, not much pain… just wet, you said. Alright. Can you tell me a little more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear. Sometimes… little bit yellow. Not… not smelly. I try to clean it… with cloth. But it keep coming. Is from… this ear. <points to his left ear> I think. Is not… bad pain, like… shooting pain. Just… feeling full. Like… water inside.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear to yellowish discharge, no odor, you’ve been trying to clean it with a cloth… and it’s coming from your left ear. And you describe a feeling of fullness, like water inside. Do you notice any hearing changes with this?
PATIENT: Yes. Is… little bit hard to hear. Especially… when people speak quiet. I ask my wife to… repeat things. But… she is not here now. She… we are divorced. But… yes, hearing is not so good on this ear. Is not… gone completely. Just… muffled. Like… talking underwater.
DOCTOR: Alright, muffled hearing in the left ear along with the discharge and fullness. Have you had any fever, chills, or any dizziness associated with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. I feel… normal. Just… ear problem. And… sometimes little bit tired. But is… is August. Is hot. Maybe from the heat. No dizziness. I walk… okay. Everything… spin normal. <He gestures with his hand in a small circle to demonstrate.>
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or dizziness. Just the ear discharge, fullness, and muffled hearing. Have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, pain, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… when I was young… in Somalia… I have ear pain. Maybe infection. But… very long time ago. The doctor… give me drops. I forget what kind. Everything… was okay after. But… since then… no. No problems. Until now. This is… new. I am… 60 years old. Things start to… break. <He chuckles softly.>
DOCTOR: Alright. A history of ear pain as a child, treated with drops. Okay. Now, let's take a quick look in your ear. I just want to get a better view and see what's going on. It won't take long. <I reach for an otoscope.> Just relax and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is… good. I sit. I relax. You look. Is… alright. I tell you… if something is hurt. Just… careful. My ear… is sensitive. <He winces slightly.>
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm seeing some swelling in the ear canal and some discharge. The eardrum looks a little cloudy, but it's hard to get a completely clear view. It doesn’t appear to be a hole in the eardrum, but it’s difficult to say for sure. I’m also going to check your temperature and listen to your heart and lungs just to get a complete picture. <I proceed with a quick physical exam, noting normal vital signs and clear lung sounds.> Your temperature is normal, and your heart and lungs sound good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I do not think so. No. I take… little pill for my blood pressure. Is… lisinopril. But no… allergies. Never had… reaction to anything. I eat… everything. Spicy food… everything. Never problem. My wife… she is allergic to… cats. But I am not. <He pauses, thinking.> No allergies. I am sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. You take lisinopril for blood pressure and no known allergies. Now, based on what you've told me and what I've seen, it sounds like you likely have an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa. The swelling and discharge are consistent with that. It's often caused by bacteria or fungi getting into the ear canal, especially with moisture. However, to be sure, I’d like to send a sample of the discharge to the lab to identify what’s causing the infection. That way we can make sure we give you the right medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? Is… serious? The lab… you take something from my ear? I… I do not like things go inside my ear. But… if you think is best… okay. If you need… I let you take something. But… gentle. Please. Is… sensitive. What kind of… medicine you give me? Is… pills? Or… drops? Drops is… better. I think. No pills. <He looks apprehensive.>
DOCTOR: It's not usually serious, Mr. Radillo, but it can be uncomfortable, and it's best to treat it to prevent it from getting worse. We’ll take a small sample of the discharge with a sterile swab - it shouldn't hurt much, and I'll be very gentle. And you’re right, drops are usually the first line of treatment for otitis externa. We'll use antibiotic ear drops to kill the bacteria or fungus. I'll also prescribe a little bit of a steroid drop to help reduce the swelling and inflammation. No pills needed, thankfully. Would you be comfortable with me collecting the sample now?
PATIENT: Okay… drops is good. No pills. That… is good. And… you are gentle. Yes. Collect… sample. Okay. You… you do it. But… quickly. Please. I… I do not want to sit here all day. Is… sensitive. Very sensitive. <He winces again, anticipating the procedure.>
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. I'm going to gently clean the outside of your ear canal with this cotton swab first. Then, I’ll very gently insert a clean swab into the ear canal just to collect a small sample of the discharge. It should only take a few seconds. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible, I promise. <I carefully clean the outside of his ear and then gently insert the swab into his left ear canal for a brief moment. I withdraw the swab and place it in a specimen container.> There we go. All done. Just a quick little sample. I'll send this to the lab and we should have the results back in a couple of days. Now, I'm going to write you a prescription for antibiotic/steroid ear drops. You’ll need to put two drops in your left ear twice a day for seven days. It’s important to finish the whole course of treatment, even if your ear starts to feel better. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Two drops… twice a day… seven days. Finish… all. Yes. Is… clear. I write it down. <He pulls out a small notepad and scribbles a note.> Seven days. Two times. I remember. And… how long until… feel better? Is… fast? I have… appointment next week. I hope… ear is okay by then. And… what if… is not better? What if… it still hurt? <He looks concerned.>
DOCTOR: Most people start to feel better within a few days with the ear drops, Mr. Radillo. However, it can take up to a week for the infection to completely clear. If your ear doesn’t start to improve after three days, or if it gets worse at any point – more pain, fever, dizziness, or hearing loss – please call the clinic right away. We may need to switch to a different medication or investigate further. We'll also follow up with you in a week to see how you’re doing, just to make sure everything is healing properly. <I pause.> Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think… that is all. You are… very kind, Doctor. Thank you for… looking at my ear. And… writing down the drops. I will… remember. Seven days. Two times. <He smiles weakly.> Thank you. I think… I go now. Is… hot outside. <He slowly rises from the chair.>
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And you're right, it is hot out there. Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon. <I offer him a friendly nod as he heads towards the door.> .
