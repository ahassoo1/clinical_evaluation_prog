DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I'm Dr. Voytek. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… the back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Feels like a… a heavy weight, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head for about three days, comes and goes, and you describe it as a heavy weight. Can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… after I was working with the dinkey. Moving the cars around in the yard. It was a hot day, very hot. I was lifting some things too, not very heavy, but still. Lifting and pushing… you know, what I do. It started that evening, after I got home.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it began after a day of work—moving cars, some lifting—and it started that evening. Was there anything specific that you were doing when the pain first started?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was… sitting in my chair, watching the news. Just relaxing. Then… boom. Not a big boom, but… it started. A dull ache, right at the back. I thought maybe I just needed to rest. But it keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it started spontaneously while you were resting, after a physically active day. And it's a dull ache at the back of your head. Has anything made it better or worse since then?
PATIENT: Well… lying down sometimes helps a little. But not much. And… when I bend over, it gets worse. Like when I'm trying to tie my shoes, or… pick something up off the floor. That really makes it hurt. No pills, no nothing seems to make it go away for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down provides some relief, but bending over makes it worse. And over-the-counter pain relievers haven't helped much. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe a little tired, but I'm always a little tired. No blurry vision, no… dizziness. Just the headache. And… sometimes my neck feels stiff, but I don't know if that's from the headache or… old age! Heh.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other symptoms like blurry vision or dizziness, and some neck stiffness. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had… the flu, a few times. And my knees bother me, you know, from all the work. But no… nothing serious. The doctor, back in Guatemala, he checked me up when I was younger. Said my heart was strong. And… I haven’t seen a doctor in a long time. Too expensive, you know? Especially now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, some knee pain, and a history of a strong heart from a check-up years ago. And I understand the concern about costs. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. I've been lucky, I guess. Just… bumps and bruises from working. Nothing that needed a hospital. My wife… she had some problems with her stomach, years ago. But… she’s gone now.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife. Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife… she was allergic to some kind of flower. But I don’t remember what kind. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're not currently taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pills, no nothing. I try to stay away from them if I can. My wife… she took some for her stomach, but I don't now what they were called. I don’t like taking things if I don't need them. Makes me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications currently. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength, and also feel around your head and neck. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle with my neck, okay? It's a little… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be. If you could sit up there for me, please. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. There's some tenderness to palpation in the occipital muscles – the muscles at the base of your skull. No obvious swelling or masses. Range of motion in your neck is limited due to pain, particularly with extension and rotation. I also noticed some mild stiffness.
PATIENT: Hmm… that doesn't surprise me. It does hurt when I move my neck. And… the back of my head feels… tight. Like a knot, sometimes. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad," but it’s definitely something we need to investigate further. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you might have a muscle strain or tension headache, possibly related to the work you were doing. However, given your age and the location of the pain, I want to rule out anything more serious, just to be safe. Would you be willing to get an X-ray of your neck and head?
PATIENT: An X-ray…? Is it… is it expensive, Doctor? I don't have much money, you know. And… is it dangerous? I’ve heard things about those machines… And… what are we looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. Let's address them one by one. Yes, X-rays do cost money, and I'm aware of your financial situation. We do have some options to help with the cost. We can look into programs for patients who are uninsured, or discuss a payment plan. As for the danger, the amount of radiation from an X-ray is very low. We always use the lowest dose possible and take precautions to protect you. The benefits of ruling out something serious outweigh the small risk. What we’re looking for is any signs of arthritis in your neck, or any problems with the bones themselves. It's just a precaution, Mr. Brum. If you're still hesitant about the X-ray, we could try some conservative treatment first – like muscle relaxants and physical therapy. However, if the pain doesn't improve, or if it gets worse, we would need to get imaging eventually. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm… conservative treatment sounds… better. Less scary, less expensive. Muscle relaxants… what are those? Will they make me sleepy? I need to be able to… do things, you know? And physical therapy… will that hurt? I… I don't want to be in more pain. And… I don't want to spend a lot of money if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a very reasonable approach. Muscle relaxants can help ease the tension in your neck muscles. They can cause some drowsiness as a side effect, but it varies from person to person. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If you experience significant drowsiness, we can adjust the dosage or try a different medication. Physical therapy involves exercises and stretches to improve your range of motion and strengthen your neck muscles. It shouldn't cause more pain, but it might be a little uncomfortable at first. The therapist will work with you to make sure the exercises are appropriate for your level of pain and tolerance. Let's start with a prescription for a muscle relaxant, and a referral to physical therapy. I'm going to write you a prescription for cyclobenzaprine, 5mg, to take three times a day for one week. And I’ll have the receptionist schedule you for an initial evaluation with a physical therapist. Does that sound like a plan you're comfortable with?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Cyclobenzaprine… I'll try it. And… physical therapy. I hope it helps. Thank you, Doctor Voytek. You’ve been… very patient with an old man. And… thank you for not making me get that… X-ray right away. I appreciate that. My wife… she always liked doctors who listened.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. It's my job to listen and make sure you’re comfortable with the plan. And I'm glad we could find a solution you’re happy with. Here is your prescription for the cyclobenzaprine. Please let the pharmacy know if you have any allergies or other medications you're taking. And the receptionist will get you scheduled for physical therapy before you leave. I want you to follow up with me in one week to let me know how you're doing. If your pain gets worse, or if you experience any new symptoms, please call my office right away. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you again. I… I appreciate your kindness. And… thank you for listening. I'm going to go now, I think.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. Take care of yourself, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. The receptionist is right over there, she'll help you schedule your physical therapy appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
PATIENT: .
