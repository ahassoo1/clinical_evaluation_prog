DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day, so let’s get straight to it. I want to have a baby. And I want it to be…easy. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I don’t want any…complications. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly clear. You’re hoping to conceive and want to discuss making that process as smooth as possible. And you’re right to be proactive. We'll certainly explore all options. Just to start, have you been trying for a while, or is this a new consideration?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not trying. I’m…planning. There's a difference. I just want to make sure everything is as it should be, before I…begin. I don't want any unpleasant surprises. Frankly, I thought it would just…happen. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable. Planning is smart. And you’re right, for many people it does happen easily. But it’s always wise to have a check-up beforehand, especially as we get older. To get a good picture of things, let's go through some questions, if that’s alright with you. First, can you tell me about your regular menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh. Cycles. Really? Must we? Look, I’ve always been…regular enough. What do you need to know, exactly? Length? Bleeding? Honestly, I don’t keep a calendar. It’s not like I was charting this, you know? I just…know when it happens. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s not a problem at all. We just need a general idea. Roughly, how long between periods?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. Roughly… around 28 days, I suppose. Maybe a little longer, sometimes. It varies. And it’s not like clockwork, if that’s what you’re getting at. It's not a machine! Look, is that good enough, or do you need a detailed spreadsheet? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Twenty-eight days is a good starting point. And no spreadsheet needed. Now, how heavy is your typical period?
PATIENT: Heavy? What does that even mean? Normal, I suppose. Not…flooding, if that’s what you’re asking. Enough to require…products. Is that sufficient? I haven't spent my life measuring it! Honestly, doctor, you ask the strangest questions. It's a period! It happens!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm just trying to get a complete picture. Knowing the amount of blood loss can help us identify potential issues. Okay, let’s move on. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Divorced, remember? One. A long time ago. And a…disappointment. I don’t really want to relive it, if you don't mind. It ended…poorly. I want this to be different. This time I want everything to be…right. Are you writing all this down? I hope so. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting everything, Ms. Shteynberg. And I understand you want this experience to be positive. One previous pregnancy…and it didn’t end as you hoped. Was that a live birth, or a miscarriage?
PATIENT: Miscarriage. Early on. A waste of time, really. And quite unpleasant. I don’t like to think about it. It was…a long time ago. Why are we going over this? What does it even matter now? I want a baby now, not a history lesson. I need to know what you can do for me.
DOCTOR: You're right to focus on the future, Ms. Shteynberg. Knowing your history helps me understand any potential risks and plan accordingly. Now, let's talk about your medical background. Do you have any existing health conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Look, I'm generally healthy. I eat reasonably well, I don’t smoke, and I walk. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s under control now, with medication. A small dose. Nothing dramatic. And that's it. I don't like doctors, so I avoid them when possible. Is that good enough? Or do you need a list of every headache I’ve ever had?
DOCTOR: That's good information, Ms. Shteynberg. Medication for blood pressure…and otherwise healthy. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. And a multivitamin. You know, to stay healthy. Nothing fancy. I read something about folic acid being good for…well, you know. So I’ve been taking one of those sometimes. Not every day, mind you. Honestly, I forget half the time. Is that a problem? I have a terrible memory.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and occasional folic acid. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. I eat everything. I’m Hungarian, you know? We eat…everything. No allergies. I'm perfectly fine. Honestly, this is taking far too long. Are we getting anywhere, or are you just trying to fill up your charts? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Ms. Shteynberg. Just a few more questions, and then we can discuss a plan. Finally, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Everyone has something. My mother had heart trouble, eventually. And my aunt had…cancer, I think. Something with her breast. It was a long time ago. Look, it's a family! People get sick. Is that helpful? I don’t keep a medical registry for my relatives, you know. I’m trying to have a baby, not write a novel. .
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Ms. Shteynberg, based on what you’ve told me, and given your age, I recommend a few basic blood tests to assess your overall health and check hormone levels. Also, a pelvic exam would be helpful. We can schedule those tests for tomorrow. Would that be alright?
