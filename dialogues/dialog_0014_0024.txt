DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Osterholm. I need a letter saying I’m able to fly. It’s for… well, it’s a bit complicated, but my travel insurance requires it. I’m planning a trip overseas next month, and they need confirmation from a doctor before they’ll cover anything.
DOCTOR: A letter for travel insurance… Right. So, they just need a general statement saying you’re able to fly?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It sounds silly, I know. They didn’t ask for anything specific, just a doctor’s note. I just… thought it would be easier to get it sorted out now than to deal with it while I’m already traveling. Is that something you can do?
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose I can write a note. It’s just… it’s a bit unusual to clear someone for something without knowing why they might not be. Do you have any… pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I lost my husband last year, and… honestly, that’s been the biggest thing. Physically, I’m fine. I exercise regularly, eat well… I have Medicare, if that helps? I don’t usually need to see a doctor, but I figured it’s better to be safe than sorry with the insurance company.
DOCTOR: Medicare… yes, I see that. And you said you lost your husband last year. I'm sorry to hear that. That's… a significant life event. Still, to write a note saying you're fit to fly, I need to at least ask a few basic questions. Just routine. Have you had any recent hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, no hospitalizations. Not for years. Just the usual check-ups with my primary care physician. And… a broken wrist when I was a teenager, but that was ages ago. Really, I’m very healthy. I’m just trying to anticipate any problems with the insurance company. They can be… particular. Is there a form I need to fill out, maybe? Would that make it easier?
DOCTOR: No, there’s no specific form. It’s just… I prefer to have a little more information before I write these things. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No medications at all. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I’m being interrogated! I understand you need to be thorough, but I really just need a simple letter saying I’m healthy enough to travel. I don’t have any complicated medical history. Is there anything specific you’re worried about? Maybe if you tell me what they need to know, I can answer directly.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sayar, I’m not trying to interrogate you. It's just… people come in asking for these letters all the time, and half the time they conveniently 'forget' to mention important things. For example, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. None at all. Food, medication, pollen… nothing. I promise. I'm trying to be as helpful as possible, but this is getting a bit frustrating. I just want to go on a trip to visit my sister. It’s been a hard year, and I really need this. Do you need to check my blood pressure or something? I’m happy to do whatever it takes, I just wish we could get this sorted out quickly.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let's just do a quick check of your vitals. It's standard procedure. Then we’ll see. Arm please. And just so we are clear, you haven't experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness recently?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness. I walk five miles every morning! I'm perfectly healthy. Honestly, I think I'm healthier than most people my age. Just please, can we get this letter done? I have a flight to book.
DOCTOR: 120 over 80. Pulse is 72. Not bad… Alright. And you said no family history of… blood clots or anything?
PATIENT: No, no family history of blood clots, heart problems, or anything like that. My parents were both very healthy, and my sister is too. They lived to be almost ninety! Look, I understand you’re being careful, but honestly, I think this is getting a little excessive. I’m starting to feel like I need a full physical exam just to get a letter saying I’m fit to fly. Is there anything else you need to know, or can we please move on?
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose I can write a brief note stating that you are currently in stable condition and have no immediately apparent contraindications to air travel. But it’s a very basic statement, Ms. Sayar. Don’t expect it to cover anything beyond that. It's more of a formality than a comprehensive medical clearance. Do you have a preferred method of receiving this note?
PATIENT: That’s… acceptable. A formality is fine! I just need something to appease the insurance company. You can email it to me, please. My email address is kiante.sayar@email.com. And thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time, even if it was a little… thorough. I’m sure they’ll be happy with that.
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. It states that you are currently in stable condition with no immediate contraindications to air travel. As I said, it’s a basic statement. Don’t expect it to cover pre-existing conditions or potential complications. And frankly, Ms. Sayar, I still think it’s unusual to request a letter like this without any specific reason. But that’s your business. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you. This is perfect, thank you so much. No, that’s all. Honestly, I think I’ll just be glad when this trip is over. Thank you again, Doctor Osterholm. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. You too. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you experience any changes in your condition.
