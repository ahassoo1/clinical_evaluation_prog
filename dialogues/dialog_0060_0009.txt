DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Alcorta is the name, yes. It’s… well, it’s my eyesight, you see. It’s not what it used to be. Frankly, it’s been going downhill for some time now, and I suppose I should have addressed it sooner. But one puts things off, doesn’t one?
DOCTOR: Yes, people do. Alright, “eyesight declining.” Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm. Well, things just aren’t clear anymore. Like looking through… a dirty window, perhaps. And it’s not a sudden thing, it's gradual. It’s difficult to make out details, especially at a distance. Though, even up close it’s becoming troublesome. I find myself needing more and more light to read, for instance. Not that I do much reading these days. Mostly just the newspaper.
DOCTOR: Right. Gradual onset, blurry vision, difficulty with details at both distance and near… needing more light. And this has been happening for… how long exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. It's not like there was a specific day I noticed it. Perhaps… a year, maybe a year and a half? It’s hard to pinpoint. I suppose I first noticed it when trying to read road signs on the highway. They just weren’t as crisp as they used to be. I dismissed it initially, thought it was just fatigue. But it’s… persisted. And worsened, naturally. It's not a sudden change, Doctor. I'm not going blind overnight, am I?
DOCTOR: No, certainly not. A year and a half of gradual decline… alright. And is this affecting your daily activities beyond reading the newspaper and driving?
PATIENT: Well… yes, I suppose it is. I used to enjoy tinkering in the garden, small repairs around the house, that sort of thing. But it's become… frustrating. Difficult to see the small screws, the tiny details. I've found myself making more mistakes, things not quite right. And truthfully, I've just… stopped doing as much of it. It's not worth the aggravation, really. Though, my daughter keeps telling me I should get it checked out. She worries, you see. Women. Always worrying.
DOCTOR: Right. Frustration with detail-oriented tasks, avoiding those tasks… alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not particularly. No flashing lights, no pain, no double vision. Everything is just… dim, and blurry. It's not as if I'm seeing spots or anything dramatic like that. It’s just… a general lack of clarity. I suppose my eyes feel a bit strained sometimes, after prolonged reading, but that's hardly a surprise. I haven't noticed anything unusual, if that makes sense. Just the expected decline of age, I presume.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, no flashing lights, no double vision. Just blurriness and strain with prolonged reading. And you attribute this to age?
PATIENT: Well, what else would it be? I’m not a young man anymore, Doctor. Fifty-two years old, and I haven't exactly taken the best care of myself, if I’m being honest. Long hours at work, not enough sleep, and a fondness for a good whiskey now and then. It stands to reason my eyesight would suffer. It's not like I expect to have the vision of an eagle at my age. Though, my grandfather lived to be ninety, and he could still thread a needle. But then again, he was a Cherokee medicine man. Perhaps it's in the blood. I don't know. I just assume it’s a natural process.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get a proper look, then. We’ll do a basic visual acuity test, check your pupils, and I’ll take a quick look at the back of your eyes. It's just to rule things out, really. Don't want to assume anything. If you'll just follow me over to the exam chair.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Lead the way. I appreciate your thoroughness. Though, I still maintain it’s probably just age. But one can never be too careful, I suppose. And it's better to know, than to wonder. Though I suspect I won't like the answer. Still, let's get on with it. I have a luncheon with the Rotary Club next week and I'd prefer to be able to read the menu.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll start with your distance vision. Please stand about ten feet away and cover your left eye with your hand. Read the smallest line you can make out on the chart. Don't strain, just read what you can see clearly.
PATIENT: Ten feet… right. Hmm. I can see the… the big E at the top, of course. And the next line… I think… is that a P? No… an R? It’s rather blurry, Doctor. I’m not entirely certain. It's difficult to make out the shapes. This isn't promising, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it's not ideal. Okay, let’s try the other eye. Cover your right eye now. And again, read the smallest line you can clearly see.
PATIENT: All right… This one… is even worse, I believe. I can barely make out the large letters at the top. The E… and perhaps a faint outline of the next one, but nothing more. This is… disconcerting, Doctor. Truly. I hadn’t realized it was this bad. I’ve been compensating, I suppose. Relying on one eye more than the other. It’s a shame, really. I used to have excellent vision.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pupils are equal and reactive to light, but… there’s a bit of clouding of the lens in both eyes. Not severe, but present. I’m going to use an ophthalmoscope now to get a look at the back of your eyes. It won’t hurt, but it will be a bright light. Just look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Clouding of the lens, you say? That doesn’t sound particularly good. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. A bright light, you say? Well, get it over with then. I've faced worse, I assure you. It is rather bright. Is everything alright, Doctor? You're awfully quiet.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There's some mild drusen present in both eyes, which is common with age, but nothing alarming at this point. The optic nerves appear healthy. However… the clouding of the lens is more significant than I initially thought. It's consistent with cataracts. And your visual acuity is significantly reduced in both eyes. It's not a sudden condition, as you suspected, but it is progressing. We need to discuss your options.
PATIENT: Cataracts, you say? I’ve heard of those. My grandmother had them, I believe. She went nearly blind before they could do anything about it. Progressing, you say? So, it will get worse. I suppose I knew it couldn't last forever. Options, you say? What options are there, exactly? Surgery, I presume? I’ve heard… mixed reviews about those sorts of things. And frankly, I’m not keen on having anything poked and prodded at, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Well, yes, surgery is the most effective treatment for cataracts. Modern cataract surgery is a very safe and common procedure. It involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial one. The success rate is very high, and most people experience a significant improvement in their vision. Of course, it’s your decision. We can also discuss managing your vision with stronger glasses for now, but that’s just a temporary solution. It won’t stop the cataracts from progressing. Frankly, waiting too long can make the surgery more complicated. We can schedule a consultation with an ophthalmologist for a more detailed evaluation and to discuss your specific options. I'll give you a referral.
PATIENT: A temporary solution… of course. Just like everything else. I suppose I had hoped for a miracle. Or at least, a less… invasive approach. An ophthalmologist, you say? Very well. Send me to your specialist, then. I'll listen to what he has to say. But don’t expect me to jump at the first offer of a scalpel. Frankly, I've never been one for unnecessary procedures. And I'd like to know all the risks involved, before I consent to anything. Send the referral, Doctor. And I'll consider my options.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the receptionist send that over to you. I'm also going to give you a prescription for stronger glasses in the meantime. It won’t fix the problem, but it should help you see a little better. And I strongly encourage you to schedule that consultation as soon as possible. The sooner you address this, the better. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that will be all. You've confirmed my suspicions, and provided me with the next step. I appreciate your… thoroughness. Though I still maintain a skeptical outlook. I'll consult with your specialist, and make my own decision. Thank you for your time, Doctor. .
