DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Mutnick. It is… a little embarrassing, truthfully. I have been, shall we say, passing gas. A lot of gas. More than usual, and it is… disruptive. It started maybe a week ago, and it happens throughout the day. Not painful, just… frequent.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say. Well, let us attempt to ascertain the cause of this… disruption. A week ago, you indicate. Has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Yes, a week ago… Let me think. Hmm. No, not really. I eat the same things mostly. I work at the burger place, so… burgers, fries, sometimes a soda. I do not cook much at home. Perhaps a little more cabbage than usual? My neighbor gave me some, and I did not want to be rude, so I ate it.
DOCTOR: Cabbage, of course. A rather… gaseous vegetable. And you consume this regularly?
PATIENT: Not regularly, Doctor. Just… that one time. A decent-sized plateful, though. It was very kind of Mrs. Henderson to share. She makes a lovely sauerkraut, too, but I did not have any of that. Only the cabbage.
DOCTOR: So, a rather substantial portion of cabbage consumed in a single sitting. And you are certain nothing else has altered in your routine?
PATIENT: Yes, quite certain. I take the bus to work, and back. I watch television in the evenings. I do not have any new hobbies, or… new friends, or anything like that. Just the cabbage, really. And maybe a little extra soda last Tuesday, because it was hot.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, with all due respect, these… anecdotal details are not particularly helpful. We are attempting to diagnose a medical condition, not compile a social history. Do you experience any abdominal pain, bloating, or changes in your bowel habits alongside this… increased flatulence?
PATIENT: Oh! I… I apologize, Doctor. I did not mean to be… rambling. No, no pain. Just… a feeling of fullness, sometimes. And, yes, perhaps a little bloating. My trousers feel… snugger than usual, if you understand. Bowel habits are… normal, I suppose. Regular. Just… accompanied by the… gas.
DOCTOR: Snugger trousers. Right. And have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No, Doctor. Not at all. Everything looks… normal in that regard. Just the… the sounds, and the smell. It is quite unpleasant, I must admit. And it makes it difficult to concentrate at work.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed with a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We will begin with auscultation of your abdomen. Remove your trousers, please. I need to listen to your bowel sounds.
PATIENT: Oh. Remove my… trousers? Is that… necessary, Doctor? Surely listening to my abdomen through my clothing would be sufficient? I am a bit… self-conscious, you understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, with all due respect, a proper medical assessment requires a proper examination. Listening through clothing is… inadequate. It compromises the accuracy of the diagnostic process. Unless you wish to continue experiencing this… disruption indefinitely, I suggest you comply. This is not a matter of personal preference, but of professional obligation. Now, please.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. If you believe it is necessary… I suppose I have no other choice. It is rather cold in here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Bowel sounds are… hyperactive. Increased motility, as suspected. No abnormal bruits or rubs detected. Palpate your abdomen, Mr. Goodstein. Is there any tenderness?
PATIENT: Tenderness? No, Doctor, not really. It feels… normal, I suppose. A little… gurgly, perhaps. But no pain when I press. It is… soft. Not hard or swollen. I hope that is helpful.
DOCTOR: Tympany is present, consistent with increased gas. No rebound tenderness or guarding observed. Very well. Based on your history and this preliminary examination, it appears you are experiencing symptoms consistent with… excessive intestinal gas, likely secondary to dietary indiscretion – specifically, the aforementioned cabbage.
PATIENT: Dietary… indiscretion? So, it is the cabbage? I thought as much, truthfully. Is there… anything I can do? Some sort of medication, perhaps? Or a special diet? I do not want to keep… disrupting my coworkers.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, I assure you, this is not a condition requiring pharmaceutical intervention. The solution is remarkably simple: modify your diet. Reduce your intake of gas-producing foods – cabbage being a prime example. Avoid carbonated beverages. And eat more slowly. I can provide you with a list of foods to avoid, but frankly, a simple internet search will suffice. This is not a serious medical condition, and I will not be prescribing medication for it. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. A list would be… appreciated, perhaps. I am not very good with the internet, you see. My neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, she helps me with things like that. But it is… embarrassing to ask her about this. No, I don't think I have any other concerns. Just… the cabbage. And perhaps the soda.
DOCTOR: Here. This outlines common gas-producing foods. I suggest you adhere to it. And limit your soda intake. Do not return unless you develop significant abdominal pain, fever, or blood in your stool. This concludes our consultation. .
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. Thank you… I think. Goodbye, Doctor Mutnick. And… thank you again. .
