DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here regarding a matter with my work. Specifically, the requirement to wear masks and certain other protective equipment. I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps an alternative.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you're seeking medical guidance regarding workplace requirements, specifically concerning mask-wearing and protective equipment. That's perfectly reasonable. To help me understand your situation better and determine if an exemption or alternative is appropriate, could you tell me a bit more about why you're seeking this?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s…difficult to explain simply. It isn’t a matter of discomfort, not precisely. It’s more…a feeling. A deep unease when my face is covered for extended periods. It affects my breathing, not in a way that stops it, but…it changes it. Makes it harder to focus, harder to be present. And I work with people, vulnerable people, and I need to be fully present for them. I realize it may sound unusual.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Knabenshue. It doesn’t sound unusual at all to want to be fully present when working with vulnerable individuals, and I appreciate you sharing this with me so openly. It's important to explore these feelings. To clarify, when you say it changes your breathing, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s not like I’m gasping for air, or feeling short of breath in a panicked way. It's…shallower, I suppose. And quicker. Almost like I'm constantly trying to catch my breath, even when I'm at rest. It causes a bit of dizziness, a lightheadedness. Not enough to be debilitating, but enough to be…distracting. And it’s worse the longer I have something covering my face. It's as if it constricts more than just the air. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you're experiencing some physiological responses – the shallower, quicker breathing and dizziness – triggered by having your face covered. We'll need to explore this further. Now, has this always been the case, or is this something that developed recently?
PATIENT: It's…recent, Doctor. Very recent. It began with the initial mask requirements, a couple of years ago, but I initially dismissed it as simply adjusting to something new. A bit of anxiety, I thought. But it hasn’t lessened with time, and if anything, it has grown more pronounced. I initially managed it, but the requirements have become stricter at my workplace. It’s only within the last few months that it has become a real issue. A hindrance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So it sounds like it started around the time of the initial mask mandates and has gradually worsened, particularly recently with stricter workplace policies. Before we proceed, let's get a more complete picture of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. No allergies to medications, foods, or anything else that I am aware of. I’ve always been fairly…robust, health-wise. Nothing serious ever. I did have chickenpox as a child, of course, but that’s about it. I've been fortunate, I suppose. Mostly just the usual bumps and bruises that come with life.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Knabenshue. And yes, chickenpox is quite common. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medications if possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, when it can. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about the extent of it. And not even regularly, to be honest. Mostly when I feel a bit run down.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. No current medications or regular supplements. Now, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As I mentioned, I’ve been quite healthy throughout my life. No major illnesses, no surgeries. I had the usual childhood vaccinations, of course. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but it healed cleanly. No chronic conditions. No heart trouble, no diabetes, no asthma. I've always been physically active, and I believe that has contributed to my good health. I spend a lot of time outdoors.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Knabenshue. A history of good health and physical activity is always positive. Now, thinking about your family—are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. My mother…she had high blood pressure later in life, and my father had some trouble with his knees, arthritis, I believe. On my mother’s side, there was an aunt who had…I believe it was some form of heart condition. But beyond that, nothing particularly significant that I am aware of. My family wasn’t particularly forthcoming about medical matters, to be honest. It wasn't something we discussed much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. High blood pressure in your mother, arthritis in your father, and a heart condition in an aunt. Thank you for sharing that. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I live alone, have for many years. I enjoy a quiet life. I work as a Protective Service Worker, as you know. It’s…demanding work, emotionally, but rewarding. I don’t drink alcohol, and I’ve never used tobacco or other substances. I have a few close friends, and I spend a lot of time with my community. We are very close. I find strength in that connection. I've always preferred the company of a few good people to large crowds.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Knabenshue. A strong community and meaningful work are both important. Now, just to confirm, and for documentation purposes, your height is 190 centimeters and your weight is 89 kilograms, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. 190 centimeters, and 89 kilograms. I haven't weighed myself recently, but those numbers are approximately accurate. I’ve always been a fairly tall and slender build.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Thank you for confirming that. Now, Mr. Knabenshue, to get a better understanding of what's happening, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Specifically, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and assess your breathing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I am happy to cooperate in any way that might be helpful. Listening to my heart and lungs, checking my blood pressure…whatever you deem necessary. Please proceed at your own pace. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound good, Mr. Knabenshue, and your blood pressure is within a normal range. Your breathing appears regular at rest. However, I would like you to take a few deep breaths for me while I observe. Okay. Your breathing is slightly quicker than average, but not significantly so. It doesn't appear to be causing you any immediate distress, but it is something we should investigate further. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order some basic bloodwork. It will check for any underlying inflammation or other conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Bloodwork to check for inflammation or other conditions…absolutely. I trust your professional opinion, and I’m happy to provide whatever samples are needed. Please let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare for the tests. I am ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Knabenshue. No special preparation is needed for the bloodwork. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw a few vials. The results should be available in a couple of days. In the meantime, given your description of the anxiety-like feelings you experience when wearing a mask, and the fact that the bloodwork will take a few days, I'd like to explore some strategies to manage those feelings while we await the results. Have you ever considered or tried any relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve never really been one for…exercises, or mindfulness, or anything of that nature. My community has always been my source of strength, and I’ve always relied on connection to others to manage stress. I suppose I’ve always been a bit skeptical of…internal techniques. I prefer to address things externally, with others. But I am willing to try, if you think it might be helpful. I just…I’m not sure where to begin.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Knabenshue. It's not for everyone, and it’s good you're open to considering it. Given your preference for external support, perhaps focusing on grounding techniques while wearing a mask might be a good starting point. These techniques help bring you back to the present moment and can reduce feelings of anxiety. For example, while wearing the mask, you could try focusing on the sensation of your feet on the ground, or deliberately noticing five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. It’s a simple exercise, but it can be surprisingly effective. We can also discuss referral to a therapist experienced in anxiety management if your symptoms persist or worsen. Would you like me to provide you with some resources on grounding techniques in the meantime?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be very kind of you. Resources on grounding techniques…that sounds like a good place to begin. Focusing on sensations…it’s not something I’ve ever done before, but I’m willing to try. And the referral to a therapist…I think that’s a wise precaution. I appreciate you considering all options. It’s reassuring to know I’m not alone in this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knabenshue. I'll have the nurse print out a handout with some grounding exercises and a list of local therapists experienced in anxiety management. To summarize, we've discussed your symptoms, completed a brief physical exam, and ordered some bloodwork to rule out underlying medical conditions. We're also exploring strategies to manage your anxiety, including grounding techniques and potential referral to a therapist. We'll review the bloodwork results in a couple of days. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and understanding, and I feel much more hopeful knowing we have a plan in place. I look forward to hearing from you when the bloodwork results are available. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
