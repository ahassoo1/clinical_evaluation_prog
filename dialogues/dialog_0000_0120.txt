DOCTOR: Alright, Carmaleta. Forty-three, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Look, can we just get this over with? I have things to do, you know. It’s not like I want to be here poking around with all this… baby stuff. It should be easy, really. Just tell me what I need to do to make sure everything works, okay?
DOCTOR: “Baby stuff?
PATIENT: Well, you know. Getting pregnant. Not making a fuss. I don’t want any… complications. My husband… well, it’s been a while, and I just want things to be simple. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Right. “Simple.” Well, even attempting a pregnancy, as you put it, isn’t always straightforward, Carmaleta. It’s not merely a matter of…willing it to happen. Now, let's start with the basics. Have you been trying for a while?
PATIENT: Trying? Honestly, not really. Not actively. We… well, things just didn’t work out that way after… you know. It’s been a few years. I suppose I just assumed it would happen if it was meant to, and now I’m getting… looks from people. And I don’t want to be too old when… if… anything happens. So, here I am, wasting my time.
DOCTOR: "Wasting your time," you say. It's good you're addressing this proactively, actually. A few years of unprotected intercourse without conception warrants some investigation, regardless of assumptions. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Ugh, unprotected… please. Look, yes, I had one. A long time ago. Perfectly normal, healthy baby boy. He’s… grown up now. That was easy! No problems. That’s why I don’t see what the big deal is this time. Is something wrong with me? Don’t tell me I’m too old.
DOCTOR: "Too old" is a relative term, Carmaleta. And frankly, a rather unhelpful one. It is possible for a healthy woman in her forties to conceive and have a healthy pregnancy. But a previous uncomplicated pregnancy doesn’t guarantee the same outcome this time around. Things change. Let’s not jump to conclusions. Now, have you been tracking your menstrual cycle at all?
PATIENT: Tracking? No! Honestly, doctor, do I look like someone who keeps charts? I have a life! I vaguely know when it happens, you know, the usual… monthly thing. But no, I don’t sit around marking dates on a calendar. Is it important? It sounds like a lot of fuss for nothing.
DOCTOR: It is important, Carmaleta. Irregular cycles can indicate underlying issues that could affect fertility. We need to get a baseline, understand your body. Do you experience heavy bleeding, spotting between periods, any pain with your cycle?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. Like, normal cramps, you know? Nothing I haven’t dealt with since… forever. And the bleeding… it’s usually pretty normal. Maybe a little heavier now and then? Honestly, I don’t pay that much attention. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: A luncheon?
PATIENT: Yes, a luncheon! With friends. It’s important. And I told them I’d be back by one. Look, can we just get some pills or something? Is that what I need? Just something to… help things along? Please don’t tell me I need tests.
DOCTOR: “Pills”?
PATIENT: Yes, pills! You know, for getting pregnant. My sister-in-law used them, and it worked for her. Something to boost… whatever it is I need boosted. I really don't want a lot of poking and prodding. And I absolutely do not want to hear about IVF or anything like that. Too much fuss.
DOCTOR: Carmaleta, with all due respect, you are simplifying a potentially complex issue. Simply prescribing medication without a proper assessment is irresponsible. We need to rule out any underlying conditions. Have you had a recent physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical? Ugh, it’s been… a while. I went to my regular doctor, you know, for check-ups and things. But that was… last year, I think? Just the usual blood pressure and weight stuff. Not anything… special. Honestly, I thought I was coming here for a quick fix, not a whole life story.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with the basics. Weight and blood pressure. And then, I'm going to need a urine sample to check for infection or other issues. Then, we’ll discuss blood work. It's non-negotiable, Carmaleta. And after that, we will have a proper discussion, and then maybe we can talk about the "quick fix" you mentioned. Please, step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Fine. But this is really cutting into my luncheon time. Honestly, you doctors… so much fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: 130 pounds. That’s within a healthy range. Blood pressure next. Please, have a seat and extend your arm. 128/80. Also normal. Now, about that urine sample... There's a collection cup in the restroom. Please try to collect a midstream sample. I'll be back in a few minutes.
PATIENT: Honestly... fuss, fuss, fuss. A quick pill is all I need. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get this over with. I’ll need to draw some blood for basic hormone levels and a complete blood count. We'll send it to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days.
PATIENT: No, no, no. Absolutely not. I knew this would happen. I hate needles. Is there really no other way? Can’t you just guess what’s going on based on… you know, everything else? This is awful.
DOCTOR: “Guess”?
PATIENT: Yes, guess! You know, based on my age, the fact that I had a baby before… surely you can just make an educated guess and give me something to help things along. My sister-in-law didn’t have all this fuss. She just went to the doctor, got a pill, and boom! Pregnant. Is that so much to ask? I don’t need all this… poking around.
DOCTOR: Carmaleta, your sister-in-law's experience is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. Hormone levels, thyroid function, and a complete blood count are crucial to identify potential issues that could be hindering conception. It’s not simply about “getting a pill.” We're talking about your health and the potential health of a future pregnancy. Now, I understand your apprehension, but this is a necessary step. If you absolutely refuse, I will document that in your chart, and I will advise you to seek care elsewhere. Are you willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Fine. But if I faint, it’s on your head. And I want a lollipop afterwards. A big one. This is just… ridiculous. Do it quickly, please. And don't poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath. You may feel a slight pinch. There. All done. Now, just sit still for a few minutes to prevent bruising. We'll have the results in a few days. While we're waiting, let’s discuss your menstrual history in more detail. When was the last normal menstrual period?
PATIENT: Ugh. It did pinch. Honestly. Um… the last one? Let me think… it was… sometime in… June, I think? Maybe July? They’re always a little different, you know? Sometimes heavier, sometimes lighter. I really don’t keep track. It just… happens. Why does it matter so much? Is everything broken down there?
DOCTOR: "Broken down?
PATIENT: Well, you're asking all these questions! It just feels like something must be wrong, doesn't it? If everything was normal, you wouldn't need to poke around and draw blood and ask about… periods. Honestly, you're making me nervous. Is this going to be expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: Carmaleta, I understand your concerns. We’re not assuming anything is "broken down." I'm gathering information to create a complete picture of your reproductive health. A slightly irregular menstrual cycle isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm, but it's a piece of the puzzle. As for expenses, your insurance should cover most of the tests, but there may be a co-pay. I can have the billing department provide you with an estimate. But right now, let's focus on gathering the information we need. Now, have you noticed any unusual vaginal discharge or pelvic pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes, a little. Like, normal cramps. Nothing I haven't dealt with since… well, you know. And discharge… um… sometimes it’s a little different. Hard to say. Everything's always changing, you know? Honestly, doctor, I’m really not good with these details. I’m just hoping for a quick fix and to get on with my life. This is exhausting. Can’t you just give me a pill?
DOCTOR: “A quick fix,” you say. I'm afraid that's not how this works, Carmaleta. While I understand your frustration, prescribing medication without proper diagnosis is unethical and potentially harmful. You’ve had one baby before, and now you’re concerned about conceiving again, and that may involve some new issues and new challenges. We’re still missing vital information. Tell me, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Just a multivitamin. And sometimes I take something for my joints. My knees are acting up. It’s… um… glucosamine, I think? And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take something with melatonin. But that’s it. Honestly, you're making me feel like I'm a science experiment. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Glucosamine and melatonin. Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Honestly, I'm pretty healthy. Except for my knees, of course. And maybe a little bit of stress lately, with all this fuss. Can we just get this over with? I have a luncheon, remember?
DOCTOR: Right. A luncheon. Alright, Carmaleta. I've gathered enough information for now. We will await the results of your blood work. Once we have those, we’ll discuss your options, which may or may not include medication. I would also like you to schedule a pelvic exam with me when you are next available so that I can assess you physically. Until then, if you experience any heavy bleeding, severe pelvic pain, or fever, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just... when will I get the results? And can I at least get something for my anxiety? This whole experience has been awful. And please, don't expect me to come back for a... a physical exam.
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes 3-5 business days to return the results. I will have my nurse contact you once they are available. As for your anxiety, I can write a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication, but I strongly recommend that you consider scheduling a consultation with a mental health professional to address the underlying cause of your stress. And frankly, Carmaleta, a physical exam is essential for proper diagnosis and treatment. Here. Take this, and contact me when the lab results are available. Have a pleasant day.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Thank you. This has been a complete waste of time. I’m just going to take the pills and hope for the best.
DOCTOR:
