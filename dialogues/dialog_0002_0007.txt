DOCTOR: Hi Lakiya, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. My back... it is painful. I would like to be quick, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Can you tell me more about the pain in your back?
PATIENT: It is... a sharp ache. Mostly on my left side. It started about two weeks ago, I believe. I was building a fence for Mr. Henderson, out past the river. A long fence. Lots of bending and lifting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about two weeks ago with the fence building – bending and lifting. And you describe it as a sharp ache, mostly on your left side. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. When I am sitting still, it is better. But if I try to… move too much. Or lift something. It gets worse quickly. Like a knife, almost. Not all the time, but… often enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse with movement and lifting, and you'd describe the pain as sharp, almost like a knife, when it flares up. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Sitting is best. And… warm water. A warm bath helps for a little while. Not for long, but it takes the edge off. I also use a heating pad sometimes. But it is not a good fix.
DOCTOR: Alright, so sitting and warm water/heat provide some relief, but it's temporary. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your leg, or any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No. Just my back. No tingling. No numbness. It stays in my back. Mostly low, on the left side. I have never had trouble with my legs.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you had any trouble with your bowel or bladder function recently?
PATIENT: No. Everything is... normal. I do not understand why you ask, but... yes. Normal. It has not changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. I ask because sometimes back pain can be associated with those things, so it's good to rule them out. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just... old age. No. Nothing the doctors ever wrote down. My husband… he took care of all that. He passed two years ago. I have Medicare. That is all. I do not take any pills regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm sorry to hear about your husband. And thank you for letting me know about your Medicare. So, no regular medications, and no other medical conditions diagnosed previously. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. Not even when my children were born. I had them at home, with the midwife. Just… nothing. No surgeries.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother had arthritis, in her hands. Badly. She could barely make a fist by the time she was my age. My father… he was a strong man. Never sick a day in his life. He worked on the ranch until he was eighty. That is all I remember, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had arthritis in her hands, and your father was generally healthy. And finally, can you tell me a little about what you do day-to-day?
PATIENT: I build fences. It is my work. I have a small business. Mostly for ranchers, like I said. I do everything myself. Digging the post holes, setting the posts, stringing the wire. It is hard work, but… it pays the bills. And I like being outside. When my back allows.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're a fence builder, and it sounds like a physically demanding job. Alright, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Not to pills. Not to food. Not to bee stings. Nothing. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I think. I do not believe so.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Well, Lakiya, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on with your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Quickly, if you please. I have another job to get to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. Let's get started. Okay, can you bend forward for me, and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof. Just to here. That is as far as I can go. It hurts. Sharp pain. When I bend.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And when you bend sideways, does that cause pain as well?
PATIENT: Yes. Especially to the left. There. That is the worst. A knife, like before. It is difficult to move. It feels... tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting that range of motion is limited, especially to the left, and there's pain with both flexion and lateral bending. Now, I'm going to gently press on different areas of your back to see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain. Okay, does this hurt?
PATIENT: Yes! There. That is it. Very sore. Like a bruise, almost. And… it feels tight. Like a knot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting tenderness and muscle spasm on the left side of your lower back. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you have a muscle strain, likely from the heavy lifting with the fence building. It's common, especially with that kind of work. It doesn’t seem like anything more serious, like a disc issue, but we should still be cautious. I'd like to order some X-rays just to rule out any other possibilities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-rays? That will take time. I need to get back to work. Is it necessary? If it is just a muscle, can I not just rest it? And use heat? I do not want to spend the day waiting for pictures.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the time, Lakiya. You’re right, often a muscle strain can be managed with rest and heat. However, to be absolutely sure, and to rule out anything else that might be causing the pain – like a small fracture or a problem with the bones in your spine – the X-ray is the best approach. It’s a precaution. It will take about an hour to get the results, and we can get you started on a treatment plan as soon as we have them. If you prefer, we could start with conservative treatment – rest, heat, and over-the-counter pain relievers – and see how you feel in a few days. But if the pain doesn't improve, or if it gets worse, you'd need to come back for the X-rays anyway. What feels like the best course of action for you?
PATIENT: Very well. The pictures. An hour, you say? I suppose it is better to be sure. But if it is just a muscle, I want something for the pain. Something I can take so I can work. I have fences to build.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. We'll get those X-rays ordered right away. In the meantime, I can prescribe you a short course of a muscle relaxant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug to help with the pain and inflammation. The muscle relaxant will help ease the spasm, and the NSAID will reduce the discomfort. I’ll also give you some instructions on how to care for your back at home – things like avoiding heavy lifting, using proper body mechanics, and applying heat. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds... acceptable. Just quickly, please. I have to get back to Mr. Henderson. He is a patient man, but… fences do not build themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand completely. Let me just finish writing up the prescriptions and instructions for you. It will just take a couple of minutes. Here you go. These prescriptions are for [Name of Muscle Relaxant] and [Name of NSAID]. Take them as directed on the label. And here's a handout with instructions on back care. The radiology department is just down the hall to your left. They’ll take the X-rays and send the results to me as soon as they’re available. Please let the receptionist know you're here for an X-ray ordered by Dr. Ranjan. Do you have any questions before you head over there?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… when will I have the results? One hour, you said? And where do I go if the pain gets worse? After the hour?
DOCTOR: Yes, about an hour. The receptionist will let me know when they are ready, and I will call you as soon as I’ve had a chance to review them. If the pain gets significantly worse – if you develop numbness or tingling in your legs, or if you have trouble controlling your bladder or bowels – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, if it doesn’t improve after a few days, or if you have any concerns, please call the clinic to schedule a follow-up appointment. Here’s a card with our contact information. I hope you feel better soon, Lakiya. And thank you for coming in today. Do you have any other questions at all before you head off to radiology?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. I believe that is all. I will go now.
DOCTOR: Okay. You're very welcome, Lakiya. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
