DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. Hyper… something. That’s what the paper said. I don’t really understand all that stuff, but I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia, yes. That's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, it really is! I try to remember things, I really do, but those big words just… slip away. It just means my cholesterol is too high, right? Is that bad? I don’t smoke, and I try to eat pretty healthy, so I was surprised to see that on the paper.
DOCTOR: It does mean your cholesterol is elevated, yes. And you're right to be proactive about it. It can be a concern, but it's also very manageable. Many factors can contribute to high cholesterol—diet is important, certainly, but genetics, age, and other health conditions play a role too. Now, to get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit more about your diet?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes me feel a little better. Manageable is good. I eat… well, I try to eat a lot of vegetables. And chicken, mostly. I like fish sometimes, but not every day. I do like a good piece of cheese now and then, and I have a sweet tooth, I won’t lie. Chocolate, mostly. Dark chocolate, if that makes a difference. And bread, I like a good sandwich. Is bread bad? I drink water, lots of water. And coffee, one or two cups in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Bread isn’t necessarily bad, but it depends on the type. White bread, for example, is more processed and can affect cholesterol levels. Dark chocolate, in moderation, can actually be good for you—it has antioxidants. Do you know what your total cholesterol number was, or perhaps the numbers for your LDL, HDL, and triglycerides?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Numbers… that’s where I get lost again. The paper had lots of numbers, and I… I think I just looked at the part that said “high.” I honestly don’t remember any specific numbers. I'm so sorry. I really wish I was better with all that stuff, but it just… doesn’t stick. Would the lab have sent that information to you? That might be easier.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Geho. Don't worry about it at all. That's what I'm here for. Let me take a look at the lab results… Ah, yes. Okay, your total cholesterol is 245, LDL is 160, HDL is 50, and triglycerides are 180. Those numbers do indicate elevated cholesterol, specifically the LDL, which we often call “bad” cholesterol. Your HDL is okay, but could be higher. And your triglycerides are a little bit on the high side. Now, do you have any family history of heart disease, high cholesterol, or stroke?
PATIENT: Okay, 245… that sounds like a lot! My mother… she had some heart trouble when she was older. She had a blockage, I think. They put a… a little wire in, or something. And my father, he had high blood pressure. I don’t know about cholesterol specifically, though. They didn’t talk about numbers much back then. It was just… “high blood pressure,” and he had to take a pill. He lived to be 85, though, so maybe it wasn’t too bad. Does that help? I try to remember things like that, but it’s hard. I was just a little girl when all that happened.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. A family history of heart disease and high blood pressure does increase your risk. It’s good that your father lived to be 85 despite it, but it still means we need to be proactive. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, but that was… oh, goodness, 20 years ago, maybe more? And I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, but it’s not too bad. I walk every day, helps keep it loose. Otherwise, I feel pretty good, actually. I sleep okay, and I don’t have any trouble with… well, you know. All the normal things. I have regular check-ups with my regular doctor, and she always says I’m healthy. Just this cholesterol thing. It’s a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. Gallbladder removal and arthritis don’t necessarily affect your cholesterol. And it’s positive that you’re active and have regular check-ups. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a little bit of ibuprofen sometimes for my knees, when they’re really bothering me. And I take a multivitamin, just a regular one. Nothing else, I don’t think. Oh! And I take calcium, for my bones. That’s it. I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it. It makes me feel… funny sometimes. And I forget if I’ve already taken one! That’s why I keep a little chart, but sometimes… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It’s good you’re keeping track. Alright, so ibuprofen occasionally, a multivitamin, and calcium. No allergies to any medications, correct?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had one. I’m very lucky that way. It’s just the forgetting… that’s the problem! I’m generally pretty healthy, I really am. This cholesterol thing just… surprised me. Is it something I need to be really worried about? Should I be changing everything I eat? I like my chocolate, you know.
DOCTOR: No, you don’t necessarily need to change everything. And you absolutely don't need to give up your chocolate entirely! It's more about making some moderate adjustments. Based on your numbers, family history, and overall health, I think we should start with lifestyle modifications, and then reassess in three months. We’ll want to repeat the cholesterol tests to see if things are improving. Would you be open to that approach?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Less drastic is always better, if it works. Three months isn’t too long to wait, I suppose. And I can definitely try to make some changes. What kind of changes are we talking about? Less chocolate? I'm willing to try, I really am. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Let’s focus on small, sustainable changes. First, let's aim for a diet lower in saturated and trans fats. That means reducing red meat, processed foods, and full-fat dairy. Increasing soluble fiber—found in oats, beans, fruits, and vegetables—can also help lower cholesterol. As for chocolate, dark chocolate in moderation is fine, but we'll aim for limiting it to a small square or two a day. And most importantly, regular exercise is key! You’re already walking, which is excellent. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. I also have a handout here with more detailed information about diet and exercise. We can go through it together, or you can take it home and review it at your own pace. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable. I can definitely cut back on the red meat, I don't eat a ton of it anyway. And I do like beans! And I can walk more, maybe a longer route. A small square of chocolate... I can live with that. The handout sounds good, actually. Maybe we can look at it together now? I sometimes forget things if I read them on my own later. And it’s nice to have someone explain it, just to make sure I understand. Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's what I'm here for. Here, this section details foods high in saturated and trans fats to avoid. You'll notice things like fatty cuts of beef and pork, processed meats like bacon and sausage, fried foods, and many commercially baked goods. Then, this section lists foods rich in soluble fiber… you see oats, apples, pears, beans, lentils… These are all good choices. And this section goes over the benefits of exercise… it doesn't have to be strenuous, just regular movement. Do you have any questions as we go through this?
PATIENT: Okay… bacon is on the list. That’s sad. I do like bacon with my eggs sometimes. And… commercially baked goods. That means cookies and cakes, right? Oh dear. This is a little bit harder than I thought. Lentils… I think I’ve had lentils before. They’re… okay. Not my favorite, but I can try to eat them more often. And what about butter? Is butter bad? I use butter on my toast.
DOCTOR: Butter is a bit of a grey area. It contains saturated fat, so it's best to use it sparingly. Opting for olive oil or other healthier fats for cooking is a good alternative. You don't have to completely eliminate butter, but reducing the amount you use is a good start. It's about making small, sustainable changes, remember?
PATIENT: Olive oil… yes, I have olive oil. I use that on my salad sometimes. So, less butter, more olive oil. That I can do. And try to eat more lentils. It sounds like a lot of trying, but… it's not terrible. Okay, what about drinks? Are there any drinks I should avoid? I drink a lot of water, and I have coffee in the morning. Is coffee okay?
DOCTOR: Water is excellent! Keep doing that. And coffee is generally fine in moderation. Excessive caffeine can raise blood pressure, but one or two cups a day shouldn't be a problem. Avoid sugary drinks like soda and juice, and limit alcohol intake. Alright, so we’ve covered diet, exercise, and drinks. Do you have any other questions about lifestyle modifications?
PATIENT: I think… that’s it. Less bacon, more lentils, less butter, more olive oil, and no sugary drinks. And one or two cups of coffee is okay. It sounds… manageable. And I’ll try to walk more. When will we repeat the test? Three months, you said? I guess I’ll just try my best in the meantime. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It's less scary when you know what you're supposed to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, three months. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment now to repeat the cholesterol test and see how things are progressing. And you're very welcome, Ms. Geho. My goal is to make you feel comfortable and empowered to take care of your health. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Now, before we finish up, do you have any other health concerns I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, but nothing serious. I see my regular doctor regularly, and she always checks me over. This cholesterol thing is the only new thing. I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll try my best with the lentils. .
DOCTOR: Excellent. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Geho. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And don't worry too much about the lentils! We'll see you in three months. Have a good day, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
