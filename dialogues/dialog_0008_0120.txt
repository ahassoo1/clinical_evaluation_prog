DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I'm Dr. Cumper. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, good morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let’s just get right to it. I want to have a baby, and I want it to be…easy. My husband…well, he was a very practical man, and we always planned things. I don't want any trouble getting pregnant, you understand? I'm not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re thinking ahead, and planning is always wise. So, to clarify, you’re hoping to conceive, and you’d like to discuss ensuring a smooth path to pregnancy?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Smooth. That’s the word. No…complications. I had a…a perfectly healthy marriage, a perfectly healthy life, and I expect this to be perfectly healthy too. Honestly, I don't know why anyone wouldn't want that. Are you going to ask me a million questions about…things? Because frankly, I don’t have the patience.
DOCTOR: I'll certainly try to be efficient, Ms. Villarreal. A few questions are necessary to get a good understanding of your overall health and any potential factors that could affect conception. It’s standard procedure. We'll start with some basics. Have you been trying to conceive already?
PATIENT: Trying? Well…not exactly. It hasn’t…started yet. It’s just…preparation, really. We were talking about it, planning the timing…you know. Before…everything. Honestly, I haven't really done anything besides think about it. Does that make sense? It feels silly explaining this.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Villarreal. Thinking and planning are a very important first step. So, you haven’t actively been trying for a specific amount of time yet. Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history then. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history… Honestly, I don't really bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. My husband handled all that. I think…I had the usual childhood things. Measles, chickenpox…nothing serious. And I've had a yearly check-up, I suppose, but I can't remember what they found. Honestly, I'm very healthy, always have been. I eat well, I don’t smoke, I… I really don’t see what the problem could be. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Villarreal. We just want to make sure we have a complete picture. Okay, let’s try this. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. I think I had my tonsils out when I was little. That’s about it. Nothing else. And no hospital stays, not unless you count the birth of my… well, never mind. It was a long time ago. Look, I really don't enjoy talking about this. I just want to know if there's something wrong or not. Can’t you just…check me? A blood test or something?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Villarreal. We can absolutely do some blood work. That will give us a good baseline. Before we order those, just a few more quick questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing I know of. I eat everything. Honestly, I think people just say they have allergies these days. It’s… fashionable. Look, can we just get this over with? I have a luncheon to get to. It’s a charity event. Very important.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely nothing. I believe in a healthy lifestyle. Good food, fresh air…that’s all you need. I wouldn’t put all those chemicals in my body. Honestly, it’s appalling how many people rely on pills these days. Are we done yet? I can feel my hair getting messed up.
DOCTOR: Almost, Ms. Villarreal. Just a few final questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family – your mother, sisters, or other close relatives – had difficulty getting pregnant, experienced miscarriages, or had any genetic conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history... Honestly, I haven't spoken to most of my family in years. My mother…she had a perfectly normal pregnancy with me and my sister, as far as I know. My sister…well, she got married late and had a child eventually, but I don't know the details. Honestly, I don't see what this has to do with anything. Look, I'm a healthy, normal woman. Can we just order the tests and be done with this? I really don't have time for a family reunion in a doctor's office.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Villarreal. I understand your desire to be efficient. I'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These will give us a good baseline assessment of your overall health. I’ll also order a urine test to rule out any infection. Let me explain what we'll do next... .
