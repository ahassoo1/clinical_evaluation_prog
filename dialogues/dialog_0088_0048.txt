DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… something my wife, Srey, has been on me about. I’ve been… losing my place, I guess you could say. Little things. Forget where I put things, or what I was just saying mid-sentence. It’s not constant, mind you. But enough to bother her, and frankly, it’s a little unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Losing your train of thought or misplacing things can be concerning. It’s good that Srey is looking out for you, and you're getting it checked out. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start… that's a good question. It wasn’t sudden, not like a switch flipped. Probably… six months ago, maybe? It started with just… not remembering where I left my tools after a job. I always put them in the same place, but suddenly… not there. Then it was names. Not important names, thankfully, just… the fella who delivers the tiles. Things like that. It’s been… creeping up, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, starting with misplaced items and progressing to occasional difficulty with names. And it’s been gradually worsening. Has it affected your ability to do your work, or your daily routines in any significant way?
PATIENT: Well, significant is a strong word. I still get the job done. Been a tile setter for forty years, Doctor, I'm not about to let a few… lapses slow me down. But it takes… longer. I have to double-check things more. Srey gets frustrated because I ask her the same questions twice, sometimes. It's more annoying than anything, really. But I notice it. And she certainly points it out. She says I’m becoming… unreliable.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like it's causing some frustration both for you and Srey, even if it hasn’t completely stopped you from working. And you're aware of the changes, which is good. Now, let's talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, sleep, or appetite?
PATIENT: Mood… no. I’m always grumpy, that’s just my nature. Sleep is… okay. Get up early, always have. Can’t stand to lie in bed. Appetite is fine too, Srey makes sure of that. She feeds me well, even if I complain about it. No, nothing like that. Just… the forgetting. That’s the main thing. And the occasional… blank spot, you know? Like the word is right there, but I can't grab it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That "tip of the tongue" feeling can be frustrating. And it’s good to know your sleep and appetite haven’t been affected. Now, have you had any history of head injuries, strokes, or any other neurological issues?
PATIENT: Head injuries… not serious ones. Banged my head on a low beam a few times on jobs, nothing that knocked me out. Just a few bumps and bruises. Strokes? No. Never been sick, really. Always been strong as an ox. My mother, she had… something with her memory when she got old, but that was years ago. And I don't remember the details, to be honest. Never been much of a hospital person.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant head injuries or stroke history. And a family history of some memory issues in your mother, though you don’t have many details. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my knees. They bother me after a long day on the concrete. Something the doctor down at the clinic gave me a few years back. Can’t recall the name of it. Little white pill. And… sometimes I take something for heartburn. But that’s only when I eat something spicy, which Srey lets me do, even though she complains about the smell. Nothing regular, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for your knees and something for occasional heartburn. Do you know the dosage of the knee medication?
PATIENT: Dosage… …now that you mention it, I haven’t looked at the bottle in ages. Srey handles all that. She tells me to take one in the morning, one at night. That’s all I know. I trust her, she’s always been good with… details like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. We’ll need to get that information from Srey. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your daily life. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A little. A beer with dinner sometimes, especially on a hot day after work. Nothing excessive, mind you. Not like some of those fellas I used to work with. Just a beer or two. Srey doesn't particularly like it, but she lets me have one. I’m not a problem drinker, Doctor. Never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, a beer or two with dinner occasionally. Do you smoke or use any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. Tried it once when I was a boy, made me sick. Srey wouldn’t allow it, even if I wanted to. She's very particular about health, she is. No, no smoking. Never have, never will.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a quick neurological assessment – that just means checking your reflexes, balance, and a few simple memory tasks. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Memory tasks? What kind of memory tasks? I told you, I’ve been forgetful, not… stupid. But… alright. Fine. Do your exam. Just… don’t take too long, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. This won't take long, Mr. Lason. First, let's check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Go ahead. Just be quick about it. This cuff always feels so tight.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 138/82. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you relax your legs for me?
PATIENT: Relax? Always been a fidgety person, Doctor. But alright. Do what you need to do. Just don’t hit me too hard with that thing.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your memory. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date… … August… … the second? Yes. August 2nd.
DOCTOR: Okay, August 2nd. Good. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? What words? Go on, tell me the words. I'm not doing a test, am I?
DOCTOR: No, not a test, just a quick assessment. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There. Done.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’m going to ask you a few other questions. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: …The year… … Twenty… twenty-five? Yes. Twenty-twenty-five.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock face, showing all twelve numbers, and set the time to ten minutes after eleven. I have a piece of paper and a pen here for you. It doesn’t need to be perfect, just your best attempt.
PATIENT: Draw a clock? Now you’re just testing me! I’m a tile setter, Doctor, not an artist! Fine. But don’t expect a masterpiece. I haven’t drawn anything since… well, since I was a boy.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Lason. Just do your best.
PATIENT: There. Finished. It's… not very good, is it?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. Alright, that's all for the physical assessment. Based on this brief examination, you are oriented to person, but have some difficulty with recall and a mild difficulty with visuospatial skills, as demonstrated by the clock drawing. Given your history of gradual memory loss, and the findings on this exam, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I would also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A neurologist? You think I’m… losing my mind? Blood work, alright. I suppose that’s reasonable. But a neurologist… isn’t that for people with… serious problems? I just forget things sometimes, Doctor. It’s not like I’m wandering around lost. Srey worries too much, that’s all. But… fine. Do the blood work. And… I’ll think about the neurologist.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Lason. Seeing a neurologist doesn’t necessarily mean there's something serious wrong. It simply allows us to get a more detailed picture of what’s going on and rule out any other potential causes. It's always best to be thorough. I’ll write an order for the blood work, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. I will also provide you with information about neurologists in the area, should you decide to proceed with a referral. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… I don’t want to be poked and prodded unnecessarily. And I don't want Srey telling everyone I'm… failing. It's bad enough she worries constantly. So, just… do the blood work. And I'll… consider the other thing. When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. I will ensure that your results are kept confidential. The blood work should take about a week to come back. I will have the lab contact you directly with the results, and my office will also follow up with you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your memory, such as difficulty with familiar tasks or confusion, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions about the blood work itself or how to prepare for it?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m alright. Just… don't make me fast for it or anything. Srey would have a fit if I missed breakfast. Alright. Let’s get this over with then.
DOCTOR: No, no fasting required. You can eat and drink as normal. I’ll have the lab send you instructions as well, just in case. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Lason. I hope we can get to the bottom of this and ease your mind. I'll have my nurse provide you with the lab requisition form and some informational brochures before you leave. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I still think Srey worries too much, but… it’s good to check things out, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Lason. It’s always best to be proactive about your health. And Srey sounds like a caring wife. Don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
