DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be honest, a friend suggested I look into something… a way to help prevent HIV. She said I should talk to someone about it, and she recommended this clinic. I don’t really know much about it, but it sounded… sensible.
DOCTOR: Preventative measures, right. Yes, well, that’s… prudent. Though, frankly, at your age, it’s not typically the first thing one considers. But, alright. Let's clarify. When your friend mentioned this, were they referring to PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis?
PATIENT: PrEP… is that what it’s called? Yes, I think so. She used that word. Look, I’m not very good with… medical terms. She just said it was a pill you take to protect yourself, even if… even if things aren't always planned. And that it's safe. She mentioned it a few times, actually, and I figured it couldn't hurt to ask about it.
DOCTOR: “Safe” is… a relative term, Ms. Trefren. Everything carries some risk. But PrEP is generally well-tolerated. Before we proceed any further, I need a complete medical history. It's crucial for determining if you’re a suitable candidate, and to rule out any contraindications. Let’s start with your past medical history. Any significant illnesses or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, honestly. I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, when I was maybe… twenty? And I broke my wrist badly when I was a teenager, needed a cast for months. Other than that… just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. No surgeries, no chronic conditions. Oh! And I had my gallbladder out about fifteen years ago, but that was pretty routine. I remember the doctor was very good, Dr. El-Masri. He was in Paterson, New Jersey then. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Pneumonia, fractured wrist, and cholecystectomy fifteen years ago… alright. And Dr. El-Masri, noted. Now, family history. Any significant illnesses in your immediate family – parents, siblings – such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or infectious diseases?
PATIENT: Okay, family history… my mother, she passed away about ten years ago from heart failure. My father, he’s still alive, thankfully, but he has diabetes, and his eyesight isn’t very good anymore. And my brother… he had some kind of cancer, a long time ago, I think it was leukemia, but he’s been clear for years now, thankfully. He lives in California, so I don’t see him often. As for infectious diseases… not that I know of, no. We weren't really… close enough to talk about those things, if that makes sense. It was a big family, but not a close one.
DOCTOR: Heart failure in your mother, diabetes in your father, and a history of leukemia in your brother… acceptable. Now, Ms. Trefren, I must ask about your social history. This is… delicate, but necessary. Do you currently have any sexual partners?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well… that's a bit personal, isn't it? Look, I’m single, as you can see. I haven’t been with anyone… regularly… for a long time. But… I do see someone occasionally. It’s nothing serious, just… companionship. We’re both… older. And we always use protection. But honestly, that's why I'm here. I just want to be extra careful. Is that okay to say? I don’t want to… sound like I’m living some wild life, because I’m not.
DOCTOR: “Companionship,” right. And you use protection. That’s… a start. Now, are you sexually active with men, women, or both?
PATIENT: Just men. Always. And… like I said, it’s not often. But I want to be prepared, you know? My friend… she said PrEP works really well, but I want to make sure it's right for me, and that I understand everything. I don’t want to rely on… just protection. It feels… insecure, I guess. Does that make sense? I’m probably rambling.
DOCTOR: It’s… efficient that you’re direct. Now, Ms. Trefren, have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve always been… careful. And I’ve always gotten tested regularly, especially when I started seeing someone new. I can get you records from Dr. Ramirez, she was my gynecologist for years. She retired a few years ago, but I’m pretty sure she still keeps records. I’ve never had anything… positive, if that makes sense. Always clear.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a blood pressure pill, Lisinopril, very small dose. My doctor prescribed it a couple of years ago. And I take a Vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was low on it. Other than that… no. Just the usual ibuprofen for headaches sometimes. Nothing else. I don’t really like taking pills unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Trefren, before we proceed, I must perform a physical examination. This is standard protocol to assess your overall health and ensure you are a suitable candidate for PrEP. It will include a blood pressure check, a basic physical assessment, and a blood draw for HIV and other relevant tests. Do you consent to the examination?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That’s… sensible. Yes, I consent. I just want to get this done, if possible. The sooner I know, the better. Is it… a lot of blood? I don’t like needles. But… I understand it’s necessary. Do I need to change clothes?
DOCTOR: A small amount, Ms. Trefren. Standard vials. You do not need to change, but please loosen your clothing to allow access to your arm. I'll have the nurse draw the blood. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll be right back with the stethoscope.
