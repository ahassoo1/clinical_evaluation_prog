DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you as well. My name is Jammal Goodstein. I am here... well, it is a little embarrassing, but I have a lot of gas. More than usual, you understand. It is… quite disruptive, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. There's no need to be embarrassed; digestive issues are quite common. It's good you came in to discuss it. “Disruptive” is a good way to put it – it sounds like it’s affecting your daily life. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this gas?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. It happens… after I eat, mostly. Not every time, but often. And sometimes… even when I haven't eaten for a while. It is not painful, exactly, but… uncomfortable. And the sound… well, it is not pleasant. I work at the burger place, you see, and it… happens during the shift. It is very awkward. I eat pretty normal things. Burgers, fries… sometimes a little salad. Nothing fancy. I drink soda with my lunch, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it occurs mostly after eating, but can happen even when you’re not eating, and it’s causing some… social discomfort at work. You mentioned a fairly typical diet – burgers, fries, salads, and soda. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me think… Usually, I have a small breakfast. Just toast with a little jam, maybe. And a coffee. Then I go to work. I usually get a burger and fries for lunch there, of course. And a large soda. Sometimes I have another soda later in my shift. For dinner… it depends. Sometimes I have a frozen meal – something easy. Other times, I might have a sandwich. Nothing too complicated. I do not drink a lot of water, if I am being honest. Mostly soda. I do like a little chocolate sometimes, after dinner, if I have it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Goodstein. That gives me a good overview. It sounds like you have a fairly consistent diet with a good amount of carbonated beverages and perhaps not a lot of water intake. Now, have you noticed any specific foods that seem to trigger the gas more than others?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. Hmm… I think the beans at the burger place… they sometimes make it worse. We have a bean burger option, and if I am near it while it is cooking… even if I don't eat it, it seems to bother me. And onions, maybe? When we have a lot of onions being chopped for the burgers, I notice it more. I am not sure. It is hard to tell, sometimes. Everything smells so strong at the burger place! But, yes, I think beans and onions are the worst. And perhaps… the soda? It could be the soda.
DOCTOR: Okay, so beans and onions seem to be potential triggers, and you're wondering if the soda might be contributing as well. That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Aside from the gas, have you noticed any bloating, abdominal pain, changes in your bowel movements—either constipation or diarrhea—or any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no nausea or vomiting. And no abdominal pain, really. Just… the gas. And sometimes I feel a little… full. Bloated, perhaps? But not painful. And my bowel movements are… normal, I think. Regular. Not too hard, not too soft. Just… normal. Everything is normal, except for the… passing of gas. That is the problem. It is very embarrassing at work, you see. My coworkers… they try not to laugh, but… you can tell.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. It sounds like the main issue is the excessive gas and the social discomfort it's causing. No pain, no changes in bowel habits, just the bloating and gas itself. Now, let me ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. I have never been diagnosed with anything. I do not go to the doctor often. Just for checkups, maybe. And when I have a cold. Nothing serious. I have Medicare, so I try not to bother the doctors unless it is important. But this gas… it is becoming a problem. It is interfering with my work. It is very distracting. And embarrassing, as I have said. It is difficult to concentrate when you are worried about… you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior medical diagnoses and you generally only see the doctor for checkups or acute illnesses. I appreciate you coming in to address this now, as it is clearly impacting your quality of life. Let's quickly go through a few other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. As far as I know, anyway. I have eaten many things in my life, and nothing has ever bothered me. I can eat shellfish, peanuts, chocolate… everything. I have never had a reaction to anything. I do not take any medications regularly. Just sometimes, if I have a headache, I will take a pain reliever. But that is all. Nothing special. I am usually very healthy, except for this… gas.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no regular medications. That's good to know. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope to rule out anything unusual. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I just want to get rid of this gas. It is very disruptive, you see. And embarrassing. I am happy to do whatever you think is best. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I am a little nervous, but I trust you. It is just the… thought of someone listening to my stomach, you know? It is a little strange. But I am willing to do it if it will help.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mr. Goodstein. It can feel a little strange, but it’s a quick and painless procedure. I'll explain everything as I go. Okay, take a few deep breaths for me… and exhale slowly. Good. Now another one… Good. Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Your abdomen sounds normal – no unusual sounds or tenderness. Everything feels soft and relaxed. That’s a good sign. It doesn’t seem like there’s anything acutely concerning going on.
PATIENT: That is good to hear, Doctor. Very good to hear. So… what does that mean? Is it something I am eating? The beans? The soda? Or something else? I am very confused. And a little worried, still. I just want to know what is causing this gas, and how to make it stop. I am happy to change my diet, or whatever you think is best. I just want to be normal again. It is very difficult to concentrate at work when you are worried about… you know. And I do not want to bother my coworkers anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Goodstein. It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of excessive gas, likely related to your diet. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it doesn't appear to be anything serious. It’s often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause, as it can be a combination of factors. However, the beans and the carbonated beverages are likely major contributors. Soda, in particular, introduces a lot of gas into your system. Certain foods, like onions, can also contribute. We can try a few things. I recommend starting with a simple elimination diet. Try reducing or eliminating carbonated beverages—the soda—for a week or two and see if that makes a difference. Also, try to limit foods known to cause gas, like beans, onions, and potentially other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli or cabbage. Alongside that, ensure you're staying adequately hydrated. Drinking plenty of water helps with digestion. We can also discuss over-the-counter remedies like simethicone or activated charcoal, which can help reduce gas. But I’d prefer to start with dietary changes first. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. I can certainly try to cut back on the soda. It will be difficult, but I can try. And I will try to avoid the beans at the burger place. And drink more water. I always forget to drink enough water. So, no more soda, less beans, more water… and see if it helps? What if it does not help? What if I still have all the gas? I am a little worried it will not work. And what about the over-the-counter remedies? When would I take those? And what if they do not work either? I am a little confused about all of this. It is very frustrating. I just want to be normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Goodstein. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about whether the changes will work. We'll take it one step at a time. Let's start with the dietary changes for two weeks. Keep a food diary—write down what you eat and drink, and note when you experience gas. That will help us identify any other potential triggers. If the dietary changes don't provide enough relief after two weeks, then we can discuss the over-the-counter remedies. Simethicone, like Gas-X, can help break up gas bubbles. Activated charcoal can absorb gas, but it can also interfere with some medications, so we’ll need to be cautious. We can discuss the appropriate dosage and timing if needed. If those don't work, or if your symptoms worsen, then we can consider further investigation. This might involve a referral to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health – to rule out any underlying conditions like irritable bowel syndrome or lactose intolerance. But let’s not jump to that conclusion yet. We’ll start with the simplest steps first. Do you have any questions about keeping a food diary or about the over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. A food diary… write down everything I eat and drink, and when I have gas. And try to cut back on the soda. And then, if it does not help, we can talk about the remedies. I am a little worried about remembering to write everything down. I am a little forgetful, you see. But I will try my best. I want to get rid of this gas. It is very disruptive, and embarrassing. I think that is all. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better now, knowing what to do. And knowing that we can try other things if this does not work. It is a little reassuring. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Don’t worry about being forgetful – just do your best. If you miss a few entries in the food diary, that’s okay. The important thing is to be consistent as much as possible. I’ll print out a handout with some general dietary tips for reducing gas. And I’ll make a note in your chart to follow up with you in two weeks to see how you’re doing. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits—please don’t hesitate to call the office sooner. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is everything. Thank you very much for your help. You have been very kind and patient. I appreciate your time and your advice. I will try my best to follow your instructions. I think I will go home now and start the food diary. And try to find some water to drink. Thank you again, Doctor. And have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you all the best, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day as well, and please take care.
