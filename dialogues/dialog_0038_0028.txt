DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this cough. It just won't go away, and my heart… it hasn't been feeling its best lately either. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and some heart palpitations, and it’s been going on for about two weeks. Let's start with the cough. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not a…productive cough, if you know what I mean. Not much comes up when I cough, just a little bit of clear stuff sometimes. It mostly happens when I lie down, especially at night. Wakes me right up! And it feels…deep, like it’s coming from my chest. Not just my throat, you understand?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dry cough, mostly at night when lying down, and it feels deep in your chest. That’s helpful. And when you say “clear stuff,” is that mucus, or something else?
PATIENT: Yes, mucus. Just…not a lot of it. It's clear, sometimes a little bit white. Not yellow or green, thankfully. And it doesn't hurt when I cough, just…tires me out. I have to sit up a lot to breathe easier, you see. It's been a bit of a bother, especially when I want to get a good night's sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear or white mucus, no pain with the cough, just tiring. And sitting up helps you breathe easier. That’s good to know. Now, you also mentioned your heart hasn’t been feeling its best. Can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, well… it's hard to explain. It feels like it's…fluttering sometimes. Like a little bird trapped in my chest, maybe? Not a painful fluttering, just…uneasy. And I get winded very easily now. Even walking from the kitchen to the living room leaves me breathless. It wasn't this bad before, you understand? I used to be able to do a lot more.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fluttering sensation and shortness of breath, even with minimal exertion. Has this shortness of breath been gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: It's been gradual, I think. It didn’t happen overnight. I noticed it getting worse over the last month or so. At first, I just thought I was getting old! But then the cough started, and now I worry it’s something more serious. I’ve been trying to take it easy, but it's hard when even simple things leave me so tired.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nadene. It's good you’re paying attention to these changes. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have heart failure. The doctor – Dr. Ramirez, lovely man – told me about five years ago now. I take some medication for it, a couple of pills every day. And I see a cardiologist regularly, but my appointment isn't until next month. He’s the one who told me to come see you if this cough didn’t go away. I also had pneumonia once, many years ago, but I recovered fully from that.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart failure diagnosed five years ago, currently on medication, and a history of pneumonia. And you see a cardiologist next month. That’s good information. Do you remember what medications you’re taking for your heart failure?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think... I have…furosemide, that’s one. And lisinopril. And…digoxin, I believe. Yes, those three. I take the furosemide every morning, and the other two… twice a day, I think. It’s been a while since Dr. Ramirez explained everything. He has a lovely accent, sometimes hard to catch all the details. But I try my best to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, furosemide, lisinopril, and digoxin. We'll double-check those dosages in your chart to be sure. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. Never had an allergic reaction to anything, thank goodness. I used to worry about that, but I’ve been fine with all the different medicines I’ve taken over the years. Though, I don’t like taking so many pills! Makes me feel old, even if I am old, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the allergies. And I understand feeling that way about taking multiple medications. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any heart problems or lung conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My mother, she had high blood pressure, and it caused her heart problems later in life. She ended up needing a pacemaker, poor woman. And my brother, he had asthma when he was a child, and it bothered him all his life. Not as bad as some, but he always had to carry an inhaler. Other than that, not much that I can recall. We didn't have a lot of doctors in the family when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure and heart problems in your mother, and asthma in your brother. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Well, I’m a widow, Doctor. My husband, Miguel, passed away ten years ago. We lived in El Salvador most of our lives before moving here to be closer to my daughter. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don't drink alcohol much anymore, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, if my daughter's visiting. I used to be a very active person, but now I mostly stay at home and cook. My daughter helps me with groceries and things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're a widow, you don’t smoke, and you have a limited alcohol intake. You’re mostly at home now. And your daughter helps you with groceries. That’s good to know. Alright, Nadene, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your legs for any swelling. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. I don't mind at all. I’m used to doctors listening to my heart, unfortunately. Just…be gentle, please? My chest feels a little tender from all the coughing.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Okay, I’m listening now. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I can hear some crackling sounds in your lungs, especially at the base of your right lung. This could indicate some fluid buildup. Your legs do have a bit of swelling, which is common with heart failure. I also notice your breathing is slightly labored. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like your heart failure may be getting worse, and the cough could be related to fluid buildup in your lungs. I want to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray to get a better picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good, does it? Fluid in my lungs… that’s what Dr. Ramirez warned me about. Yes, Doctor, please do the tests. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, you know? I miss being able to walk around without getting so tired. And my daughter worries so much. So, blood tests and a chest X-ray. Where will those be done? And will I need an appointment?
DOCTOR: Okay, Nadene. Don't worry too much yet. We're just gathering information to understand what's happening. The blood tests will check your kidney function and levels of certain hormones that can affect your heart. The chest X-ray will show us if there's fluid in your lungs and give us a better look at your heart. We can do both of those tests right here in the clinic. The nurse will draw your blood, and then we'll send you over to radiology for the X-ray. You don’t need an appointment, we’ll just get it done right away. It should take about an hour or so. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to adjust your medication slightly. I’m going to increase the dose of your furosemide a little bit to help get rid of some of the fluid. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds alright, Doctor. More furosemide… I remember Dr. Ramirez adjusting that dose before, too. I just hope it doesn't make me have to go to the bathroom too much! And an hour, that's not so bad. I can sit here and rest while I wait. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, you know? It makes me feel a little less worried. Are there any instructions I need to follow before the X-ray? Like, should I remove my jewelry?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the X-ray, yes. Please remove any jewelry around your neck and chest before the test. And let the technician know if you think you might be pregnant. Other than that, just relax and follow their instructions. And you're very welcome about the explanations, Nadene. I want you to understand everything that's happening. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and then take you to radiology. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions for me right now before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough and kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I’ll just wait here, then, and try to relax. Thank you again. I trust you to take good care of me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. It's my pleasure. I’ll check back in with you as soon as the results are available. Just let the nurse know if you need anything at all.
