DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Reisig. It’s very nice to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been having some… well, some pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. And how long has this been bothering you, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I would say, about three weeks ago. It wasn’t constant at first, just occasionally. But it’s become more frequent in the last week or so.
DOCTOR: Alright, three weeks with increasing frequency over the last week. Could you describe the pressure for me?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not painful, exactly. More like a full feeling, even when I’ve just gone to the bathroom. And sometimes it feels like I need to go right now, but when I try, only a little comes out. It’s a bit uncomfortable, and it’s starting to disrupt things a little.
DOCTOR: I understand. A full feeling even after voiding, with urgency and incomplete emptying. That is disruptive. Has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual. And… sometimes I notice a little discomfort lower down, a sort of ache, especially after I’ve been sitting for a long time. But it’s not severe.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and lower abdominal discomfort with prolonged sitting. Have you noticed any changes in your urine—color, odor, or any blood?
PATIENT: No blood, thankfully. The color seems normal, and I haven’t noticed any unusual odor. I suppose… it’s been a little foamy sometimes, but I wasn’t sure if that was just… something I was imagining. It hasn't been consistent, though.
DOCTOR: Foamy urine is good to mention, Ms. Creagh. While not always significant, it's worth investigating. Now, let’s move on to a bit more background. Have you had any urinary tract infections in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I had one particularly bad one about five years ago. I remember it was quite painful, and I needed antibiotics to clear it up. I’ve had a couple of milder ones since then, but they’ve resolved on their own, thankfully. I don’t recall having any other medical issues, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of UTIs. That’s helpful. And have you had any surgeries or major medical procedures?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. I’ve been very fortunate, health-wise, until this started. Just the usual check-ups and vaccinations, nothing major at all. I did have my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant surgical history. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and she also had high blood pressure. My father was generally healthy, though he did have some arthritis in his later years. I don't believe anyone else in my family has had any major kidney or bladder issues, as far as I know. It’s not something we really discussed much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of diabetes and hypertension. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a graphic designer, so I spend a lot of time sitting at a computer. I try to eat a healthy diet – lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein – but sometimes it’s hard to find the time to cook, and I do enjoy a good cup of coffee in the mornings. I’m married, and my husband and I enjoy walking our dog on the weekends. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol occasionally, usually a glass of wine with dinner.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Creagh. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. This will include checking your vital signs, listening to your abdomen, and a quick neurological check. Then, I would like to collect a urine sample for analysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Dr. Reisig. Please proceed. I'm happy to do whatever you think is necessary to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is within normal limits. Pulse and respiration are normal. Temperature is also normal. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, normoactive bowel sounds present in all quadrants. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, sensation intact. Now, if you could please step into the restroom and collect a urine sample in the provided cup, I will be just outside when you are finished. Please just hand it to me when you're ready.
PATIENT: Okay, Dr. Reisig. I’ll be right back with the sample.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Creagh. I will send this off to the lab for analysis. We'll check for signs of infection, blood, and protein levels. While we wait for the lab results, which should be back later today or tomorrow, I would like to ask you a few more questions, if you don’t mind. This is what we call a review of systems. I'm just going to ask about different parts of your body to see if you’ve been experiencing any other symptoms you may not have mentioned previously. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Dr. Reisig. Please proceed. I’m happy to answer whatever questions you have. I want to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let’s start with your gastrointestinal system. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation recently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. My digestion has been normal. I haven't had any issues with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. I’m quite regular, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Creagh. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin – rash, itching, dryness?
PATIENT: No, my skin has been fine. No rashes, no itching, no dryness. I do make sure to use moisturizer, especially after showering, but I haven't had any unusual problems. I did have a little bit of a sunburn a few weeks ago when we were gardening, but that cleared up quickly with some aloe vera.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your musculoskeletal system?
PATIENT: No issues there either, Dr. Reisig. I don't have any joint pain, muscle weakness, or stiffness. I do sometimes get a little bit of soreness after a long walk, but that's just normal aches and pains, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Good. And finally, regarding your neurological system, have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or numbness or tingling in your extremities?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No headaches, no dizziness, and my vision is perfectly fine. I haven't experienced any numbness or tingling either. Everything feels normal neurologically. I did have a very vivid dream last night, but that’s hardly a symptom, is it?
DOCTOR: No, a vivid dream isn't a medical symptom, Ms. Creagh. It sounds like you’re experiencing no other concerning symptoms, which is good. I’ve ordered a urinalysis and a complete blood count. We'll look at the urine sample to rule out infection or other abnormalities, and the blood test will give us a broader picture of your overall health and rule out anything systemic. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies to medications, Dr. Reisig. I’ve never had a reaction to anything I’ve taken. I've only needed antibiotics a couple of times, as I mentioned before, and I tolerated them well. I do have a slight sensitivity to certain fragrances, but that's not a medical allergy, just a preference.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not currently taking any medications at all, Dr. Reisig. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements either. I try to get everything I need from my diet.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh. We’ve covered quite a bit today. Based on what you've told me, the symptoms you're experiencing – bladder pressure, urgency, and incomplete emptying – could be due to a number of things, including a urinary tract infection, overactive bladder, or even something as simple as dehydration. However, we need the lab results to get a better understanding of what’s going on. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake – aim for at least eight glasses of water a day – and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate the bladder. I will call you as soon as the lab results are available, and we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Reisig, that all makes perfect sense. Increasing my fluid intake and avoiding caffeine and alcohol sounds reasonable. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. No, I don’t think I have any questions at this time. I’m just relieved that we’re getting to the bottom of this. Thank you very much for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Creagh. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any further concerns. I will be in touch soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you, Dr. Reisig. Thank you again. I will wait for your call. Have a wonderful day as well.
