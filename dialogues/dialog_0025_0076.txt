DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Oh, it’s these bumps on my legs, see? On my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda…hard. They hurt, too, especially when I’m walking around. Been botherin’ me for a couple weeks now.
DOCTOR: A couple weeks, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe three weeks now? It's hard to say exactly. Things kinda blend together when you get to be my age, you know? They didn’t start hurting right away, just kinda… appeared. Then got redder and started achin’.
DOCTOR: Right. And have they changed at all since they first appeared?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. They haven’t gotten more of them, if that makes sense. Just the ones I have are…well, they’re still there. And maybe a little bigger now? Not much, but I think so. They’re definitely more noticeable when I wear shorts. My wife pointed it out, said I shouldn’t ignore ‘em.
DOCTOR: And you haven't noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what kinda symptoms? I just got the bumps, that’s it. No fever, no feelin’ sick, nothin’ like that. Just these… things. They're kinda itchy sometimes, but not real bad. It's the pain that's the worst, especially after I’ve been on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said you've been on your feet a lot recently?
PATIENT: Yeah, I still do a little work helpin’ out at the warehouse. Mostly movin’ boxes, light stuff, nothin’ too heavy. I'm retired officially, but I like keepin’ busy. And my wife says I need to earn my keep! It’s not like I’m liftin’ cars or anything. Just…work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look at these bumps. If you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Sure, go ahead. They're probably not much to look at. They’re right here, see? Mostly on this leg, but a few on the other one too.
DOCTOR: Hmm. They are firm, and a bit warm to the touch. Do you have any history of varicose veins, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Varicose veins… I don’t think so. My wife might know better. She’s always tellin’ me to get checked for things! Blood clots… no, never been told I have those. I had a little swelling in my ankles a while back, but the doctor said it was just from bein’ on my feet too long. Nothin’ serious, he said. They don’t feel like they’re gonna burst or anything, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it could be stasis dermatitis, or possibly some early venous insufficiency. It’s common with age, and with being on your feet a lot. But to be certain, I'd like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your legs to check the blood flow. And a basic blood panel to rule out any other issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Doppler ultrasound… blood panel… sounds… complicated. Look, Doctor, I ain’t a complicated man. I just got these bumps and they hurt. Is it somethin’ serious? Do I need to, like, go to the hospital? I just want to know if I need to worry. I’m not real good with all the medical stuff.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Aluia, it does not sound like you need to go to the hospital. That’s why we’re doing these tests - to rule out anything serious and get a clear picture of what’s going on. The ultrasound is just a non-invasive scan to look at the veins in your legs. The blood panel is routine. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially with these things. We'll get the results back quickly, and then we can discuss a plan. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, that sounds a little better. Non-invasive… I like that. And routine blood work… I can handle that. So, you don't think it's, like, an infection or somethin’ dangerous? My grandson, he’s always readin’ about all sorts of diseases on the internet… scares me sometimes.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound like an infection at this point, Mr. Aluia. No fever, no redness spreading, which are typical signs. But we need to be thorough, and that's what these tests will help us determine. Your grandson is right to be cautious about health, but it's best to get information from a doctor, not the internet. I’m ordering the tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They'll take care of you. I’ll have the results sent to me, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that works. Down the hall, you said? Easy enough. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ it to me… and not makin’ me feel like I’m fallin’ apart. My wife’s gonna be glad I came in. She’s always worryin’ about me. I guess I’ll go get these tests done then. Just… let me know if it’s somethin’ bad, okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Aluia. We will. The nurse will let you know how to access the results online, and my office will call to schedule a follow-up. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. And… Doctor? You’re a good doctor.
