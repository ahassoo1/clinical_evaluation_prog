DOCTOR: Right. Hedy Cantoran, 57 years old. Good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. Just…tired. Really tired. And I keep…eating dirt. It’s stupid, I know. Don’t ask me why. It just…feels right, okay? I just want something to help me stop feeling so drained and stop with the…the stuff.
DOCTOR: “Dirt,” you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, dirt. Clay, mostly. From the garden. Don't look at me like that. It's not like I'm enjoying it. It’s just…a craving. And it’s getting worse, which is why I’m here, isn't it? Honestly, I haven't been feeling well for months now, but this…this is new. And frankly, embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Right. Months of not feeling well…and the dirt craving is recent. Can you tell me a bit more about this general feeling of unwellness?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's hard to explain. Just…everything is harder. Getting up, moving around…even thinking sometimes. Like my battery is always low. I used to be able to do everything, work all day, take care of things…now? I nap. A lot. My husband…he passed last year, and I guess things haven't been the same. But this tiredness…this is more than just sadness, you know? It's…physical. Like my body is fighting something.
DOCTOR: I see. Loss is…profound, and it certainly takes a toll. But you’re right to say this feels different, more physical. Okay. And has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean? Everything's changed since…nevermind. Let me think. I guess…I've been more irritable, I think. Snapping at people. Not like me at all. And…my stomach. It's been…off. Not really sick, but just…not right. Bloated, mostly. And I haven’t been…regular, if you catch my drift. Look, I’m a practical woman. I don't want to bore you with details. Is this dirt thing connected to all this?
DOCTOR: It could be. The craving for dirt—what we call pica—can sometimes be a sign of a nutritional deficiency. The irritability and stomach issues certainly fit with that. Before we jump to conclusions, though, I need to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat…when I remember. Not a big eater, never have been. My husband always made sure I was taken care of, but…now it’s just easier to skip meals sometimes. I drink water, I guess. And I take a multivitamin. The cheap kind. Does that matter? I don't understand all this fancy doctor talk. Just tell me if I need a shot or something.
DOCTOR: A multivitamin is a start, but sometimes it’s not enough. And no, you don't need a shot…not yet. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam and then order some blood work. It will help me see if there are any deficiencies or underlying issues causing this. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever gets this over with faster. I got things to do. Just…don’t keep me waiting. And please, try not to poke too much. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let's just listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take your blood pressure. Then we'll do a quick look at your throat and abdomen. After that, we’ll get the blood work ordered. It's a standard process, and it will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Let's start with your heart. Could you just take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. Deep breath… there. Happy now? Honestly, I don't even know why I bothered coming here. It's always waiting and poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are…regular, but a little faint. Blood pressure is slightly low, 108/70. And your respiratory rate is normal. Now, let's just take a look at your throat...open wide and say "ah." Throat looks clear. No obvious signs of infection. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Just let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here, on your left side?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, that one hurts a little. Not terrible, just…uncomfortable. It feels…bloated, like something's pushing. I told you my stomach hasn't been right. Honestly, I’ve been trying to ignore it. It's probably just gas. You're pushing too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, just trying to get a sense of things. It does feel a little distended, yes. And a bit tender to the touch. It could be gas, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Alright. I think we have enough for now. We'll get those blood tests ordered. I want to check your iron levels, vitamin B12, and a complete blood count to see if there’s anything else going on. It will also include a thyroid panel. I’ll also order a stool sample to rule out any parasites. I’m going to give you the requisition forms, and the lab is just down the hall. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Parasites? Seriously? Now you're telling me I have worms? I haven't felt this ridiculous in years. Look, just tell me what I need to do. Forms, fine. Lab, fine. Just…don't call me with a bunch of scary results, okay? I don't need that stress. Can I at least get something for this tiredness now? A pill, something?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I'm not trying to scare you. It's standard procedure to rule out all possibilities. We're just being thorough. As for something for the tiredness, I'm hesitant to prescribe anything before we have the blood work results. We need to know why you're tired before we can treat it effectively. Taking something without knowing the cause could potentially mask a more serious problem. Here are the forms. Please take these to the lab, and they’ll take it from there. Once the results are back—usually within a few days—my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. And please, try to rest and drink plenty of water. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just…get this over with. I don't have time for this. And don't call me with anything silly, okay? I'm a busy woman. .
