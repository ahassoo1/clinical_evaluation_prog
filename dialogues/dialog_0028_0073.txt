DOCTOR: Alright. So, Ms. Woodring, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s… well, it’s my stomach. Just constantly running to the bathroom. I’ve tried everything the drugstore sells, and it’s not stopping. It's been going on for weeks, and frankly, it’s embarrassing and exhausting.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks! Honestly, I don’t know exactly how many, I stopped keeping track after the first week of humiliation. It’s just… constant. And nothing helps. I’m not one to complain, but this is ridiculous. I have things to do, you know? I can't keep cancelling appointments.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “constant” is… vague. Is it after meals?
PATIENT: Ugh, sometimes. Not always. It just… happens. Look, is this important? I just need something that will stop it. I don’t need a dissertation on my digestive system. I'm a painter, I don't have time for this. I have deadlines!
DOCTOR: Right. So, no fever, no blood in the stool, no weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Definitely no blood, thank goodness. And I… I haven’t really weighed myself lately, to be honest. I’ve been… distracted. Probably a little lighter, I guess, with everything I’ve been… losing. But I wouldn’t say I’ve been trying to lose weight, if that’s what you mean. It’s just… not a priority. Honestly, I'm more concerned with getting this over with.
DOCTOR: And you said you’ve tried… over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Yes! Everything. Imodium, Pepto-Bismol, those charcoal pills… you name it. I even tried some of that herbal stuff my cousin recommended, which, let me tell you, tasted absolutely awful and did nothing. I’m really not one for alternative medicine, but I was desperate. It's been a waste of money, honestly. I just want something that works.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam. Lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Honestly. This is all so unnecessary. Fine. But make it quick, please. I have a commission that’s due next week, and I’m already behind schedule. I don't have time to lay around all day getting poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Normal bowel sounds… some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. Nothing alarming. Do you have any pain right now?
PATIENT: Well, it's not pleasant, if that’s what you mean. It’s just… a dull ache, really. It comes and goes. It's probably nothing, honestly. I probably just ate something bad. I had some questionable fish last week, but I didn’t want to bother anyone with something that might just… pass. Honestly, I don’t like making a fuss. Just… is there anything you can give me to make it stop?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your… history, and the exam findings, it’s likely a mild case of infectious gastroenteritis. Probably viral. We’ll do some stool tests just to be sure. I’m prescribing you something for the symptoms. It won't cure it, but it should offer some relief. Drink plenty of fluids, bland diet. If it doesn’t improve in a few days, or if you develop a fever, blood in the stool, or severe pain, then come back. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m perfectly healthy, usually. Just… this stomach thing. Honestly, it’s probably just stress. My husband… passed away last year. It’s been… difficult. But I don’t expect a doctor’s visit to fix grief. Just… the prescription, please. And can we be quick about this? I really need to get back to work. I’m not a fan of hospitals, or doctors, to be frank. This is all rather unpleasant. .
DOCTOR: Here. Avoid dairy, caffeine, and alcohol. Follow the dosage instructions carefully. And if your symptoms worsen, do not hesitate to return. I’m also putting in a referral for a basic stool culture. That’s all. .
