DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 83 years young. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, 83… feels like it sometimes! Well, it’s a bit of a worry, really. My granddaughter, bless her heart, she kept saying I should come in. There’s been… well, some weakness, you see. Comes and goes. And my sister, God rest her soul, she used to get terrible headaches… awful migraines. So, I thought it best to get checked out, just in case. It's hard to explain exactly what's going on, though. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Weakness, you say. Comes and goes… and a family history of headaches. I understand memory can be… unreliable at times. Let’s try to piece this together. When did you first notice this weakness, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I first notice it? That’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, you know? Not like a fall or anything. It just… crept up on me. Maybe… a few months ago? Perhaps longer. It's hard to say for sure. It's mostly on this side… <points to her right side with a shaky hand>… my right arm and leg feel a bit… heavy sometimes. But then it's okay again. It’s very confusing.
DOCTOR: A few months, primarily on your right side. And it comes and goes. Do you notice anything specifically that triggers it, or makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggers? No, not that I can recall. It doesn’t seem to happen after any particular activity, or… at a certain time of day. Sometimes it’s there when I wake up, sometimes it’s not. Honestly, Doctor, I wish I could be more helpful. It just is. And then it isn't. It's like a little… ghost, maybe? Comes and goes as it pleases. Does that make any sense? <pauses and looks at Dr. Gonzalezperez with a worried expression> I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Tofani, that is… perfectly understandable. It sounds frustrating. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Now, besides the weakness, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… symptoms… let me think. Well, sometimes I get a bit… fuzzy-headed, you know? Like I’m looking through a fog. It doesn't last long, just a few minutes. And… I have been getting headaches, now that you mention it. Not terrible, like my sister used to get, but a dull ache at the back of my head. It comes and goes with the… fuzziness, I suppose. Does that count? And, oh! I almost forgot… sometimes my vision gets a little… blurry, just for a moment. It's quick, but it worries me. I don't know if it's all connected, though.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy-headedness, headaches, and brief blurry vision. We are building a picture here, Ms. Tofani. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, my… that was a long time ago. Let me see… I had a touch of high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I took some pills for it, but I think I stopped a while back. And… arthritis, of course. Everyone gets that when they get old, don’t they? It’s mostly in my hands and knees. Nothing major. And… I had my gallbladder out, goodness, must be 30 years ago! Apart from that… I think that’s it. I used to go to the doctor regularly, but… well, things slip your mind, don’t they? I’m sorry I can’t be more precise. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, arthritis, and gallbladder removal. Yes, that’s helpful. And are you currently taking any medications at all, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear, not really. Just a little something for my aches and pains sometimes, when they get bad. Something my granddaughter gets me from the drugstore. I don't even remember the name of it. It’s just… a pain reliever, I suppose. Nothing special. I try not to take too much, you know? I don't want to get hooked on anything. I used to take a pill for water retention, but the doctor took me off that a long time ago. It made me feel… funny. So, no, not really taking anything regularly. Just the occasional pain pill. <pauses> I hope that's not a problem.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Tofani, that is fine. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better sense of what's going on. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam – check your reflexes, strength, and balance. Will that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. It sounds… thorough. I suppose I should have come in sooner. Yes, please. Do whatever you need to do. I just want to feel… normal again. Though, at my age… <trails off with a small sigh>. Go ahead, dear. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit here for me, please. First, let's check your blood pressure. <begins taking Ms. Tofani's blood pressure> It’s a little elevated, 148 over 82. Not terribly high, but something we’ll keep an eye on. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope… <listens to Ms. Tofani's heart and lungs> Breathing is a little labored, but no wheezing or crackles that I can detect at this moment. <continues with a neurological exam, checking reflexes, strength, and balance> Your reflexes are a little diminished on your right side, and there is some slight weakness in your right arm and leg, as you described. Balance is a little unsteady. I'm going to have you stand and walk for me, if you are able. <observes Ms. Tofani as she stands and walks a few steps> Hmm… a slight shuffling gait. Now, let's check your pupils… <examines Ms. Tofani’s pupils> Pupils are equal and reactive to light. <pauses and looks at Ms. Tofani> I’d like to order a few tests, Ms. Tofani, to help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. A blood test to check your overall health, and a CT scan of your brain, just to rule out anything serious. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh my… a CT scan! That sounds… serious. I've never had one before. Contrast dye… goodness. No, I don't think I have any allergies. My sister was allergic to penicillin, but I've never had a reaction to anything. I just… get a bit nervous, you know? All these tests. Is it something bad, Doctor? I hope it's not something bad. I’m just an old lady, after all. Is there any reason to be worried? <looks at Dr. Gonzalezperez with a frightened expression> I trust you, dear, but… it’s all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Now, Ms. Tofani, let's not jump to conclusions. A CT scan is simply a way for us to get a detailed look at your brain, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It’s a precautionary measure, to rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. The contrast dye helps us see things more clearly, but it's generally very safe. The allergy concern is simply a routine question. Now, regarding your symptoms – the weakness, the fuzziness, the headaches – they could be a number of things. It's too early to say definitively. We need the results of the tests to give us a clearer picture. I understand you're nervous, and that's perfectly natural. I'll explain everything to you every step of the way, and we'll work through this together. I am ordering the blood test right now, and will get the order for the CT scan sent to the radiology department. They will call you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that's… reassuring, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. What about the blood test? Will it be painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a little tea party with my granddaughter next week, and I’m hoping I’ll be well enough to go. That’s very important to me. And… is it possible it’s just… old age? Sometimes I just feel… tired. <pauses, looking wistfully into the distance> It’s hard to explain. I just want to be able to enjoy my time with my family. .
DOCTOR: The blood test is very quick, Ms. Tofani. Just a small prick of a needle, and a few tubes of blood will be drawn. It shouldn’t be painful, just a little discomfort. As for the results, it usually takes a few days for them to come back. I will call you as soon as I have them. As for whether it’s just…old age…it is possible, of course. But we need to rule out any other potential causes before we can say for certain. It is always better to be safe than sorry. Now, I will get the orders sent over, and the receptionist will schedule your appointments. I will also write you a note for your granddaughter, just in case you need it. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call us. <begins typing on the computer> Do you have any other concerns at this moment?
