DOCTOR: Good morning, Terasa. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s my hearing, mostly. It’s been… funny, lately. Comes and goes. And I get a bit dizzy with it, sometimes. It's hard to explain, really. My daughter, Lani, she's the one who made the appointment, to be honest. She worries about me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you have Lani looking out for you. “Funny” is a perfectly fine way to describe it when it’s hard to put into words. So, it’s your hearing that’s been fluctuating, and you've noticed some dizziness accompanying it at times. Can you tell me a bit more about the hearing changes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Lani’s a good girl. Always has been. Um… well, it's like… sometimes I just can’t hear things clearly. Like, people are talking, but it’s muffled. Or it sounds like they're far away, even when they're right next to me. And then… it just comes back. Not always right away, though. Sometimes it takes a little while. It’s just… unpredictable, you know? It’s been happening on and off for… oh, I don't know, maybe a few months now? It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: I see. Fluctuating hearing with periods of muffled sound, and it’s been going on for several months. That is hard to keep track of. And you mentioned it comes and goes. When you say it comes and goes, can you think of anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Triggers… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t really… noticed anything specific, to be honest. It doesn’t seem to matter if I’m quiet or noisy. It’s happened when I’m resting, and when I’m out gardening. I do love my garden, though. My husband, Ratu, he always said I had a green thumb. Oh, but that's… never mind. No, nothing really makes it happen, as far as I can tell. It just… does.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it's helpful to know you haven't noticed any specific triggers. It can sometimes be difficult to pinpoint the cause. Now, you mentioned dizziness. Can you describe that dizziness for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the dizziness… it's not like I'm going to fall over, not usually. It’s more like… everything spins a little bit. Or feels unsteady. Like I’m on a boat, maybe? Not a big boat, more like a little fishing boat. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes. And it always happens when my hearing goes funny, I think. Or maybe it's the other way around. It’s hard to say which one starts first, you know? Everything gets mixed up. I get a bit of a headache with it sometimes too. A dull ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a spinning or unsteady sensation, often accompanied by the hearing changes, and sometimes a dull headache. It sounds like those symptoms tend to occur together. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… um… well, I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago. The doctor put me on some pills for it, and I took them for a long time. But I don’t take anything for it now, I think he said it was under control. And… oh, I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. That was… unpleasant. Other than that… not much, I don’t think. My mother had a bit of trouble with her heart when she got older, and my brother, he had diabetes. Does that count? I don’t have either of those, though. I hope not.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. History of high blood pressure that's currently well-managed, gallbladder surgery in the past, and a family history of heart trouble and diabetes. That gives us a good starting point. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I used to get stung by bees a lot when I was a girl, playing in the garden, but that didn’t bother me much. Just a bit of swelling, that’s all. I don't take any medications regularly, so I haven't really had much chance to be allergic to anything, I suppose. Just the blood pressure pills for a while, like I said, and those didn't bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and not currently taking any medications. That's good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your ears, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to check your balance and coordination. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s… that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… don’t take too long, alright? I have to get home and… well, Lani’s making a roast, and I don't want it to burn. Just be gentle, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as gentle as possible. And I promise to be as quick as I can without rushing. Okay, looking in your ears now… Both ear canals are clear. Your eardrums appear intact, though they are a little… dull in color. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs next. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Okay, just stand here for a moment with your feet together and eyes closed… And now, walk a few steps forward and backward… Your balance seems a little unsteady, but it's not significantly impaired. You do have some mild difficulty with coordination.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That doesn't sound very good, does it? Unsteady and… difficulty with coordination. Is it… serious? I just want to be able to hear properly again, and not feel so dizzy. Is there something wrong with my brain? My mother, she… well, she got a bit forgetful towards the end. I don't want that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Terasa. It’s good you’re voicing these worries. The findings from the exam aren’t necessarily indicative of a serious problem, but they do warrant further investigation. The unsteady balance and mild coordination difficulty, combined with your fluctuating hearing and dizziness, suggest a possible issue with your inner ear or the pathways that connect your inner ear to your brain. The possibility of something affecting your brain is certainly something we need to consider, but it's not the most likely explanation at this point. Forgetfulness and dizziness can be related to a number of things, and we need to rule out other causes first. I’d like to order an audiogram – that’s a hearing test – to assess the extent of your hearing loss. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. The MRI is just a precaution, to be thorough. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Oh… an MRI… that sounds… scary. Is it painful? And a hearing test… I already know my hearing’s bad, Doctor. What good will another test do? My daughter, Lani, she’s very good with these things. Maybe you should just talk to her. She can explain it all properly. I… I don’t understand all this medical talk. And I really just want to go home now. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can I just… go?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Terasa. An MRI can seem daunting, but it’s completely painless. You simply lie still inside a large machine, and it uses magnetic waves to create detailed images of your brain. It's like a very detailed photograph. There is no radiation involved, and you can even listen to music during the scan. The hearing test is more about where the hearing loss is and how severe it is. That information is critical in determining the possible cause and the best course of treatment. It's not just about confirming that you have hearing loss, it's about understanding why. I'm happy to talk to Lani as well, but it’s important that you understand the recommendations. I want to make sure you feel informed and comfortable with the next steps. Before we decide on anything, let's try to address your immediate concerns. You mentioned wanting to go home. We can certainly discuss that. However, I strongly recommend at least getting the audiogram done as soon as possible. It’s a simple, non-invasive test that can provide valuable information. Would you be willing to schedule an audiogram for tomorrow?
PATIENT: Oh… tomorrow… alright. Just the hearing test, then. No MRI. Not today, not ever, maybe. My daughter, she can handle the scheduling. She’s very good at these things. Just tell her to make it quick, alright? And not too loud. My ears are… sensitive, remember? I just want to get this over with. And then I can go home? Lani’s making a roast. It'll probably be cold by now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Terasa. Just the audiogram for tomorrow, scheduled through Lani. I’ll make a note to have the technician be mindful of your ear sensitivity. And yes, you are free to go home after we get that scheduled. I’ll have the receptionist provide you with the paperwork, and she can coordinate scheduling with Lani. We’ll take things one step at a time. Getting the audiogram is a good first step. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased dizziness, sudden hearing loss, or severe headache – please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… tell Lani to make sure the test isn't too loud. And thank you, Doctor. For… trying. I really do appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I need to get home to my roast.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be sure to note your concern about the test volume. And you're very welcome, Terasa. I’m glad I could help. Have a good day, and I hope the roast is still warm when you get home. Please let Lani know we are here if you have any questions. .
