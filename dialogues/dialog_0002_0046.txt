DOCTOR: Hi Marialena, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Dr. Ranjan. Thank you for having me. I’ve been experiencing some… well, pressure in my bladder. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. That’s good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… a consistent feeling, like I need to urinate, even when I’ve just gone. It doesn’t necessarily hurt, it's more… uncomfortable and a bit distracting. It’s been happening for about three weeks, I’d say. Perhaps a little longer, but that feels like a good estimate. It seems to be more noticeable in the afternoons, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a consistent feeling of needing to urinate, even after you've gone, for about three weeks, and it's more noticeable in the afternoons. Distracting and uncomfortable, but not painful. That’s helpful. Now, when you do go to the bathroom, are you able to urinate normally?
PATIENT: Yes, when I am able to go, the stream is… normal, I suppose. It doesn’t feel weak or strained, and I empty my bladder completely, as far as I can tell. It just… doesn’t last very long, if that makes sense. And then, shortly after, the pressure returns. It’s a bit of a cycle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so normal stream, feels like you empty completely, but it doesn't last long and the pressure comes back quickly. A bit of a cycle, you said. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no chills. I haven't noticed any blood in my urine. I have been feeling a little more tired than usual lately, but honestly, who isn’t these days? It's hard to say if that’s related. And… my lower abdomen feels slightly tender to the touch, especially in the evenings. Not painful, just… sensitive. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. No fever, no chills, no blood in the urine, increased tiredness, and some tenderness in your lower abdomen, especially in the evenings. Alright, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever had any urinary tract infections, or any other kidney or bladder problems?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I had one UTI about five years ago. It was quite unpleasant, and I remember feeling a burning sensation when I urinated. I was treated with antibiotics and recovered fully. Aside from that, no, I haven’t had any other issues with my kidneys or bladder. I do have a family history of diabetes, on my mother's side, but I’ve always been careful with my diet and I’ve never been diagnosed with it myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, one UTI five years ago, treated successfully with antibiotics. Family history of diabetes on your mother’s side, but you haven’t been diagnosed yourself. Good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies to medications. I've taken various antibiotics and pain relievers in the past without any adverse reactions. I’m also not currently taking any regular medications, just the occasional over-the-counter ibuprofen for headaches.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and only occasional ibuprofen for headaches. And just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a graphic designer, so I spend a lot of my day sitting at a computer. I try to take breaks and walk around, but it's not always easy. I'm married and we both work full-time. We don't have any children. I drink plenty of water throughout the day, usually around eight glasses. I eat a fairly balanced diet, mostly home-cooked meals. And I try to get around seven to eight hours of sleep each night, although sometimes work keeps me up a little later. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol occasionally, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Graphic designer, mostly sedentary, drink a good amount of water, balanced diet, 7-8 hours of sleep, no smoking, and occasional alcohol. Let me just take a look at your record here… Height is 165 cm, weight is 64 kg… okay. Medicare is listed as your insurance. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Certainly, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Yes, please do. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I understand a physical exam will help determine what’s going on. Please let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Great. No specific preparation needed. If you could just lie down on the table for me, that would be perfect. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen, and then I'll gently palpate it to check for tenderness or any abnormalities. I’ll also do a quick neurological exam just to be thorough. It’s all pretty standard, nothing to worry about. Okay, sounds normal so far. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen… Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, that’s… not painful, exactly. It’s just a little sensitive, right here. It's more of a discomfort than a sharp pain. Like a dull ache, almost. It's not constant, it comes and goes. It seems to be worse when my bladder feels full. Does that make sense? It’s also a bit tender on the sides, lower down, but less so than right in the center.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tenderness in the lower center of your abdomen, with some milder tenderness on the sides. It's a dull ache that’s worse when your bladder feels full. Alright, everything else seems normal neurologically. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like we need to rule out a few things. It could be a urinary tract infection, even though you don't have a fever or blood in your urine, sometimes they can present atypically. It could also be something called interstitial cystitis, which causes bladder pressure and pain. We also want to rule out any kidney issues. I’d like to order a urine analysis and a urine culture to check for infection. I also want to check your kidney function with a basic metabolic panel. And just to be thorough, I'm going to order a complete blood count to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Dr. Ranjan. I trust your judgment. Please do all of those tests. I want to get to the bottom of this and find out what’s going on. I'm happy to provide a sample whenever you’re ready. Is there anything else I need to do to prepare for the tests? Perhaps a specific type of water to drink beforehand?
DOCTOR: No, no special preparation needed for the urine tests or blood work. Just drink normally, as you have been. We'll collect the urine sample now, and then the nurse will draw some blood for the other tests. Please try to collect a midstream sample, if you could. I'll explain that briefly – start urinating, then pause for a few seconds, and collect the sample midstream. That helps avoid any contamination. Once you've collected the sample, I'll send it to the lab. Okay, great. I’ve sent the sample to the lab. The nurse will be in shortly to draw blood. It’ll just take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Dr. Ranjan. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. I'll wait for the nurse to draw my blood, and I look forward to hearing from you when the results are available. Thank you again for your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. .
