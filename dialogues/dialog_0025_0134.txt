DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well… it’s my stomach, I reckon. It’s been botherin’ me something fierce lately. I just… I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full, and then… well, then I feel sick. It's been going on for a little while now, but it’s gettin’ worse, I think. Honestly, my memory ain’t what it used to be, so it’s hard to say exactly how long.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Botherin’ you fierce,” alright. And you feel full quickly, and then nauseous?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Quickly, yes. And not a good kind of full, you know? More like… stuffed, even when I haven’t eaten much at all. And then… this queasy feeling comes over me. It doesn’t always happen right after, sometimes it’s a bit later. It’s just… uncomfortable. Makes it hard to do much of anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is this nausea… does it lead to you actually vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes. Not every time, thank goodness. Mostly it's just… the feeling like I might. It happens more often when I try to eat something heavier, I think. Like… a proper meal. Soup's usually alright, though. And crackers. Little things. It’s been makin' it hard to keep my strength up, you know? Especially with… well, with everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say “everything”, are you experiencing any increased stress or anxiety lately?
PATIENT: Oh, bless your heart for askin’. Well… yes, I suppose. It’s been a hard year. Lost my husband, see. Been… adjustin’. And then there’s the treatments, of course. They… they take it outta you, you know? Not that I’m complainin’, mind you. I need ‘em. But they don't make things easier, if you catch my drift. It's just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Loss is difficult, and treatments often have side effects. Let's talk about those treatments for a moment. What kind of treatments are you receiving, and where are you receiving them?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It’s at the cancer center, downtown. I see Dr. Abernathy, I think her name is. And… it's the infusions. They put somethin’ in my arm, through a little tube. It's… chemotherapy, I believe. Or somethin’ like that. I get it every other week. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. They tell me everything, but it just… goes in one ear and out the other sometimes. It's a lot of new words, you see.
DOCTOR: Right, chemotherapy infusions. And you’ve been getting those every other week. Okay. Have you noticed if this stomach trouble started around the same time as the chemotherapy, or has it been a gradual thing?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Let me think now… I started the treatments… oh, goodness, I believe it was in the spring, maybe March? And… yes, I think the stomach trouble started around then too. Maybe a little bit after, but not long after. It was gradual at first, like just not feelin’ hungry. But it’s definitely got worse over the last few months. It’s… it's hard to say for sure, though. Like I said, my memory… It just ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the nausea and early fullness, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. Well, I’ve been feelin’ tired, of course. More tired than usual, even for an old woman. And… sometimes I feel a little weak. And… Oh! I have lost a little weight, I think. My clothes are a bit looser than they used to be, but I haven’t weighed myself recently. Everything just feels… off, generally. It’s hard to explain. Like somethin' is slowly drainin' me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue, weakness, unintentional weight loss… We’re building a picture here. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a personal question. Well… yes, actually. I haven't been… regular, you might say. Sometimes I have trouble goin', and sometimes... well, sometimes it's a bit too much, if you understand. It’s been worryin’ me a bit, to be honest. It’s not like it used to be at all. Everything feels… upset, generally. I haven't said much about it because... well, it just seemed like another thing to add to the list.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Kelder. That’s important information. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle, please. My bones ain’t as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is… soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. I don’t feel any masses. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright. That tenderness… that’s where it feels most uncomfortable, usually. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. And yes, checkin' my reflexes is fine. I always did have trouble with those, even when I was young. Maybe that's why I wasn't much good at sports!
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, which isn’t uncommon at your age, but within normal limits. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. The nausea, early fullness, weight loss, changes in bowel habits, and tenderness in your upper right quadrant, combined with your chemotherapy treatment… it could be a number of things. It could be a side effect of the chemotherapy itself, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm concerned about potential liver involvement, given the tenderness. Chemotherapy can sometimes affect the liver. It could also be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I want to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and liver function tests. We’ll also do a stool sample to check for any infections. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Liver involvement? That sounds… serious. I suppose if you think it’s best, though… yes, I trust your judgement. Blood work and a stool sample… alright. Whatever you need to do to figure out what's goin' on. Will it be painful? I don’t like needles much, you see.
DOCTOR: The blood work will involve a standard needle stick, yes. We'll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. The stool sample… well, that’s just collecting a sample after you use the restroom. No needle involved there! We'll get those tests ordered right away. The lab is right down the hall, and the nurse will help you with the collection. It should only take a few minutes. Once we have the results – usually within a couple of days – we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and eat smaller, more frequent meals. Avoid anything that seems to trigger your nausea. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear about the stool sample. Smaller meals… yes, I’ve been tryin’ that. It doesn’t always help, though. Hmm… Will these tests tell us if it’s the chemotherapy makin’ me sick, or somethin’ else? And… if it is somethin’ else… what then? I’m just… worried about everything, you see. It's hard to keep track of everything and… I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Kelder. These tests will help us differentiate between side effects of the chemotherapy and another underlying cause. The blood work will tell us a lot about your liver function, your kidney function, and your overall health. It can also rule out things like infections or inflammation. If it is something else, then we'll need to investigate further. Depending on the results, that could involve imaging studies like an ultrasound or a CT scan. We may also need to consult with a specialist, like a gastroenterologist or an oncologist. I understand you're worried, and you're absolutely not a bother. That’s what I’m here for – to help you figure out what's going on and to provide you with the best possible care. We will take things one step at a time. I’m also going to write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a gastroenterologist. It’s good to have a specialist on board even if we determine it is a chemotherapy side effect. They can help manage your symptoms and ensure you're getting the best supportive care. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Oh, a specialist… that sounds… reassuring, I suppose. Thank you. I think… I think that’s all for now. Just… try to stay hydrated and eat smaller meals, you said? And the blood work and stool sample… and the referral to Dr. Ramirez. It’s a lot to remember. But thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you listenin’ to an old woman ramble on. I guess I’ll go see the nurse now, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It’s my job. And please, don't apologize for “rambling”. I need all the information you can give me. The nurse will guide you through the next steps. She’ll have the paperwork for the lab and the referral. Here's a printed summary of everything we discussed today, just in case you forget anything. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you. That’s very thoughtful. A printed summary… that will be very helpful. Alright. I guess I’ll go find the nurse, then. Thank you again, Doctor Fourney. You have a good day now.
