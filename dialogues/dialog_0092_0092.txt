DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Giganti, huh? Sounds… foreign. Anyway, I’m here 'cause I can’t… breathe good no more. Feels like sandpaper in my throat, and my eyes are always scratchy. Been happenin’ a while now. Don't remember exactly when it started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. And thank you for sharing that with me. "Giganti" is Italian, actually. It’s a family name. So, you’ve been experiencing some difficulty breathing and a scratchy sensation in your throat and eyes for some time now. When you say “some time,” could you try to give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate? Hmph. Doctors always wantin' numbers. Let me think… maybe… six months? Could be longer. Everything kinda blurs together when you get old, you know? Not like I keep a calendar of when my throat starts feelin’ dry. It just… is. I used to be able to yell at the kids next door without coughin’, now I can barely say hello. That's somethin', at least. I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Guilds. It's perfectly alright if you don’t have exact dates. Six months gives me a good starting point. And it’s good you’ve noticed a change in your ability to speak, that’s helpful information. Could you describe the feeling in your throat a bit more?
PATIENT: It's… like someone left a towel in there, a real dry one. And it don’t go away, no matter how much water I drink. I drink a lot of water, let me tell ya. Used to enjoy a good rum and coke, but that just makes it worse. Hurts when I swallow, too. Not a bad hurt, just… annoying. Like sandpaper, I told ya. Everything’s sandpaper. You understand, right? It’s not like I can show you sandpaper in my throat.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Guilds, I understand. A dry, scratchy sensation, almost like sandpaper, that isn’t relieved by drinking water, and some discomfort when you swallow. It sounds quite irritating. Now, aside from the throat and eyes, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… Let me think. I get tired easier, I guess. Used to be able to work on my car all weekend, now I gotta take naps. And my skin… feels like lizard skin sometimes. Real flaky. Don't tell me that's somethin' serious, though. I ain't got time for fancy skin creams. Just want to be able to breathe, that's all. You know, back in my day… we didn't need doctors for every little thing. But times change, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. Fatigue and dry, flaky skin alongside the throat and eye irritation. We'll figure this out. It’s good you’re telling me everything, even if it doesn’t seem directly related. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don't think so. My wife used to take my temperature when I was sick, but she’s… gone now. Long gone. Night sweats… maybe? Hard to tell. I sleep with the air conditioner on full blast, so I'm usually cold. Don't remember sweatin' in my sleep. Honestly, doctor, I mostly just remember bein' tired. And thirsty. Real, real thirsty. Is this gonna take long? I got a bingo game at two.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. That's perfectly alright. We will try to keep this as efficient as possible. No fever or chills, and uncertain about night sweats. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. The little blue pill for my… you know. Keeps things workin', if you catch my drift. And somethin' for my blood pressure, the white one. Small one. Can’t remember the name, never could. And sometimes I take somethin’ for my arthritis, when it’s real bad. That’s a yellow one. Everything’s a different color with these pills. My daughter brings 'em, she keeps track of it all. I just swallow 'em. Don't bother with all that fancy stuff. Mostly just makes me thirsty.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're taking medication for erectile dysfunction, blood pressure, and arthritis as needed. It's helpful you're letting me know, even if you don’t know the specific names. We can certainly get a list from your daughter if you'd like. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. Used to love shellfish, before it got expensive. Never had any trouble with anything. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, after a big meal. But that's just from eatin' too much, not an allergy. My wife always said I had an iron stomach. She's gone now, though. Long gone. Everything's gone now. Except the thirst. Still got the thirst.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And we've covered a lot of helpful information already. Now, can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Hmph. That's a long story. I had… somethin’ with my heart a long time ago. They stuck a tube in my leg, I remember that part. And my blood pressure’s been high for years, that’s why I take the pills. I used to be a traffic technician, you know? Lots of stress. And I broke my arm once, fallin' off a ladder. Not much else, really. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Though I ain’t feelin' so lucky now. This dry mouth is killin' me. Can I have some water?
DOCTOR: Certainly, please drink as much as you need. So, a history of a heart procedure, high blood pressure, and a broken arm. Do you recall what the heart procedure was for?
PATIENT: Heart procedure… Now that's fuzzy. Something about a blockage, I think. They said my arteries were clogged up. They put a little spring in there, to hold 'em open. A stent, that's what they called it. Years ago, though. Real years ago. I don't remember much else about it. Doctors talkin', machines beepin', me feelin' sleepy. That's about it. I was younger then, not so thirsty all the time. Is this bingo game gonna start without me?
DOCTOR: Okay, a stent placement for a blocked artery. That's very helpful information. And don't worry, we will get through this as quickly as possible. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides the heart procedure?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid. Real simple thing, they said. And… oh! I had a mole removed from my back, a long time ago. The doctor said it looked suspicious, so he cut it off. That's about it. Nothing major. Just the appendix and the mole. And the stent, of course. But that was for my heart, not… regular surgery, if you catch my drift. All this talkin' is makin' me even thirstier. Can I have another sip of water?
DOCTOR: Of course, please drink as much as you need. So, appendectomy and mole removal in addition to the stent placement. Now, can you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Family medical history… Hmph. My mother, she had… somethin' with her heart. Died young, too young. And my father, he had diabetes. Lost a leg, poor guy. My brother, he had high blood pressure, just like me. And my sister… she had arthritis. Real bad arthritis. Everything runs in the family, it seems. Bad luck, mostly. No good genes in this family, I tell ya. That's why I'm here, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. Thank you. Now, regarding your social history, do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never smoked a day in my life. Tried it once, didn't like it. Made me cough. Drink? Used to enjoy a rum and coke now and then, before all this throat business. But it makes me even drier, so I stopped. Recreational drugs? Hmph. I'm eighty-three years old, doctor. What do you think? I get enough excitement tryin' to win at bingo. Seriously, is this bingo game over yet?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. No smoking, limited alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. And I apologize for taking up your time; we will be as quick as possible. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? I already told ya, no allergies! I eat everything. Shellfish, peanuts, whatever. My wife used to worry about it, but I never had a problem. Maybe a little heartburn now and then, but that's just from eatin' too much. Honestly, doctor, you're askin' me the same questions over and over. Is this gonna take much longer? I got a game to win!
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mr. Guilds. My apologies for the repetition. I sometimes do that when trying to be thorough. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. But be gentle, okay? I ain't as young as I used to be. And hurry up, will ya? I can hear 'em callin' my number already.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Your heart sounds a bit… irregular. I’m hearing a slightly faster rate than normal, and there's a subtle murmur. Your lungs sound clear, but you do have a slightly elevated respiratory rate. Your throat is quite dry and there's some redness, but no obvious signs of infection. I can see some dryness in your oral mucosa as well. I’m going to recommend a few tests to help us determine the cause of your symptoms. These include a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? What for? I just want some water and a way to breathe! All these machines and pokin' and proddin'… it ain't gonna magically fix my throat. And an EKG? Sounds scary. Look, doc, I'm an old man. Sometimes things just… wear out. Maybe I'm just gettin' old. Is there anything simpler you can do? Like… give me a cough drop?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Guilds. You're right, sometimes things do just wear out, and I don’t want to subject you to unnecessary tests. However, these tests will help us rule out any serious underlying conditions and ensure we're providing you with the best possible care. The EKG is a very simple, painless procedure that provides valuable information about your heart rhythm. In the meantime, I can certainly give you a cough drop. But I do recommend we proceed with the blood tests and EKG. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! But make it quick, okay? And no pokin' and proddin' if you don't have to. I got a bingo game to win, remember? And tell those lab people to be gentle. I bruise easy. Just get it over with, doc. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guilds. I will personally ensure the lab technicians are gentle. It will take just a few minutes to draw the blood, and the EKG is very quick. I’ll also call the lab ahead to let them know you're coming and to be especially careful. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, continue to stay hydrated and rest as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmph. No. Just get it over with. And tell me when my number’s called. That’s all I ask. Just hurry up, doc. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Let’s head to the lab. I’ll be right here when you get back, and we can discuss the results as soon as they are available.
