DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It's lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it’s about my legs. They just…gave out on me, practically. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a really nasty cold. Not flu, a cold. There's a difference, you know. And now, walking is…difficult. It’s very inconvenient, to say the least, considering my profession.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. A cold is quite different from the flu. Thank you for clarifying. So, the weakness in your legs began a few days after recovering from a cold. Could you describe what you mean by “gave out”?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not like I collapsed or anything dramatic. More like…they just feel incredibly heavy and wobbly. Like trying to walk through mud, only the mud is inside my legs. And it's both legs, which is…odd, isn't it? I mean, usually things happen on one side, not both sides at once. It makes me think it’s something…serious. I really rely on being able to walk, you understand. Tours, travel… it’s my livelihood.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. Firestone. And it is good you’re paying attention to the fact that it’s affecting both legs. "Heavy and wobbly," you say…and this started shortly after your cold resolved. Has this weakness been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s been… fluctuating, I suppose is the word. It was a little better yesterday, I thought, so I tried to do a short walking tour – a very short one, mind you – and regretted it immediately. This morning? Much worse. It's definitely worse after I've been on my feet for even a little while. Like they need…a rest, but even with a rest, they don’t seem to fully recover. It's frustrating. I’ve never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: I see. Fluctuating weakness, worse with activity, and not fully resolving with rest… Alright. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not much to tell. I’ve always been a very healthy person. I eat well – mostly. I don't smoke, hardly drink. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, you know. But nothing major. No surgeries, no chronic conditions. I'm on Medicare, of course, because of my age, but it’s mostly for preventative things. I was divorced a few years back, so that was stressful, but physically? I've been quite robust, if you understand me. It's why this is so alarming.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Firestone. A change in your usual health is concerning. And it's good to know you have no significant past medical or surgical history. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 87, so genetics are on my side, I suppose. She was very active her whole life. My father… he had some issues with his heart later in life, but again, that was much later. And my sister… she's perfectly healthy, lives in Tegucigalpa. She’s a lawyer. No history of anything like this on either side of the family, as far as I know. Though, truthfully, we weren't terribly close, so I wouldn't necessarily know if something was going on. It's not like we shared medical details, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to know, nonetheless. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I pride myself on being very self-sufficient, and I really try to avoid medications if I can help it. I’ll take an aspirin if I have a headache, but that’s about it. No vitamins, no herbal remedies, nothing. I really don’t believe in loading up on things you don’t need, you understand. It just seems… unnecessary. Besides, I’ve always been able to manage things on my own. It's… humbling, this whole situation, needing to come to a doctor.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Firestone. It’s always best to be cautious. Alright, then. If you don’t mind, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam to assess your leg strength and reflexes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with, then. Though I doubt poking and prodding will reveal anything useful. I've already told you everything I know. But, alright. Proceed. Just…be gentle, please. And don't take too long. I have things to schedule, you understand. Tours don't plan themselves.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Firestone. I'll be as efficient and gentle as possible. Please, have a seat here. First, I’ll just check your vital signs… Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, could you please lie down for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Honestly, I haven't been on one of these things in years. It's terribly uncomfortable. And what exactly are you looking for? I assume it's not just to confirm what I've already told you. Is this…some sort of nerve test? I read something about those once. They sounded dreadful.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort. We’re simply checking for any tenderness, swelling, or abnormalities in your muscles. We’ll assess your reflexes and strength in both legs. No, this isn’t a nerve test at this stage, though we may consider that later if needed. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, could you please try to lift each leg, one at a time, against my resistance?
PATIENT: Lift my legs? Against resistance? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a weightlifter. I run tours. It's different. There. Happy? It’s not exactly effortless, is it? And it feels even weaker now, if you must know. Honestly, it's humiliating. I used to be so strong. You’re just confirming what I already told you. It's weak. Both of them. Is that what you wanted to hear?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Firestone. You are right, it is more difficult than it should be. Strength is 4/5 bilaterally, meaning you can move against gravity with some resistance, but it’s less than normal. Any tenderness in your lower back?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, actually. Just a little. I didn't mention it before because it's not…constant. More like a dull ache. It flares up when I've been on my feet for too long, I suppose. Probably just from walking so much. Though, truthfully, I’ve been more sedentary lately, trying to rest my legs. So, it shouldn’t be worse, should it? Honestly, everything feels wrong now. It's…disconcerting. You're making me worry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. The tenderness in your lower back is noted. Now, I’d like to ask about your bladder and bowel function. Have you experienced any changes or difficulties with either recently?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Now you're asking about that? Honestly. Is this relevant? I came in about my legs, not… that. No. Everything is perfectly normal in that department. Absolutely no changes. I find the question rather…invasive, if you don't mind my saying so. I mean, what does that even have to do with my legs? Honestly. It's just…tacky.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that was uncomfortable, Ms. Firestone. It’s standard procedure to rule out certain neurological causes of weakness. Alright. Given your symptoms – fluctuating weakness in both legs, worsening with activity, tenderness in your lower back, and no changes in bowel or bladder function – I suspect we may be dealing with a musculoskeletal issue, possibly a lumbar strain or nerve compression. However, given the bilateral nature of your symptoms and their sudden onset, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work to check for inflammation and vitamin deficiencies, and an MRI of your lumbar spine to assess for nerve compression. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds…excessive. All this poking and prodding and now an MRI? I told you, it's just my legs. Probably just pulled a muscle. I’ve done that before. A little rest, some heat, and I’m good to go. But…fine. If you insist. But I expect a full explanation of why this is necessary, and I don't want to spend a fortune on unnecessary tests. I have a budget, you understand. And I’m not keen on being stuck in a machine for an hour. Honestly, it sounds dreadful. Explain it to me, Doctor. And make it quick. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. An MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, is a non-invasive imaging test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your spine. It allows us to visualize the bones, nerves, and soft tissues, and identify any potential causes of your symptoms, such as a herniated disc, nerve compression, or inflammation. It's painless, though you'll need to lie still for about 30-60 minutes. Medicare should cover a significant portion of the cost, and we'll verify your coverage beforehand. I understand your concerns, and I wouldn’t order it if I didn’t believe it was necessary to get a clear diagnosis. It’s the best way to rule out more serious causes and ensure we provide you with the most appropriate treatment. While a muscle strain is possible, the bilateral nature of your weakness warrants further investigation. Would you like me to schedule the MRI for you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Schedule it, then. But make it as soon as possible, and if it’s going to be a dreadful machine, make sure it’s a big one, so I don’t feel so claustrophobic. And check with Medicare first! I don’t want any surprises. Honestly, this is all so…inconvenient. I have a tour scheduled next week, and I can't afford to be laid up. Just…get it over with. And tell me when and where. I need to rearrange my schedule, you understand. This is…highly disruptive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. I’ve scheduled you for an MRI at Suburban Imaging Center next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. I’ve already verified your Medicare coverage, and it should be fully covered. I’ll send the order to the center and they will contact you to confirm the appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and continuing with gentle stretches if comfortable. I’ll also prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help manage any pain or discomfort. Once we have the MRI results, we’ll discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm. Tuesday at 10:00 AM… alright. That will have to do. Anti-inflammatory medication… fine. But nothing strong, understand? I don’t want to be drowsy. And I expect a clear explanation of the results. None of this medical jargon. I want to understand what’s going on, in plain English. And if it’s just a muscle strain, I expect a full refund for all this… fuss. Honestly. No, I don't think I have any other questions. Just…get the results quickly. And let’s hope it’s nothing serious. I have a life to live, you understand. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to reschedule a tour. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. I will ensure you receive clear and concise explanations of the results, and we’ll discuss all available treatment options. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to get you back to your active lifestyle as quickly as possible. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you next week. .
