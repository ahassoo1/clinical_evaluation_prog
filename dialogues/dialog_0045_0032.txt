DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I’m Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s rather… embarrassing, to be frank. A bit of a… discharge, you see. Not a pleasant thing at my age. I haven’t… well, it’s been some time since I’ve had reason to discuss such matters with a professional. Though, my wife insisted I come. She worries, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. A discharge. Well, it’s good your wife encouraged you to come in. These things do need to be looked at, regardless of… how long it’s been. Let's not be shy about it. Now, can you describe this discharge for me?
PATIENT: Goodness. Well, it’s… not a torrent, if that makes sense. More of a… a seep, really. And… it’s not entirely clear. A bit… yellowish, perhaps? Honestly, I didn’t examine it too closely. My wife pointed it out, and I… I didn’t feel the need to scrutinize it. Is that… sufficient? I haven’t noticed any… pain, thankfully. Just… the unpleasantness of it.
DOCTOR: Yellowish discharge… alright. No pain, you said. Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Goodness, that’s a difficult question. Time… slips away, you know? It must be… a week? Perhaps longer. My days tend to blend together. I’ve been rather preoccupied with the harvest, and… well, I don't recall specifically when I first noticed it. My wife would likely have a more precise answer, but she’s at home tending to the garden. A very capable woman, she is. But… a week, give or take, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A week, give or take. Right. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No, not really. I haven't felt unwell, generally. Perhaps a bit of… tiredness, but that's to be expected at my age, isn't it? And with the heat, of course. No fever, no burning… no, nothing else comes to mind. I do find myself… frequenting the lavatory more often than usual, now that you mention it. But I attributed that to the… increased fluid intake with the weather. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Increased urinary frequency... possibly. Okay. Have you experienced any difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Difficulty? No, not precisely difficulty. It's not a struggle, if that’s what you mean. It just… comes more often. And perhaps a bit weaker stream, now that I think about it. But nothing alarming. I wouldn't call it difficult, Doctor. Just… less forceful. Like a garden hose with a kink in it, perhaps. Does that make sense? I'm not one for… detailed descriptions of bodily functions, you understand.
DOCTOR: A weaker stream, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A bit… diminished. Not painful, just… less robust than it used to be. I used to be able to… well, never mind. It’s not a competition, is it? I suppose everything slows down eventually. Though it is… concerning, to be honest. I pride myself on keeping things in order, you see. A man likes to feel… capable. And this… this feels like a sign of things falling apart.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a quick look. We’ll just do a brief physical exam. Nothing to be embarrassed about. It'll help me get a better idea of what’s going on. Do you mind if I take a look?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose not. It's hardly ideal, but if it’s necessary… Very well, Doctor. But please, be quick about it. And… discreet. My wife would be most displeased to hear details. Though, I suppose she'll want to know the results, eventually. A most pragmatic woman. Do let me know if you require… any specific positioning. I’m not as nimble as I once was.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on your back, that’ll be perfect. And don’t worry, we’ll be as quick and discreet as possible. I’m just going to palpate your abdomen and then do a quick external exam. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. Just let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must confess, I’ve never been particularly fond of doctors. A necessary evil, I suppose. Do proceed when you are ready. And… perhaps a little warning before you… palpate, as you say? I’m a bit sensitive, you see. Old bones, and all that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Just going to press here and here. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. Hmm. Okay. I’m just checking for any swelling or abnormalities. I’m noticing some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, and your prostate feels slightly enlarged. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm at your age, but it could be contributing to your symptoms.
PATIENT: Ouch… yes, that’s… a bit uncomfortable. I told you, Doctor, old bones. Enlarged prostate, you say? Is that… serious? My father had prostate issues, as I recall. A rather unpleasant business. Will I need… surgery? I’ve heard dreadful stories. And my wife… she wouldn't be able to manage the farm on her own if I were… incapacitated. Is that the likely outcome? Please, Doctor, be frank with me. I prefer to know the worst, rather than be surprised.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, let's not jump to surgery just yet. An enlarged prostate is very common as men age. It doesn't automatically mean you'll need an operation. However, given your symptoms – the discharge, the increased frequency, the weaker stream – and the mild tenderness I’m feeling, we need to rule out a few things. It could be a simple case of benign prostatic hyperplasia – BPH – which we can manage with medication. But it's also important to rule out infection, or something more serious. I’m going to order a urinalysis and a prostate-specific antigen – PSA – test. The urinalysis will check for infection, and the PSA will give us a baseline reading on your prostate. We'll also do a digital rectal exam to get a more detailed assessment.
PATIENT: Urinalysis… that I understand. Though, a… digital rectal exam? Good heavens, Doctor. Must that be done? Is it absolutely necessary? My wife always said I have a… sensitive constitution. And that sounds… thoroughly unpleasant. Is there no other way? Perhaps a… scan of some kind? I've heard about those futuristic machines. Surely, they can see everything without… resorting to such invasive measures. And what of the PSA test? Will that involve… needles? I do detest needles. You see, I'm a man of the land, Doctor, not a laboratory specimen. This is all rather… distressing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I understand your reluctance, but the digital rectal exam is a crucial part of the evaluation. It allows me to physically assess the size and texture of your prostate, which is something a scan simply can’t do accurately. And yes, the PSA test does require a blood sample, so a needle will be involved. It's a standard procedure, and it doesn't take long. As for scans, they aren't always necessary and can sometimes provide inconclusive results. Look, I’m not trying to cause you discomfort. But I need to gather as much information as possible to determine the best course of action. It’s possible your symptoms are due to something relatively harmless, but we need to rule out anything serious. Let's just get the tests done first. Then, we’ll discuss the results and decide on the next steps. I will write the orders for the lab now. And a nurse will be in shortly to take the blood sample. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: I suppose not. Though, I confess, I’m not pleased with this turn of events. My wife will be most… insistent on knowing the details. And she has a rather… direct way of questioning. Needles, exams… it’s all rather… undignified. Very well, Doctor. Proceed with your… tests. But please, be as gentle as possible. And tell the nurse I have… a slight aversion to sharp objects. I’ve spent my life working with tools, you see, and I prefer to be the one wielding them, not the subject of them. Is there anything I should… prepare for? Any specific instructions? And will the results be available quickly? My wife expects… prompt answers. Perhaps you could expedite the process?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. The nurse will be in shortly. Just try to relax, and it will be over before you know it. As for preparation, just drink a normal amount of fluids beforehand. Nothing special. The results typically take a few days to come back, but I'll see if I can expedite the process for you. I understand your wife expects answers, and I'll do my best to provide them as quickly as possible. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… try to be quick, Doctor. And… discreet. I pride myself on my privacy, you see. Very well. I’ll… await the nurse. And try to… steel myself for the inevitable. Thank you, Doctor. I believe I'll just… lie here until she arrives. .
