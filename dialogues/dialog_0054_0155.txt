DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this shaking. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. Been happening for… a while now. Honestly, hard to say how long. Seems worse lately, though. I just want to get it checked out, if you don't mind. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik, I understand. Shaking, primarily in your hands, and it seems to be getting worse recently. That’s a good reason to get it checked out, and you’re right to come in. It’s good you’re taking care of this. When you say “a while now,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe… six months? Could be longer. Time just… slips away, you know? It started small, barely noticeable. I thought it was just… old age creeping in. But it’s gotten harder to hold things, like a cup of coffee. That’s when I figured I should probably see someone.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Six months, or possibly longer, and it's gradually worsened to the point where it's affecting your ability to hold things. That’s definitely worth investigating. Can you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like a big tremble, not all the time. More like… a little flutter, a vibration. It happens when I’m trying to do something, like writing or… buttoning my shirt. When I’m just resting, it’s usually okay. Sometimes it’s worse if I’m stressed, I think. Though, honestly, everything stresses me out these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more of a flutter or vibration, happening primarily with action, and potentially worsened by stress. That’s helpful. Does it happen on both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I think. It's… hard to tell sometimes. Maybe the left one is a little worse, but it’s not a big difference. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I keep forgetting things. I apologize if I’m not very helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Jezik. It's very common to have some memory changes as we get older, and it doesn’t make you any less helpful at all. We can take our time. Both hands are affected, with perhaps a slight difference in severity. Now, aside from the shaking and the memory concerns, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Well, I’ve been a little… tired lately. More tired than usual. And my legs feel a little… stiff sometimes, especially in the morning. But, honestly, that could just be the weather. It’s been awfully humid. I don't know. It's hard to say what's new and what's just… getting old. I really don't want to bother you with things that don’t matter.
DOCTOR: No, please don’t worry about bothering me. It’s important to get a complete picture. So, you’ve noticed increased fatigue and some stiffness in your legs, particularly in the mornings. Okay. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I still eat, maybe not as much as I used to, but that's probably just because I don't get out and do much anymore. Weight… I haven't weighed myself in ages, Doctor. I don’t really pay attention to that sort of thing. I used to be pretty active, working at the water treatment plant, but that was a long time ago. Everything just feels… slower now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant changes in appetite, and you haven’t noticed any weight loss. You used to be quite active, but your activity level has decreased. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something about that years ago, but I don’t remember taking any pills for it. Maybe just watching my salt intake. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Heart problems… not that I know of. I had a bad flu a few years back, but that’s about it. I mostly stayed healthy, really. Worked hard, didn't drink much, didn’t smoke. I always thought I’d be alright. I apologize if I’m being vague, Doctor. It’s just… a lot to remember. .
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Jezik. You're not being vague at all. It sounds like you were generally healthy, with a possible mention of high blood pressure in the past. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
