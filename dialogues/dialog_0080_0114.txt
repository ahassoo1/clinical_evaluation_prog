DOCTOR: Hi Maribeth, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Rosanova, it’s nice to meet you too. I’m here because… it’s my breathing. When I lie down flat, it feels like I can’t get enough air. It’s been happening for… oh, I’d say about a month now. Maybe a little longer. It’s quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Breathing trouble when lying down, started about a month ago. That is bothersome. Can you describe the feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s not exactly… pain, Doctor. More like a tightness in my chest, and… a need to sit up. Like I have to get upright to breathe easier. It doesn’t happen when I’m sitting or standing, only when I’m lying completely flat. And it wakes me up sometimes, at night. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I see. So it's a tightness, a need to sit up for relief, and it's waking you up at night. That gives me a better picture. Does anything else happen when this occurs?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my ankles do swell up a bit in the evenings. Not terribly, mind you. Just… puffier than usual. And I feel a little more tired during the day than I used to. I just thought it was my age, to be honest. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, ankle swelling in the evenings and increased fatigue. That is relevant, thank you for telling me. Let's get a bit more detail. About the fatigue – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Some days I feel quite alright, and others… well, others I just have no energy at all. Even simple things, like walking to the kitchen, feel like a great effort. It’s not every day, mind you. But it’s happening more frequently than it used to. I used to be so active! I miss gardening.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent fatigue, worse on some days, impacting your activity level. And you miss gardening, I understand – that’s frustrating. Now, before we move on, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. Doctor told me about that, oh, fifteen years ago maybe? I took pills for a while, but… I stopped taking them a few years back. I felt alright. Maybe that wasn’t the smartest thing. And… no diabetes, I don’t think. I had my gallbladder removed, a long time ago. That’s all I can recall right now. Does that help, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. High blood pressure in the past, off medication, and a gallbladder removal. I’m going to ask some questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had heart problems, lung disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Family history… Let me see. My mother had high blood pressure, just like me. She passed away when she was quite old, from… well, just general weakness, I suppose. My father, he was very healthy, never a sick day in his life. My brother… he had some trouble with his heart, a few years back, but he recovered. I think. It was a long time ago. And that’s all I can remember, really. It’s difficult to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, heart trouble in your brother. Thank you. Now, just a couple more questions before we do a quick examination. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’m not taking anything at all. Not even aspirin. I try to avoid pills as much as possible, if you don't mind. I prefer a cup of chamomile tea when I’m feeling unwell, but that’s it. I haven’t taken any supplements in years, either. Just chamomile tea. Is that alright? I hope you don’t mind me asking, but are you sure you need to know all of this? I'd like to get this over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: No, chamomile tea is perfectly fine, Maribeth. And yes, it's important for me to have a complete picture. Okay, just one last thing – any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had one in my life, thankfully. Not to food, not to medicine, nothing at all. Honestly, I’m a pretty healthy person, all things considered. I just… can’t seem to breathe when I lie down. Is that all you need to know? I would really appreciate it if we could proceed with the examination now. I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, and you’re generally healthy aside from the breathing trouble. Excellent. Alright, let's do a quick examination. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be fine, Doctor. Just please be quick, if you don’t mind. I'm not fond of doctors, to be honest, and the sooner this is over, the better. Thank you.
DOCTOR: I’m hearing a slightly rapid heart rate, and a very faint murmur. It’s subtle, but worth noting. Your lungs sound a little congested, with some crackling sounds, especially at the base of both lungs. And yes, I can feel some swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. It's mild to moderate, but present. Your blood pressure is 160/90, which is elevated. Okay, Maribeth, based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing, it sounds like you could be experiencing heart failure. The shortness of breath when lying down, the ankle swelling, the fatigue, and the congested lungs are all consistent with that. The elevated blood pressure is a contributing factor. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this. Would you be willing to undergo a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram ?
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds… rather serious. I just want to be able to breathe, Doctor. I never asked for all this. A chest… what was it? X-ray? And an… electro-thing? I don’t know… I’m not sure I want to have all sorts of tests done. Are you sure it’s necessary? I’m an old woman, Doctor. Is it going to be painful? And what will it cost? I’m on a fixed income, you know. Honestly, I’m feeling quite overwhelmed. Perhaps I should just try to rest more and see if it improves on its own? I really don't want to go through a lot of trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Maribeth. It is overwhelming, and you’re right to ask these questions. Heart failure sounds scary, but it doesn't necessarily mean your heart is stopping. It means your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should be, and we need to find out why and how best to manage it. The chest X-ray is just a picture of your lungs, it’s painless and takes just a few minutes. The ECG is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart – it also doesn’t hurt, just some sticky patches on your chest. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover most of it, and we can check your coverage beforehand to give you an estimate. The main goal right now is to understand what’s going on so we can get you feeling better. Resting more is a good idea, but it won't address the underlying cause. Ignoring it could lead to further complications. We need to rule things in and out. Would you be willing to let me order these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medicare… well, that’s a bit of a relief, I suppose. And you say they don’t hurt? Alright. Very well, Doctor. If it won’t hurt, and Medicare will cover it… then I suppose I can have those tests done. But please, make it as quick as possible. And tell me the results as soon as you can. I don’t want to be waiting for weeks. Is there anything else you need from me right now? I really do have that appointment later, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Maribeth, thank you. I'll get the orders sent to the radiology department right away, and they'll schedule you for the X-ray and ECG. They’ll contact you directly to set up an appointment – usually within a day or two. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. For now, I’m going to prescribe a low-sodium diet and recommend you limit your fluid intake to about two liters a day. This will help reduce the workload on your heart. I’ll also give you a prescription for a mild diuretic – a water pill – to help remove some of the extra fluid. Is there anything else you’re experiencing besides the breathing trouble and fatigue?
PATIENT: A water pill? Oh dear. I don't want to be running to the bathroom all day. And a low-sodium diet… I do like my food, Doctor. But alright, if you think it’s necessary. Just please, make sure it’s a small dose of that pill. No, I don’t think so. Just… a little dizzy sometimes, when I stand up too quickly. And my legs ache a bit, especially at night. But that’s probably just old age, you know. I don’t think that’s important. Is there anything else you need from me? I really do need to go now. I'm starting to feel quite anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright, the diuretic is a low dose, and we can adjust it if needed. The dizziness and leg aches are good to know - they could be related. It’s good that you mentioned them. I will document those. Okay, I think we’ve covered everything for now. I’ll have the nurse give you some instructions on the diet and medication, and a number to call if you have any questions. We'll get those tests scheduled, review the results, and figure out the best plan for you. I understand you’re feeling anxious, and I appreciate you coming in today. I'll make a note to keep things moving as quickly as possible. If you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or significant swelling, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Oh dear. No, I don't want to go to the emergency room. No, Doctor, I don’t think I have any questions. I just want to get this over with. Thank you for your time, and please, make sure those tests are scheduled quickly. And that pill is a small dose, alright? I really do need to go now. .
