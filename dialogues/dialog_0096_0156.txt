DOCTOR: Alright, Jase. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's... my stomach. It's been really bothering me. Like, a lot of diarrhea. It’s been going on for a while now, and it's just… persistent, you know? I don't really remember exactly when it started, to be honest. It just kind of… always feels like it’s there, on and off.
DOCTOR: Persistent, you say. Well, "a while now" isn't terribly helpful, dear. Try to think. Was it before or after the holidays?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. The holidays… hmm. I… think it was before. Maybe around spring? Or was it summer? I honestly get mixed up easily. My husband usually reminds me of dates, but he’s at work right now. It’s definitely been a few months, though. It’s not like, a new thing. It just… won't go away.
DOCTOR: A few months, alright. And is it… consistently diarrhea, or are there periods where things are… normal?
PATIENT: It’s mostly diarrhea, to be honest. There are some days where it’s… not as bad. Like, I don’t have to run to the bathroom immediately after eating, but it's never really… solid. It's always kind of loose, even on the good days. It's just… varying degrees of bad, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Varying degrees, yes. And have you noticed anything specific that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Um… I think dairy sometimes makes it worse? But I like yogurt, and that usually doesn’t bother me. And… maybe really spicy food? But I can’t really pinpoint anything for sure. It feels kind of random, actually. Like, I could eat the same thing two days in a row, and one day it's fine, and the next day I’m… well, you know. It’s really frustrating.
DOCTOR: So, inconsistent triggers, prolonged duration… Have you lost any weight recently, dear?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question… I don’t know, actually. My husband says I seem a little thinner, but I haven’t really been weighing myself. I’ve been so busy with work, I just haven’t gotten around to it. I feel okay, mostly. Just tired, from… everything, I guess. Not really losing appetite, though. I still eat pretty normally.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the diarrhea and the tiredness, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my stomach feels… bloated, really full, even when I haven’t eaten much. And… I get cramps sometimes, not all the time, but they’re pretty bad when they happen. And… occasionally, I feel a little nauseous, but I haven't actually thrown up. Does that… make sense? I’m not sure if those things are related, though. It all just feels kind of mixed up.
DOCTOR: Bloating, cramps, occasional nausea… Alright. Now, have you travelled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a quick trip to see my sister in Birmingham a couple months ago, but that was just for the weekend. It was before all this really got bad, I think. We just mostly stayed inside because of the weather. Nothing fancy, just a normal visit. I haven't been anywhere else.
DOCTOR: And what about your diet generally?
PATIENT: Um… pretty normal, I guess. We try to eat healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables, some meat, rice, things like that. My husband does most of the cooking, actually. I eat what he makes. I don’t have any allergies that I know of, and I don't really avoid any specific foods unless it's something I know makes me feel sick, like, really sick. But this… this isn't like that. It’s just… constant. It's just annoying.
DOCTOR: "Normal" is rather vague, dear. Are you consuming a lot of processed foods?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not a lot, I don’t think. We try not to. My husband buys some frozen meals for when we’re really busy with work, but we mostly cook from scratch. We have takeout sometimes, maybe once a week? But it’s usually something relatively healthy, like Indian food or stir-fry. Not like, fast food all the time. I’m not really sure what you mean by ‘processed’ exactly?
DOCTOR: Alright, Jase. I’m going to need to examine you. We’ll start with your abdomen. Lie down on the examination table, please. And try to relax. It will be quicker if you do.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. That sounds… okay. Relaxing is… sometimes hard. But I'll try. Where is the table?
DOCTOR: Right over there. Just lie flat on your back with your arms at your sides. I'll listen to your abdomen first, then gently press around to see if anything feels tender. It shouldn’t be too uncomfortable, but let me know immediately if it is.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m lying down. I'll try to be still. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. And yeah, I'll definitely tell you if it hurts.
DOCTOR: Normal bowel sounds… somewhat hyperactive, actually. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yeah, that one. A little bit. Not super painful, but… yeah, that feels a bit tender. Like a dull ache, maybe? It's not constant, but… yeah, that feels different.
DOCTOR: And here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah! That's… that's definitely tender. It’s a bit more uncomfortable now. It’s like… a cramping feeling, almost. It’s not… sharp pain, but it's definitely not comfortable. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the lower left quadrant, with cramping. Alright, just relax. I’m going to press here, and then quickly release. Let me know if that hurts more when I take my hand away.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m trying to relax. Ooh! Yeah, that… that hurt a little when you took your hand away. Not terrible, but definitely a sharp pain for a second. It’s gone now, but… yeah, it was there. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Rebound tenderness… not a good sign. Alright, Jase. I’m going to order some blood work and a stool sample. We need to rule out an infection. It could be something as simple as food poisoning, but with the tenderness and the prolonged duration, we need to be thorough. I also want to schedule a colonoscopy. I know it’s not pleasant, but we need to see what’s going on in your colon. It’s the most accurate way to diagnose the problem.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Um… what does that involve? And… blood work I understand, but… what if it’s something serious? I… I don't really like hospitals. And I’ve been so busy with work… is it going to take a long time? I really don't want to miss any shifts.
DOCTOR: Look, dear. Worrying won't change anything. A colonoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your colon to examine the lining. It’s done under sedation, so you won't feel anything. As for it being serious, it could be something minor, or it could be something more significant. That's why we need to investigate. And frankly, your work is not my primary concern right now. Your health is. We'll schedule the colonoscopy as soon as possible. I’ll have the nurse explain the preparation process – it's not pleasant, I won't lie, but it’s necessary. The blood work will help us rule out any immediate infections. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. I've never had any allergies that I know of. My husband says I'm pretty resilient. But… I get really anxious about medical procedures. Like, really anxious. Is there anything… anything I can take to calm me down? I get really shaky and… I just… I don’t cope well.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can prescribe a mild sedative for the colonoscopy. It won’t eliminate your anxiety completely, but it should take the edge off. I’ll write a prescription for lorazepam. Take it as directed. And honestly, dear, sometimes a little anxiety is normal. It means you're taking this seriously. Now, about the blood work and stool sample… the nurse will give you instructions on how to collect the sample. It's relatively straightforward. We need to get this done as soon as possible, so let's not delay. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… lorazepam. Yes, that sounds… good. And blood work and the stool sample. I understand. I’ll… I’ll ask the nurse for the instructions. I just… I really hope it’s nothing serious. And… thank you. For… trying to explain everything. I think… I think that’s all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the details with you. Don't hesitate to ask her any questions you have. And try to stay calm. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and we’ll schedule the colonoscopy. .
PATIENT: Okay… thank you, Doctor. .
