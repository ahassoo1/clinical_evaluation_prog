DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 46 years of age. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 46… feels like a long time ago sometimes. It is… the words. I have trouble… finding them. It is very frustrating. It started, I think, a few months back. Not all the time, but… enough to make me worry.
DOCTOR: I see. Trouble finding the right words, you say. And this has been occurring for several months now. Could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Yes, several months. It is… difficult to explain. It’s not that I don't know what I want to say, you understand? The thought is there… but the word… it escapes me. Like it is on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot… grasp it. Sometimes it is names, sometimes everyday things. It is most bothersome when I am talking to… friends. Or trying to remember things.
DOCTOR: Very well. So, the thought process itself remains intact, but the expression of those thoughts—the retrieval of specific words—is proving difficult. And this seems to affect both names and common nouns. Do you find this happens more frequently in certain situations?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Yes, I believe it is worse when I am… tired. Or if there is a lot of noise. A busy room, for example. It makes it… harder to focus, and then the words… they become even more elusive. I do not think it is worse at any particular time of day, though. Just… when my mind feels… cluttered.
DOCTOR: Cluttered, alright. So, fatigue and environmental distractions seem to exacerbate the issue. Now, let’s delve a little deeper. Have you noticed any other changes in your cognitive function?
PATIENT: Cognitive… function? That is a… a big word, Doctor. I do not know… Let me think. I… I used to be very good at remembering dates. Family birthdays, anniversaries… Now, I have to write them down. Before, I could just… recall them. Is that what you mean? Remembering things… like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, precisely, Mr. Gyamfi. Memory recall is certainly a part of cognitive function. You’ve noted a decline in your ability to remember dates without assistance. Have you experienced any difficulties with other types of memory – perhaps recent events, or following conversations?
PATIENT: Following conversations… hmm. Sometimes. If someone speaks very quickly, or if there are many interruptions, I find myself… losing track. I have to ask them to repeat themselves. But it is not… every time. Recent events… I think my memory for distant events is still quite good. But… yes. Remembering what I had for lunch yesterday… or what I did last week… that is sometimes… difficult. It is not all the time, Doctor, but it worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gyamfi. These are all important details. Now, let's move on to some other areas. Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision…? No, Doctor. I do not think so. I wear glasses, of course. Have for many years. But my prescription has not changed recently. I had my eyes checked… maybe a year ago? No problems reported then. Everything looks… normal. Clear enough. I do not see any… spots, or blurry areas, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Good. No recent changes in vision reported. And have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, or balance issues?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No headaches. Not for a very long time. And no dizziness, or… balance problems. I walk normally. I do not feel unsteady on my feet. I have not fallen, or… come close to falling. I had a slight… a very slight feeling of being off-balance once, a few weeks ago. But it only lasted a moment. It wasn’t… concerning. Just… a little wobble. But that was the only time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently experiencing any difficulties with your hearing?
PATIENT: Hearing… no, I do not believe so. My wife… she used to say I didn't listen to her very well, but… she said many things. But truly, my hearing seems… normal. I can hear you quite clearly, Doctor. And I hear the television and the radio without any trouble. I do not need to… ask people to speak louder, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s briefly discuss your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? I had… a bad knee, many years ago. Needed surgery. But that has healed well. My doctor… before… he said my blood pressure was a little high once. But it was controlled with… pills. I do not take any pills now. I do not have… diabetes, I do not think. And my heart… I’ve never had any problems with my heart. But my wife… she kept all the medical records. I do not… remember everything. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. A history of knee surgery and previously controlled hypertension. We can review your EHR to confirm, if you’d like. Now, have you ever had any neurological conditions, such as stroke or seizures?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No stroke. No… seizures. I’ve never had anything like that. I did… bump my head once, when I was a child. Fell from a tree. But that was a very long time ago. No lasting problems. I’ve always been… healthy, as far as I know. Is this… is this serious, Doctor? All these questions… they make me… anxious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gyamfi, I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, we are simply gathering information. It is important to rule out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. We will get to the bottom of this. Now, regarding your family history - are there any instances of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or other neurological conditions within your family?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother… she was a bit forgetful in her old age, but it was just… old age, I think. She didn't… wander or anything like that. Just… misplacing things, forgetting names. My father… he was quite sharp, right up until the end. I don't… I don't recall anyone with… with dementia, or Alzheimer's. It wasn't… something we talked about much. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. My memory… is not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. A history of some forgetfulness in your mother, but no known instances of dementia or Alzheimer's disease within the family. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked. Never have. And I… I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. But that was a long time ago. Not anymore. And no… no recreational drugs. I am a… a retired professional, Doctor. I do not… engage in such activities. I do enjoy my garden, and… and reading. And visiting my grandchildren. That is what I do.
DOCTOR: Alright. A retired professional with no history of smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, Doctor. I do not take any regular medications. I take… something for my knee sometimes, when it acts up. But that is just ibuprofen. Over-the-counter. And… and a multivitamin, every now and then. But that is it. Nothing… prescribed by a doctor. I am very careful about what I put into my body, Doctor. Especially now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen as needed for knee pain and occasional multivitamin use. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. As far as I know. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I am sometimes… sensitive to the cold, but that is not an allergy. Just… I get chilled easily. And my wife… she was allergic to pollen. But that is not me. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. It is just… my memory is not what it used to be. I am afraid I am not much assistance.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gyamfi, you are being very helpful. Every piece of information is valuable. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I’d like to check your vital signs, neurological function, and perform a cognitive assessment. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. If you think it is necessary. I… I do not like doctors very much. But… if you think it will help find out what is wrong… then yes. Please. Just… be gentle. I am a bit… frail. And please… explain everything you are doing. I do not want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gyamfi. I will explain each step as I go, and we’ll take things at your pace. First, I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and temperature. Blood pressure is 138 over 76. Pulse is 72 and regular. Respiration is 16 and unlabored. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. All within normal limits. Now, I’d like to examine your ears, eyes, and throat. Do you have your glasses with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here they are. I need them to see anything clearly. Is something wrong, Doctor? You look… serious.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. The retinas appear normal, with no signs of macular degeneration or other abnormalities. Ears are clear, with no signs of infection or fluid buildup. Throat is clear as well. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Motor strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Now, I’m going to perform a brief cognitive assessment. It involves a few simple questions and tasks. It's nothing to be worried about, just to get a better understanding of your memory and thinking skills. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I suppose so. But please, be patient with me. My mind is not what it used to be. What kind of questions? Will it be… difficult? I do not want to look… foolish. Please… just go slow.
DOCTOR: It will be quite simple, Mr. Gyamfi, and there's no need to worry about looking foolish. We are simply gathering information. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Oh dear. I… I believe it is August. Yes, August. But the day…? I… I cannot quite recall. Is it the 1st? No… it feels later than that. I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. My mind is a complete blank.
DOCTOR: Alright. No immediate recall of today's date. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: The year…? Oh dear. Is it… 2020? No… that can’t be right. It feels… later. I think it’s… 2024? Or is it 2025? I am so sorry, Doctor. It’s all… a blur. I used to be very good with dates.
DOCTOR: Alright. Difficulty recalling the current year. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” for me. Can you do that?
PATIENT: Spell… “world”? Oh dear. W… uh… is it with a “W”? And then… O… R… L… No… I’m not sure. Is that right? It feels… wrong. I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. My mind is simply not cooperating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Difficulty with spelling. Now, I'm going to ask you a simple question about your memory. I'm going to name three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will try. But please, be patient with me. I… I may not remember them. Go ahead. I will do my best.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Now, can you repeat those three words back to me, please?
PATIENT: Apple… table… uh… Oh dear. I… I can remember apple. And table, yes. But the third one…? It’s on the tip of my tongue… a small, shiny thing…? Oh, I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. I can’t recall the third word. It’s… gone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Difficulty with short-term recall. Now, I’m going to ask you a series of simple arithmetic questions. First, what is 5 plus 7?
PATIENT: Five plus seven…? Oh dear. Let me see… five… and then seven… hmm… is it… eleven? No… that doesn’t seem right. Is it twelve? Oh, I am so sorry, Doctor. My mind is simply not working. I used to be very good at numbers.
DOCTOR: Alright. Difficulty with simple arithmetic. Based on these brief assessments, Mr. Gyamfi, it appears you are experiencing some cognitive difficulties. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your daily activities. Are you experiencing any difficulties with tasks such as managing your finances, taking medications, or preparing meals?
PATIENT: Managing finances…? Oh, well, I used to do that myself, but… now my daughter helps me with that. She is very good with numbers. And… medications? I don't take many, but she helps me with those too, just to be sure. Preparing meals…? I can make a simple sandwich, but… I don’t cook much anymore. It's just easier to… have something pre-made. I… I rely on my daughter for a lot of things now. It’s… a little embarrassing to admit.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Gyamfi. It's not embarrassing at all. Many people require assistance with daily tasks as they get older. Based on your reported symptoms and the results of these brief assessments, I suspect you may be experiencing some early signs of cognitive impairment. However, it’s crucial to rule out any other potential underlying causes. I would like to order a comprehensive neurological evaluation, including an MRI of the brain and a series of blood tests to assess your overall health. I will also refer you to a neuropsychologist for more detailed cognitive testing. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood tests? A neuropsychologist…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious, Doctor. What does that mean? Is it… is it something bad? Will it hurt? I… I don’t like hospitals very much. What are we looking for, Doctor? Please, tell me straight. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gyamfi, I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we are simply taking these steps to get a clearer understanding of what is going on. An MRI of the brain will allow us to visualize your brain structure and identify any potential abnormalities. The blood tests will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms. A neuropsychologist will conduct a series of cognitive tests to assess your memory, thinking skills, and language abilities in more detail. This will help us determine the extent of your cognitive impairment and develop an appropriate treatment plan. We are looking for signs of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, or other neurological disorders. However, it’s important to remember that these are just possibilities, and we need to gather more information before we can reach a definitive diagnosis. The MRI is a painless procedure, although you will need to lie still for a period of time. The blood tests are also relatively simple and involve taking a small sample of your blood. I will explain each step in detail before we proceed, and I will be here to answer any questions you may have. I want to assure you that you are not alone in this, and we will work together to get to the bottom of this. Would you like me to schedule these tests for you?
PATIENT: Yes… I suppose so, Doctor. If it will help find out what is wrong. But please… explain everything very carefully. And… could my daughter come with me? I… I don't think I could do this alone. And… what if it is something bad? What happens then?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gyamfi. I completely understand. We will explain every step in detail, and your daughter is more than welcome to accompany you to all appointments. It’s always helpful to have a support person with you. As for what happens if it is something serious, we will discuss all available treatment options with you and your daughter. These may include medications to help manage your symptoms, lifestyle changes to support your cognitive health, and support groups to provide emotional support. We will also connect you with resources to help you and your family navigate the challenges of a cognitive impairment diagnosis. There are many support services available, and we will work with you to find the ones that are right for you. Let’s start by scheduling the MRI and blood tests. I'll have my assistant contact you to arrange the appointments. We can schedule the neuropsychological evaluation shortly thereafter. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, such as confusion, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think I need some time to process everything. Just… please make sure my daughter is informed about everything. And… thank you, Doctor. For being… patient with me. I appreciate it. I really do. .
