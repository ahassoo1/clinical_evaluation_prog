DOCTOR: Alright, Jailenne, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Osterholm, nice to meet you too! Well, I’ve just been getting the chills lately. It’s kinda weird, not like a full-on fever or anything, just… cold. It’s been happening for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Chills, you say. Just chills… not much else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I felt a little tired yesterday, but I thought that was just from work. And maybe a tiny bit of a headache, but nothing I’d usually bother anyone about, you know? It's mostly just… being cold when I shouldn’t be.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Tiny bit of a headache,” alright. And work… what do you do, Jailenne?
PATIENT: I’m a Health Education Specialist. Basically, I help people understand health stuff and make good choices. It's a lot of talking and making presentations, sometimes going to schools or community centers. It can be busy, but I usually like it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, it does. A lot of talking… alright. And when did you first start noticing these chills?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was probably… Tuesday, I think? So, like, three days ago. I just felt cold in the evening, and I thought maybe the AC was too high, but it’s been happening since then, even when it’s warm. It’s just… off.
DOCTOR: Alright, three days. And have you taken your temperature at all?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I didn’t think it was a fever thing, honestly. I usually only bother with that if I feel really awful. I just figured I was a bit run down. Should I have?
DOCTOR: Well, it wouldn’t hurt. But we can check it here. Let me just… We’ll take a quick look. And while we’re at it, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. That sounds good. Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No cough, no sore throat, no stuffy nose… nothing like that. Just the chills and a little tired, like I said. And the tiny headache, but it’s gone now, actually. It’s just… weird. I don’t usually get sick.
DOCTOR: Right. You don't usually get sick. Good to know. And no aches or pains anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no aches or pains. Honestly, it’s so subtle, it’s almost like I’m imagining it sometimes. But then I’ll just feel really, really cold, and it’s kinda unsettling. I just wanted to get it checked out, you know? Just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, your temperature is 98.6. Normal. Still… the chills are concerning. Have you been around anyone who’s been sick lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. My niece had a little cold last week, but I didn’t get close to her, she was staying with her dad. And work… no one’s been out sick recently, as far as I know. We’re pretty good about washing hands and stuff. Oh! Actually, there was a new volunteer at the community center on Monday. I don't know if she was sick, but she was coughing a bit.
DOCTOR: A volunteer coughing… alright. And how long were you in contact with her?
PATIENT: Not long, maybe 20 minutes? Just showing her around the center and explaining where everything is. It wasn’t a close conversation, we were a few feet apart, you know? I didn’t even think anything of it at the time. It was just a quick introduction.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even brief exposure can be enough sometimes. Let’s just do a quick listen to your lungs, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. Is it gonna be cold? I'm already chilly!
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t be cold. Just a quick listen. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale. Okay, again… deep breath… and exhale. Lungs sound… clear. Nothing obvious there. But these vague symptoms are… frustrating. Are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. I try to stay healthy, so I haven’t needed anything. Just vitamins sometimes, but I haven’t even been taking those regularly. I really don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Is it possible it's just… stress? Work has been a little hectic lately.
DOCTOR: Stress… it could be. But it’s always best to rule out other things first. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been eating pretty normally, I think. Maybe a little less hungry yesterday, but that could just be because I felt a bit tired. And my weight… I haven’t weighed myself recently, but my clothes haven’t felt any tighter or looser. I did notice I was a little more thirsty than usual, maybe? But again, it could just be the weather. It's been pretty warm.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst… alright. And any recent travel?
PATIENT: No, no travel at all. I haven’t been anywhere for months, honestly. Just back and forth to work and the grocery store. I wish I was going somewhere exciting! But no, no travel. Is this sounding like something serious? I'm getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Look, Jailenne, you're a Health Education Specialist, you should know that vague symptoms are the hardest to diagnose. We've ruled out a lot, and frankly, it could very well be a mild virus or stress. But to be absolutely certain, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Just to rule out anything unusual. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that sounds… sensible. I mean, if it will rule things out, then yeah, definitely. I guess I just… I'm not used to being the patient, you know? I'm usually the one explaining things to people. So, blood tests? What does that involve? And will it take long to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, blood tests. Just a standard draw, a few vials. It'll take a few days for the lab to process everything. We'll schedule you for that right now, then we'll follow up once we have the results. In the meantime, stay hydrated and try to get some rest. If your symptoms worsen – fever, severe headache, shortness of breath – go to the emergency room immediately, do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, I understand. Stay hydrated, get rest, and emergency room if anything gets worse. Got it. A few days… alright. And will someone call me with the results, or should I call the office? And is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime?
DOCTOR: The lab will call you directly with the results. We usually don’t bother you with normal results, but they’ll contact you if anything concerning pops up. And no, there’s nothing else you need to do at this point, just monitor your symptoms. Honestly, Jailenne, I suspect it’s nothing serious. But it’s always better to be cautious. Here’s the requisition slip. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. Let me know if you have any trouble finding it. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Osterholm. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, even if it's probably just a silly little bug. I'll go get the blood tests done now. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You too. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes. Now, next patient… .
