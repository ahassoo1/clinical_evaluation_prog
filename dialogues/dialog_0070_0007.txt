DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. I am here because I am having… painfulness. It is in my back. I would like to be quick, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. We’ll do our best to be efficient. “Painfulness” is a bit broad – could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Broad? Yes, I suppose it is. It is… a sharp ache. Mostly low, in my back. Feels like when you have worked too hard, but… I have not worked that hard lately. It stays mostly in one spot, but sometimes it moves a little to the side. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A sharp ache localized to your lower back, that sometimes radiates slightly to the side... and it's not related to strenuous activity. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: It started… let me think. July 18th, I believe. Yes, July 18th. I remember because my grandson, little Timmy, had a birthday on the 20th, and I could barely lift him to give him a hug. It was not a good feeling.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it began around July 18th, and you noticed it specifically when trying to lift your grandson. Has the pain been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly goes, then comes back when I try to do something. Like… bending over to tie my shoes. Or standing for a long time. Sitting is alright for a bit, but then it gets worse. It is not… always there, but it is often there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's intermittent, worsened by bending and prolonged standing, and sitting can aggravate it after a while. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you can imagine, what would you rate the pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Hmm. Zero to ten… At its worst? I would say… a seven. Maybe an eight on a very bad day. It makes it hard to think, that is how bad it gets. It hasn’t been that bad lately, thankfully, but it has been close.
DOCTOR: Alright, a seven or eight at its worst, and currently it's less severe. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. My feet feel alright. And my legs… they feel strong enough. I walk normally, I think. I have not fallen or anything. I do have a little trouble getting up from a chair sometimes, but that is just… getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. And that trouble getting up, is it due to the pain in your back, or something else?
PATIENT: It is… hard to say. I think the pain makes it harder. I have to sort of… pull myself up. Before, I could just… stand up. Now, it needs more effort. It is in my lower back when I do it, though, so I think it is connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the difficulty standing is related to the pain in your lower back. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you had any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever. No chills. And no… weight loss. I have maybe gained a little, if anything. My daughter keeps telling me I need to eat less, but… I like my food. No, no weight loss, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or weight loss. Have you had any problems with your bladder or bowels – any changes in your urination or bowel movements?
PATIENT: No. Everything is… normal there. No trouble with either one. I apologize if that is… too much information, Doctor. It is just… you asked. I try to be… thorough.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Reihner. It's important to be thorough. Thank you for sharing. Now, regarding your medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis, osteoporosis, or any other bone or joint conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My doctor before… he never said anything about arthritis or… osteoporosis. He retired a few years back, and I have not seen a doctor much since then. Just for checkups, nothing serious. I do have… a touch of the high blood pressure, but I take my medicine for it. Otherwise, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure managed with medication, but no other diagnosed bone or joint conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder removed, a long time ago. Maybe twenty years back? And I was in the hospital when I broke my arm when I was a little girl. But that was… a very long time ago. Nothing else. No surgeries, no hospital stays recently.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal many years ago and a childhood broken arm. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of. I eat everything. My daughter worries about that too, but I have never had a reaction to anything. No trouble with any medicines either. That is good, I think. Fewer worries.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure. It is… Lisinopril, I believe. A small white pill. I take it every morning. That is all. I do not take any other pills, no creams, no… anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure is the only medication you're taking. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to assess your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. I would like to be finished, if possible. I have things to do. But… yes, please. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Could you point to the exact spot where you feel the most pain?
PATIENT: Right here. It is… deep down. Sometimes it feels like it goes into my back. And when I bend over… it gets worse. It is right about here.
DOCTOR: Okay, and how about this?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes, that is it. That is where it hurts. Not so hard, Doctor, please. It is… sensitive. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. I'm being gentle. Now, could you try to bend forward slowly, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Ouch! No, that is far enough. It hurts. Really hurts when I do that. I cannot go much further. It feels like something is… stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Thank you. And now, can you try to stand on your tiptoes?
PATIENT: It is… hard. I can do it, but it is not easy. It feels… unstable. Like I might fall. And it hurts in my back a little when I do that too. Not as bad as bending, but… yes, it hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Now, can you walk on your heels for a few steps?
PATIENT: Oh, this is… difficult. I might fall. I do not like this. It is… very hard. I do not think I can do very many steps. It hurts too. A lot. Can I stop now?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Please stop. That’s enough. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it seems like you have a muscle strain in your lower back, possibly with some facet joint irritation. The pain worsening with bending and walking on your heels supports that. However, to rule out other possible causes, like a disc issue or arthritis, I'd like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Yes, if you think it is necessary. I just want to be finished. I do not want anything… serious. But if you need it, yes. Fine. Medicare will cover it, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover it, provided we document the medical necessity. We'll get the order sent to the imaging center right away. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, following the dosage instructions on the label. Applying a warm compress to your back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, can also provide some relief. Try to avoid strenuous activity and lifting heavy objects. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. Just… how long will it take to get the X-ray done? And when will I know the results? I just want to get this sorted out. And… thank you, Doctor. For your help. I suppose. I just want to feel better. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. I understand your desire to feel better. The imaging center will likely be able to schedule you within the next few days. They typically send the results to my office within 24-48 hours. I'll review them as soon as they arrive and contact you to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, please follow the recommendations I gave you regarding pain relief and activity modification. If your pain worsens significantly, or if you experience any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet, please contact the office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Here is a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with the pain, and also a work note excusing you from strenuous activity for one week. Do you have any other questions at this time?
