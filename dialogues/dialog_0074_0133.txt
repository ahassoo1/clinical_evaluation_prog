DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I just need some papers signed, really. Some health forms… for a thing. I don’t really understand all the fuss, but they said I needed a doctor to verify them. It's probably something to do with… well, never mind. Just need it notarized, I guess? Is that what you do here?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you have some forms that require a physician’s signature. Yes, I can certainly review those and sign them if appropriate. However, simply signing them isn’t usually enough, Melvenia. I need to understand what the forms are for, and ensure they accurately reflect your current health status. It’s a matter of medical responsibility, you see. Could you tell me what these forms are related to?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical responsibility… right. See, I knew there was more to it than just a signature. Let me see… They’re for… a volunteer thing. I’m trying to help out at the local animal shelter. They need everyone to have updated health forms, something about making sure we’re all healthy enough to work with the animals. I think it’s mostly just to cover themselves, you know? A lot of older folks helping out. They want to be sure… I don’t know, I didn’t read the details too closely. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. It sounds like these are volunteer health questionnaires. It’s quite responsible of the shelter to require them. We want to make sure you’re fit to safely participate, and it’s good they’re thinking about everyone’s well-being. Before I sign, I’d like to ask you a few questions to fill out the form accurately, and to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Ask away. I’m happy to answer whatever you need. Though, if it’s anything too complicated, I might need you to explain it slowly. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can take things at your pace. I'll do my best to explain everything clearly. No need to worry. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, the doctor years ago – Dr. Hernandez, lovely man – he said my blood pressure was a little high once. But he put me on a little pill for it, and I took that for a while. I stopped taking it, though. Felt like I didn’t need it anymore, and he didn’t push it. And my knees… oh, my knees are always complaining. Arthritis, I think the other doctor said. It’s just old age, really. Nothing too serious. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, and some knee pain consistent with arthritis. Thank you. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just this. For my knees. It’s ibuprofen, I think. Just when they really bother me. Not every day, though. And… sometimes a multivitamin. Just to be sure, you know? Old habits. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and a multivitamin. Good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… Oh, yes! When I was a little girl – maybe seven or eight years old – I had my tonsils out. A very long time ago! And… When I was in my thirties, I had a gallbladder removed. That was… unpleasant. But that was a long, long time ago too. Nothing since then, thankfully. Just a little sniffle here and there. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Tonsillectomy as a child and gallbladder removal in your thirties. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family… My mother… she had diabetes. Towards the end of her life, anyway. And my father… he had heart problems. He smoked too much, you know. Terrible habit. And… My sister… she had cancer, a long time ago. She’s… she’s gone now. But she fought it bravely. That’s about all I can remember, really. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things much. Is that enough? It's a bit sad to think about all of that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Melvenia. It’s understandable that it’s difficult to recall, and it’s perfectly okay to feel sad thinking about it. You’ve given me very helpful information. Knowing about the family history of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer is important. Now, just a couple more quick questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my whole life! And I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. I'm a pretty sturdy person, I think. Though, I don’t go around eating just anything these days. Is that all? I'm starting to feel a bit tired talking about all of this.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, no known allergies. And you are absolutely right to be mindful of what you eat. That was the last of my questions regarding your medical history. Now, I’d like to quickly check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – just to get a current snapshot of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon, you see. Just a hair appointment, but still. I like to be on time.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won’t take long at all. Just a few quick measurements. Alright, your blood pressure is 142/88, your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which is not uncommon, especially with a bit of anxiety about appointments. We can discuss that further. Now, would you mind if I listened to your heart and lungs, and just quickly examine your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding? I really don’t like doctors poking and prodding. But… I suppose if you have to, you have to. Just be quick about it, please. And try not to make it uncomfortable. My knees are very sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur, which is not uncommon in people your age. Your lungs are clear. There is some mild swelling and tenderness in both knees, consistent with arthritis. There is some limited range of motion in both knees, also consistent with arthritis. Alright, that’s all I need to examine for now. Everything seems consistent with your history. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve poked and prodded enough for one day, I think. Can we just get to the signing now? I really need to get going. I’m afraid I’m not very good with all the medical talk. It just makes my head spin.
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. We can absolutely get to the signing now. I completely understand. Based on what you’ve told me, and my examination, I can verify that you are in generally good health, and there are no contraindications to volunteering at the animal shelter. I will sign these forms confirming your health status. Here you are. I recommend that you continue to manage your knee pain as needed with ibuprofen, and I suggest you discuss a potential referral to a physical therapist with your primary care provider to help with strengthening and range of motion. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You were very thorough, even if it was a bit… much. I appreciate you signing the papers for me. It’s a relief to have that taken care of. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
