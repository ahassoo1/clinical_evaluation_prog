DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Doyle Pitmon, it’s a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for a life insurance thing. They sent me, said I need a check-up before they approve anything. Hope it doesn't take too long, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: A life insurance check-up… Right. Well, we'll do our best to be efficient. It's still a medical assessment, though, so we need to be thorough. It's not just about rubber-stamping things for the insurance company, you understand. We need to get a good picture of your overall health. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Been okay mostly. Had a doctor back when I was working at the resort, but that was… a while ago. Things were different then. Now I just go if something really hurts. Does that make sense? I don't usually bother with check-ups if I feel alright.
DOCTOR: It… partially makes sense, I suppose. But preventative care is important, Mr. Putney. A lot of things don't feel bad until they're quite serious. Alright. So, since you haven't been with a regular doctor recently, let's start from the beginning. Any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, no. When I was a kid, I had the usual stuff – chickenpox, measles. Nothing I needed to go to the hospital for. And, uh… I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. That needed a cast, but that was a long time ago. Everything else… just colds and flu, I guess. Nothing serious. I don’t really remember anything else.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major surgeries, childhood illnesses. That’s good. Any family history of significant medical problems – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my dad, he had some trouble with his heart later in life, I think. He was older, though. And my mom… she had high blood pressure, I remember her taking pills for that. That’s about all I know, really. We didn’t talk much about health stuff. It wasn't something we did.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble and high blood pressure in the family. That’s useful information. And what about you currently?
PATIENT: Currently? Well, like I said, I feel okay. A little tired sometimes, maybe. Work’s been busy. I manage a few rooms at the little inn outside of town. It’s…physical work, you know? Lifting bags, cleaning, fixing things. But nothing I can't handle. No chest pain or anything like that. Just… regular tiredness. And maybe a little bit of achiness in my knees sometimes. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: "Old age" at 49?
PATIENT: Well, feels like it some days! Working hard all these years… it takes a toll. Not complaining, just… you know. Being on my feet all the time. It’s just how it is. Sorry. I didn’t mean to…
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Putney. It’s good to be honest. Alright. Let’s talk about some of your habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. Tried it once, back when I was a teenager, didn’t like it. Too harsh. My mom always hated it, too. So I just…never.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a beer now and then. Maybe one or two on the weekend, if I'm with friends. Nothing regular, and never to excess. I’m not a big drinker. Mostly, I drink water. It gets hot out here, you know? Gotta stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional alcohol use. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything a doctor gave me, if that makes sense. Back when I did see a doctor, they never said anything about allergies. I don't really remember them asking, to be honest. I just…took what they gave me. Is that bad? I just assumed they knew what they were doing.
DOCTOR: It's… not ideal, Mr. Putney. It’s good to have a record. Alright, let's move on. Before we do a physical exam, I'm going to ask a few quick questions about your body systems. Just tell me if anything feels off, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Fire away. I’ll try my best to answer. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I got some things to get back to, if you don't mind. Just letting you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, if I'm running around, yeah, I get a little winded. But who doesn’t? Nothing unusual. I can walk up the stairs fine, and I don’t have any trouble sleeping because of breathing. It's just… normal tiredness, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your digestive system?
PATIENT: Uh… no problems there either. Everything works… regular. Sorry, it’s kind of a personal question. Never had any stomach pain or anything like that. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, after a spicy meal, but nothing serious. I eat pretty normal, I guess. Rice, fish, some vegetables. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright. How about your urinary system?
PATIENT: Uh… everything's okay there too. No burning or anything. Just… normal. Sorry, I'm not sure what else to say. It all works like it should, if that makes sense. Look, is this all necessary for the insurance thing? I just want to make sure it doesn't take all day.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, it is necessary to get a full picture of your health, regardless of the insurance. We need to rule out anything serious. It's standard procedure. Now, have you experienced any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, my vision’s not so good anymore. Been getting worse over the last couple of years. I need reading glasses. Just for close-up stuff. And, uh, my hearing… it’s not what it used to be, either. I have to ask people to repeat themselves sometimes. Old age, I guess. Sorry. Is that going to be a problem? Will the insurance not cover me if I can't see or hear perfectly?
DOCTOR: It's not about the insurance covering you, Mr. Putney, it's about documenting your health status accurately. Alright, let's move on. Any joint pain or swelling?
PATIENT: Yeah, like I said, my knees. They ache sometimes, especially after a long day. It’s just a little achiness. Nothing terrible. And my back gets stiff, too. Just from lifting stuff at the inn. I don’t think it’s anything serious. Just… old age. I'm starting to feel like a broken-down machine, if I’m honest. Sorry for complaining. I just… want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. I think I have enough information for now. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to confirm what you’ve told me. It won’t take long. If you could just lie down on the examination table, please.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… try to be quick, please? My back’s not gonna appreciate being poked and prodded for too long. And… can I keep my clothes on? I’m not really comfortable taking them off for strangers.
DOCTOR: We can leave your clothes on, Mr. Putney. However, I will need to listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie on your back with your arms at your sides. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Deep breath… and exhale. Your breathing is a little wheezy, Mr. Putney. And I'm detecting a slight murmur. It’s probably nothing, but we'll want to get an EKG to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: A murmur? What’s a murmur? Is that bad? Is something wrong with my heart? I told you I was fine! I just needed a piece of paper for the insurance. Now you’re telling me there’s something wrong with my heart? Look, maybe I should just go. Maybe I don’t need the insurance. Maybe I’ll just be careful. I don’t want an EKG. I don't like doctors. I just… I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, please, calm down. A murmur doesn't necessarily mean there's something seriously wrong with your heart. It simply means there's an unusual sound when we listen to it. It could be completely benign, but we need to investigate to be sure. An EKG is a simple, non-invasive test – it just measures your heart's electrical activity. It’s standard procedure for someone with a murmur, and it will give us valuable information. Look, I understand you're anxious, but refusing a basic diagnostic test won't make you feel any better. It’s better to know for certain, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Alright, alright… fine. Do your test. But… just make it quick, please. And… tell me what it means afterwards. I don’t want to be left in the dark. I just… I just want to know if I’m going to drop dead tomorrow. Is that too much to ask? Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. It won’t take long, Mr. Putney. Just lie still, and I'll attach these electrodes to your chest, arms, and legs. It's painless, I assure you. Now, I'm going to start the machine. It will record your heart’s electrical activity for a few minutes. Try to breathe normally. Hmm… Well, the EKG shows some abnormalities, Mr. Putney. It’s not conclusive, but it suggests possible left ventricular hypertrophy and some ST segment changes. This could indicate several things, including high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathy. It’s too early to say for sure. I recommend you see a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation. They may want to do an echocardiogram and a stress test to get a better understanding of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Cardio… what? Echo… what? Stress test? What are you talking about? I just came here for a life insurance thing! Now you're telling me I have… I have what? Left ven-tri-what? Is that… is that serious? Am I going to die? Look, maybe I just need to lie down. Maybe I'm having a heart attack right now. Just… just leave me alone. I don’t want to hear any more. I just want to go home and pretend this never happened.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, please calm down. You are not having a heart attack right now. Hyperventilating will only make things worse. You are experiencing anxiety, which is understandable given the situation. Look, I'm going to write you a referral to a cardiologist. They are the specialists who can properly evaluate your heart and determine the best course of action. I’ll also give you a copy of the EKG results. I understand you're upset, but ignoring this won’t make it go away. It's better to be proactive and get it checked out. Here’s the referral information. The cardiologist’s office will call you to schedule an appointment. Please, schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
