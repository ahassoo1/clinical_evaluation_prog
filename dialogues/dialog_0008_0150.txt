DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, Doctor, let's not waste time. I’m 51, and frankly, I want to have a baby. And I want it to be…easy. No complications. Is that even possible at my age? I’ve always been…healthy, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're wanting to explore the possibility of pregnancy at age 51, and hoping for a straightforward course. It’s good that you’ve generally been healthy. It is possible, though it does come with increased risks. Let me pull up your chart quickly… Alright, I see you’re 51, and your height and weight are noted as 186cm and 86kg. Do you have any current medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Really? You need to write that down? It's all perfectly obvious. No, I don't have…conditions. I had a divorce, does that count as a condition? I take Medicare, obviously, but that’s not a medical thing. Look, I just want to know if I need a lot of tests, or…procedures. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seemed unnecessary, Ms. Shteynberg. It's standard procedure to document everything thoroughly for your care and legal reasons. And no, divorce isn’t a medical condition. Okay, so no known medical conditions. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Not really. A wisdom tooth pulled when I was young, and… that's it. Absolutely nothing else. I’m very careful with my body. I wouldn’t just go getting cut open for fun. Is this all necessary? I mean, I just want to know if it’s possible, not a full life history.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries noted. I understand your frustration, and I'll try to be as efficient as possible. Knowing your surgical history helps us assess potential risks, and it’s important for anesthesia if any procedures were needed. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly? It’s all very…Eastern European. Lots of people who lived long lives and lots who didn’t. My grandmother smoked like a chimney and lived to 90, so… who knows. My mother had high blood pressure, but she also ate a lot of salt. It’s not exactly a scientific study, is it? Look, I’m a healthy person. Can we just skip this part?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A complicated family history can make it difficult to assess risk. And I appreciate your patience. We can move on, though it’s good to be aware of these things. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Really? You have to ask? I told you I was healthy! No, I don’t smoke, I have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally, and absolutely not drugs. Honestly, Doctor, are you implying something? I’m a perfectly respectable woman.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem accusatory, Ms. Shteynberg. I assure you, that’s not my intention. These are standard questions asked of all patients, regardless of their stated health. It helps me get a complete picture. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Vitamins? A multivitamin, occasionally. And sometimes I take something for my joints, but it’s herbal. Nothing serious. Look, I’m trying to be proactive about my health, not…fall apart. Can we please get to the point? What are the chances, realistically? Is this even worth doing, at my age?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin and an herbal supplement for your joints. Let's be frank, Ms. Shteynberg. Achieving pregnancy at 51 is challenging, but not impossible. The biggest factor is egg quality, which declines significantly with age. The chances of conceiving naturally at your age are very low – less than 1%. However, assisted reproductive technologies like in-vitro fertilization with donor eggs offer a much higher success rate. But IVF is expensive and carries its own risks. Before we discuss those options further, I need to perform a basic physical exam and order some blood tests to assess your overall health and ovarian reserve. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Donor eggs? Absolutely not. That's… that's not what I had in mind. I want to use my eggs. Look, I may be 51, but I'm still…functional. Blood tests, fine. But no talk of donors. And I expect quick results. I don't have time for a long process.
DOCTOR: Understood, Ms. Shteynberg. We will proceed focusing on using your eggs. As you said, we'll aim for efficiency. Alright. Let's start with a basic physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick abdominal exam. Then I’ll order the blood tests. They'll assess your hormone levels, ovarian reserve , and general health markers. It will give us a clearer picture of your baseline status. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But quickly, please. And explain everything in simple terms. I don’t need a lecture on hormones. Just tell me what the numbers mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shteynberg. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at this moment. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, the blood tests will give us more information. AMH, or Anti-Mullerian Hormone, is a good indicator of your egg reserve. Lower levels suggest fewer eggs remaining. We’ll also check your FSH and estradiol levels, which help assess ovarian function. I’m ordering the tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and it usually takes a few days for the results to come back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available to discuss the findings and explore possible options. Do you have any questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… get the results to me quickly. And no pressure about donors. I want to see if it's even possible with my eggs, then we’ll talk. Honestly, Doctor, I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand. No pressure about donors. We’ll focus on your options first, and we’ll proceed at your pace. Here’s the lab form. Please take it to the lab, and they’ll get the tests scheduled. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available. I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Thank you for coming in today.
PATIENT: Fine. Goodbye. And do try to hurry with those results.
