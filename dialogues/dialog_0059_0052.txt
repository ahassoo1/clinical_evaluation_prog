DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye, Doctor. And the pleasure's all mine. Well, I've been havin' a wee bit o' trouble, see. Mostly in the mornings. A fair bit o' nausea, it is. Been gettin' worse the past couple o' weeks, and my heart... well, it's not the strongest, as ye likely know. They told me it was heart failure a while back now. It's mostly this sickness in the mornin' that's botherin' me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Benic. It sounds quite unsettling to be experiencing worsening nausea, especially with your history of heart failure. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Could you describe the nausea a bit more?
PATIENT: Aye, unsettling is a good word for it, Doctor. It's not like a quick upset, ye ken? It builds slowly. Starts as a sort o' queasiness, a wee flutter in the stomach. Then it just... grows. Feels like I might be sick, but often I'm not. Just that awful feelin'. It usually starts before I even get out o' bed, and it can last for a good few hours. Doesn’t always happen, mind ye, but when it does, it really knocks me for six. And it's not linked to anythin' I've eaten, not that I've noticed anyway. I eat fairly plain, truth be told.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Benic. It’s helpful to know it builds slowly and isn’t necessarily tied to food intake. And it’s good you've noticed it can last for several hours. Now, when you say it "knocks you for six," does that mean it impacts your ability to carry out your normal daily activities?
PATIENT: Aye, "knocks me for six" means it really takes it out o' me, Doctor. I work at the library, cataloguing books and helpin' folks find what they need. When it's bad, I struggle to even think straight, let alone focus on work. I've had to take a couple o' days off already this month because o' it. Just feelin' too weak and sick to be much use, ye see? And it's not just work, it makes me tired all day, even if it's a mild case. Makes even simple things like makin' a cup o' tea a bit of an ordeal.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly disruptive to your life, Mr. Benic, and concerning given your heart history. It's good you're recognizing the impact it’s having. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea?
PATIENT: Not particularly, Doctor. Not that I've consciously noticed, anyway. I've been a bit more breathless than usual, maybe? But I always put that down to the heart. Gets worse when I'm walkin' up the stairs, naturally. No dizziness, no pain, no fever... just the sickness and the tiredness. Oh, wait a minute... now that ye mention it, my ankles have been a wee bit swollen lately. I didn't think much of it, just assumed it was the weather. They do ache a bit at the end o' the day. Is that somethin' to worry about?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Mr. Benic. The increased breathlessness and the ankle swelling are definitely things we need to consider, especially in the context of your heart failure. Swelling in the ankles can often be a sign of fluid retention, which can be related to the heart’s ability to pump effectively. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a bit more generally. Besides the heart failure diagnosis, do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I had a bit o' arthritis in my hands years ago, but it's not botherin' me much these days. Just a wee bit o' stiffness in the mornings, that's all. And I had my appendix out when I was a lad, but that was decades ago. Otherwise, I've been fairly lucky, all things considered. I don't smoke, and I only have a wee dram o' whisky now and again. I try to keep myself active, walkin' when I can, but as I said, the breathlessness makes that harder some days. I’ve never been a fan o' pills, so I don't take much in the way o' medication, besides what the doctor prescribed for the heart, o' course.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Benic. It’s good to know you’ve generally been healthy, aside from the heart failure and the arthritis. And it’s helpful to know about your lifestyle – no smoking and limited alcohol intake are certainly positives. Could you remind me what medications you are currently taking for your heart failure?
PATIENT: Aye, no problem, Doctor. Let me think... there's Lisinopril, I think that's for the blood pressure. And then there's... Furosemide, is it? A wee white tablet, they said it was a diuretic, somethin' to do with gettin' rid o' excess water. And then I take Digoxin, a purple one, to help the heart beat properly. I've been on these for a good few years now. The dosage hasn't changed in a while, I don’t think anyway. I usually just leave it to the chemist to sort it all out, to be honest. I’m not one for fussin’ with tablets.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Benic. That's very helpful. Lisinopril, Furosemide, and Digoxin. It sounds like you’re on a fairly standard regimen for managing heart failure. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anythin', thankfully. I can eat most foods, no bother. I'm not allergic to penicillin or any o' the usual suspects, so to speak. I've got a bit o' a sensitive nose, gettin' hay fever in the summer, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? And I’m not a fan o' cats, but that's a dislike, not an allergy! I've always been pretty robust, all things considered. Never had much trouble with illnesses, touch wood.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Benic. No known allergies. Alright, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination now. That will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and examining your ankles. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, go right ahead, Doctor. No bother at all. I'm used to havin' me heart listened to, unfortunately. I'll just sit here, shall I? And I suppose I should lift me trousers up a bit for ye to look at me ankles, eh? Do as ye need to. I trust your judgement, o' course. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable, and I'll let ye know if I feel anything strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Benic. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. … … Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I can hear a bit of a murmur, which we already know about. There’s some congestion in your lungs, though not severe. Now, let me just check your ankles… Yes, as you mentioned, there is some swelling in both ankles. And I can see some pitting edema when I press on them. That’s consistent with fluid retention. Blood pressure is 150/90 which is a little high. Alright, Mr. Benic. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the examination, it seems likely that your nausea and tiredness are related to a worsening of your heart failure. The congestion in your lungs and the swelling in your ankles support this. It is possible the nausea could be a side effect from your medications, but I believe the heart failure is the more likely cause at this time. It’s important we address this now to prevent it from getting worse. Do you have any questions about what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: Aye, that makes sense, Doctor. I knew somethin' wasn't right, feelin' so poorly. Worsenin' o' the heart failure... it's no a surprise, I suppose. I've been feelin' more breathless than usual, and me ankles have been achin'. So, what does that mean, exactly? What can be done about it? Are ye gonna have to give me more pills? I was hopin' to avoid more pills, if I'm honest. And will I need to be admitted to hospital? I’d rather not, if possible. I've got a few books I need to catalogue, ye see. Is it serious? I just want to know what I'm up against. I appreciate ye explainin' it all so clearly, Doctor. It's a wee bit frighten'in', hearin' it all laid out like that.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Mr. Benic, and it’s perfectly understandable to feel frightened. It is concerning, but we can certainly work to manage this. First, let's address the seriousness. It is important we take this seriously, as worsening heart failure can lead to complications. However, with prompt treatment, we can often stabilize your condition and prevent it from becoming more severe. Now, regarding treatment. You are right to be concerned about more pills, but unfortunately, it’s likely we’ll need to adjust your current medications. It may be that we need to increase the dose of your Furosemide to help get rid of the excess fluid. It's also possible we need to consider adding a different type of medication to help your heart pump more effectively. We'll discuss the potential side effects of any new medications, and I'll try to minimize those as much as possible. Regarding hospitalization, I don’t believe you need to be admitted to hospital right now. However, we need to monitor your condition closely. I would like to order a few tests, including a blood test to check your kidney function and an ECG to assess your heart rhythm. We will also repeat your blood pressure and check the oxygen levels in your blood. I'd like to see you back in a few days to review the results and see how you're responding to any medication adjustments. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A few more tests... I can manage that. And seein' ye in a few days... that's better than bein' stuck in hospital, certainly. I'm grateful ye're not rushin' to put me under a blanket, so to speak. Adjustin' the medication... I trust your judgement on that. Just... try to keep it to a minimum, if ye can. I don’t react well to pills, as I said. What about the oxygen levels? Is that somethin' to worry about? And the kidney function... is that related to the water retention? I'm just tryin' to understand it all, ye see. It's easy to get overwhelmed, hearin' all these medical terms. If I feel worse before my next appointment, should I come straight back? And is there anythin' I should be doin' in the meantime? Less salt in me food, I suppose? And avoid walkin' up hills? Just tryin' to be proactive, ye see. I appreciate ye takin' the time to explain it all so clearly, Doctor. It puts me mind at ease, knowin' ye're on top o' it.
DOCTOR: You’re very proactive, Mr. Benic, and I appreciate your questions. It’s excellent that you’re thinking about all of this. Regarding the tests, the blood test will assess your kidney function because the kidneys play a crucial role in regulating fluid balance. The medication we use to get rid of excess fluid can sometimes affect kidney function, so it’s important to monitor it. Checking your oxygen levels is also important, as reduced oxygen levels can indicate worsening heart failure. And yes, you are correct to think about reducing salt intake. Lowering your salt intake can help reduce fluid retention and ease the burden on your heart. Avoiding strenuous activity, especially walking up hills, is also a good idea. Listen to your body and stop if you feel breathless or tired. If you feel worse before your next appointment – if your breathlessness worsens, if your ankles swell significantly more, or if you experience any chest pain – please come straight back, or go to the nearest emergency room. Don’t hesitate. I will write a referral for the blood tests and ECG now, and I’ll also provide you with some information about a low-sodium diet. We’ll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment in a few days. I’ll also make a note to review your current medication list to see if there’s anything that could be contributing to your symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think ye've covered everythin'. I appreciate yer patience and yer clear explanations. I feel much better understandin' what's goin' on, and what needs to be done. I'll get the tests done as soon as possible, and I'll try to stick to a low-sodium diet. And I'll listen to me body, as ye said. Thank ye again for yer time, Doctor Chagaris. I feel much more at ease now. And I'll see ye in a few days. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you in a few days. .
