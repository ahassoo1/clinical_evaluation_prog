DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Gibbel, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Percell, please. Mr. Gibbel makes me feel…old, you know? And it is Percell. Been Percell for eighty-four years.
DOCTOR: Percell, then. And what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's this headache. Right in the back of my head. Started a couple of weeks ago, maybe three. It's not…sharp, exactly. More like a dull ache. Constant, mostly. It doesn't go away completely, even when I rest. It's just…there.
DOCTOR: A constant headache for three weeks. Alright. Any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No fever, no dizziness. I haven't been sick to my stomach or anything like that. My vision's been okay, I think. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I’ve always needed glasses, so it’s hard to tell if that’s new. Oh! And I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, at eighty-four, something’s always tired. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Tiredness at your age is… expected. But we still need to rule things out. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…I haven't been eating as much. Not a huge difference, but my daughter, May, she’s always fussing over me, making sure I eat enough. She says I've lost a few pounds, but I haven't weighed myself. I don't really bother with that stuff anymore. I just haven't been as hungry, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of headaches, or neurological issues?
PATIENT: Oh, family…that's a long story. My mother, she had migraines, bad ones. Couldn’t do anything when they hit. But that was a long time ago, and I never got them like she did. My father… he didn’t really talk about his health much. We didn't have doctors a lot where we came from, you know? More traditional medicine. Nothing major, I don't think. Though my cousin, Lee… he had some trouble with his balance a few years back, but I don’t know what it was. It wasn't a headache, though.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, or have you recently started any new supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off it. Said it was doing more harm than good. And I take a multivitamin, but I’ve been taking that for ages, nothing new. May tries to get me to take all sorts of things, but I mostly just stick to the vitamin. She means well, that girl. Always looking out for her old Pa.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see here you haven't had a full physical in… quite some time. And your weight is down 8 pounds since your last visit, which, admittedly, was a long time ago. I'm going to need to do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, I can stand. A little creaky, but I can stand. Eight pounds, huh? Didn't realize it was that much. Just be gentle, Doc. Old bones, you know. What are we lookin' for exactly? Just curious.
DOCTOR: Just checking your reflexes, balance, and a quick neurological assessment. Nothing to worry about. Reflexes are a bit diminished, as expected. Pupils are equal and reactive. Follow my finger with your eyes…left, right, up, down. Good. Alright. Now, I want to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me…and another. Any shortness of breath or chest pain with that?
PATIENT: No pain, no shortness of breath. Just an old man breathin’. Used to a lot of walking, you see. Used to be a farmer, back in Laos. Lots of hills. Didn’t bother me then, but these old lungs ain’t what they used to be. You're doin' a good job, Doc. Very thorough. Makes me feel a little better, knowin' you’re lookin' at everything.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds. Heart sounds are regular, but a mild murmur is present. Likely benign, but we’ll need to monitor it. Alright. Given your age, weight loss, and persistent headache, I’m going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. We also need to rule out any structural issues causing the headache, so I’m ordering a CT scan of your head. May, your daughter, can arrange those for you?
PATIENT: A CT scan…that sounds…serious. Is it somethin’ bad, Doc? I mean, I get headaches, sure, but I figured it was just old age catchin' up to me. May can handle the arrangements, yeah. She's very good at that sort of thing. She worries about me, you see. Always has. But what are we lookin’ for with the scan?
DOCTOR: It's a precaution, Mr. Gibbel. We need to rule out anything serious – a tumor, bleeding, anything that could be causing your symptoms. It doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong. It's standard procedure given your age and the unexplained weight loss. The blood work will check for infection, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The scan will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on in your brain. I'll have May schedule those appointments. Follow up with me in one week to discuss the results. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I don't think so. It's just…a lot to take in. I appreciate you checkin' everything, Doc. Really. It's just… I've never had so many tests before. May will be glad to handle the scheduling. She always does. Thank you. I guess… I'll see you next week.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have your daughter contact the clinic to schedule the tests. We’ll see you next week. .
