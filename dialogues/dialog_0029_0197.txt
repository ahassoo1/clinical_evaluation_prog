DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarotta. I’m Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Just trying to get this card so I can drive for… well, you know, one of those ride-sharing things. It’s a long story why I’m doing it at my age, but here we are. I need the medical bit sorted, that’s all. Let’s get it over with, shall we? I have a mahjong game this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Right, a medical evaluation for a rideshare driver's license. Understandable. We want to make sure you're safe out there. To start, can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. Well, I’m 70, so things aren’t perfect, naturally. I have a little bit of trouble with my knees sometimes, but nothing a good soak doesn’t fix. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, but I wear glasses. Other than that… honestly, I feel pretty good for my age. I still work, you know? Logging equipment is hard work. Is that enough information, or do you need a list of every ache and pain?
DOCTOR: That’s a good start, thank you. The EHR does mention some osteoarthritis in the knees, and a prescription for glasses. Just to clarify, when you say you "still work," what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: Oh, right, the computer knows everything these days. Yes, osteoarthritis, that’s the fancy name for the knee trouble. And the glasses are for reading, mostly. As for work… I operate logging equipment. Chainsaws, skidders, that sort of thing. Been doing it for… well, a very long time. It keeps me active, anyway. Though my ex-husband always said it was a dangerous job for a woman. He wasn't very supportive. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Logging equipment… that is physically demanding. And requires good vision and reflexes. Okay. Have you had any recent changes in your vision – beyond needing your reading glasses?
PATIENT: No, not really. The reading glasses have gotten a little stronger over the last year, maybe? But nothing drastic. I had my eyes checked last year, same doctor I’ve always seen. He just said I was getting old. Which, frankly, I already knew. Everything feels a little blurry if I don't have them on, but that’s normal, isn’t it? I haven’t had trouble seeing things while I’m driving, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you experienced any dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting spells recently?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I get a little warm sometimes when it's hot, but that’s just because I’m… well, not as young as I used to be. I make sure to stay hydrated. And I don’t stand in the sun too long. Never had a proper faint, though. Not once. Are we getting close to being done? My mahjong partner, Hana, gets very upset if I'm late.
DOCTOR: Almost. Just a few more questions to cover. Have you had any problems with your heart – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. My heart’s been good as far as I know. I get a little breathless when I'm hauling logs, but that’s just from the effort, you understand? Nothing… alarming. I did have a bad scare years ago – a terrible flu that affected my chest – but the doctor said my heart was fine then. And it’s been fine ever since. Really. Is this about the heart? Because if it is, I’m pretty sure I’m okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s talk about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I take a little something for my arthritis, naproxen, the doctor prescribed it. Sometimes I take Tylenol if the naproxen isn’t enough. And I take a multivitamin, just to be safe. No allergies that I know of. I've had all sorts of medications over the years, but never had a reaction. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Is that enough? I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. It will only take a few minutes. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a brief neurological exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, then. I don’t mind. Just try to be quick, alright? Hana is very competitive. And she’ll never let me forget if I’m late. Do I need to undress or anything?
DOCTOR: No, no need to undress. Just sit comfortably. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Good. Blood pressure now. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Everything seems to be responding normally. Now, just follow my finger with your eyes... . Alright. All seems relatively normal. Do you have any trouble with balance?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I’m not as nimble as I used to be, but I haven’t fallen or anything. I walk around in the forest all day, climbing over logs and things. I’d notice if I had trouble with my balance, wouldn’t I? And I haven’t. This is all very thorough, Doctor. Are we almost done? My mahjong tiles are calling my name.
DOCTOR: Almost finished. Okay, based on what you've told me and the brief exam, you appear to be in relatively good health for your age. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which we should monitor, and you mentioned some knee pain, which you're managing. Given your profession, though, and the need for good reflexes and vision for driving, I would recommend a full vision exam with a specialist, just to be certain. And I’d like to order a basic blood workup to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: A vision exam, alright. I already have a doctor for that. I’ll make an appointment. And blood work... fine. Whatever you think is best. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… can I get the card now? So I can go play mahjong? Hana is going to be furious. Is there anything else I need to do? Any forms I need to fill out? Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarotta. Here’s a form for the blood work. You can get that done at the lab across the street. And here is a document outlining the recommendations – vision exam, monitoring your blood pressure. And here is the medical certification form that you need to submit to get your rideshare driver's license. I’m signing it now, contingent upon receiving satisfactory results from the blood work and confirmation of a recent vision exam. I’m going to write a note for your primary care physician regarding the slightly elevated blood pressure. Do you have any known heart conditions, or family history of early heart disease?
PATIENT: No, no heart conditions. My father lived to be 85, and he smoked like a chimney, so I think I’m alright. My mother… she was healthy too, as far as I know. She was a very private woman. So, no, no family history of early heart disease. Can I just… go now? I really don’t want to keep Hana waiting. She's a formidable opponent, even without a head start. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarotta. You’re welcome. Please follow up with the blood work results and a confirmation of your vision exam. Drive safely, and enjoy your mahjong game. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I will drive safely. Don’t worry about me. I’ve been driving longer than you’ve been alive! Goodbye now. Hana is going to pay for this… waiting…
