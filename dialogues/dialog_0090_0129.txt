DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about my… well, my poop. It’s black. Like tar, almost. And I take those pills, you know, for the arthritis. The red ones. Been taking them for years. It just started happening a few days ago and it’s… concerning. I don't like it one bit. Can we just get this sorted, please? I have errands.
DOCTOR: Black, tarry stools are certainly something we need to investigate, Ms. Hatchard. And yes, we’ll get to the bottom of this – no pun intended. You mentioned the red pills for arthritis… those are important to know about. First, can you tell me exactly when you started noticing the change in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… let me think. It was… Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday. I had my usual breakfast, then took the pill with my coffee, and… well, later that day. It wasn't immediately after, but… Tuesday. Definitely Tuesday. I remember because Mrs. Gable next door was wearing that awful floral dress. She only wears it on Tuesdays. Honestly, the things people wear… Is that important? Just tell me if it’s bad.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Gable’s fashion choices aren't relevant, Ms. Hatchard, though I appreciate the detail. Tuesday is helpful. So, it’s been… three days now of these black stools?
PATIENT: Three days, yes. And it's not just a little dark, Doctor. It's… unsettling. Like something’s terribly wrong. I've never seen anything like it before, and I’ve lived a long life. And I told you, I take those pills every day! Are you going to give me another one? Or… what are we doing here? I really don't have time for a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Hatchard, black, tarry stools can indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract. The pills you’re taking, depending on what they are, can sometimes irritate the stomach lining. But we can't just assume that's the cause. First, I need to ask a few more questions. Do you experience any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A little discomfort, maybe, after I eat. But I'm 73! Everything hurts a little, don’t you think? It's just old age. It's not like a sharp pain or anything. It's more of a… dull ache, and it comes and goes. Honestly, I think you’re making a big deal out of nothing. A few dark stools. People have worse problems.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, while I understand your perspective, we must rule out serious possibilities. Any change in bowel habits, especially with black stools, warrants investigation. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or weakness lately?
PATIENT: Weakness? Well, I get tired easily, but that's just getting old, like I said. I haven't been throwing up, if that’s what you mean. And I haven't felt sick to my stomach, not really. I ate a bit too much cabbage last week, that's all. It gives me gas. Is that relevant? Honestly, this is a lot of questions over something that might be nothing. Are you going to do a test, or just keep asking me about my digestion? I have a bridge game later.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, I'm going to need to perform a physical examination, and I’ll also need to order some lab tests. Specifically, a stool test to check for blood, and a complete blood count. It’s standard procedure. It will take a few minutes. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials?
PATIENT: Latex? No, I don’t think so. Never had a problem with gloves or anything. Honestly, I’ve been poked and prodded enough times in my life. Just get it over with, please. The sooner we’re done, the sooner I can go. And try not to be too rough, alright? I bruise easily. And tell me what these tests are for, exactly, not just what they’re called. I want to understand what you're doing to me.
DOCTOR: The stool test will confirm if there is blood present, and the complete blood count will tell us if you’re anemic – meaning if you’ve lost a significant amount of blood. It’s a simple procedure, Ms. Hatchard. I’ll just need you to lie down on the examination table. Please turn onto your left side, with your knees bent.
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Alright, alright. Just be quick about it, Doctor. I have a very nice cucumber sandwich waiting for me at home. And if you find anything, just tell me straight. No beating around the bush. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just checking for any tenderness or masses. Bowel sounds are present, though a little sluggish. No significant tenderness to the touch, thankfully. Now, I’ll need a small stool sample. There's a collection kit in the bathroom. Instructions are on the lid. Please bring it back when you're finished.
PATIENT: A stool sample? Honestly! This is ridiculous. Fine, fine. Just… don’t expect miracles, alright? It might take a while. And I expect a clean bathroom, Doctor. I won’t tolerate dirt. This is such a waste of time. I could be playing bridge right now. .
