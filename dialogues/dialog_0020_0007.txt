DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my back. It’s been painful. I’d like to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, your back. I understand. And you'd like to get it sorted as quickly as possible. I'll certainly do my best. To start, can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. But sometimes, when I’m working – I erect fences, you see – it shoots sharp pain down my leg. It started about a month ago, I think. Not sure of the exact date. It just… began.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache with shooting pain down your leg, especially when you’re erecting fences. And it started roughly a month ago. That gives me a little to work with. Can you point to exactly where on your back the pain begins?
PATIENT: Right… here. It feels like it starts right in this spot, and then goes down my left leg. Not always, but when it’s bad, it definitely goes down my leg. Feels like… a burning, almost.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, on the left side, with burning pain radiating down the left leg. That's helpful. Does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Sometimes… lying down flat. And… warm baths, they help a little. But not for long. Mostly, it just… is there. Doesn’t really go away completely. Working makes it worse, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright, lying flat and warm baths offer some temporary relief. And working exacerbates it. Now, has this pain affected anything else?
PATIENT: Yes. My… my sleep. It’s difficult to get comfortable. I toss and turn. And… walking long distances is harder now. I used to enjoy walking, but not so much anymore. It feels… unsteady, almost. Like my leg might give out.
DOCTOR: Okay, impacting your sleep and making walking difficult. A feeling of instability in your leg. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Just please be quick, if you wouldn't mind. I have work to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Okay. I'm noticing some tenderness when I press right here, on the left side of your lower back. And when you bend backward, I see a slight wince. Lifting your left leg is a bit restricted compared to your right. Do you feel any pain or tingling with those movements?
PATIENT: Yes. Bending backward… that’s definitely uncomfortable. And lifting my left leg… yes, a sharp pain shoots down the leg when I do that. Not tingling, just… pain. Like a pulling sensation. It’s… unpleasant. Can we be done soon?
DOCTOR: Alright, pain with bending backward and lifting the left leg, described as a sharp, pulling sensation radiating down the leg. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing sciatica – irritation of the sciatic nerve. However, to be certain, and to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. It will help us visualize the bones and see if there's any structural issue contributing to your pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… yes, alright. If it’s necessary. But how long will that take? I really need to get back to work. And… will it show anything? I don’t want to waste time on something that won’t help.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time. The X-ray itself only takes a few minutes, and the radiologist usually gets the report back within 24-48 hours. It’s a good first step to get a clear picture of what's going on, and it will help me determine the best course of treatment for you. While we wait for the results, I can recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen – to help manage the pain. And gentle stretching exercises may also provide some relief. Would you like me to write down some simple exercises for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Write down the exercises. And the pain relievers… ibuprofen is fine, I think. I’ve taken that before. Just… please make the exercises simple. I don’t have time for anything complicated. And… how long before I can get the results? Really, 48 hours is too long. Is there anything faster?
DOCTOR: Here you are. These are fairly basic and shouldn’t take much time at all. Regarding the X-ray results, 48 hours is typical, but I can certainly ask the radiology department to prioritize it. There's no guarantee, but I'll do my best. In the meantime, we can discuss some other options if the pain becomes unbearable. Have you tried any heat or cold packs?
PATIENT: Yes, I’ve tried both. Heat feels a little better, I think. But it doesn’t last. Look… Doctor, I appreciate you trying to help. But I really need to know if this is something serious or not. If it's just… a pulled muscle, I can deal with that. But if it’s something that needs more… attention, I need to know now. Can you give me your honest opinion? From what you’ve seen so far?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner. Based on the examination and your description, it doesn't present as an emergency. However, the pain radiating down your leg suggests it's likely more than a simple pulled muscle. Sciatica, as I mentioned, is a strong possibility. The X-ray is crucial to rule out any underlying structural issues, like a herniated disc or bone spur, that could be compressing the nerve. I want to be cautious and thorough. I'm going to order the X-ray, and while we wait for those results, I will also write you a prescription for a short course of muscle relaxants to help with the pain and spasm. If the pain worsens significantly – if you experience weakness in your leg, loss of bowel or bladder control, or severe numbness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that sounds acceptable. Muscle relaxants, alright. And the emergency room instructions are clear. Please, just hurry with the X-ray order. I need to get back to work. And… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. .
