DOCTOR: Hello, Mirriam. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop! It’s been… goodness, I’d say about three days now. Not constantly, mind you, but they come and go and it’s getting a bit tiresome.
DOCTOR: Three days, alright. That is a bit tiresome, I can imagine. Hiccups for that long… hmm. Are they interfering with your sleep or eating at all, Mirriam?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little bit of both, actually. Not terribly with the eating, I just get a fright with every bite sometimes! But the sleep… that's the worst part. Every time I start to drift off, hic! there it is again. Wakes me right up. It's a bit silly, isn't it? But it's really starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mirriam. Sleep is so important, and anything that disrupts that is definitely worth looking into. Okay, let’s see… have you noticed anything before the hiccups start?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… Now, the first time it happened, I was having a cup of tea and laughing at a silly video my grandson sent. But the others… not really. Sometimes I’m just sitting quietly, reading, and hic! it starts. Other times I’m walking around. I haven’t been doing anything particularly strenuous, if that’s what you mean. Just normal things, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, normal activities… and it sounds like it's not consistently triggered by anything. Alright. Do you have any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not really. No heartburn, no stomach pain, no feeling sick or anything. Just the hiccups. Oh, wait! Now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little bit tired lately, but I just thought that was my age catching up to me. I’m 86, you know! Everything takes a bit more effort these days.
DOCTOR: That’s fair, Mirriam. 86 is wonderful! And feeling tired is certainly something we should note. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I do. Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure – Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a little something for my cholesterol. Atorvastatin, that’s it. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I’ll take naproxen. But I haven’t taken any of that in the last couple of days, just the blood pressure and cholesterol pills. Same dose as always, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, Atorvastatin… and occasional naproxen. Good. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Mirriam?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve been pretty lucky, really. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! Though these hiccups are certainly testing that theory, aren’t they?
DOCTOR: They certainly are! Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind at all. I always think it’s good to check everything properly, you know? Better safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to touch, and I don’t feel any masses. Everything feels normal there. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s reassuring to hear. My mother always worried about everything, so it’s nice when things are… normal! Go ahead with the reflexes, Doctor. I used to be quite good at those in school, but I haven't had anyone check them in ages! Perhaps I’ll surprise you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are a little bit diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Nothing to be concerned about at this point. Okay, Mirriam. Everything seems physically normal. Given the duration of the hiccups, and the fact that they’re interfering with your sleep, I think it’s worth running a few tests, just to rule things out. Would you be okay with a blood test and a chest X-ray?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If it will help find out what’s causing these pesky hiccups, then absolutely. Blood test and X-ray… no problem at all. Just let me know when and where, and I’ll be there. I trust your judgement, you know? You seem very thorough.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mirriam. I appreciate that. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. We can schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow morning, at the imaging center across the street. It’s a quick, painless procedure. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and get as much rest as you can. If the hiccups get significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms – like shortness of breath or chest pain – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Hydrate, rest, and call if anything changes… I can do that. And thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing it as just “old age.” It really is nice to feel like someone is taking it seriously. I’ll see you tomorrow for the X-ray, then. Thank you again.
