DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Lovely to meet you as well. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me see... it's about my blood, I think. My son, he wanted me to… get it checked. Something about knowing what type it is. I don't quite recall the reason, you see. Old age, it steals the memories! But he was quite insistent.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very common. It’s good of your son to be so proactive about your health. So, it sounds like your son is concerned about getting your blood type checked. Is he a medical professional, or did something specific prompt him to suggest this?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear, he's not a doctor. He's... a builder, I think? Or maybe an architect? Something with houses. Very good at it, he is. As for what prompted it… honestly, I haven’t the faintest. He just said it was important to know. He’s always been a worrier, that boy. Always fussing over everything. It could have been something on the television, maybe? I watch a lot of television these days. Though what I watched yesterday… now that I can’t recall at all.
DOCTOR: That's alright, don't worry about the details. It’s good he’s looking out for you. Knowing your blood type is helpful information to have, even if there wasn't a specific reason for the request. It can be important in case of emergencies. So, besides your son’s concern, are you experiencing any symptoms or feeling unwell in any way?
PATIENT: Oh, emergencies… goodness. No, no, nothing like that, dear. I feel… well, I feel my age, if that makes sense. A little creaky in the mornings, and I forget where I put my glasses at least three times a day. But nothing wrong, exactly. Just… old. And tired, sometimes. But who isn’t, at my age? I haven’t been feeling poorly, if that’s what you mean. Just a bit… faded, perhaps. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Darl. Feeling "faded" is a perfectly valid way to describe things. It's very common to experience those kinds of changes as we get older. We'll definitely take everything into account. Just to get a more complete picture, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now you’re asking things that are really lost in the fog! Let me see… I had my appendix out, a long, long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, when I was very young, trying to ride a bicycle. A silly thing, really. And… and I think I had the flu, a few times. But major illnesses? Not that I recall. I’ve always been quite strong, you see. I used to work as a… a rigger, it was. Up high on the ships, tying things down. Quite a physical job. But that was… a long time ago now. I’m afraid my memory isn't what it used to be, doctor. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Don’t apologize at all, Darl. It’s perfectly understandable. We’ll work with what you do remember. So, appendix out, broken wrist, and some bouts of the flu. That’s helpful. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my son, of course. He's got a daughter, my granddaughter. Lovely girl. She lives in the city, I don’t see her as much as I’d like. My husband… he passed away many years ago. A good man, he was. We didn’t have any other children. Just the two of us, really. As for illnesses in the family… now that’s another thing I can’t quite grasp. My mother… I think she had something with her heart. But it was a long, long time ago, and I was just a girl. It’s all very hazy, you see. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Darl. You’ve given me a good starting point. It’s helpful to know about your husband and your granddaughter. And knowing your mother had some heart trouble is good information too. Now, just to cover everything, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, yes! The doctor gave me some pills for my… well, for my aches and pains. Little white ones. I take them every morning, I think. Or maybe it's every evening? I can’t quite recall. And… and I have a cream for my skin, it's very dry these days. As for allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to love roses, and I never had any trouble with them. I don't think I’m allergic to anything, dear. But if I suddenly start swelling up, I suppose I'll find out!
DOCTOR: Alright, aches and pains pills, and a cream for dry skin. We'll try to get a better idea of what the aches and pains medication is. It’s good to know you don't think you have any allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of things, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam? Well… alright, dear. If you think it's necessary. I suppose it couldn't hurt. I haven't had one in… goodness, I don't even remember when. Just don't poke too hard, alright? My bones are a bit… fragile these days.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Darl. I'll be very gentle. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, and then just listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also take a quick look in your ears and throat. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning at this point. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s quite faint, and could be normal for someone your age, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackling sounds. Ears are clear. Your throat looks a little dry, but no signs of infection. Everything looks okay there.
PATIENT: Oh… a murmur, you say? Goodness. My husband… he had a murmur too, I think. Is it… bad? I don’t want to be a bother. I just want to know if it’s something I should worry about. And the dry throat… that’s probably just from the air conditioning, isn't it? It’s always so cold in here. I try to drink plenty of water, but I forget sometimes.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned your husband had a murmur as well. Murmurs can be quite common and aren't always a cause for concern. It simply means there's a slight extra sound when your heart beats. However, it’s good to be aware of it, and we'll want to monitor it. You’re right, the dry throat is likely due to the air conditioning. Staying hydrated is very important. Now, just a few more questions. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, chest pain… no, no, not really. A little bit of discomfort sometimes, when I’ve been walking up the stairs, but nothing terrible. Just a bit… tight. Shortness of breath… not unless I’m really rushing, and then it’s probably just my age! And swelling… now that you mention it… my ankles do feel a bit puffy sometimes, especially at the end of the day. But I just thought it was from being on my feet too long, you see. I used to be so active, walking everywhere, but I don’t get out as much now.
DOCTOR: Okay, some chest discomfort with exertion, and occasional ankle swelling. That’s helpful information. Given your age, the murmur, the slight chest discomfort, and the ankle swelling, I think it would be wise to do a few tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would you be comfortable with a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any underlying inflammation?
PATIENT: A blood test… oh dear. I don’t love needles, you see. But if you think it’s important… alright, dear. If it will help me understand what’s going on… then yes, alright. Just… be quick, if you would? And try not to poke too hard. I bruise so easily these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Darl. We’ll be very gentle. And I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is aware of your concerns. It will only be a small sample, and we’ll get it done as quickly and comfortably as possible. I’d also like to order an EKG, which is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It’s painless and non-invasive. Would you be comfortable with that as well?
PATIENT: An… EKG? What does that involve? Does it hurt? I've never had one before, you see. I always try to avoid anything… anything complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be a little apprehensive about new tests. An EKG is very simple, and it doesn’t hurt at all. We'll just place a few small stickers, called electrodes, on your chest, arms, and legs. These electrodes are connected to a machine that records your heart’s electrical activity. It’s completely painless. It takes just a few minutes, and will give us valuable information about how your heart is functioning. Think of it like taking a photograph of your heart’s electrical activity. No poking, no needles, just a quick, painless recording. Would you be willing to try it?
PATIENT: A photograph… that sounds… less scary, I suppose. No needles, you say? And it won’t take long? Alright, dear. If it’s just like taking a photograph… then yes, alright. I’ll try it. But if it feels… strange, you’ll let me know, won't you? I get a bit anxious sometimes, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Darl. I’ll explain everything step-by-step, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. We’ll be right here with you the whole time. Excellent. While we wait for the lab results and the EKG, I’m going to recommend you continue to drink plenty of water and try to elevate your legs whenever possible to help with the swelling. Given your history of chest discomfort and the murmur, I’m also going to write you a prescription for a mild diuretic, which will help your body get rid of excess fluid. It’s a low dose, and we’ll monitor you closely to see how you respond. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A diuretic… that’s a water pill, isn't it? I don’t like taking pills, you see. But if you think it will help… alright, dear. As long as it’s not a strong one. And you’ll explain everything carefully, won't you? What are the side effects? I always worry about side effects. And what if it interacts with the aches and pains pills I’m taking?
DOCTOR: Yes, a diuretic helps your body get rid of extra fluid. It’s a low dose, and it shouldn’t have any significant side effects. The most common side effect is needing to urinate more frequently, which is actually helpful in this case. We'll start with a low dose and monitor you closely. As for interactions with your aches and pains pills, I'll double-check everything in the system to make sure there are no contraindications. To be safe, it would be helpful if you could tell me the name of the aches and pains medication you are taking. Do you happen to have the bottle with you?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, the bottle… let me see. I think I have it somewhere… hmm… oh dear, it’s a bit of a mess in here! Ah, here it is! Yes, here we are. It says… …Paracetamol and Codeine. 500mg/30mg. Is that what you need? I don’t always pay attention to these things, you see. My son usually handles my medications.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Darl. Paracetamol and Codeine… okay. This is important information. Paracetamol is generally safe, but Codeine can interact with some diuretics and may cause some drowsiness. We'll be cautious. I'm going to write you a prescription for the diuretic, and I’ll also recommend you take the lowest effective dose of the Paracetamol and Codeine for the shortest possible time. Given your age and the potential for interactions, I’m also going to recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to see how you’re responding to the medication. We’ll review your lab results, discuss any side effects you may be experiencing, and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds alright, dear. I suppose it’s better to be safe. And you’ll explain everything carefully before I take any new pills, won’t you? I do get confused easily these days. And what about the blood test? How long will that take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. I don’t like waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Darl. I will explain everything step-by-step before you take any new medication, and I’ll make sure you understand all the potential risks and benefits. You can always ask me any questions you have, no matter how small. The blood test results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. I’ll call you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. For now, I'm going to write you the prescriptions for the diuretic, and a referral for the blood test. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… I think that’s all, dear. You’ve been very patient with me and all my… forgetfulness. Thank you. I do feel a little overwhelmed, with all the pills and tests… but I trust you. And I’m glad I came in. Perhaps my son was right, after all, about getting my blood type checked. I suppose it’s always best to be on the safe side. And thank you for explaining everything so carefully. .
