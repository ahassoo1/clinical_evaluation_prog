DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Rannells. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Though, frankly, I’m not entirely sure why I had to come here for this. My nephew, Carlos, he said I needed a… a certification to get something for my nerves. He made it sound quite official. He insisted. It's just… getting older, you know? Things aren’t what they used to be. And frankly, I’d rather not be a bother if it isn't absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like Carlos is looking out for you, and it’s quite thoughtful of him to arrange this appointment. It appears he may be referring to a medical evaluation to determine if medication might be helpful for your nerves – perhaps for some discomfort or anxiety you've been experiencing. We can certainly discuss that, and if it's not necessary, we won't pursue it. To clarify, Ms. Rannells, when you say "things aren’t what they used to be," could you elaborate on what specific changes you've noticed that are concerning you?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's not something I enjoy discussing, honestly. It's just… a general feeling of being unsettled. I used to be able to manage everything – the house, the garden, social engagements – all with a clear head. Now… now I find myself forgetting things. Not important things, mind you, but little things. Where I put my glasses, the name of that nice woman from the church… things like that. And I just don't sleep as soundly. I wake up feeling… jittery. It's not pain, exactly. More like… a constant low-grade agitation. My husband, bless his heart, says I've become a bit… difficult to live with. Though, frankly, he’s always been a bit dramatic.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Rannells. It sounds like you’re experiencing some very common changes that can occur with age, and it’s good that you’re acknowledging them. Forgetting small details and experiencing some sleep disturbance are certainly things we can explore. It's also helpful to know your husband has noticed some changes, as well. To get a better understanding of what's going on, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Oh, heavens. Not really. I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but that’s hardly a condition. And my blood pressure runs a little high, but it’s nothing a bit of sensible diet and exercise can’t manage. My doctor back home – Dr. Alvarez, a perfectly good man – always said I was as healthy as a horse. I was very active, you see. Gardening, mostly. And a good deal of walking. Though, frankly, the heat these days makes that rather difficult. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, quite some time. I don't like to bother them unless absolutely necessary. It's all rather inconvenient, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you were generally healthy and active, Ms. Rannells. It’s also helpful to know you’ve been managing your blood pressure with diet and exercise. And I understand your reluctance to seek medical attention unless truly needed. You mentioned you haven’t been to a doctor in some time. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. Not a single surgery. And I’ve never been inside a hospital, thank goodness. I always took pride in my good health. A strong constitution, my mother always said. She lived to be ninety-two, you know. Ninety-two! And she was gardening right up until the end. Though, to be fair, she was a bit of a stubborn woman. Refused to slow down, even when she probably should have. It's just… things are different now. I feel… fragile, I suppose. Not physically, necessarily, but… mentally. It's difficult to explain. It’s not illness, exactly. It's just… a general feeling of not being right.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Rannells. It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of diminished well-being, and that's certainly valid. It's helpful to hear you describe it as not feeling "right," even if it's not a specific illness. Your mother’s longevity is also good information. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmm. That’s a bit tricky. My mother, as I said, lived to ninety-two. She died peacefully in her sleep, thank goodness. My father… he was a strong man, a fisherman. He died rather suddenly, a heart attack, I believe. He was in his sixties. I have a brother, Ricardo, but we’ve lost touch over the years. We didn’t… part on good terms, shall we say. He was always a bit of a wild one. As for any… hereditary conditions, I don’t really know. Nobody ever talked about such things. It wasn’t considered proper, you know? We just… accepted things as they came. There weren't many… mental health issues in the family, if that’s what you’re asking. Everyone was quite… stoic, really. Determined to get on with things, no matter what.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Rannells. That gives me a good starting point. It sounds like your family had a history of heart health, and a general stoic attitude. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, as I mentioned, I used to be very active. I kept a lovely garden, roses mostly. But the heat, it's been dreadful this summer. I find it difficult to spend much time outdoors these days. I spend most of my time inside, reading, mostly. And watching a bit of television. My husband, Jorge, he likes to watch the news. I find it rather depressing, frankly. We eat fairly well, I suppose. Jorge does most of the cooking. He makes a lovely arroz con pollo. I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And I certainly don't smoke. We used to go out to social events, but… frankly, I haven’t been feeling up to it lately. It’s tiring, you know? And I find myself getting… anxious in crowds. It's all rather unsettling. I used to enjoy socializing, but now… now I prefer the quiet of my own home. It's just… safer, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Rannells. That gives me a good understanding of your current lifestyle. It sounds like you’ve had to adjust your activities due to the heat and some increased anxiety. Now, just one more set of questions before we move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat, and I don’t take many medications. Just a bit of something for my blood pressure, occasionally. Nothing serious. I’ve always prided myself on having a strong constitution, as I mentioned. I’ve never been one to complain, or fuss over minor ailments. I believe in letting nature take its course, you know? And I’ve always been very cautious about trying new things. I prefer to stick to what I know, and what has always worked for me. It's just… sensible, I think. I don't understand why everyone makes such a fuss over allergies these days. It seems to me that people are far too sensitive. Back in my day, we didn’t bother with such things. We just got on with things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Rannells. It’s good to know you don’t have any known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh, dear. Well… I suppose so. I don’t particularly enjoy being poked and prodded, but if it’s necessary… I suppose it’s necessary. Though, frankly, I doubt it will reveal anything. I told you, I’m as healthy as a horse. Still, do what you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle, if you would. And please don’t take too long. I have a rather lovely pot of chamomile tea waiting for me at home.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Rannells. I will be as gentle as possible, and I’ll try not to keep you longer than necessary. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit here and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, this table is rather cold. And I do wish they'd make these sleeves a bit longer. It's terribly drafty. Is there a reason you need to listen to my lungs, Doctor? I haven't had a cough in… oh, goodness, decades. Is something wrong? I do hope it’s nothing serious. I told you, I’m generally very healthy. Perhaps a cup of tea would be more effective than all this… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Rannells. It’s standard procedure to listen to your lungs and heart as part of a routine physical exam, even if you're feeling well. It allows me to establish a baseline and ensures we haven’t overlooked anything. It doesn’t necessarily mean there is something wrong. Your blood pressure is 148/82. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so, and it’s understandable given your recent stress and perhaps a bit of anxiety about the appointment. Pulse is 78 and regular. Okay, I'm listening to your lungs now… They sound clear to me, but I do hear a slight decrease in breath sounds at the bases. This is common in older individuals and isn’t necessarily cause for alarm, but we should keep an eye on it. It could be due to a number of factors, including shallow breathing or decreased lung elasticity.
PATIENT: Decreased lung elasticity? Good heavens. Is that… serious, Doctor? My mother had wonderful lungs. She used to sing in the church choir, you know. A beautiful soprano voice. And she gardened right up until the end. She never had any trouble breathing. Is this something I should be worried about? Perhaps I should just stick to drinking my chamomile tea and getting a good night’s sleep. All this talk of decreased elasticity is rather unsettling. And what about my nerves? Is there anything you can do about that? That’s why I’m here, isn't it? To get something for my nerves. My nephew, Carlos, he said this was the place to come. He said they could… well, he didn't say exactly what they could do, but he said it would help me relax. Is that what this appointment is for, Doctor? Or are we just going to talk about my decreased elasticity?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Rannells. Let’s address your questions one at a time. The slight decrease in breath sounds isn’t necessarily serious, as I mentioned. It’s a common finding in individuals your age, and it often doesn’t require any treatment. It’s simply something we’ll monitor. And yes, you are right to remind me - you came to discuss your nerves and feeling unsettled. I apologize for getting caught up in the physical exam. To help me understand what’s going on with your nerves, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day… well, it’s not very exciting, Doctor. I wake up, usually around seven o’clock, though I don’t sleep very soundly these days. I get up, make a cup of coffee, and have a piece of toast. Then I spend most of the day inside, reading or watching television. My husband, Jorge, he usually does the gardening, though he complains about the heat. We have lunch together, usually something simple, like a sandwich or soup. In the afternoon, I might do a bit of crossword puzzles or listen to the radio. We have dinner together, usually around six o’clock. Then we watch the news, which is rather depressing, and go to bed around ten o’clock. It's all very… routine, Doctor. And lately, I've been feeling more and more… anxious. I worry about things, small things, that I never used to worry about. And I have trouble relaxing. I just can't seem to… switch off. It’s exhausting, Doctor. Absolutely exhausting. And frankly, it’s not the life I envisioned for myself. I used to be so active, so engaged. Now… now I just feel… adrift. Is there anything you can do about that, Doctor? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Rannells. It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant change in your daily life and feeling a sense of loss and anxiety. It’s perfectly understandable to feel that way when routines change and you feel less engaged. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of anxiety and possibly some mild depression. It’s important to remember that these are common conditions, especially as we age, and there are many things we can do to help. Before we discuss treatment options, I'd like to ask you a few more questions. Have you experienced any significant life changes or stressors recently, besides the general change in your routine?
PATIENT: Significant life changes… well, my grandson, Miguel, he moved to California last year for a job. I miss him terribly. We used to see him every weekend. He was such a bright spot in my life. And my daughter, Isabella, she's been having some trouble with her marriage. It’s very upsetting. She won’t tell me the details, but I can tell something is wrong. And, of course, there’s the general state of the world… all the bad news, the political turmoil… it’s all very… overwhelming. But I don’t want to burden you with my problems, Doctor. Everyone has their troubles, don’t they? I suppose I’m just… getting old. And things are changing. And I don’t like it. But I don’t want to complain. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? Do you think… could this marijuana… could it help me feel normal again? That’s why Carlos sent me here, isn’t it? To get something to help me relax and feel less anxious? Is it safe, Doctor? I don’t want to get… addicted or anything. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: It’s not a burden at all, Ms. Rannells. It’s important for me to understand all the factors contributing to how you’re feeling. Losing your grandson’s presence, your daughter’s struggles, and the general state of the world are all significant stressors. Now, let’s address your question about marijuana. In some states, medical marijuana is approved for conditions like anxiety and depression. However, it’s important to understand that it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. It can have both benefits and risks, and it’s not appropriate for everyone. In addition, there's limited research on the long-term effects, especially in older adults. Before we consider medical marijuana, I'd like to explore some other options that are generally considered safer and more effective for managing anxiety and mild depression, particularly in individuals your age. These include talk therapy, lifestyle modifications, and, if necessary, medication. Would you be open to discussing these options with me?
PATIENT: Talk therapy? Oh, dear. I don’t know… I’ve never been one for talking about my feelings. It seems rather… undignified. And frankly, I’m not sure what I would even say. I’ve always been a very private person. And medication… I’ve always avoided taking pills whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, you know? Chamomile tea, a good night’s sleep… things like that. But I must admit, those things aren’t helping much these days. But… if you think it might help, I suppose I could try talk therapy. But I don’t want to be one of those people who spends hours analyzing their childhood. I just want to feel… calmer. Is there a quick fix for this, Doctor? Something that will help me relax and sleep better? I just want to get my life back, you know? Is this marijuana… is it a quick fix? Carlos said it would help me relax. And I trust Carlos. He’s a very sensible young man. I just want to feel normal again, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about talk therapy and medication, Ms. Rannells. It’s perfectly valid to feel that way. And I assure you, talk therapy doesn’t necessarily involve hours of analyzing your childhood. It’s about developing coping mechanisms and learning strategies to manage your anxiety and improve your overall well-being. We can focus on your current concerns and what’s causing you distress. Unfortunately, there isn't a quick fix for anxiety and depression. It takes time and effort to find the right approach. However, there are many effective treatments available. Regarding marijuana, it can provide temporary relief from anxiety, but it also has potential side effects and risks, especially in older adults. It can interact with other medications you may be taking, and it can worsen underlying health conditions. In addition, it’s not a long-term solution and can lead to dependence. Based on what you’ve told me, I recommend starting with talk therapy. I can refer you to a therapist who specializes in working with older adults. We can also explore some lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise and mindfulness techniques. If these approaches aren’t effective, we can discuss medication options. Would you be open to me referring you to a therapist?
PATIENT: A therapist… well… I suppose I could try it. But I don’t want to be one of those people who spends hours crying on a couch. I just want to feel… calmer. And I want someone who understands what I’m going through. Someone who won’t judge me for worrying about silly things. And someone who won’t tell me to analyze my childhood. I just want a quick fix, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? But… if you think it might help… I suppose I could try talk therapy. But I want a guarantee. I want to know it will work. And I want it to be quick. And I want it to be discreet. I don’t want anyone knowing I’m seeing a therapist. I just want to feel normal again, Doctor. Please. Can you find me a therapist who can guarantee that? And who is discreet? And who won’t tell me to analyze my childhood? And who can help me quickly? And who understands what it’s like to be an old woman worrying about silly things? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick and guaranteed solution, Ms. Rannells. And I wish I could offer you that. Unfortunately, therapy doesn't work that way. It’s a collaborative process, and its effectiveness depends on many factors, including your willingness to participate and the rapport you have with your therapist. There are no guarantees, and it takes time and effort to see results. However, I can assure you that I will do my best to find a therapist who is a good fit for you. I’ll look for someone who specializes in working with older adults and who has experience treating anxiety and mild depression. I’ll also make sure they are discreet and respectful of your privacy. I can’t guarantee they won’t ask about your childhood, but I can ask them to focus on your current concerns and what’s causing you distress. I can also emphasize your desire for a practical and solution-focused approach. Would you like me to proceed with finding a therapist for you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Find me a therapist. But if it doesn't work… if it doesn't help me feel calmer… I’m blaming you, Doctor. You promised you’d find someone good. And if they start asking about my childhood, I’m walking out. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask? And make sure they’re discreet. I don't want anyone knowing I'm seeing a therapist. This is embarrassing enough as it is. And make sure they’re… you know… nice. I don't want someone who’s going to judge me. Just someone who can help me feel calmer. And who won’t ask about my childhood. Please, Doctor. Just find me someone good. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Ms. Rannells. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to find a therapist who is a good fit for you. I'll prioritize finding someone who specializes in working with older adults, who is discreet, who has a compassionate approach, and who is solution-focused. I have a list of several therapists in the area who meet those criteria. I'll review their profiles and contact a few to see if they have availability. I’ll also ask them about their experience and approach to ensure they are a good match for your needs. I'll need your insurance information if you have it, but you mentioned earlier you were uninsured, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. No insurance. Never really needed it before. Always been healthy as a horse, you know? But… well, things are different now. So… I suppose I’ll have to pay out of pocket. How much does therapy cost? And… can you recommend someone who offers a… sliding scale? I don’t want to spend a fortune on this. Just… help me feel calmer, Doctor. That’s all I ask. Is there anything else I need to do? Any forms I need to fill out? And… what if I don't like the therapist? Can I switch to someone else? I just… I’m nervous, Doctor. Very nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Rannells. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when trying something new. Many therapists do offer a sliding scale based on income, which could help reduce the cost. I’ll be sure to check for therapists in the area who offer that option. The typical cost of a therapy session without insurance ranges from $100 to $200 per session, but it varies depending on the therapist’s experience and location. I’ll also gather information about any therapists who accept payment plans. And yes, you absolutely can switch to another therapist if you don’t feel comfortable with the first one. It’s important to find someone you trust and feel safe with. I do have a brief intake form I'd like you to fill out. It will ask about your medical history, current concerns, and what you’re hoping to achieve in therapy. It’s just a standard form to help the therapist get a better understanding of your needs. Here you go. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions. And don’t worry, we’ll find someone who is a good fit for you.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is a lot of questions. I haven't thought about some of these things in… decades. And I’m not sure I remember all the details. But… I suppose I should try. I just want to feel normal again. This is… rather personal, Doctor. I hope this therapist is discreet. And I hope they don’t ask too many questions about my childhood. And I hope they can help me feel calmer. Is there anything else I need to do? Any other forms I need to fill out? And… how long will it take to find a therapist? I just want to start feeling better. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to help me relax? I just… I’m nervous, Doctor. Very nervous. Perhaps a cup of chamomile tea would help.
DOCTOR: It is a rather detailed form, Ms. Rannells. I apologize for that. It’s just to help the therapist get a comprehensive understanding of your needs and concerns. Take your time, and only answer what you feel comfortable with. There are no other forms I need you to fill out at this time. I'll review the information you provide and start contacting therapists in the area. It may take a few days to find someone with availability and who is a good fit for your needs. In the meantime, a cup of chamomile tea is an excellent idea. Other relaxation techniques that may help include deep breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, and gentle exercise. You could also try listening to calming music or spending time in nature. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious. I'm here to support you through this process. Take your time with the form, Ms. Rannells. And remember, you’re taking a positive step towards feeling better.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I think I’ve finished. It’s not perfect, but… it’s the best I can do. I skipped a few questions, but… I wasn’t comfortable answering them. I hope that’s alright. And I hope you can still find a therapist for me. I just want to feel normal again. Will you call me if you find someone? And… how much will it cost? And… will they judge me? I just… I’m nervous, Doctor. Very nervous. Perhaps a cup of chamomile tea would help. Is there anything else I need to do? Anything else I need to know? I just… I’m nervous, Doctor. Very nervous. Perhaps a cup of chamomile tea would help.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Rannells. This is perfectly fine. It’s perfectly alright that you skipped a few questions. You only need to share what you feel comfortable with. I will review this carefully and start contacting therapists in the area who might be a good fit for you. I’ll prioritize those who offer a sliding scale, and I’ll make sure they have experience working with older adults. I’ll also ask them about their approach to ensure they’re compassionate and non-judgmental. I will definitely call you if I find someone. I'll let you know their rates and qualifications before scheduling any appointments. The cost of therapy can vary, but I’ll do my best to find someone who is affordable. And please, don’t worry about being judged. A good therapist will create a safe and supportive environment where you can share your thoughts and feelings without fear of criticism. For now, there’s nothing else you need to do. Just relax and take care of yourself. And yes, a cup of chamomile tea would certainly help. I’ll be in touch soon, Ms. Rannells. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the meantime. You’ve taken a big step today.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that means a lot. I just… I just want to feel normal again. Alright then. I think… I think I’ll be going now. I have a cup of chamomile tea waiting for me at home. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I just… I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Rannells. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you all the best, and I’ll be in touch soon. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Goodbye, Ms. Rannells. And please, do enjoy your chamomile tea.
