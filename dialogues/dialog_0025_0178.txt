DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Mr. Pithan. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a cough. Been on me for a while now, and I get tired easy. Plus, my sinuses feel all plugged up a lot. It’s just… wearing me down, you know?
DOCTOR: A cough, fatigue, and sinus congestion… alright. “A while now” is rather vague, Mr. Pithan. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… maybe six, seven months? Started kinda slow, just a tickle in my throat now and then. But the last three months it's gotten worse, especially this past month. Feels like it just won’t go away. Honestly, I don’t keep real good track of dates, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Six to seven months… alright. And you said fatigue as well. Is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly constant, I guess. Not like I can't do things, but I get wore out quicker. Used to be able to work a full day no problem, now I gotta take more breaks. And at night, I’m just… wiped out. Even getting up in the mornings is a struggle sometimes. I just feel… heavy, you know?
DOCTOR: "Heavy"... I understand. And is this cough productive?
PATIENT: Productive? You mean… do I cough stuff up? Yeah, I do. Mostly in the mornings, and sometimes when I lie down. It's… thick, yellowish stuff. Sorry if that's… gross.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Mr. Pithan. That is important information. And how about fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t had a fever that I noticed. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothing I’d call a fever. No chills, and definitely no night sweats. I do get a headache with the sinus stuff sometimes, though. A dull ache right across my forehead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Headache with sinus congestion. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never been told I had anything like that. I see a doctor when I need to, you know? Usually just for a cold or something. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I’ve had a few… bad colds over the years, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can. Not a fan.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my mother… she had some trouble with her lungs when she got older. Couldn't breathe too good, needed oxygen sometimes. But that was a long time ago. And my father… he was healthy as a horse, lived to be ninety. Other than that, don't really know much about their health history, to be honest. We weren’t real close.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. Not a smoker, never been one. I don’t care for the smell of it, honestly. Bad for you, you know?
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Not really. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. Don't drink much, if anything. It just doesn't appeal to me. I prefer water.
DOCTOR: And finally, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I haven't had to take much medicine, so I haven't had a chance to be allergic to anything. Honestly, Doctor, is this gonna take much longer? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Just a few more questions, Mr. Pithan. It’s important to get a complete picture. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs, check your sinuses, and take your temperature. If you’ll just sit back…
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. I'm ready. Hurry it up, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath… and exhale. Another one… Good. Lungs sound… somewhat congested, but no wheezing. Sinuses are tender to the touch. Temperature is 99.2 Fahrenheit. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 78. Not much to note, honestly. It could be a lingering upper respiratory infection, but given the length of time, we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: So what possibilities are you talkin' about? I just want this cough to go away. Is it somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Pithan, it’s premature to say anything is “serious.” But a cough lasting six months, with fatigue and sinus congestion, could indicate several things. It could be bronchitis, pneumonia, or even… less common issues. To be thorough, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. And, frankly, given your age, a sputum culture to check for any unusual bacteria or fungi. This will help me determine the exact cause and formulate an appropriate treatment plan. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests. Look, I ain’t a fan of all this pokin’ and proddin’. Is it really necessary? I just wanna get somethin’ for the cough. Can’t you just give me somethin’ for the cough and see if that helps? I don’t like the sound of all this other stuff.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pithan, prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis is… irresponsible. It’s like throwing darts in the dark. While I understand your reluctance, I have a professional obligation to ensure we address the root cause of your symptoms. Given your age and the persistence of your cough, we need to rule out anything serious. If you refuse the tests, I can prescribe a cough suppressant, but I strongly advise against it. It will only mask the symptoms, and potentially delay a proper diagnosis. It is your decision, of course, but I strongly recommend you reconsider.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Do your tests. Just… hurry it up. I got things to do, remember? But I'm tellin' ya, it's probably just a bad cold. A long bad cold.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll put in the orders for a chest X-ray and a complete blood count and sputum culture. The lab technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I’ll prescribe a mild cough suppressant to help alleviate your symptoms. It won’t cure anything, but it may provide some relief. Please take as directed. And if your symptoms worsen—particularly if you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain—go to the emergency room immediately. Here’s the prescription. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… when will I get the results? I just want this over with. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: The results typically take 24 to 48 hours. The lab will contact you directly once they're available. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today, or are we finished?
PATIENT: No, that’s it. I’m done. Thanks, I guess. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Pithan. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if your condition changes. .
