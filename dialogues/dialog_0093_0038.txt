DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I… I’m not entirely certain why I scheduled this appointment. Something about… planning for the future, I believe? My ex-husband mentioned something about forms, should… things happen. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. I understand it has something to do with making sure my wishes are known if I can’t express them myself? Perhaps an Advance Directive, or a POLST form, as he called it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds like you may have scheduled an appointment to discuss advance care planning. It’s very prudent to consider these matters, Ms. Buoniconti, and quite responsible of you – and your ex-husband – to prompt this discussion. We can certainly address both Advance Directives and POLST forms today, and determine which, if either, are appropriate for you. To begin, perhaps you could tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… That’s… a difficult question. I don’t have any major illnesses, as far as I’m aware. I work as an etcher, so I spend a lot of time sitting, which isn’t ideal. I try to eat reasonably well, though I admit my diet could be better. I have private insurance, so I see a doctor when I need to. Honestly, I haven’t been to a doctor in quite a while, unless it was an emergency. I’m… fairly thin, if that’s relevant. I’m quite tall, which sometimes causes aches and pains. But truly, nothing specific comes to mind. Is there something particular I should be mentioning?
DOCTOR: No, that’s a very helpful overview, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s good to hear you don’t have any major illnesses and have insurance coverage. The fact that you're tall and spend a lot of time sitting is relevant, as that can certainly contribute to musculoskeletal issues. Let's delve a little deeper. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… Let me see. I don’t think so. I’ve never been told I have diabetes, or anything like that. I’ve had my blood pressure checked at various appointments, and it was always… normal, I believe. Though again, my memory is rather spotty. My ex-husband always handled the details of my healthcare, so I often wasn’t privy to the specifics. I recall one instance, years ago, where the doctor mentioned something about slightly elevated cholesterol, but it wasn’t considered serious enough to require medication. Is that relevant? Perhaps I should have kept better records. I apologize for being so vague. It's frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: Please don't apologize, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly alright. Many patients find it difficult to recall details of past medical history, and it's quite common for a family member to manage those details. The slightly elevated cholesterol is good information to have, thank you. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I believe I had my tonsils removed when I was a child. That’s the only surgery I’m certain of. As for hospitalizations… I broke my arm once, when I was quite young, and spent a night in the hospital, I think. It was a rather silly accident involving a tree and a rather ambitious climb. Other than that… no, I don’t believe I’ve been hospitalized. I’ve always been fortunate enough to avoid serious injuries or illnesses, thankfully. Is that… sufficient information? I feel as though I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Buoniconti. Tonsillectomy as a child and a broken arm – that provides a good foundation. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. My family is… rather dispersed. I grew up in Mongolia, and communication has always been challenging. I know my grandmother, on my mother’s side, passed away at an older age, but I don’t know the cause. My father’s side… I barely knew them. He rarely spoke of his family. I believe there was a history of… lung problems, perhaps? Something to do with the dust and climate where they lived. But I’m honestly just guessing now. I wish I had more concrete information to offer. It’s terribly frustrating, I know. Is this… helpful at all? I feel as though I’m failing miserably at this.
DOCTOR: You are not failing at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly understandable that you don't have detailed family history, especially given the circumstances you've described. It's quite common, and we can proceed without it. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke, drink, or… recreational drugs? No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I find that… rather distasteful, to be frank. I’ve always been very focused on my work. Etching requires a steady hand and a clear mind, and those things do not pair well with such… habits. I occasionally enjoy a cup of tea, but that’s the extent of my indulgences. I lead a rather quiet life, mostly. Is that… satisfactory? I hope I’m not being overly… judgmental. It’s just… not my lifestyle.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly satisfactory, Ms. Buoniconti. It's good to know you don't smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs. That's very positive for your overall health. Finally, let's discuss any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: Allergies… That’s another tricky one. I don’t believe I have any significant allergies. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything. I might get a bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I recall a slight rash once, years ago, after using a particular brand of etching acid, but it might have been a chemical irritation rather than a true allergy. I don’t recall any food allergies. I eat a fairly varied diet, and I’ve never had any adverse reactions. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies to report. Though, again, my memory… perhaps I’m overlooking something. It's quite frustrating, honestly. I wish I were more helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly alright that you're unsure of some details. We’ve gathered a good amount of information. Now, given that you came in to discuss advance care planning, let's talk about what that entails. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and I haven't required any regular medication. I did take some pain relievers a few months ago for a backache, over-the-counter ibuprofen, but that was a one-time thing. I don't take anything on a daily basis. Is that… all you needed to know? It feels as though we’ve been circling around this topic for quite some time. Perhaps I should have prepared a list. I apologize for my disorganization.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Ms. Buoniconti. It's very helpful to know you're not currently taking any regular medications. Now, with a good understanding of your medical history, let's move onto a physical exam. This will allow me to assess your overall health and identify any potential concerns. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam seems prudent, given the circumstances. Though, I must confess, I do get a bit… anxious during medical examinations. It’s a silly habit, I suppose, stemming from childhood experiences. But please, proceed. I trust your expertise. I suppose it's best to get everything checked, even if I feel relatively healthy. Where shall we begin?
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s quite common to feel anxious during medical examinations, and we can take things at your own pace. We’ll start with your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Blood pressure is 120 over 80. Normal. Pulse is 72 and regular. Respiration is 16. And temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: There you go… Is everything alright, Doctor? I feel a bit… exposed, if I’m being honest. It’s a strange sensation, having someone listen to my… insides. But please, continue. I’m trying to remain calm. It’s just… unsettling, that’s all. I trust your judgment, of course. I simply… prefer to be prepared for what’s happening. Is there anything I should be expecting? Perhaps I should have brought a book. Or a… distraction. I apologize for my nervousness. It's quite silly, I know.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Everything sounds good so far, Ms. Buoniconti. You’re doing very well. No need to apologize for your nervousness – it’s perfectly normal. Now, I'd like to examine your abdomen. Please lie back, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. I’ll be gently pressing on different areas of your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall remain as still as possible. Though, I do have a rather sensitive stomach, so please be gentle. And if I wince or make a sound, it doesn’t necessarily indicate serious pain. It’s simply… a quirk of my constitution. I’ve always been prone to digestive issues. But please, proceed. I’m trusting your expertise. I simply… prefer to be informed of what’s happening. Is there anything I should be expecting? Perhaps a cold stethoscope? Or… pressure? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply a habit. A nervous habit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m starting in the upper right quadrant. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Your abdomen is soft and non-distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. No masses palpated. Everything feels normal so far. A little sensitivity is perfectly alright, but no cause for concern at this time. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’ll need you to bend your knees and relax your legs.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall attempt to remain as still as possible. Though, I must confess, my reflexes are… unpredictable. Sometimes they’re quite strong, and sometimes they’re… lacking. It’s another one of my peculiar quirks. I’ve never been particularly athletic, so I suspect that’s the cause. But please, proceed. I’m trusting your judgment. Is there anything I should be expecting? Perhaps a tapping sound? Or… a sudden jolt? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply a nervous habit. A very silly habit, I suppose. But I do prefer to be prepared for what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Buoniconti. Just relax. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Now, let’s check your sensory function. I’m going to lightly touch different parts of your arms and legs with this cotton ball. Just tell me when you feel it.
PATIENT: Yes… I feel it now. And… yes, here as well. And… faintly here. Is that… satisfactory, Doctor? My skin is… rather sensitive, so the sensations can be… subtle. I apologize if I’m being difficult. I simply prefer to be precise. Is there anything I should be expecting? Perhaps a cool sensation? Or… a tingling feeling? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply a nervous habit. A very silly habit, I suppose. But I do prefer to be informed of what’s happening. I trust your judgment, of course. But I do prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Ms. Buoniconti. Your sensory function appears intact. Everything is as expected. Alright, Ms. Buoniconti. That completes the physical examination. Overall, you appear to be in good health. No significant abnormalities detected. Now, let’s discuss your advance care planning. Do you have any thoughts on who you would like to designate as your healthcare proxy, should you become unable to make decisions for yourself?
PATIENT: That’s… a relief to hear, Doctor. Thank you. As for a healthcare proxy… that's… a difficult question. My ex-husband and I are… not on the best of terms. And I don't have any close family members nearby. I do have a… colleague, Mr. Chen. He's a fellow etcher, and a very reliable man. But I haven't discussed this with him. He might be… surprised. And I haven't considered the legal implications. It's all rather overwhelming, to be honest. Perhaps I should consult with a lawyer. Or… simply avoid the topic altogether. It's a bit… morbid, isn't it? Planning for the inevitable. I apologize for my indecision. It's simply… a difficult topic. Do you have any recommendations? Perhaps a form I could review? Or… a checklist? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply a nervous habit. A very silly habit, I suppose. But I do prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not being indecisive at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. It is a difficult topic. Consulting with a lawyer is an excellent idea, and I can provide you with some recommendations if you'd like. In the meantime, I can give you some information about advance directives and POLST forms, and we can discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each. This brochure provides a good overview of advance care planning. It outlines the different types of advance directives, explains the role of a healthcare proxy, and provides information about POLST forms. We can go through it together if you'd like, and I can answer any questions you have. Perhaps we can start by discussing what’s important to you, Ms. Buoniconti. What are your values and beliefs regarding medical treatment?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Values and beliefs… That’s… a rather philosophical question, isn’t it? I suppose… I value independence above all else. And I believe in… dignity. I don’t want to be kept alive artificially if there’s no hope of recovery. I don’t want to be a burden on others. And I want to be treated with respect, even if I’m… incapacitated. I suppose… quality of life is more important than quantity. I don’t want to be sustained by machines if there’s no possibility of regaining my… faculties. I suppose… that’s my philosophy, in a nutshell. It's rather simple, isn't it? I apologize for my rambling. It's simply… a difficult topic. Is there a form that reflects these values? Perhaps a checklist? Or… a questionnaire? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply a nervous habit. A very silly habit, I suppose. But I do prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That's not rambling at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It's incredibly insightful, and it's very helpful to understand your values. Based on what you’ve told me, a living will would likely be the most appropriate advance directive for you. It allows you to specify the types of medical treatment you would want or refuse in the event you become unable to communicate your wishes. This is a sample living will form. It covers a range of medical scenarios, including life-sustaining treatment, pain management, and end-of-life care. You can fill it out at your own pace, and we can review it together to ensure it accurately reflects your wishes. Would you like me to walk you through some of the sections?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Walking me through it would be… immensely helpful. The sheer volume of information is… rather daunting. I suppose… I’m particularly concerned about life-sustaining treatment. I definitely don’t want to be kept alive artificially if there’s no hope of recovery. But I’m unsure about the specifics. What does “mechanical ventilation” entail, exactly? And what is “artificial nutrition and hydration”? I suppose… I’m also concerned about pain management. I want to be comfortable, but I don’t want to be… incapacitated. It’s a delicate balance, isn’t it? I suppose… I’m also concerned about… well, everything, really. I apologize for my indecision. It’s simply… a difficult topic. Is there a glossary of terms? Perhaps a checklist? Or… a simplified version? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply a nervous habit. A very silly habit, I suppose. But I do prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not being indecisive at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Let’s break it down. Mechanical ventilation is a machine that helps you breathe if you're unable to do so on your own. It involves inserting a tube into your airway and using a respirator to deliver air to your lungs. Artificial nutrition and hydration involves providing you with fluids and nutrients through an IV or feeding tube if you're unable to eat or drink. As for pain management, you have the right to refuse any treatment, including pain medication. However, we would do everything we can to ensure you're comfortable, and we would respect your wishes regarding the level of pain relief you desire. Here's a glossary of terms, and a list of frequently asked questions. We can go through them together, or you can review them at your own pace. Perhaps we can start by discussing your wishes regarding mechanical ventilation. Would you like to be placed on a ventilator if you were unable to breathe on your own, even if there was a chance of recovery?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. No… I definitely wouldn’t want to be placed on a ventilator if there was no hope of recovery. If there was a chance of regaining my faculties, perhaps… but if it was clear that there was no hope, I wouldn’t want to prolong my life artificially. I wouldn’t want to be… trapped. I wouldn’t want to be a burden on others. I wouldn’t want to be… reduced to a machine. I suppose… that’s my wish. But what constitutes “no hope”? Who makes that determination? And what if my wishes are… unclear? What if I’m unable to communicate my wishes at the time? It’s a slippery slope, isn’t it? I suppose… I need more information. Is there a checklist? Perhaps a simplified version? Or… a flowchart? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply a nervous habit. A very silly habit, I suppose. But I do prefer to be prepared. Perhaps I should consult with a lawyer. It’s all rather overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You’re asking very important questions, Ms. Buoniconti. It is overwhelming, and it's good you're thinking through these scenarios. The determination of “no hope” is typically made by your medical team, in consultation with your healthcare proxy, if you have designated one. They would consider your overall medical condition, your prognosis, and your wishes, as expressed in your advance directive. That's why it's so important to designate a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you're unable to do so yourself. They would be responsible for communicating your wishes to your medical team and ensuring they are respected. As for your questions about clarity, you can be as specific as you want in your advance directive. You can outline the specific scenarios in which you would want or refuse certain treatments. And you can also designate a backup healthcare proxy, in case your primary proxy is unable to fulfill their duties. Here are some advance directive templates, which may help you organize your thoughts. We can go through them together, or you can review them at your own pace. And if you'd like, I can provide you with some referrals to lawyers who specialize in estate planning. We can take our time, Ms. Buoniconti. There's no rush.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… reassuring to hear. Perhaps… perhaps I should start with the checklist. And then… then I’ll review the templates. And then… then I’ll consider consulting with a lawyer. It’s a daunting task, but… but it’s important. I want to be prepared. I want to ensure my wishes are respected. And… and perhaps I should designate Mr. Chen as my healthcare proxy. He’s a reliable man. And he’s… he’s understanding. But I need to discuss it with him first. It’s a delicate conversation. Where do we begin? What’s the first question? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply a nervous habit. A very silly habit, I suppose. But I do prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not being silly at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly natural to feel nervous, and I'm here to help you every step of the way. And Mr. Chen sounds like an excellent choice for your healthcare proxy. It’s wonderful that you have someone you trust. Alright, let’s begin. The first question is: “Do you want to be resuscitated if your heart stops beating?
PATIENT: No… I do not want to be resuscitated if my heart stops beating. If there is no hope of recovery, I would prefer… a natural death. I do not want to be kept alive artificially. I do not want to be subjected to… painful procedures. I do not want to be… a burden. But… what constitutes “no hope”? And who makes that determination? And what if I change my mind? And what if I’m unable to communicate my wishes at the time? It’s a slippery slope, isn’t it? What’s the next question? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply a nervous habit. A very silly habit, I suppose. But I do prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're asking very important questions, Ms. Buoniconti. It is complex. "No hope" typically means that your condition is irreversible and that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The determination is made by your medical team, in consultation with your healthcare proxy, if you have designated one. They would consider your overall medical condition, your prognosis, and your wishes, as expressed in your advance directive. And you can always change your mind. Your advance directive is not set in stone. You can modify it at any time, as long as you are mentally competent. And if you are unable to communicate your wishes at the time, your healthcare proxy would make decisions based on their best understanding of your values and beliefs. Alright, let's move on. The next question is: "Do you want to be placed on a mechanical ventilator if you are unable to breathe on your own?
PATIENT: No… I do not want to be placed on a mechanical ventilator if I am unable to breathe on my own. I would prefer… a natural death. I do not want to be kept alive artificially. I do not want to be subjected to… painful procedures. I do not want to be… a burden. But… what if I change my mind? And what if I’m in pain? And what if I’m unable to communicate my wishes at the time? It’s a slippery slope, isn’t it? And what if my healthcare proxy disagrees with my wishes? What’s the next question? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply a nervous habit. A very silly habit, I suppose. But I do prefer to be prepared. Perhaps I should consult with a lawyer. It’s all rather overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Ms. Buoniconti. It is overwhelming. And it's perfectly natural to have these questions. Your healthcare proxy has a legal responsibility to respect your wishes. If they disagree with your wishes, they would be required to follow the instructions outlined in your advance directive. And if they are unable to do so, they would be required to seek guidance from a court of law. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, though. We’ll take things one step at a time. And I’m here to answer any questions you have. Alright, let’s move on. The next question is: "Do you want to receive artificial nutrition and hydration if you are unable to eat or drink?
PATIENT: No… I do not want to receive artificial nutrition and hydration if I am unable to eat or drink. I would prefer… a natural death. I do not want to be kept alive artificially. I do not want to be subjected to… painful procedures. I do not want to be… a burden. But… what if I’m in pain? And what if I’m dehydrated? And what if I change my mind? And what if my healthcare proxy disagrees with my wishes? It’s a slippery slope, isn’t it? What’s the next question? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply a nervous habit. A very silly habit, I suppose. But I do prefer to be prepared. Perhaps I should consult with a lawyer. It’s all rather overwhelming. And frankly, it’s quite depressing.
DOCTOR: It is overwhelming, Ms. Buoniconti, and it's perfectly alright to feel depressed. These are difficult questions, and it's natural to feel a range of emotions. It's brave of you to confront them head-on. We can take a break if you’d like. Or we can slow down and review some of the previous questions. It's important that you feel comfortable and informed. The next question is: "Do you want to receive pain medication, even if it may shorten your life?
PATIENT: Yes… I want to receive pain medication, even if it may shorten my life. I want to be comfortable. I do not want to suffer. I do not want to be in pain. But… what if it becomes addictive? And what if it impairs my judgment? And what if it interacts with other medications? And what if my healthcare proxy disagrees with my wishes? It’s a slippery slope, isn’t it? Is that… is that the end of the checklist? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply a nervous habit. A very silly habit, I suppose. But I do prefer to be prepared. Perhaps I should consult with a lawyer. It’s all rather overwhelming. And frankly, I’m quite tired. I think… I think I need a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Yes, that was the final question on the checklist. You’ve done a wonderful job confronting these difficult issues, Ms. Buoniconti. And it's perfectly alright to feel tired. I can certainly arrange a cup of tea for you. And I would highly recommend consulting with a lawyer who specializes in estate planning. They can help you formalize your wishes and ensure they are legally binding. We can also discuss designating a healthcare proxy if you haven't already done so. And if you'd like, I can provide you with some referrals to qualified attorneys. For now, let’s just focus on getting you that cup of tea. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. You’ve done a brave thing today, Ms. Buoniconti.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. A cup of tea would be… lovely. And yes, perhaps I should consult with a lawyer. And I think… I think Mr. Chen would be a suitable healthcare proxy. He’s a reliable man. Thank you for your patience, Doctor. And thank you for your kindness. I think… I think I need a moment to collect my thoughts. Perhaps I’ll just sit here for a while. And enjoy the tea. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Buoniconti. Take all the time you need. I’ll have the tea brought to you shortly. And please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you need anything at all. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care.
