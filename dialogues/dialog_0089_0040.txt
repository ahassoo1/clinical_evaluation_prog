DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been getting in my side, lower down… on both sides, really. And I seem to be getting infections a lot lately. It’s been going on for a while now, and it’s… well, it’s a bit bothersome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a bit bothersome” is good to know. Both sides, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, both sides, Doctor. Not all the time, you understand. It comes and goes. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache… like a heavy feeling, if that makes sense. Sometimes it’s worse than others. And then there’s the… the waterworks trouble. Frequent, you see. And burning.
DOCTOR: Right, a dull ache, comes and goes, worse at times, and now some issues with urination - frequent and burning. Okay. Let's try to get a clearer picture. When did this pain start initially?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… let me think. It's hard to say exactly… years, really. Perhaps… five years ago? Maybe a little longer? It started very mild, I barely noticed it at first. I thought it was just getting old, you know? It’s gradually gotten worse, though. It wasn’t constant then, just… now and again. The trouble with the waterworks is more recent… the last year or so, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so five years of intermittent pain, gradually worsening, and about a year of urinary issues. Can you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a twisting pain, or a stabbing pain. More… like a full feeling, Doctor. Like something is pressing on me. It feels deep inside, not just on the skin. And sometimes, it sort of radiates around my back, you know? It’s hard to explain. It's just… uncomfortable. I find myself shifting around a lot trying to get comfortable. And when I lie down, it can be better. But not always.
DOCTOR: Alright, a deep, full feeling, radiates to the back, relieved somewhat by lying down. Now, about this frequent urination and burning… is there any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t noticed any blood. It's just… well, it's uncomfortable. And I have to go quite often, especially at night. It wakes me up. And sometimes it feels like I haven’t emptied my bladder completely, even after I’ve just been. It’s just… annoying, really. And a little worrying. I wouldn’t say it’s painful exactly, but it stings a bit when I go.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood in the urine, frequency, especially at night, incomplete emptying, and stinging sensation. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever or chills. And thankfully, no nausea or vomiting either. Just the discomfort, the pain, and the trouble with the waterworks. I have been feeling a little tired lately, now that you mention it, but I put that down to getting older. It’s hard to keep up with everything these days! But no… no fever, no sickness.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting, just fatigue. Now, have you had any recent infections?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I’ve had a couple of water infections, like I said. In the last six months, I think. The doctor prescribed me some pills… antibiotics, I believe. They cleared it up each time, but they keep coming back. That’s why I’m a bit worried, you see. I don’t want to keep taking pills all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, recurrent urinary tract infections in the last six months, treated with antibiotics. Now, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… no, Doctor. Not anymore. I’ve been single for quite a long time now. So, no, not sexually active. I hope you don’t mind me saying. It’s just… a fact. I’m an old man, you know? Not much of that going on these days.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Espinueva. I appreciate your honesty. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… the doctor told me, years ago, that my kidneys weren't working perfectly. Something about lots of little… sacs, he called them. Polycystic something, I think. Polycystic Kidney Disease, that was it! He said it wasn't too serious at the time, just something to keep an eye on. I've been to see him a few times over the years for check-ups, but… well, it's been a while since my last proper visit. That's probably why I didn't mention it right away. It’s all a bit muddled in my head, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Polycystic Kidney Disease… okay, that's very important. And any surgeries, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no surgeries. Never had any. Just the usual… a tonsillectomy when I was a boy, I suppose. Nothing major. Nothing recent, certainly. I've been quite lucky, really. Apart from this kidney business, I've always been fairly healthy. I try to eat well, and I get a bit of exercise when I can, although these aches and pains make it harder these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries except for a tonsillectomy in childhood. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Ah, family. My wife passed away some years ago, bless her soul. I have two children, a son and a daughter. They both live overseas now, so I don't see them very often. As for medical history... my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… well, he had some sort of trouble with his kidneys too, now that you mention it. Not sure exactly what, but I remember him being unwell in his later years. It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. I wasn't very good at remembering these things, even when I was younger.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure in your mother and kidney problems in your father. Now, let's talk about your daily habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don't drink alcohol either. Never had much of a head for it, and my wife didn't approve. And as for recreational drugs… good heavens, no! I’m an old man, a churchgoer, you know. I live a quiet life. Just tea and biscuits, and a bit of gardening when the weather is nice. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or drugs. Finally, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to any pills I’ve been given in the past. Sometimes I get a bit of indigestion, but that’s probably just my age. I don’t have any known allergies, thankfully. I'm quite careful with what I eat, though. You can't be too careful these days, you know. Is that everything? I hope I haven't forgotten anything important. It's all a bit of a blur, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Espinueva, that’s very helpful. Thank you for all of that information. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can we start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Blood pressure, you say? Fine with me. I’ll just sit here, shall I? I do hope it’s not too high… I get a bit nervous at doctors, you know. But go ahead, please. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva, your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/92. Your heart sounds are normal, but I can hear some slight crackling in your lungs when you take a deep breath. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can feel a little… discomfort on my left side, right down there. It’s not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. And a bit tender, as you say. It’s been like that for a while now, on and off. Sometimes it's worse than others. And it does feel a bit full, if that makes sense? Not painful, just… uncomfortable. Is that what you're feeling?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do feel some fullness and tenderness on the left side. Now, I’m going to check your back. Please lie on your stomach for me.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Lie on my stomach, you say? That's no problem at all. Though I'm not as nimble as I used to be… Just let me know if I need to move or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva, there is some tenderness on your lower back on the left side, similar to the abdomen. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes and sensation.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Alright, reflexes, you say? I’ll just try and relax, shall I? I always worry about these things… never been very good with tests, you know. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva, your reflexes and sensation are normal. Based on everything you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’m concerned about a few things. Your history of Polycystic Kidney Disease, the recurrent UTIs, the pain in your side, and the tenderness on your abdomen and back are all concerning. The slightly elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. I’d like to order some tests. Firstly, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function, and a urinalysis to check for infection and blood. I also want to get a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better look at your kidneys and other organs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. A CT scan, you say? It all sounds a bit frightening, to be honest, but if that's what you think is best, then yes, alright. I trust your judgement. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, urinalysis… and a CT scan. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. Just let me know how to arrange it all. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the CT scan? And… what are you hoping to find out?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. The CT scan will require you to drink a contrast dye, which helps us get a clearer picture of your organs. You'll need to be well-hydrated before the scan, so drink plenty of water in the next 24 hours. We will also need to know if you have any allergies, especially to iodine, as the dye contains iodine. As for what we’re looking for, we want to assess the size and health of your kidneys, rule out any blockages in your urinary tract, and see if there’s any evidence of infection. It’s also possible the scan might show other underlying issues causing your pain. I’m also going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics while we wait for the test results, just to address the potential UTI. I’ll write you a referral for the scan and the prescriptions now. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Iodine… hmmm, I don’t think I’m allergic, but my wife always did the shopping, so I wouldn’t be entirely sure. I’ll have to check with my daughter, she might remember. And plenty of water, you say? Alright, I can do that. It's good to know we're looking for blockages… that sounds a bit worrying. And antibiotics, just in case? That sounds sensible. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now, Doctor. Just… thank you. Thank you for listening to me, and for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It's a bit overwhelming, but I feel better knowing we're doing something about it. Will someone contact me to arrange the scan?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It’s my pleasure. The receptionist will contact you to schedule the CT scan, and they will also remind you about the hydration requirements and ask about any allergies. I'll also have them send a copy of my notes and the referrals to your primary care physician. If you experience any fever, chills, worsening pain, or difficulty urinating before the scan, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll see you back in a week to discuss the results, okay?
PATIENT: Alright, a week from now. And to contact the receptionist, yes. And go to the emergency room if things get worse. I’ll remember that. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll see you next week then.
