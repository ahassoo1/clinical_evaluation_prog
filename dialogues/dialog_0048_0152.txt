DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I'm Dr. Sink. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse told me it was about my cholesterol. They said it was a little high on the blood work. I don't really understand what that means, exactly. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: High cholesterol… right. Yes, I see that here. It can be problematic, Ms. Geho, though many things factor into it. Essentially, it's a fat in your blood, and too much can build up and cause… well, let's just say issues with circulation. Do you have a family history of heart disease or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, circulation problems… that doesn't sound good. Let me think… my father, he had a… not a stroke, exactly, but he had some blockages. They put a little… a little tube in him to open things up. That was maybe fifteen years ago? And my mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. Does that count? I’m not very good with remembering medical things.
DOCTOR: A blockage... sounds like he had an angioplasty with a stent. And high blood pressure is certainly relevant. Yes, that does count, Ms. Geho. It often goes hand-in-hand with cholesterol. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because I don't get much sun. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly vegetables and fish. I walk a lot, too. I’m six-foot-four, so I get plenty of exercise just getting around! Is it possible to have high cholesterol even if you’re active?
DOCTOR: Height is… noted. Yes, Ms. Geho, it is absolutely possible. Genetics play a significant role, and lifestyle isn't always enough. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Could you step up on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Of course. I haven’t weighed myself in ages, actually. I mostly just try not to think about numbers! What exactly are you looking for, Doctor? Besides, you know, the weight itself?
DOCTOR: I'm listening for any irregularities, checking your blood pressure, and looking for any signs of poor circulation. And the weight… well, it’s a factor. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/90. Pulse is regular. Any swelling in your ankles or feet, Ms. Geho?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I've noticed. Sometimes my feet are a little tired after a long day, but I just thought that was from being on them so much. 142/90… is that really bad? It sounds… high. My mother always said hers was high too, but she never seemed too worried about it. Is there anything I can do about it right away? Like, change my diet or something?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, Ms. Geho. And your mother's tolerance isn't necessarily a good benchmark. Diet can help, yes, but honestly, at your age and with your family history, I suspect you’ll need more than just that. I’m going to order a lipid panel – a more detailed cholesterol breakdown – and we’ll see what the numbers look like. Then we can discuss treatment options. It will probably involve medication. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh. Medication, huh? I always try to avoid those if I can. But I suppose if it’s important… No, Doctor, no allergies. Not to anything, as far as I know. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, traveling as I have. Is this medication something I'd have to take forever? And what are the… side effects like? I’ve heard some scary stories.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Geho, most likely forever. It’s a chronic condition. And yes, there are potential side effects, as with any medication. Muscle aches are the most common. Rarely, there can be more serious issues, but we monitor that closely. Now, before you get too worried, let’s get those lab results back. I’ll have the nurse draw blood now. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay… forever is a long time. And muscle aches… that doesn't sound very pleasant. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry, though. No, I don't think so, not right now. Just… I hope the nurse is good at drawing blood. I have… thin veins. Is there anything I should do before the blood draw? Like, should I eat something? Or avoid coffee?
DOCTOR: A little coffee won't matter, Ms. Geho. Just relax. And I assure you, our nurses are quite competent. I’ll have them come in shortly. We'll re-evaluate after the lab results and discuss the best course of action then. I have other patients waiting, so I'm going to need to move things along. Let's just get the blood draw done, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright, Doctor. Yes, let's do that. I’ll just… wait here, then? Thank you, Doctor. I hope it doesn’t take too long. .
