DOCTOR: “Bula, Mr. Bulaong! Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Uh, it’s my chest. It… hurts a little. Not all the time, but it does hurt.
DOCTOR: “Okay, chest pain. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to say. It’s not like a bad pain, more like… sore? On my chest. Both sides. I just… feel it sometimes. Mostly when I move around a lot, you know, with the roofing job.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so it’s more of a soreness than a sharp pain, and it seems to be connected to activity, especially with your roofing work. That’s helpful. Does it radiate anywhere – like to your arm, neck, or back?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… here. It stays here. It doesn’t go anywhere else. I don’t think so anyway. Sometimes it’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: “Okay, just in the chest itself. And you said it doesn’t happen all the time, mostly with activity. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… a month? Two months? I don’t really keep track of dates, sorry. It just started, you know, when it got really busy with work. It's not… bad enough to stop me working, though.
DOCTOR: “No need to apologize, Mr. Bulaong. A month or two is good to know. So, it started around the time work got busier. And it hasn’t stopped you from working. Has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Uh… lifting heavy stuff, I think. And sometimes when I’m reaching up… like, when I’m putting the shingles on the roof. That makes it feel… tighter. And… I don't know if this is important, but my wife said she… noticed something. She said… something looked different.
DOCTOR: “Okay, lifting and reaching seem to be triggers. And your wife noticed something different – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: She said… She said my… chest looked… bigger? I didn't really see it myself. I don't really look at myself. But she said it changed. I’m a skinny guy, you know? Maybe she just noticed something. I don’t know. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: “Okay, she noticed a change in the appearance of your chest. That’s good information to have, and it’s good that she brought it up. We should definitely take a look at that. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at your chest, and check for any tenderness or changes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's okay. Sounds good. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: “Great. Thank you. If you could please sit up and lean forward, that would be helpful. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. This might be a little cold. Okay, heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Alright, I’m just feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities… Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little. Just… there. Not a big pain, but… yeah, that's a little sore. It's always been kinda… sensitive there. I just thought it was from the work.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, tenderness on the left side of your chest. I'm also noticing some… slight swelling compared to the right side. It’s subtle, but it’s there. I'm going to measure your chest circumference just to get a baseline. Alright, your chest measures 92 centimeters on the right side and 95 centimeters on the left. That’s a 3-centimeter difference. Given what you've described – the chest pain that worsens with activity, the tenderness, and the slight swelling – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be a muscle strain, costochondritis , or something else entirely. Because of the swelling, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Uh… okay. If you think it’s important, yeah. I don't want anything… bad. What will it show? Will it hurt? I'm not good with hospitals.
DOCTOR: “I understand your nervousness, Mr. Bulaong. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The X-ray is just a quick picture of your chest, and it won't hurt at all. You'll stand in front of a machine and it will take a few seconds. It helps us see your lungs, heart, and bones to make sure everything looks okay. It will help us rule out things like pneumonia, fluid around the lungs, or any structural problems with your ribs. It won't show muscle strains directly, but it will help us eliminate other possibilities. We can get it done right here at the clinic; you won’t need to go to a separate hospital. The technician is very good, and I'll be here to discuss the results with you as soon as they're available. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye or iodine, or have you had an X-ray recently?
PATIENT: No allergies, I don't think. And… no, I haven't had an X-ray. Never had one before. Okay, if it's quick and here, I guess I can do it. I just hope it's nothing serious, Doctor. I need to work. My wife… she worries a lot.
DOCTOR: “I understand completely, Mr. Bulaong. We'll get this done quickly, and we’ll do our best to find out what's going on. I'll order the X-ray now. The technician will come in and explain the procedure to you in more detail. In the meantime, I'm going to write down some instructions for you to follow while we wait for the results. These include avoiding heavy lifting and strenuous activity, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen if you're experiencing discomfort. While we’re waiting, could you tell me a little more about your work?
PATIENT: Okay, ibuprofen sounds good. I take that sometimes for my back. My work... well, it’s roofing. A lot of lifting shingles, walking on roofs, hammering nails. It’s hard work. I carry a lot of stuff around. We build new roofs and fix old ones. Sometimes it’s really hot on the roof, sometimes it’s cold and windy. We mostly work on houses, sometimes apartments. My brother helps me, he does most of the really heavy stuff now. I'm getting too old for that.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so a physically demanding job with a lot of lifting, carrying, and working in various weather conditions. That’s helpful context. We'll need to consider that when we look at the X-ray results. I'm going to write a note mentioning that you need to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity for the next few days until we have a better understanding of what’s going on. I'll also note your brother helps you, that’s good to know. The technician should be in shortly to perform the X-ray. Do you have any questions for me before they arrive?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… how long will it take to get the results? My wife will be wondering. I don’t want her to worry too much. I promised her I'd be home by dinner.
DOCTOR: “I understand. The technician usually gets the images to me within the hour. I'll review them as quickly as possible, and then we’ll discuss the results together. I anticipate we’ll have a plan within two hours at the most, hopefully sooner. If there's anything concerning, I'll let you know immediately. We can also call your wife to update her if you’d like. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: That would be… nice, actually. If you could just tell her it’s going to be a little while. She gets really… anxious. Her name is Lani. And her number is… 555-123-4567. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind.
DOCTOR: “Of course, Mr. Bulaong. I’ll give Lani a quick call to let her know you’re getting an X-ray and that it might be a little longer before you get home. That way she knows you're being taken care of and won’t worry unnecessarily. Alright, I’ve spoken to Lani. She appreciates the update. Now, the technician is ready for you when you're ready. The X-ray room is just down the hall. They will explain the procedure to you. Just follow their instructions. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns before you go. And we'll talk as soon as I have the results. Try to relax as much as possible. ”
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I will. I'll go now.
DOCTOR: “Alright, thank you, Mr. Bulaong. Take your time. I'll be right here when you get back.” .
