DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Gorga. Well, to be frank, I requested to be tested for HIV. It’s… something I’ve been wanting to get checked for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay. HIV testing… right. That’s… sensible. A lot of people want to be sure. Can you tell me a little bit about why you’re wanting to get tested now, specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my husband and I… we haven’t been as careful as we should have been, recently. And I just… I want peace of mind, you know? It’s been on my mind, and I’d rather know one way or the other. I suppose it’s a bit late, but better late than never, as they say.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Recent changes in… practices. Okay. And has there been any specific incident that prompted this concern, or is this more of a general feeling?
PATIENT: No, no specific incident, Doctor. Just a realization, really. We’ve been married a long time, and… well, we got comfortable. Perhaps too comfortable. It’s just a sense of… responsibility, I think. To both myself and my husband. I should have thought of this sooner.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sensible. A good reason to get tested. Now, have either of you been tested previously?
PATIENT: To the best of my knowledge, no. We were… young when we met, and, truthfully, it wasn’t something we discussed much. It feels a bit foolish now, I admit. Perhaps we were naive. But that was a long time ago, and things are different now.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior testing. Okay. Now, before we proceed with the test, I need to ask a few questions about your medical history, just to make sure everything is alright. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I eat everything, and I haven't had any reactions to any medications in the past. Though, I don’t take many, thankfully. Just a bit of ibuprofen now and then for aches. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, occasional ibuprofen. Good. And are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just the ibuprofen, as I said. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can. I prefer a good cup of tea for what ails me, if you understand. It’s my grandmother's recipe, you see. Works wonders.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly. Tea is good. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Thankfully, I’ve always been quite healthy. A bit of arthritis in my knees, as one gets older, but nothing that requires any special treatment. Just a bit of stiffness in the mornings. My mother always said it was the weather, though. She was never one for doctors, you see.
DOCTOR: No major medical conditions, arthritis in the knees. Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single surgery, and I’ve only been to the hospital for the birth of my children. Thankfully, everything went smoothly both times. I always try to avoid hospitals if possible, to be honest. They don’t have the… the best atmosphere, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can move on to the testing itself. Can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a bit difficult. My family is… large. And scattered. I don't know much about their medical histories, to be honest. My parents are both deceased, and I wasn't close to many of my relatives. I know my mother had high blood pressure, but that’s about all I can tell you. It’s not something we discussed much, you see. We were more focused on… survival, if you understand. It was a different time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Limited family history available. Alright. Now, I’m going to ask a quick question about your social history. Have you ever… shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. Never. I wouldn’t even consider such a thing. I’ve never… been in that sort of situation, if you understand. It's a dreadful thought. I've always lived a… a very respectable life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And have you ever had any… sexual contact with anyone other than your husband?
PATIENT: Doctor… that is a very personal question. My husband and I have been married for a very long time. We have been faithful to each other. It’s never been a question. But… in my youth, before I met him, yes. A few… relationships. But that was a very long time ago. Before I knew any better, if you understand. It’s not something I’m proud of, but it’s the truth.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for your honesty. Now, before we proceed with the test, I want to explain the process. We’ll need to take a small sample of blood. It will be sent to the lab, and the results should be available in a few days. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A few days… alright. No, I think I understand. A blood sample, sent to the lab. Is it… a painful procedure? I’m not very good with needles, you see. It's a silly fear, I know, but...
DOCTOR: No, it’s not painful. It’s a quick prick, and then it’s over. It’s a very common procedure, and our nurses are very skilled. We’ll use a sterile needle, and we'll dispose of it properly afterwards. I’ll be right here with you if you’re feeling anxious. Would you like me to have the nurse apply a topical anesthetic cream beforehand?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Yes, please. The cream, if you don’t mind. Just to… take the edge off, you know? It’s just a silly fear, as I said, but it would put my mind at ease. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me have the nurse come in and apply that for you. It will need about 20 minutes to work. Then we can proceed with the blood draw. Nurse Evelyn, could you come in here for a moment, please?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. Twenty minutes… alright. I suppose I can manage that. I’ll just sit here quietly. I do appreciate your understanding. It's a bit nerve-wracking, you see. Though I shouldn't complain. It's better to know, as they say.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's always better to be proactive about your health. I'll leave you to relax for a few minutes while we wait for the nurse. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. .
PATIENT: .
