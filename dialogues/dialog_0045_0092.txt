DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds, good to see you. So, you’re Oreste, 83 years young, and here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Huh. Eighty-three, you say? Feels younger, I tell ya. What was I comin’ in for again? My… my throat's kinda scratchy. And my mouth feels like sandpaper. Been that way a bit now. And my eyes… they don't water like they used to. Just… dry. That's it, I think. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Right. Scratchy throat, dry mouth, dry eyes…and you figure it's just old age. Well, we don’t just assume things, Mr. Guilds. It could be a lot of things. Let’s start with the throat. How long has it been scratchy?
PATIENT: Long? Oh, jeez. A while. A good… maybe a month? Hard to say. Time kinda… blurs, ya know? It's not painful, just… annoying. Like somethin' stuck. I drink water, helps a little. Not much though.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And you said it feels like something stuck?
PATIENT: Yeah, somethin’ kinda… there. Not a big piece, not like I swallowed a fishbone or somethin’. Just… a feelin’. I mostly notice it when I try to talk. Makes me sound like… well, an old man, I guess. Which I am, but still.
DOCTOR: Right. And is this affecting your ability to eat or drink?
PATIENT: Nah, I can still eat. I like my Cuban sandwiches, ya know? And coffee. Gotta have my coffee. It's just... takes a little more effort, that’s all. I gotta sip it slow, 'cause of the scratchiness. Don't want to choke or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no difficulty swallowing, just a little discomfort when talking and drinking. And you mentioned dry eyes too. Is that new, or have you always had dry eyes?
PATIENT: New, I think. I mean, I always blink, right? But they don’t… they don’t feel wet when I close 'em. Like lookin' through sand, almost. It's kinda funny, actually. Used to have watery eyes when I was younger, always cryin' over somethin'. Now… nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the dryness in your eyes is a relatively new symptom. Any blurry vision, or sensitivity to light?
PATIENT: Blurry vision? Not really. Things are… faded, I guess. But I always thought that was my glasses. They're old. Should get new ones, probably. Light… huh. Sun bothers me a little more than it used to, but I always liked the shade, ya know? Never been a beach person.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. We’re gonna do a quick exam, just to get a better look at things. I’ll check your throat, look in your eyes, and listen to your lungs. Just routine. Open wide and say “ah.”
PATIENT: Ugh, always gotta look in my throat. Reminds me of school. Just get it over with, Doc. I got things to do, ya know? Important things. Like… uh… thinkin’. Yeah, thinkin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. Throat's a little red, some mild dryness. No obvious swelling or masses. Lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at those eyes. Hmm. Corneas are a bit dry, as you mentioned. Pupils are equal and react to light. Not much redness. I'm gonna check your blood pressure and pulse now.
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Pulse? What's that got to do with my scratchy throat and dry eyes? Used to be a strong man, you know. Lifted heavy things. Never needed a doctor for nothin’ back then. Still don’t see what all this is about.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Guilds, sometimes seemingly unrelated symptoms can point to a larger issue. We have to look at the whole picture. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your pulse is a bit fast, but nothing alarming. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing a bit of dehydration, possibly worsened by aging and maybe…a touch of Sjogren's syndrome. It's a common autoimmune condition that can cause dryness in the eyes and mouth. However, we need some blood tests to confirm that. Would you be willing to get those done?
PATIENT: De… what now? Auto… something? Blood tests? Look, Doc, I just wanna feel better. Scratchy throat, dry eyes. That’s all. You’re makin’ this way too complicated. Blood tests sound… unpleasant. And expensive. Is it gonna take a long time? I got my Cuban sandwich waitin’ for me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Guilds. It can sound complicated, but it's important to figure out what's going on so we can get you feeling better. The blood tests will help us rule out other possibilities and confirm if it is Sjogren's. It’s a simple procedure – just a few vials of blood. It shouldn't take long, maybe ten minutes. And as for expenses, Medicare should cover most of it. If it is Sjogren's, there are treatments that can help manage the symptoms and make you much more comfortable. I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't think it was necessary. We can also start with some simple things in the meantime - increasing your water intake and using artificial tears for your eyes. Would you be willing to try that, and get the blood tests?
PATIENT: Artificial tears… sounds ridiculous. But… ten minutes, you say? And Medicare? Fine. Fine. Do the tests. But no promises I won’t complain the whole time. And I’m still drinkin' my coffee. Don't tell me to stop drinkin' coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. I understand. No coffee restrictions from me, I assure you. I'll have the nurse draw your blood now. It should be quick. And we'll get the results back in a few days. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water and I'll write you a prescription for some artificial tears. Use them as needed. Here are the orders. The lab is just down the hall. Once they're done, you can head home and enjoy your sandwich. And if anything changes – if your throat gets worse, or you develop a fever – call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Questions? Nah. Just… get it over with. And tell that nurse to be gentle, ya hear? I got old veins. .
DOCTOR: I’ll let her know. Have a good day, Mr. Guilds. And don't forget to stay hydrated. .
