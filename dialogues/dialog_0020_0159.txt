DOCTOR: Good morning, Elijiah. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Beinborn, right? Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, it’s kinda weird, honestly. I’ve been havin’ trouble… gettin’ out of chairs. Sounds silly, I know. Like, I can sit down fine, but standin’ back up? It feels like it takes a whole lot more effort than it should. And sometimes, I gotta really brace myself to do it. It started a couple weeks back, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that doesn't sound silly at all. It's good you're bringing it up. It's helpful to know when something changes, even if it seems minor. So, about two weeks ago… was there anything specific happening when you first noticed this difficulty?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I recall. Just… one day it was a little harder than usual. I work out on the rigs, ya know? Lots of bendin’ and liftin’. I figured it was just a sore muscle at first. But it hasn’t gone away, and it’s actually gettin' worse. I’m kinda worried it’s somethin’ more than just pullin’ somethin’. My wife… she would always tell me to come see a doc when stuff like this started. She was always right.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in. Working on the rigs is physically demanding, and it’s smart to get things checked out when they don’t improve with time. And it's good you listen to your wife – spouses often have a good sense of these things. So, when you say “worse,” can you describe what that means?
PATIENT: Well, at first, it was just feelin' kinda stiff when I stood up from a normal chair, like after dinner. Now? It's… it’s harder to get goin' in the mornin'. And yesterday, I nearly fell over tryin’ to stand up from a stool. Just kinda… wobbled there for a sec. It feels like my legs are… weak, I guess. And sometimes there's a little pinch in my lower back when I push myself up. Not sharp, just… noticeable. And it’s not all the time, but it's happenin' more and more often.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better picture. Weakness, the wobble you described, and that pinch in your lower back… all important things to know. Is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yeah. Like, I can walk around all day at work, climbin' and movin', and I'm usually alright. It’s mostly when I’ve been sittin’ for a while, then try to stand. Or like, if I’m tired. Yesterday, after a long shift… forget about it. It was bad. But if I keep movin' after I stand up, it seems to get a little better. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. That pattern is helpful to know. So, it's worse with rest and prolonged sitting, and improves with activity… Alright. Now, just to get a more complete picture, can you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever or nothin' like that. No numbness or tingly feelin' in my legs or feet. My appetite’s been normal, I guess. Sleepin’ okay, though work's been keepin' me pretty tired lately, so that might be different than usual. Oh! My back's been achin' a little more than usual, but I usually just chalk that up to the work. Nothing terrible, just… a dull ache. I don’t think there’s anything else, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No fever, no numbness, normal appetite… That's helpful. And the dull back ache. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like arthritis, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. Never had any serious illnesses or surgeries. Just the usual colds and flu over the years. My wife… she was the one who always went to the doc. She was always worryin' about somethin'. I always figured I had good genes. I haven’t really needed to see a doctor much, until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No previous diagnoses or surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mom… she had some problems with her hips when she got older, had to get a replacement. And my dad, he had high blood pressure, but he managed it with pills. That’s about it, I think. Nobody else in the family had any major health problems. My wife’s family… they all seem pretty healthy too, come to think of it. But to be honest, I don’t know a whole lot about their medical history, we didn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hip problems in your mother, high blood pressure in your father… good to know. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I don't like takin' pills if I can avoid it. Maybe some ibuprofen now and then for a headache, but that's about it. And I don't take any vitamins or nothin' like that. Just try to eat healthy, when I can. Work doesn’t always leave a lot of time for fancy meals, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen. Alright, Elijiah, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. It’s concerning that you're having difficulty standing, the weakness, and that it’s worsening. I’d like to do a physical exam, and possibly some lab work, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever ya think is best, Doc. I just wanna figure out what's goin' on, and get back to work, if I can. I’m not a fan of bein' laid up. What kinda exam are we talkin' about? And what kinda lab work? Just wanna know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll explain everything as we go. The exam will involve checking your strength, reflexes, and range of motion in your legs and back. I'll also be listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your back to see if there are any areas of tenderness. It's pretty standard. As for the lab work, I’m thinking we should start with a complete blood count, to check for any signs of inflammation or infection. I also want to check your vitamin D levels, and possibly your thyroid function. Those can sometimes contribute to muscle weakness. We might consider checking your creatinine kinase level, which can indicate muscle damage. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… alright. Vitamin D, thyroid, muscle damage… I don’t know a whole lot about any of that, but if it helps figure things out, then sure. Just… try not to take too much blood, okay? And how long is this exam gonna take? I got a shift startin' tomorrow mornin', if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. We’ll only take the necessary amount of blood. It shouldn't take too long – the physical exam will be about 15-20 minutes, and the blood draw will be quick. The lab results usually take a few days to come back, so we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Now, if you don’t mind, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. No problem. There. How’s that look? It feels… a little awkward, I guess. More difficult than it should be.
DOCTOR: Okay. I notice a slight stiffness in your gait, and you seem to be bracing yourself a bit as you stand. Your range of motion appears slightly limited. I also noticed a little hesitancy. Now, can you try bending forward and touching your toes?
PATIENT: There. That’s as far as I can go without… well, without makin' things worse. It feels tight down there, like somethin's pullin'. Does that look bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. Your range of motion is limited, and I see some discomfort as you bend forward. There is some tenderness in your lower back upon palpation. And you've stated the lower back pain has been increasing. Now, let's try some strength testing. Could you please sit back down for a moment?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. What kinda strength test are we talkin' about? I hope it doesn’t involve liftin’ anything heavy.
DOCTOR: No heavy lifting, I promise. I’m going to ask you to push against my hand with your legs. We’ll start with your right leg, then your left. Just push as hard as you can, and tell me when you can’t push any harder. We are looking for any weakness in your legs. Alright, let’s start with your right leg. I'll need you to extend your leg straight out, and I'll provide resistance. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. Extend my leg, and ya push back. Alright. Let me know when ya want me to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, push against my hand. Keep pushing... keep pushing... Alright, good. Now let's try that on your left leg. Extend your leg…
PATIENT: There. Okay, I'm pushin'. Alright, left leg now, ya said? Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, push against my hand… Keep pushing… Keep pushing… Okay, good. Based on what I've observed during the exam – the stiffness in your gait, limited range of motion, tenderness in your lower back, and the slight weakness in your left leg – I'm concerned about potential nerve compression or muscle weakness. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some imaging – an MRI of your lower back would be very helpful. And I’m also going to order those lab tests we discussed – CBC, Vitamin D, and thyroid function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: MRI… and more tests… Sounds… serious. But yeah, if that's what ya think is best, Doc, then go ahead. I just wanna know what’s goin' on, and get back to work. Can I still work while we wait for the results, or…? Is it somethin’ that could get worse if I keep liftin’ stuff? I gotta know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. It's good you're asking these questions. The MRI will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. It doesn't necessarily mean it's something serious, but we need to rule out any potential nerve compression or muscle damage. Regarding work, I would strongly advise against any heavy lifting or strenuous activity until we have the results of the MRI. Continuing to lift heavy objects could potentially worsen your condition. I can provide you with a work note excusing you from those activities. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen or naproxen, and gentle stretching exercises. Avoid any movements that cause pain. I’ll write up the orders for the MRI and lab tests, and schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… that covers it, Doc. Just… try not to take too much blood. And thanks for explainin’ everything so clearly. I appreciate it. When should I expect to hear back about the MRI? And about the follow-up appointment? .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'll make sure the lab technician knows to be gentle with the blood draw. The MRI results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. My office will contact you as soon as they're available. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment then, likely within a week, to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms like numbness or weakness in your legs, please contact my office immediately. Here is the work note, and the orders for the MRI and lab tests. Take care, Elijiah, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. .
