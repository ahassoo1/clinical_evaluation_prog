DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Helaina. Honestly, I just… I saw something online about preventing HIV, and it seemed smart to look into it. My niece, bless her, she's very careful, but you hear stories, you know? It’s better to be safe. I figured I’d ask about it. It’s a bit embarrassing talking about this, but… here I am.
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in, Helaina. It’s not embarrassing at all to be proactive about your health, and I commend you for taking this step. It’s excellent that you’re thinking about prevention. We can certainly discuss HIV prevention strategies. To best advise you, could you tell me a little more about your concerns?
PATIENT: Concerns… well, mostly just wanting to understand what my options are. I don't… I haven't been actively worried, if that makes sense. It's just… I'm single, I date a little, and I want to be responsible. I read about a pill you can take before anything happens, to stop it from even starting? Is that right? That sounded… good. And I guess I want to know if it's right for me. I don’t know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Helaina. You're right, there is a medication called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, that can be taken to prevent HIV infection. It’s a very effective option, and it’s become increasingly common. Before we discuss PrEP in detail, I'd like to get a better understanding of your overall health and risk factors. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to know. I’m pretty healthy, I think. I walk a lot at work, being a parking attendant keeps you moving. No major illnesses, just the usual aches and pains for someone my age. I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups. Is that enough? What kind of risk factors are we talking about, exactly? I’m not… I haven’t done anything risky, but… like I said, I date.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's good to hear about your activity level and regular check-ups. Medicare coverage is helpful as well. When we talk about risk factors for HIV, we’re considering anything that could potentially expose you to the virus. That includes unprotected sexual contact – meaning sex without a condom – with someone whose HIV status you don't know, or with someone who is HIV-positive. Sharing needles is another risk, but I understand that’s not relevant in your case. And sometimes, even with precautions, there can be a small risk. You mentioned dating – could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, dating. It’s… casual. I meet people online, sometimes through friends. It’s not… regular, like a steady boyfriend. More like… dinner dates, coffee, that sort of thing. I always use protection, I’m very careful about that. But you never really know, do you? That’s why I’m here. I guess I’ve had… maybe five or six different people in the last year, but it hasn’t been… frequent. And I always insist on using a condom. Is that… enough to make PrEP unnecessary? I’m just trying to figure out if I’m overthinking this.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re consistently using condoms, Helaina. That significantly reduces your risk. However, even with consistent and correct condom use, there's still a small possibility of transmission. Condoms aren't 100% effective. Given your dating activity and the fact that you meet different people, exploring PrEP might be a reasonable consideration, even though you are taking precautions. It offers an extra layer of protection and can provide peace of mind. To help me determine if PrEP is right for you, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history and lifestyle. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Ask away. I don’t mind. I'm just glad you're not making me feel silly for even asking about this. It's just… a lot of information to take in. And honestly, I worry about side effects. I'm not as young as I used to be, and I don’t want to start a medication that’s going to make me feel worse. What are the side effects like, anyway?
DOCTOR: You're not silly at all, Helaina. It's very responsible to be informed and consider all aspects of your health. And you're right to be concerned about potential side effects. The most common side effects of PrEP are generally mild and often temporary. Some people experience nausea, fatigue, headache, or stomach pain, especially when they first start taking the medication. These symptoms usually subside within a few weeks. There’s also a potential for a small decrease in kidney function, which we would monitor with regular blood tests. Rarely, some people experience more serious side effects, but those are uncommon. Before we consider starting PrEP, we'd need to do some blood tests to check your kidney function, rule out any existing HIV infection, and ensure you don’t have any other underlying medical conditions that might make PrEP unsuitable. To start, could you tell me about any allergies you have, and any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Glad to hear it’s usually mild. I get headaches sometimes, but I just take ibuprofen for those. Allergies… I’m allergic to penicillin, a pretty bad reaction. And I used to be allergic to bee stings, but I had a series of shots when I was younger, so I think that’s okay now. I haven’t been stung in years. Medications… just ibuprofen, when needed. And I take a multivitamin, one of those senior ones. That’s it. Really. Nothing else. Oh, and sometimes I take something for my heartburn, but that’s only when I eat something spicy. It’s just… Pepcid, I think it’s called.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Helaina. That's helpful to know. Penicillin allergy is important, and the information about the bee sting allergy is good as well. Now, to get a more complete picture of your overall health, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I've been pretty lucky, honestly. My mother had high blood pressure, but I haven’t had any problems. I get my cholesterol checked with my regular doctor every year, and it’s always been fine. I walk a lot at work, like I said. It keeps me moving. Sometimes my back aches, being on my feet all day, but that’s just… old age, I guess. Nothing the doctor ever worried about.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear about your overall health and active lifestyle, Helaina. Staying active is very beneficial. And it’s good that you have regular check-ups with your doctor. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long, long time ago. And I had a cyst removed from my wrist when I was in my twenties, but that was just a small thing, outpatient. Nothing major. And… oh! I had a cataract in my left eye removed about five years ago. That was pretty easy, thankfully. Other than that, no. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Helaina. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother smoked, and it was awful. I just… couldn't. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month, if that. And definitely no drugs. Never have, never will. I'm a pretty boring person, honestly.
DOCTOR: There’s absolutely nothing boring about being health-conscious, Helaina. That’s admirable. Okay, one final set of questions. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Let me think… I think my regular doctor tested me a few years back, just as part of a general check-up. I don't remember specifically, but I'm pretty sure she did. She does a lot of tests. But I don’t have the results here, I’d have to ask her. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you may have been tested before, Helaina. Knowing the results would be helpful, but it’s not essential at this point. We can always repeat the test to be certain. Okay, now that I have a better understanding of your medical and social history, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. That sounds fine. Go ahead. I haven’t had a full physical in a while, so it’s probably a good idea anyway. Just… be gentle with my back, okay? It gets a little sore at the end of the day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. I'll be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I do notice some tenderness in your lower back, as you mentioned. Now, to determine if PrEP is right for you, I would like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function, and an HIV test. We’ll also need to screen for any other sexually transmitted infections. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment. Just… how long does it take to get the results back? And… will it hurt? The blood tests, I mean. I’m not a fan of needles.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Helaina. I appreciate your trust. The blood tests shouldn’t hurt much – just a brief pinch. The phlebotomist is very skilled. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. Once I have the results, we can discuss them and determine if PrEP is a suitable option for you. In the meantime, it's important to continue practicing safe sex. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. I’m just… relieved I came in. It’s good to know what my options are. And you haven’t made me feel silly at all, which I appreciate. So, just… wait for the results, and then we talk? Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. I’m glad I could help. And you absolutely haven't felt silly – it's responsible to be proactive about your health. Yes, just wait for the results, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. We'll discuss the results and make a plan that’s right for you. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Helaina.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. You too, Doctor.
