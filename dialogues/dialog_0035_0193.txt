DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Alzoubi. It is very nice to meet you. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. Too much gas. It is… embarrassing, really. It has been happening a lot lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can be embarrassing, but it's also a common issue, so don't feel bad about bringing it up. “Too much gas” is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… difficult to say exactly when it started, but I would guess maybe… three weeks ago? It happens many times during the day. After I eat, mostly, but sometimes even when I am just… sitting. It does not hurt, exactly, but it is… loud. And smells, sometimes. I work at the fast food place, you see, and I am… concerned about my coworkers.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago, mostly after eating, but sometimes even just sitting. Loud and sometimes has an odor. And you're concerned about it at work, which I understand. Is it constant throughout the day, or does it come and go in waves?
PATIENT: It is… waves, yes. It is not always happening. Some hours are fine, and then… suddenly, many times in a short time. Then it stops for a while. It is… unpredictable. And it seems… worse after certain foods. Like, the bean burrito at the fast food place. Naturally.
DOCTOR: Naturally, with the bean burrito. So it’s unpredictable, comes in waves, and seems to be triggered by certain foods. Are there any other foods that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think… the cabbage soup my neighbor makes is… a problem. And… broccoli. Anything green, really, if I am being honest. Though not spinach. Funny, no? Spinach is fine. And… milk. A glass of milk. Not a lot, but… it creates a disturbance.
DOCTOR: Okay, cabbage soup, broccoli, other green vegetables, but not spinach, and milk. That's helpful. Now, besides the gas, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No pain, like I said. No… feeling sick to my stomach. Sometimes… a little bit of bloating. Just… a feeling of fullness, even when I have not eaten much. And… I am a little tired, maybe? But I work long hours at the fast food place, so it is hard to say if that is from the gas, or just… the work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or nausea, some bloating, a feeling of fullness, and some fatigue, which you attribute to work. Let's talk about your diet a little more generally. Besides the foods we’ve mentioned, what does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, at the fast food place, I… eat the food. A burger, usually, and fries. Sometimes a soda. For breakfast, I have… toast. With jam. Simple. Lunch is often a sandwich at work. Not much variety, I admit. Dinner… depends. Sometimes I make soup, but often it is just… something quick. Frozen meal, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fairly standard diet with some fast food, toast and jam for breakfast, sandwiches for lunch, and quick meals for dinner. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I have eaten many things in my life. Never had a reaction. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Perhaps it is too strong now.
DOCTOR: Perhaps. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I do not like taking pills. I only take what the doctor tells me to take, and… right now, that is nothing. Just Medicare, for when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… I had the flu, many times. Nothing else, really. No serious illnesses. I am a healthy man, mostly. I just have… this gas problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed as a child, and occasional flu. No other major medical conditions. And has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any problems with digestion, like irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn’s disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she always had a… sensitive stomach. Complained a lot about indigestion. But she never went to the doctor, really. Just took some tea. My father… he was a very strong man. Never sick. I do not think anyone else in the family had problems like this. Just my mother, and her… tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had a sensitive stomach, but no other family history of digestive issues. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. It is… a little embarrassing, but I want to get to the bottom of this gas.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Okay, and again. Good. I'm not detecting any significant tenderness. Your bowel sounds are present, though slightly hyperactive. No masses felt. That’s a good sign. Now, do you have any heartburn or acid reflux symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No heartburn. No burning feeling in my chest. Sometimes… a little bit of burping, but that is all. It is mostly… the other end, you understand. The gas. Not the burping. Though, perhaps they are connected? I do not know.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Given your symptoms – the excessive gas, triggered by certain foods, some bloating, and slightly hyperactive bowel sounds – it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of excessive gas production, potentially related to your diet and how your gut is processing those foods. It’s not necessarily anything serious, but it’s definitely something we can address. The first step is to try a low-FODMAP diet, which involves temporarily reducing foods that are known to cause gas. We can get you a handout with a list of those foods. It’s a bit restrictive, but it can help identify what’s triggering your symptoms. Also, consider taking an over-the-counter simethicone product, like Gas-X, to help relieve some of the gas and bloating. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A list of foods to avoid, and a pill for the gas. I can do that. I do not mind avoiding certain foods if it helps. And… it is good to know it is not something serious. A little embarrassing, yes, but not dangerous. I would appreciate the handout, please. And… thank you for listening to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help. Here’s a handout on the low-FODMAP diet. It has a comprehensive list of foods to avoid and foods you can eat freely. I recommend starting slowly and eliminating one or two food groups at a time to see if you notice a difference. I also want you to keep a food diary, logging what you eat and any symptoms you experience. This will help us pinpoint your specific triggers. If your symptoms don’t improve after a couple of weeks, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. We may need to consider further testing, but for now, let’s try this dietary approach. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. Avoid certain foods, keep a diary, and come back if it gets worse. It is… a lot to remember, but I will try my best. Thank you again for your time and… your patience. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm confident you can manage this. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns along the way. Here’s a work note excusing you from strenuous activity if needed. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
