DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need a check-up for… well, a sports team. Trying out, you see. Gotta make sure I'm not too old to break anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, a physical for a sports team tryout. Good idea to get checked out beforehand. Just to confirm, you’re Lamark Kingan, age 62, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s me. Sixty-two years young, though I don’t feel it. Mostly. Let’s just get this done, if you don’t mind. I got places to be.
DOCTOR: I understand wanting to be efficient. We’ll try to keep things moving. First, can you tell me a little more about the sport you’re trying out for?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s… Mongolian wrestling. Sort of like sumo, but with more… throwing. And less belly. It’s a long story. Not something you see on ESPN, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Mongolian wrestling. Okay. That sounds… physically demanding. Have you wrestled before, or is this a new venture?
PATIENT: Been doing it since I was a boy, back home. Took a few years off, you know, life and such. But I'm feeling pretty good now. Just need to make sure my old bones can handle it. Is that what you're checking for? Bones?
DOCTOR: That’s part of it, yes. We'll assess your overall health, including your musculoskeletal system—your bones and muscles—to see if you're fit to participate safely. Now, have you had any injuries in the past that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I twisted my knee pretty bad when I was maybe… twenty? Played soccer, surprisingly. And my shoulder… pulled something lifting heavy stuff years ago. Nothing major, I just… ignored it. Probably should have gotten it looked at. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re telling me about these. Knee and shoulder injuries, even if old, can sometimes affect your ability to participate in a sport. Okay. And besides those, any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nah. Nothing I can think of. I eat okay, sleep okay... mostly. High blood pressure maybe, the doctor back in the city mentioned it once, but I don't really bother with pills. Too many side effects, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure mentioned in the past, but not currently managed with medication. We'll definitely want to check your blood pressure today. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Just… strong tea. Lots of strong tea. Does that count? My grandmother's recipe. Keeps you going, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Mongolian food… it's pretty basic. Meat and… more meat. Nothing fancy to be allergic to. Can we get this over with? I'm starting to feel… fidgety.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Just a few more quick questions, and then we can move on to the physical exam. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Nah, haven't been sick in ages. I'm a tough old bird. Seriously. Mostly just tired, but that's just… getting older, right?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, finally, are you a smoker, or do you use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched the stuff. Bad for the lungs, you know? Gotta be able to breathe for the wrestling. It's important. Can we please start now? I'm ready to get this done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan, that’s all the questions I have for now. Let's move on to the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then assess your range of motion and strength. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be gentle, okay? These old bones aren’t what they used to be. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds regular, rate 78. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 160/95. A bit elevated, as you mentioned. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Ugh. 160? See? That's what I was afraid of. Fine, do whatever you gotta do. Just hurry. And...what does "auscultation" mean? Don't use big words, Doctor. My head starts to hurt.
DOCTOR: Auscultation just means listening with a stethoscope. Sorry, I sometimes forget to simplify things. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arm. Reflexes 2+ bilaterally, within normal limits. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? I used to have a really strong grip. Still alright, I think. Pretty good, huh? Used to be able to crush walnuts with this hand. Not anymore, maybe. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Grip strength is good, slightly decreased bilaterally. Now, let’s check your range of motion. Can you raise both of your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Ow… a little stiff. Used to be able to do this all day. Gets harder every year. There. Did that okay? It’s the shoulder, you know. Pulled it a long time ago. Never really healed right.
DOCTOR: Range of motion is slightly limited in both shoulders, with some discomfort reported. Now, can you rotate your neck to the left and to the right?
PATIENT: Ow! Careful… careful… That’s the bad side. There. Stops hurting right… there. Old injury. Soccer, believe it or not. Can we please be done soon? I'm starting to feel… creaky.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan, that’s enough for now. Let’s stop there. Based on what I’ve heard and observed, you have some limited range of motion and discomfort in both shoulders and your neck, likely from old injuries. Your blood pressure is also elevated. Now, I'm not going to give you a definitive diagnosis at this moment, but it seems like you may have some mild arthritis and hypertension. We’ll need to do some further testing to confirm this.
PATIENT: Arthritis? Hypertension? Oh, great. Just what I needed. So… can I wrestle or can’t I? That’s all I really care about. I don't want to waste money on tests if I can’t even do the tryout. Be straight with me, Doctor. Don't sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your concern. Based on this initial exam, participating in a strenuous activity like wrestling could pose a risk. Your blood pressure is significantly elevated, and that needs to be addressed before engaging in physical exertion. The shoulder and neck limitations also increase your risk of injury. I’m not going to tell you definitively that you cannot wrestle, but I strongly recommend that you do not participate in the tryout until we get your blood pressure under control and evaluate your shoulder and neck further. I can order some blood work to assess your overall health, and an X-ray of your shoulders to see if there’s any underlying arthritis or other issues. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Ugh. This is just… perfect. Tests. Pills. No wrestling. Fine. Do the tests. Blood work, X-rays, whatever. But how long will it take? And what if they say I really can’t wrestle? I just… wanted to see if I still had it, you know? One last time. Just… get it done quickly, okay? I don’t want to waste any more time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kingan. We'll get the tests done as quickly as possible. The blood work should take about a week to come back, and the X-rays can usually be scheduled within a few days. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity. I’m going to write you a requisition for the blood work and a referral for the X-rays. I will also give you a printout with instructions on how to schedule the X-rays. Now, I'm going to write you a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication to help get things under control. It's important to start this medication as soon as possible, even before the test results come back. Here are your papers. Do you have any questions about the medication or the tests?
PATIENT: Pills… great. What side effects does this stuff have? And what if I don’t take it? Is it really that bad to just… ignore it? I'm just… not a fan of all this. Is it expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: The medication I'm prescribing, Lisinopril, is a relatively mild blood pressure medication. Common side effects can include a dry cough, dizziness, and fatigue. However, not everyone experiences side effects, and they usually subside after a few weeks. It’s important to take it as prescribed, because uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to serious complications, such as heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure. Ignoring it is not recommended, Mr. Kingan. It's a silent killer. As for the cost, it is a generic medication, so it should be relatively inexpensive. I can also provide you with information on local resources that may offer financial assistance for medications. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Fine. Okay. Dry cough… great. Just what I need. And heart attacks… lovely. Financial assistance… yeah. Okay, give me the information. I guess I have no choice. Just… get it over with. What do I do now? Do I go get the X-rays first, or… Do I need to schedule an appointment? This is so complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kingan. I understand this is a lot. Here’s a list of imaging centers in the area that offer X-rays. You’ll need to call to schedule an appointment. The phone numbers are listed on the sheet. You can do the X-rays before or after you get your blood work done – it doesn't matter which one you do first. I also have a brochure with information on local resources that may offer financial assistance for medications and healthcare. And if you have any questions or concerns at any time, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. Do you have any questions before you leave today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Just… a lot to remember. Thanks, Doctor. I guess. I’ll… call them. .
