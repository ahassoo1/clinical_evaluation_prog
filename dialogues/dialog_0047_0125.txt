DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Well, to be honest, it's a bit embarrassing, but my wife... she insisted I get checked for, you know... the HIV. She’s a bit of a worrier, always reading things online. I don’t really see the need, personally, but here I am. I just want to get it over with, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Right. Well, it’s always best to be cautious, and your wife is right to encourage you to get checked if she has concerns. Even if you don’t think it’s necessary, it’s a sensible precaution. It’s good you’re here. Now, before we proceed, let's talk a bit about why she’s worried. Has she read something specific that prompted this, or is it more of a general concern?
PATIENT: Honestly? It was some article about… well, it was about people who travel a lot, and people with… different lifestyles. She saw I was away for a conference in Bangkok last month, and she got it in her head. It’s ridiculous, really. I was with colleagues the entire time. Proper business trip. I’m a compliance officer, not some… well, you get the picture. She doesn't trust anything these days. It's just easier to come and get this test done than argue with her.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a perfectly reasonable trip, and it’s certainly understandable why she might be concerned given what she read. While I appreciate you being upfront about that, we still need to take a thorough history to ensure we're covering all bases. It's my professional responsibility, you see. So, let’s start with that trip to Bangkok. Aside from being with colleagues, can you tell me a little more about the activities you were involved in?
PATIENT: Look, honestly, this is a bit insulting. Are you suggesting I’m… doing things I shouldn't be? I was at a compliance conference! Presentations, seminars, team dinners. Very boring, actually. We did visit a few temples, but always with a group. And, of course, we had a nice farewell dinner at a restaurant. A very reputable restaurant, I assure you. I’m a professional man, Doctor. I have a wife! Do you really think I'd jeopardise my marriage over… temples? This is just… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I assure you, I am not suggesting anything. I am simply gathering information. As a physician, my role is to assess risk factors, and that includes asking pertinent questions, regardless of how uncomfortable they might be. Your indignation is noted, but it doesn’t change the fact that we need to rule things out. It's standard procedure. Now, putting aside your trip, have you ever shared needles with anyone – for any reason?
PATIENT: Needles?! Are you serious right now? I have never shared needles with anyone. What kind of question is that? I’ve never even been near a needle outside of a doctor’s office. This is getting ridiculous. I’m starting to feel quite offended. Look, I work in compliance. My whole job is about following rules and regulations. I’m the last person who’d be doing anything… illicit. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time. I think I’m ready to just stop this now. I clearly don’t need this test, and I’m not enjoying this line of questioning.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your frustration, truly. However, dismissing the possibility without a proper assessment would be irresponsible of me. You may lead a very disciplined life, and I commend you for that. But risk assessment isn’t about who someone is, it’s about potential exposures. Let’s move on. Have you ever received any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions? No. Never. Look, this is absolutely absurd. I came here to appease my wife, and I’m being interrogated like I’m a criminal. I haven’t had a blood transfusion, I haven’t shared needles, and I’ve been perfectly faithful to my wife for the entire 10 years of our marriage. Are we done yet? I have a very important report due tomorrow, and frankly, this whole experience is deeply upsetting. I'm beginning to question why I even bothered.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. I’m going to ask one final question, and then we can discuss moving forward. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections diagnosed?
PATIENT: .
