DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Dr. Glowka! It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. They just won't stop. Been going on for… oh, goodness, must be three days now. It's a bit embarrassing, really, but they’re quite persistent.
DOCTOR: Three days of persistent hiccups – I understand that can be very disruptive, and certainly frustrating. Could you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, they’re… regular, I suppose. Not like a huge, booming thing, more like a little… hic… jump. And they come every few minutes, usually. Sometimes when I’m eating, sometimes just… sitting. It doesn't seem to matter much, really. It’s just… annoying! I haven't been able to enjoy a proper cup of tea in days, and you know how much a Fijian woman loves her tea.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand – a good cup of tea is essential! And I appreciate you describing them so clearly. “Regular, little jumps” is very helpful. Have you noticed anything that specifically triggers them, or makes them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I did have a bit of a fright the other day – young Timmy, the neighbour’s boy, ran right into me while I was gardening. But that was two days ago, and they started before that, I think. I did eat a rather large meal on Sunday… lots of cassava and fish… maybe that? No, I eat cassava and fish all the time! Honestly, Dr., I haven’t a clue. They just started. It's most peculiar.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear trigger identified, and it doesn’t seem related to a specific event, despite the fright or the meal. And they started roughly three days ago. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… No, not really. I feel perfectly fine, otherwise. No heartburn, no nausea… just the hiccups! I’ve been sleeping alright, eating alright… Everything else is just… normal. Maybe I’m just getting old! You know, these things happen when you reach a certain age. Though three days is a bit much, even for me!
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you’re feeling otherwise well. And while hiccups can be more common with age, three days is certainly worth investigating. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? Well, I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back – had to get them seen to, but they're alright now. And… oh, yes! I had a bout of the flu last winter, but that's about it. Nothing serious, never been in hospital or anything like that. I was married for a long time, but we divorced years ago, so no history of anything connected with that, thankfully! I take a little something for my blood pressure, that’s all. Just a small pill, once a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some knee trouble in the past, the flu last winter, and medication for blood pressure. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Here we are! It’s… Amlodipine, I think. Yes, Amlodipine Besylate. Five milligrams. I’ve been taking it for… oh, must be five years now, maybe more. It keeps things nice and steady, that’s all. Never had any trouble with it, until these hiccups started, of course! It's funny, isn't it? Everything was fine, and then suddenly... hiccups!
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine Besylate 5mg daily. That's good to know. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. No, not really. I’ve never been one for allergies. I can eat pretty much anything, thankfully. I've lived in Fiji all my life, so I’m used to all sorts of things! No reactions to any medications that I know of. I get bitten by mosquitoes, of course, who doesn't? But no actual allergies, no. I can’t think of a single thing I'm allergic to, thankfully! I’m a pretty tough old bird, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. It will just take a few moments. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. That sounds perfectly alright. I'm not afraid of a little examination. Go right ahead! I always like to know what's going on, even if it's just a little listen. Don’t hesitate to tell me if anything feels strange, alright? I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, it's all part of getting old!
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, if you could just take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Everything sounds and feels normal so far. Now, are you currently experiencing any hiccups while I’m examining you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. They seem to come and go, you see. It's not constant. Funny, isn’t it? They were just going a few minutes ago, but they’ve quieted down now that you’re listening to me. It's like they’re shy! But I can assure you, Dr., they are real. They’ll be back any moment now, I’m sure of it! It’s just my luck. They always pick the worst moment to make an appearance.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know – intermittent hiccups. It does sound like they're coming and going. Given your age, the absence of other symptoms, and the medication you’re taking for blood pressure, it’s likely these hiccups are benign, perhaps related to mild irritation of the phrenic nerve. However, since they've persisted for three days, I’d like to order a few simple blood tests just to rule out any underlying imbalances. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests? Well, alright, dear. If you think it’s best. I don't mind a little poke if it puts my mind at ease. It’s always good to be thorough, you know. I trust your judgement. What sort of things will they be looking for? Just so I know what’s going on, you see. I'm not a scientist, but I do like to understand things!
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll check your complete blood count – that looks at your red and white blood cells to rule out infection or anemia. We'll also check your electrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium, and calcium, as imbalances can sometimes cause hiccups. And finally, we'll check your kidney function. These are all fairly routine tests. Do you have any preference as to where you'd like to have your blood drawn?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that sounds very sensible, dear. All those things, you say? Well, alright then. As for where to have it drawn… There’s a little clinic just down the road, near the market. Old Man Hemmings runs it. He's a bit slow, but very gentle. He always remembers my name, which is nice. Would that be alright, or is there somewhere closer you recommend? I’m not in any hurry, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Old Man Hemmings' clinic sounds perfect. I'll send the order over there electronically. You should be able to go whenever it’s convenient for you. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if the hiccups worsen, or you develop any other symptoms, like shortness of breath or chest pain, please don’t hesitate to come back or call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds lovely, dear. Old Man Hemmings will be pleased. Thank you for sending it there. Hmm... let me see. No, I don’t think so. You've explained everything very clearly. Shortness of breath… chest pain… I’ll remember that. Honestly, Dr. Glowka, you've put my mind at ease. I was worried it was something serious, but you've made me feel much better. Just a bit of phrenic nerve irritation… it doesn’t sound so bad. Thank you. Perhaps these hiccups will finally go away on their own now that I'm not worrying so much!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mirriam. I’m glad I could reassure you. Sometimes, simply addressing your concerns can make a difference. And if they don’t resolve on their own, we’ll have those lab results to guide us. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a lovely day, and I hope those hiccups disappear soon!
