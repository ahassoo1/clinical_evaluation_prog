DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Duplichan, is it? Yes, well, honestly, it’s just… curiosity, I suppose. My daughter keeps telling me I need to get “checked out.” Says it’s what people do these days. Not that I feel particularly unwell, you understand. Just…keeping up with things. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: "Curiosity," and preventative care are certainly… admirable motivations, Ms. Calvery. Though generally, people come in when something is bothering them. Still. Your daughter is…correct. Routine check-ups are advisable. Let’s start with a bit of history then. You say you aren’t feeling unwell currently. Can you tell me about any health problems you have experienced in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The past… that's a long time ago. Let me think. My husband… he had a bad heart, you know. Passed away ten years ago now. And I… I had my gallbladder out. A long, long time ago. Maybe thirty years? Something like that. And… well, the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Nothing major. Honestly, I can’t really remember all the details. It was all so long ago, and frankly, not very interesting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thirty years ago for the gallbladder removal. And your husband’s cardiac history… that’s relevant. I’ll need to document that. And you mentioned “usual aches and pains.” Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… my knees bother me sometimes. Especially when it’s cold. And my back… it stiffens up if I bend over too much. I used to garden, you see, but it’s gotten harder. Not that I do much of it anymore. And… my hands, they get a little shaky now and then. But really, it’s just…old age. I don't expect you to fix it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: “Old age” is rarely a diagnosis, Ms. Calvery. Those symptoms can have various causes, and it's my job to determine them. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. My daughter fills it for me, so I don't even bother with the name. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for the aches and pains, if they’re really bothering me. But that’s it, I think. Honestly, I try to avoid taking too many pills. All those chemicals can’t be good for you.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication…and ibuprofen as needed. Do you know the dosage of either?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. My daughter handles all that. I just… take them. She tells me how many, and when. I wouldn't even know where to look on the bottle. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good with these things. I leave all the complicated stuff to her.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to verify those dosages with your daughter then. It's important to know exactly what you're taking. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don't care for shellfish, but that’s just a preference, not an allergy. And… I haven't had any bad reactions to any medicines, as far as I remember. Though, years ago, I did get a rash from some sort of lotion. But it was ages ago, and I don't even remember what kind it was. It wasn't important.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known drug allergies, shellfish aversion, and a distant, unspecified rash. We'll document that as “no known allergies.” Now, Ms. Calvery, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your habits, just to get a more complete picture. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. My mother always said smoking was terrible for you. And my husband… he hated it too. No, never touched a cigarette in my life. I can’t stand the smell, honestly. It's a nasty habit.
DOCTOR: Never smoked. Good. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a little. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing fancy. Just… a small glass. And not every night, mind you. Mostly on weekends. It helps me relax, you see. But nothing more than that. I'm not a big drinker, Doctor. I’m a sensible woman.
DOCTOR: Occasional wine consumption. Alright. And finally, Ms. Calvery, could you tell me about your typical diet and exercise routine?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I try to eat healthy. Mostly. I like soup, and chicken. And vegetables, when I can get them. My daughter brings me groceries, so it's usually whatever she picks out. Not that I complain. She means well. As for exercise… well, I don’t do much. I used to walk, but my knees bother me, you see. Now I mostly just… sit. I enjoy watching television. It's not very exciting, I know. But that's my life now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Ms. Calvery, while I appreciate your…candor, there are some significant gaps in your medical history. It makes it difficult to assess your overall health. However, based on what you've told me, and given your age, I think it’s prudent to conduct a physical exam and order some basic laboratory tests. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Tests? Well… I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. It’s just… I don’t like needles. And I’m not very good at standing for long periods. But if you insist… I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just…try to be quick, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand. We will proceed as efficiently as possible. First, I'd like to check your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Please sit here on the examination table. Then I will listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. We’ll take it slowly. Blood pressure is… 148 over 82. Elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 76, regular. Respiration rate is 16. Temperature is 98.6.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that… bad? The blood pressure, I mean. My daughter always worries about my blood pressure. She says it runs in the family. I try to relax, Doctor, I really do. But I always get so nervous at the doctor's office. It makes everything worse, I think.
DOCTOR: It’s slightly elevated, Ms. Calvery. But a single reading in the office isn't definitive. It can be influenced by anxiety, as you pointed out. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Normal heart and lung sounds. Normal abdominal exam.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… good, doesn't it? Everything normal. My daughter always says I worry too much. She says I’m a hypochondriac. Though, honestly, I do worry. It's just my nature, I suppose. What happens next, Doctor? More poking and prodding?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a relative term, Ms. Calvery. And while your initial exam findings are unremarkable, we still need to gather more information. I will now assess your reflexes. This involves a quick tap to your tendons. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but shouldn’t be painful. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is within the normal range. Normal reflexes. Now, to complete the exam, I'd like to check your feet for sensation. Close your eyes, and tell me when you feel this.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes… yes, I feel it. That's cold. Very cold. Is that a good thing? My feet get cold easily, you know. Even in the summer. My daughter says it’s because of my circulation. It's always something, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Sensation is intact. However, your feet do feel cool to the touch. That could indicate peripheral vascular disease, though further testing is required to confirm. Now, Ms. Calvery, based on your history and this brief examination, I recommend a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a urinalysis. I also suggest an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. We'll also order a TSH to check your thyroid function. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. All those… tests. It sounds… complicated. And expensive, I imagine. My Medicare… will it cover all that? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure I understand what any of those things are. A lipid panel? A TSH? It sounds like you're speaking a foreign language. Will it take long? I have a hair appointment on Friday.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover the necessary tests, Ms. Calvery. We will verify that before proceeding. As for the tests themselves, they are standard blood work and an EKG – a simple, non-invasive procedure to check your heart’s electrical activity. The hair appointment is… irrelevant at this time. These tests are crucial to establishing a baseline of your health and identifying any potential underlying issues. We must address any concerns before focusing on cosmetic appointments. The nurse will draw your blood now. She will explain the procedure. Do you have any further questions for me at this moment?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I suppose not. It's just… a lot to take in. And I don’t like needles, you know. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… please tell the nurse to be gentle. And… hurry, if possible. I'm getting rather tired. I’ll just… go with the flow, I suppose. That's what my daughter always says.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. I will review the results when they are available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Please let me know if you experience any unexpected symptoms before then. .
