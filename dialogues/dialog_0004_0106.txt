DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about my foot. This sore… it just won’t heal. Been fussing with it for months now, and frankly, I’ve seen enough doctors to paper this whole clinic, and none of them seem to get it right. It's embarrassing, really, at my age.
DOCTOR: Months, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, months. Started small, a little nick I barely noticed. Now look at it! It’s…well, it’s awful. And painful, especially when I try to walk. Though, what can you do, stuck at home mostly. It's the diabetes, isn't it? They always blame the diabetes. Though I manage it well enough, thank you very much. I watch what I eat.
DOCTOR: I see you have a history of Type 2 diabetes, and it does appear to be reasonably well-controlled, based on your A1C levels. But even well-managed diabetes can contribute to complications with wound healing. Now, let’s get a better understanding of this sore. Can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Oh, “describe it”? Honestly, Doctor, it looks like a hole. A red, nasty hole. It's on the bottom of my foot, near my big toe. It’s not a clean cut, all jagged around the edges. And it… it smells. Not terribly, but enough to notice. It sometimes weeps a bit, too. I’ve been putting bandages on it, of course, and trying to keep it clean. But it just…worsens. Really, it’s quite disheartening. I expect more from modern medicine, you know.
DOCTOR: A weeping, malodorous ulcer on the plantar aspect of your foot near the first metatarsal… Alright. And how long would you say it’s been actively weeping, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness…let me think. The weeping…it started a few weeks ago, maybe a month? It wasn’t constantly weeping at first, just when I’d take the bandage off, it would be…damp. Now it seems to be damp most of the time. It's unpleasant, I assure you. And it stains the bandages, of course. It’s a bother. Honestly, Doctor, it’s like it’s got a mind of its own.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any changes in the color or size of the sore recently?
PATIENT: Well, I haven’t been actively measuring it, Doctor. Do you expect me to carry a ruler around? But it certainly looks bigger. And the color… it’s a sort of… angry red. There’s some whitish stuff in the bottom, too, which I assume isn’t a good sign. It's not a pretty sight, I’ll tell you that much. It just seems to be getting deeper. I’ve tried some ointments, various creams…nothing seems to touch it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or increased pain in your leg or foot recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. I check my temperature regularly, always have. Chills… not really. Though I do get a bit cold sometimes, but that's just old age, I expect. Pain…yes, the pain is worse. It's not sharp, not like a cut. It's a dull ache, mostly, but it throbs, especially if I put any weight on it. It keeps me up at night sometimes. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to worry. It's not like I want to lose my foot over a little sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cannington. I’m going to need to take a look at this foot myself. Can you please remove your shoe and sock so I can properly assess the wound?
PATIENT: Oh. Now you want to look at it? All this questioning and no actual examination! Fine. But be gentle, Doctor. My feet are rather sensitive, you know. I’ve had a long life, these feet have carried me a long way. And I do hope you've washed your hands.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cannington. I always wash my hands before and after each patient. Alright, let’s take a look. Hmmm. Yes, this is concerning. There is a full-thickness ulceration present on the plantar surface of your left foot, approximately 2.5 x 1.5 centimeters in size. The wound bed appears necrotic, with significant surrounding erythema and edema. There is a foul odor present, and I do note some purulent drainage. Palpation elicits significant pain. Peripheral pulses are diminished, but palpable. Capillary refill is prolonged at 3+ seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse is 1+, posterior tibial pulse is 1+. Sensation to light touch is diminished distally. It appears we’re dealing with a fairly significant infection, likely osteomyelitis, and inadequate circulation. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and a wound culture. We’ll also need an X-ray of your foot to assess for bone involvement.
PATIENT: “Osteo-what-now”? And a wound culture? Honestly, Doctor, you’re speaking a different language again. All I know is it hurts, it smells, and it won't heal. I came here for a solution, not a list of complicated words and scary tests. And "inadequate circulation"? At my age? I’ve walked miles! What is all this meaning, exactly? Is this foot going to be alright, or isn’t it? Don’t tell me it’s going to have to be… removed. I won’t stand for that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your concern. "Osteomyelitis" is a bone infection—the infection has likely spread from the soft tissue to the bone. A wound culture will tell us what kind of bacteria is causing the infection so we can choose the right antibiotic. And "inadequate circulation" means the blood flow to your foot isn’t as good as it should be, which is hindering the healing process. Often associated with diabetes, and age. Based on my initial examination, this is serious. The longer this goes untreated, the higher the risk of complications, including—yes—potential amputation. But let’s not jump to conclusions. The X-ray will give us a clearer picture of the bone involvement. I am going to refer you to a vascular surgeon for a consultation to assess the circulation in your foot. And a podiatrist specializing in wound care will be necessary. We will also need to start you on broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately, pending the wound culture results. I'll write the orders now. Do you understand?
PATIENT: “Broad-spectrum antibiotics”? More complicated words. And a vascular surgeon? A podiatrist? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds like you're trying to frighten me. I came in here for a sore foot, not a full-body medical overhaul. I suppose I have no choice, if you insist. But I expect you to explain everything in plain English. No fancy medical jargon. And if any of these… specialists… suggest anything drastic, I want to be the first to know. And frankly, I expect a second opinion. I don't trust easily, you know. Are you sure there isn't anything simpler we can try? A stronger ointment, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I assure you, I am not trying to frighten you. I am being thorough, and frankly, your condition warrants it. A "stronger ointment" will not be sufficient, given the extent of the infection and potential bone involvement. This is not a simple case. I am obligated to explore all avenues to ensure the best possible outcome, and that includes referrals to specialists and comprehensive testing. I will, of course, explain everything in plain English, as you requested. I'll have the nurse print out detailed instructions for you, including a list of the medications you'll be taking and the contact information for the vascular surgeon and podiatrist. I understand your desire for a second opinion, and you are certainly entitled to one. However, delaying treatment could have serious consequences. I will arrange the consultations as quickly as possible. The nurse will schedule those appointments for you. Do you have any other questions, at this time?
PATIENT: Very well. But I’m holding you responsible for all of this, Doctor. All this fuss over a little sore. I suppose I have no choice but to trust your judgment, for now. Make sure these specialists understand that I expect a gentle touch. And I absolutely refuse to be poked and prodded unnecessarily. What about the pain? Can you at least prescribe something for the pain, immediately? I can barely sleep as it is. And is there anything I can do at home? Keep it clean, you said? Anything else? Don't just leave me with a list of appointments and complicated instructions. I'm an old woman, not a medical professional! .
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cannington. I will prescribe you a mild opioid pain reliever, enough to manage the discomfort until we get the infection under control. The nurse will also provide you with instructions for proper wound care: keep the wound clean and dry, elevate your foot whenever possible, and avoid putting weight on it. Do not attempt to self-treat the wound—leave that to the podiatrist. The nurse will also provide a detailed list of warning signs to watch for, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, fever, or chills. If you experience any of these symptoms, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here are the prescriptions, wound care instructions, and a list of the warning signs. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your appointments. I expect you to follow these instructions carefully. And I trust we've covered everything, for now?
