DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Kovtun. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. Why don't we start by you telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, yeah, hi Doctor. I'm just here for the results, you know? I did the tests last week. Just wanna know what they said, and then I can get going. I've got a pretty tight schedule today.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're here to discuss the results of the tests you completed last week. Absolutely. Let me pull those up now… Just to confirm, those were the complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that sounds right. Blood count, metabolism… and the thyroid one. Honestly, I don’t remember all the fancy names, just that they poked me a lot. Is everything okay? Or… not okay? Just tell me straight, if you can. I really need to know if I need to, like, change anything about my life right now.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness. I always aim to be as clear as possible. Let's go through these results together, and I'll explain everything as we go. I see here your complete blood count was within normal limits – that's good. Your metabolic panel was also generally normal, with the exception of a slightly elevated glucose level. And your thyroid stimulating hormone was also within the normal range. That elevated glucose level is what I want to focus on. It's not drastically high, but it's enough to warrant some further discussion. Do you have any history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Okay, good, good. Normal stuff is good. Glucose… elevated, you say? Hmm. My grandma, on my mom's side, she had something with her sugar. Not sure what exactly, she lived back on Tahiti. She always ate a lot of fruit though, mangoes mostly. Is it… serious? Like, am I gonna need shots or something? I'm not a fan of needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of sugar issues is helpful to know. It sounds like your grandmother may have had diabetes, or pre-diabetes. And yes, that's the direction we need to investigate. The elevated glucose level doesn’t automatically mean you have diabetes, but it does mean we need to look into it further. It could be a number of things – stress, diet, even dehydration can temporarily raise your blood sugar. However, given your family history, it’s important to rule out pre-diabetes or diabetes. We’re not talking about shots right now. The first step is to repeat the glucose test to see if that elevation was a one-time occurrence. We can also do an A1C test, which gives us a better picture of your average blood sugar levels over the past few months. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. Repeating it sounds… reasonable. And the other one, the A1C… what exactly does that involve? Is it more poking? Because seriously, I'm good on the poking for a while. And stress… yeah, I’m pretty stressed lately, trying to get everything organized. Work's been crazy. Does that really affect it that much?
DOCTOR: No, no more poking for now. The A1C test just involves a simple blood draw, like the one you had last week. It doesn’t require any special preparation. And yes, stress absolutely can affect your blood sugar levels. When you're stressed, your body releases hormones like cortisol, which can raise your glucose levels. It's a temporary increase, but if you're chronically stressed, it can contribute to higher blood sugar over time. We'll want to rule out any underlying medical conditions and get a clearer picture of your average blood sugar before making any definitive decisions. So, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to repeat the glucose test and draw an A1C. In the meantime, let's talk a little about your current diet and lifestyle. Could you describe a typical day for me, starting with breakfast?
PATIENT: Okay, good, no extra poking is good. Yeah, a typical day… hmm. Breakfast is usually just coffee, to be honest. I'm not really a breakfast person. I rush out the door to get to work, usually grab something on the go – a pastry, sometimes. Lunch is whatever's fast and easy, like a sandwich or salad. And dinner… it varies. Sometimes I cook, sometimes I get takeout. I try to eat healthy when I can, but it's hard with my schedule. I do drink a lot of juice, though. Orange juice, mostly. Is that bad? Does the juice thing matter? I’m trying to cut back on sugar, but it’s a habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you being so open. Coffee for breakfast, something quick for lunch, varying dinners… and a habit of drinking a lot of orange juice. Yes, the orange juice does matter, unfortunately. Even though it’s natural, orange juice is very high in sugar. It can cause a rapid spike in your blood sugar levels, and it doesn’t provide the same sustained energy as eating a whole fruit. That's something we'll definitely want to work on. It's not about eliminating things completely, but about making healthier choices and finding substitutes. Before we get into specific dietary changes, let's quickly review your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions – high blood pressure, high cholesterol, thyroid issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. I get tired sometimes, but who doesn't? I haven't really been to a doctor in… years, to be honest. Just for check-ups, when my employer made me go. I don't have insurance, so I try to avoid it if I can. But I figured getting these results checked was important, since my grandma… you know. Okay, so less juice. Got it. Is there anything else I should be doing right now besides the juice thing? While I’m waiting for the next tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know – no major health concerns and you generally feel healthy. It’s good you’re prioritizing this, especially given your family history. Besides reducing your juice intake, I'd recommend focusing on incorporating more fiber into your diet. Fiber helps regulate blood sugar levels and keeps you feeling full longer. Things like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes are excellent sources of fiber. And staying hydrated is also crucial – aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. Also, even though you're busy, try to find some time for physical activity – even a short walk each day can make a difference. Anything that gets your heart rate up. It doesn't have to be strenuous. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No medications. Nothing. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills unless I absolutely have to. I'm trying to be natural, you know? And I try to walk when I can, but my job is pretty sedentary. Mostly I’m on the computer all day. Okay, less juice, more fiber, stay hydrated… got it. That sounds… manageable. Can we just schedule the tests now? I really need to get back to work. I’m already behind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That all sounds very manageable, and you're taking all the right steps. Let me see… we can schedule you for a follow-up appointment next week, Tuesday at 10:00 AM?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10:00 AM works. Perfect. Okay, great. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you not making a huge deal out of everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kovtun. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, we’re just gathering information at this point. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions before your appointment. And don't stress too much. Have a good day, and I'll see you next Tuesday.
