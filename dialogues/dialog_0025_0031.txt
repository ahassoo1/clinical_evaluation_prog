DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. So, you're 18… and here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, that’s right. My left leg is… well, it’s gotten quite big, it has. And the doctor back home said it’s somethin’ to do with my heart beatin’ all funny. Atrial… somethin’ or other. I just… it’s swollen, and it’s a bit uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: “Atrial… somethin’ or other,” you say. Right. So, the doctor back home suspected a cardiac issue contributing to swelling in your left leg. And how long has this swelling been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… not too long, I don’t think. Maybe a couple of weeks? It started small, just a bit bigger than usual at the end of the day. But now… well, it’s quite noticeable, even in the mornin’. I didn't think much of it at first, I just put my feet up more. But it hasn’t gotten better.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks. And has anything made it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not that I’ve noticed, really. I’ve been tryin’ to take it easy. Walkin’ isn’t too bad, but standin’ for long is… unpleasant. And maybe a wee bit warmer weather makes it feel worse, but it’s been warm these last few weeks, so I can’t be certain. I'm not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes some sense. “Wee bit warmer” isn’t exactly a medical measurement, but I appreciate you trying to be specific. And standing aggravates it. Alright. Let’s get a bit more detail. Any pain associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: Oh, aye, there is a wee bit of pain. Not sharp, more… achy. It's mostly if I press on it, or if I try to… move my foot a certain way. Not awful pain, just… bothersome. It doesn't keep me up at night or anything, but I know it's there. It's hard to explain, it's just… a heavy ache.
DOCTOR: “Heavy ache” is… descriptive. And how about anywhere else?
PATIENT: Elsewhere? Do you mean… other parts of my body? Well, I've been feelin' a bit tired lately, more tired than usual. But I thought that was just because I haven't been sleepin’ well. Worryin' about my leg, mostly. And sometimes, I get a wee bit short of breath if I walk up the stairs too quickly. But that's been happenin’ on and off for a while now, even before the leg swelled. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, and shortness of breath… interesting. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite’s been fine, actually. I’ve been eatin’ normally, I think. Not much different from usual. I still enjoy my porridge in the mornin’, and a nice bit of fish and chips when I’m feelin’ fancy. I haven’t lost any weight, if that’s what you’re askin’. I haven’t been weighin’ myself regularly, mind you, but my clothes still fit, so…
DOCTOR: Right. Alright. Let's have a look at this leg. If you don't mind. We’ll need to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what's goin’ on. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. That’s alright. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just… be gentle, please? It’s a wee bit tender.
DOCTOR: I will be as efficient as possible. Now, please lie down on your back. I’m going to start by feeling the pulses in both of your legs and feet. Then, I’ll measure the circumference of both calves, just to see how much larger your left leg is. Hmm. Your pulse in your left foot is… diminished. Not absent, but weaker than your right. And as suspected, your left calf is noticeably larger. Approximately two inches greater in circumference than your right. No obvious bruits. Now, I'm going to press on your leg to check for pitting edema. Yes. Significant pitting edema. Alright. I’m going to need to order some bloodwork. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a D-dimer. And an EKG. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found in the exam, it's highly likely we're dealing with deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot in your leg – potentially stemming from a cardiac issue causing reduced blood flow. The D-dimer will help confirm the clot. The EKG will assess your heart function. This is serious, Nixon. We need to rule out a pulmonary embolism—a clot that travels to your lungs.
PATIENT: Oh… my. A blood clot? And in my lungs? That sounds… terrible. I… I didn’t realize it could be that bad. My heart causing it? Is there… anything I should have done? Should I have known somethin’? I just thought my leg was a wee bit swollen and I was tired. A pulmonary… what did you call it? Is that… life-threatenin’?
DOCTOR: It can be, Nixon. A pulmonary embolism – a clot that travels to your lungs – restricts blood flow and can be fatal. The risk depends on the size of the clot. That's why we're doing these tests immediately. Now, as for whether you should have known something… it’s not always obvious. Sometimes, these things develop gradually. The fatigue and shortness of breath could be early indicators, but they are common symptoms, so it’s easy to dismiss them. And the diminished pulse in your foot is… concerning. You mentioned a doctor back home suspected a cardiac issue. Did he perform any tests?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. He listened to my heart, and he said it was… irregular. He called it “atrial fibrillation”, I think. He said it wasn’t anything to worry about right away, that I just needed to be monitored. He didn’t do any scans or blood tests, just listened with the wee tube thing. He said I should see a specialist if it bothered me, but I… well, I didn’t want to bother anyone. It just made my heart flutter a bit sometimes. And I'm a student, I didn’t have much time. Perhaps I should have.
DOCTOR: “Perhaps” is an understatement, Nixon. Atrial fibrillation—an irregular heartbeat—significantly increases the risk of blood clot formation. To not follow up on that is… suboptimal. Regardless, we’re dealing with the situation now. We need to get you started on anticoagulation—blood thinners—to prevent the clot from growing and traveling. I’m ordering a CT scan of your chest to rule out a pulmonary embolism. And I’m going to admit you to the hospital for monitoring. This is not something you can treat at home. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Admit… to the hospital? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I have classes starting next week! And I… I live alone. I don’t have anyone to… To look after things, or… or come visit. I just… I really didn’t expect any of this. Is there… is there any other way? Perhaps the blood thinners alone? Or… or could I come back every day for… for somethin’?
DOCTOR: Nixon, with all due respect, your academic schedule is irrelevant at this moment. Your life is at risk. Daily visits are not sufficient. This isn't a case of simply taking a pill and hoping for the best. We need to monitor your breathing, your heart rate, and your blood coagulation levels continuously. The CT scan will determine the severity of the situation. If a pulmonary embolism is detected, you'll need immediate intervention. I understand your concerns about living alone, and we can arrange for social work services to assist you with your belongings and any necessary arrangements while you’re hospitalized. But delaying treatment is not an option. I'm ordering the CT scan and preparing the admission paperwork. We will discuss the long-term management plan—including anticoagulation therapy and cardiology follow-up—once we have the results. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: Oh… all right. If you really think it's that serious… I suppose I have no choice. No, I don't have any allergies, thankfully. No, not to any medication that I know of. I get a bit itchy sometimes with… with bee stings, but that's all. And… and I get a bit seasick on boats, but that's not really an allergy, is it? This is all… a bit overwhelming. Will I be able to… to contact my family?
DOCTOR: No, seasickness isn't an allergy. And yes, you can absolutely contact your family. We have patient phones and visiting hours. Social work will also assist you in making those arrangements, if you'd like. Look, Nixon, I understand this is frightening. But we’re going to get through this. We’re going to stabilize you, identify the underlying cause of the blood clot—likely the atrial fibrillation—and develop a long-term treatment plan to prevent this from happening again. Let's get the CT scan done. The radiology technician is expecting you. And then we’ll get you settled in the hospital. I'll be by to discuss the results as soon as they're available. Do you have any emergency contact information for your family?
PATIENT: Oh… right. Yes, I have my aunt's number. She lives in Inverness. Her name is Moira Kreckel. It’s… 01463-723-891. And… thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. I’m still a wee bit scared, but… thank you. I suppose… I suppose I should go then? For the scan?
DOCTOR: Yes. Go to radiology, and tell them Dr. Fourney ordered a CT scan for deep vein thrombosis and possible pulmonary embolism. They will walk you through everything. And Nixon… try to remain calm. The sooner we get a diagnosis, the sooner we can start treatment. I’ll see you after the scan. Now go, please.
PATIENT: .
