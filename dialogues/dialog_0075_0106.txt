DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. It's about time someone saw to this foot of mine. It's been bothering me for weeks, and frankly, I’ve had better care from my granddaughter. It’s a sore, a nasty one, right here. <points to foot> And it just won't heal. I’ve been told it’s from the sugar sickness…diabetes, they call it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Louine. It's good you're getting it checked out. And you're right to mention the diabetes – that can certainly contribute to slow healing and foot problems. Let's take a closer look. Could you tell me a bit more about the sore itself?
PATIENT: Well, it started small, just a little redness, really. I didn't think much of it. Then it got…deeper. Now it’s painful to walk, even with shoes. And it smells. Don't think I need to tell you that. I keep it covered, but…it's just not right. I’ve tried putting some ointment on it, the kind my granddaughter gets me, but it hasn’t done a thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started as redness, progressed to deeper pain, and now has an odor. And the ointment isn't helping. Thank you for telling me that. Do you remember when approximately it started, Louine?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it was after the church picnic, I believe. Yes, definitely after the picnic. That was… oh, goodness. Let me see. July something… the tenth, maybe? Yes, around July tenth, I’d say. It was a hot day, and I was wearing new sandals. Probably rubbed something raw. Though I've worn sandals for years and never had this trouble.
DOCTOR: Around July tenth, after the church picnic, and you were wearing new sandals. That's helpful. And you haven't noticed any fever, chills, or redness spreading up your leg at all?
PATIENT: Fever? Goodness, no. I take my temperature regularly, you know. Always have. No fever. And redness spreading? No, just right there on the bottom of my foot. It’s contained, thankfully. I wouldn’t want this getting any worse. It’s already a nuisance enough. <frowns>
DOCTOR: Good. That’s good to hear. Now, let's take a closer look at the foot itself. Could you please remove your shoe and sock for me so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here. Don't mind the stockings; they’re support hose. Doctor’s orders, you know. <struggles slightly to remove shoe and sock, revealing a visibly ulcerated foot> There. Not a pretty sight, is it? And it aches.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. I see the ulcer. It's located on the plantar aspect of your foot, approximately 2cm in diameter, with some exposed tendon visible. There’s surrounding erythema and some drainage present. I'm also noting diminished pulses in your foot, which is something we'll need to monitor closely. And yes, it does look quite painful. Do you have any allergies to medications, Louine?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I've taken all sorts of things in my life. Back in my day, we didn't fuss over allergies like they do now. Though… I did have a reaction to some cream once, many years ago. Made my skin all bumpy. But I can't recall what it was. Probably some old-fashioned stuff they don’t use anymore. Just whatever the doctor gave me back then.
DOCTOR: Alright, a possible reaction to a topical cream in the past. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, Louine?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, of course. The little white pill, once a day. And something for my water retention, helps with my swelling. The pink one, I believe. Oh, and a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were low. That’s all, I think. Unless… oh, yes, sometimes I take a pain reliever if my arthritis is acting up. But not regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're taking a medication for blood pressure, one for water retention, vitamin D, and occasionally a pain reliever for arthritis. Do you know the names of any of these medications, Louine?
PATIENT: Names? Goodness, no. I just ask my granddaughter to fill my pill organizer each week. She keeps track of everything. I wouldn't know a Lisinopril from a… a papaya. I just take what she gives me. <sighs> It's all so complicated these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Louine. We can often look these up based on what the pharmacy provides. Now, I’m concerned about this ulcer, especially given your diabetes and the reduced pulses in your foot. It's important to prevent infection and promote healing. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar and white blood cell count. We’ll also need to get an X-ray of your foot to see if there’s any underlying bone infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. More poking and prodding. Well… I suppose it’s necessary. If it's going to help this foot, then yes, go ahead with the tests. But please, be gentle. And don’t keep me waiting too long. I have a bridge game this afternoon. <adjusts glasses sternly>
DOCTOR: Certainly, Louine. We'll do everything we can to be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll get the lab orders and X-ray requisition sent to the lab right away. In the meantime, I’m going to clean and dress the ulcer. I'll also apply a special antibacterial ointment. Would you mind if I take a photograph of the ulcer today?
PATIENT: Photograph? Goodness gracious, no! Absolutely not. I don’t need my foot plastered all over some chart. What would the neighbors think? No, no photographs. Just clean it and put something on it. That’s all. And please, hurry. My bridge partner is very particular about punctuality. <taps foot impatiently>
DOCTOR: Very well, Louine. No photograph. We'll proceed without one. I understand your concern. Let me go wash my hands, and then we’ll get started cleaning and dressing the ulcer. It might sting a little, but I’ll be as gentle as possible.
PATIENT: Hmph. Sting, she says. Everything stings these days. Well, just get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get to my bridge game. I haven’t missed a game in twenty years, you know. <crosses arms and looks away, clearly bracing herself>
DOCTOR: Alright, Louine. I’m going to gently clean the area with a saline solution. This will remove any debris and help prevent infection. Then I’ll apply the antibacterial ointment and cover it with a sterile dressing. This may feel a bit cool and there might be some mild discomfort, but please let me know if it's too painful. I’m being very careful…
PATIENT: Ooh, that is cold! And it stings, just like you said. Careful now, careful! You’re tugging at it… It feels quite raw, you know. I haven't slept well with the pain. Honestly, I don't know why they don't have something better than this water to clean it with. It’s like washing it with ice.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Louine. You’re right, it does seem to be causing some discomfort. I'm switching to a cotton swab now to be more gentle. And I’ll be as careful as possible. This is just to remove any dead tissue and ensure we’re starting with a clean base. We need to make sure any infection is addressed quickly. Do you feel any throbbing or increased pain now?
PATIENT: Throbbing… well, it’s always throbbing. That’s what it does. But it feels… sharper now. Like a little pinch with each swab. And it smells, you know. It smells awful. Honestly, I think it’s getting worse, not better. Are you sure you’re doing this right? My granddaughter knows a thing or two about wounds. She used to be a nurse’s aide. Perhaps I should have asked her to do this.
DOCTOR: Louine, I understand your concern and I appreciate you letting me know. You’re right to be cautious. It's important we address this properly. I’m being very careful to avoid any further irritation. However, given the throbbing and your concern about the odor, I'm starting to suspect there may be a deeper infection present. I am concerned enough that I want to consult with a podiatrist immediately. They specialize in foot care and can provide a more thorough assessment. Would you be willing to allow me to page Dr. Abernathy?
PATIENT: A podiatrist? What's wrong with you? Are you saying you can’t handle a simple foot ulcer? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I came here for treatment, not a referral to another doctor. My granddaughter warned me about doctors passing you around like a hot potato. Is this going to cost me extra money? I'm on a fixed income, you know. <frowns deeply> And honestly, the thought of another doctor poking at my foot…no. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Louine, I completely understand your frustration and concern. I apologize if I've made you feel passed around. That is not my intention at all. The reason I'm suggesting a podiatrist is because, given the level of concern regarding potential infection and your diabetes, they have specialized tools and expertise to properly assess and treat this, ensuring the best possible outcome. It’s true that a podiatrist consultation could incur an additional cost, depending on your Medicare coverage. However, preventing a serious foot infection is vital, and complications from untreated infections can be much more costly – both financially and health-wise. I want to emphasize that my primary concern is your health and preventing any further complications. However, I completely respect your wishes. If you are adamant about not seeing a podiatrist, I will proceed with a stronger antibiotic and a more frequent dressing change. But please understand that this carries a higher risk of complications. What would you like me to do?
PATIENT: Stronger antibiotic, then. And frequent dressing changes. But you will be doing them. I don’t want another doctor poking around. And if this gets any worse, if it starts throbbing constantly or smells even more foul, you’ll be hearing from my granddaughter. She’s a very…persuasive woman. And don’t even think about sending me to a podiatrist. I’ve made up my mind. Now, get on with it. I have a bridge game to get to.
DOCTOR: Very well, Louine. I understand. We’ll proceed with a stronger course of oral antibiotics, and I will personally oversee the frequent dressing changes here in the clinic. I will also schedule you for a follow-up appointment in two days to assess your progress. I want to emphasize the importance of watching for any worsening symptoms – increased pain, redness, swelling, fever, or a foul odor. If you experience any of these, please contact us immediately. Now, let me finish cleaning and dressing the ulcer, and then we'll get you set up with the prescription. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, that’s enough for now. Just get me the prescription. And make sure it’s one that won’t interfere with my blood pressure medication. My granddaughter does all the checking, you know. She’s very careful. Honestly, doctors these days… you don’t even listen to the patients anymore. Now, hurry up. My partner is expecting me. <taps foot impatiently>
DOCTOR: Here you are, Louine. This is a prescription for Amoxicillin-Clavulanate. I’ve double-checked for interactions with your blood pressure medication, and it should be safe to use. It's important to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better before it's finished. Here’s a sheet with written instructions on wound care and potential side effects. And here is the phone number for the clinic, should you have any concerns. I've scheduled your follow-up appointment for Thursday at 10:00 AM. Please arrive a few minutes early to allow time for check-in. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, that’s all. Just get me out of here. Honestly, this has been a most unpleasant experience. And don’t expect me to be singing your praises. My granddaughter will be hearing all about this. Now, if you’ll excuse me… <struggles to her feet, leaning heavily on a cane>
