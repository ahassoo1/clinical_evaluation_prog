DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 29 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, morning. Look, to be honest, I don’t really remember making an appointment. Something about…sleep? And getting…fitter? It’s all a bit hazy, really. My wife, bless her, she usually handles this sort of thing. But… well, she’s not around anymore. So here I am. I just feel…tired, I guess. And probably could use a bit of… shaping up. Not that I spend much time worrying about it.
DOCTOR: I see. A bit hazy, you say. That's...unfortunate. Well, we can certainly address both fatigue and general fitness. Though, before we delve into a fitness plan, let’s explore this fatigue. Is this a recent development, Mr. Redfern, or has it been ongoing?
PATIENT: Ongoing. Definitely ongoing. I mean, it's been…a while now. Since…well, you know. Everything. It’s just… harder to get going, harder to stay going. I don’t bounce back like I used to, that’s for sure. And honestly? I probably don't eat right. I just…don't have the energy to bother with all that fuss. It’s not like a proper diet is going to bring anyone back, is it?
DOCTOR: I understand. A significant life event can certainly disrupt one's routines and energy levels. “Not like a proper diet is going to bring anyone back,” you say. While that is true, proper nutrition can aid in the recovery process, both physically and mentally. It's not a cure, of course, but it can be supportive. Now, can you describe this fatigue a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Ugh. Let me think. It’s not… collapsing tired, you know? More like… a constant drag. Like I’m walking through treacle. I can do things, I still fix instruments all day, that takes concentration, but by the evening… forget it. I just sit. Watch telly. Maybe. Sometimes I can’t even be bothered with that. And getting up in the morning… that’s the worst. It just feels like… an effort. A huge effort. It’s not like I’m doing anything exciting to need energy for, either. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Constant drag, difficulty with morning activation… that's helpful. And you mentioned fixing instruments all day – is that physically demanding work?
PATIENT: Physically? Not really, no. It's fiddly, you know? Lots of small movements, bending over a workbench. It requires concentration, like I said. But it’s not lifting heavy things or running around. It’s more… mentally tiring, I suppose. Though after a long day, my back does ache. Probably from hunching over. But I wouldn’t say it’s the cause of this… drag. It’s just… everything feels heavier, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Everything feels heavier.” I see. Now, let's move on to some more systematic questions, if you don't mind. It’s standard procedure. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not… really. I eat. When I remember. It’s not like I’m actively losing weight or anything. I just don’t… crave things. I used to enjoy cooking, a proper Syrian meal, you know? But that feels… pointless, now. It just ends up being… whatever’s easiest. Frozen dinners, mostly. Or a sandwich. Nothing exciting. Not that I need to be excited about food. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Reduced enjoyment of food, eating for convenience… alright. Now, have you experienced any difficulty sleeping – trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrested?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep. Yeah, that’s… a whole thing. I fall asleep alright, usually pretty quickly. It’s staying asleep that’s the problem. I wake up… a lot. Usually for no reason. Just… awake. Then I lie there. Thinking. Or not thinking. Just… staring at the ceiling. And even when I do get a few hours, I wake up feeling… like I haven’t slept at all. It's frustrating, to be honest. I’ve tried a few things. Warm milk. That doesn’t work. Everything feels… temporary.
DOCTOR: Interrupted sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep… and warm milk ineffective. I see. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about other potential symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Really? Do you need to know that? Look, I fix instruments. I don’t… discuss that sort of thing with doctors. It feels… invasive. I mean, I suppose if you have to know… everything’s pretty normal. Maybe a little… irregular. But nothing dramatic. Honestly, I’m not sure what you’re getting at. Is this related to the… drag?
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I assure you, these questions are all pertinent to a thorough medical evaluation. Changes in bowel habits can be indicative of a variety of underlying conditions, even those seemingly unrelated to fatigue. “Irregular,” you say. Can you elaborate?
PATIENT: Fine. Look, it’s just… sometimes I go more often, sometimes less. It’s… unpredictable. And sometimes it’s… difficult. That’s all. Honestly, it’s not exactly a pressing concern. I haven't got anything serious, if that's what you're implying. I just… don't see what this has to do with feeling tired all the time. It feels like you're fishing for something, and frankly, it’s a little… demeaning.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll move on. Have you experienced any recent weight loss, or conversely, any unexplained weight gain?
PATIENT: No. I told you. I haven’t noticed any changes in my weight. I’m… the same. Solidly the same. I haven't been weighing myself, obviously. What’s the point? It’s not like it’s going to magically fix things, is it? Look, I appreciate you doing your job, but this feels… pointless. Are you actually going to help me, or are we just going to catalogue my… bodily functions?
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I assure you, I am conducting a necessary assessment. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I used to be perfectly healthy. Before… everything. I didn’t exactly spend my life running marathons, but I wasn’t sickly. I fix instruments. It requires a certain amount of… stability. I can't exactly be collapsing on the workbench, can I? Look, if you want to know, my wife used to handle all this. She made sure I went to the dentist, got my eyes tested. I just… showed up. Now I’m here, being interrogated about… bowel movements. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I’ve broken a finger once, fixing a particularly stubborn lute, but that’s it. No operations. No… anything serious. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I'm wasting my time here. Is there actually anything you can do about feeling tired all the time, or is this just… a formality?
DOCTOR: Let's discuss your family history, Mr. Redfern. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, mental health issues?
PATIENT: My family? Look, they were… Syrian. We didn’t exactly spend our lives keeping detailed medical records, alright? There was… illness, of course. But nothing specific that I can recall. My mother had… aches and pains. Old age, mostly. My father… he worked hard. He had… stress. That's about it. Honestly, it feels like you're trying to find something, anything, to pin this on. And frankly, it’s a little insulting. I just want to feel less tired. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Absolutely not. I fix instruments, alright? Delicate instruments. You don’t fix instruments with nicotine-stained fingers, do you? It’s… impractical. And frankly, disgusting. Look, are we almost done? I have… things to do. Or, I would have things to do if I wasn’t spending my afternoon answering invasive questions about my bowel movements and smoking habits.
DOCTOR: No smoking. Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. When I have dinner. It’s not like I’m a… a heavy drinker. I don’t need to drink. Honestly, it just… tastes nice sometimes. But it’s not a regular thing. And definitely not enough to… cause problems. Look, is this actually going to lead to anything useful, or is this just… standard procedure?
DOCTOR: Occasional alcohol. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I don’t believe in all that. Pills and potions… it’s just… masking the problem, isn’t it? I prefer to… deal with things. Or, I used to. But as you can see, it’s not exactly working out. Look, I'm starting to feel a little… patronized, to be honest. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed to a physical examination, then. If you’ll just allow me to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… try not to poke too hard. And honestly? I doubt you’ll find anything. It’s not like a stethoscope is going to magically reveal the cause of my tiredness, is it? Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: “Heart sounds are within normal limits. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no palpable masses. Mildly decreased bowel sounds. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted.” “Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is normal.” “Your weight is 105 kilograms, which is… substantial. And your height is 190 centimeters. That puts your BMI at…” “…approximately 29.1. That’s considered overweight.”
PATIENT: "Overweight?" "I'm built like an instrument repairer! I need some substance to support the work! And I already told you, I haven't noticed any changes in my weight." "Is that it? Is that your grand diagnosis? I'm overweight? Honestly, I came here for help, not to be lectured about my physique." "What now? Are you going to suggest I go on a diet and take up jogging?"
DOCTOR: “Mr. Redfern, I am simply documenting my findings. Your weight is a factor. We also need to consider your lifestyle and diet. Given your reported fatigue and decreased enjoyment of food, coupled with the intermittent sleep disturbances, I recommend a comprehensive blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions – thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, anemia, diabetes. Additionally, I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss a potential referral to a registered dietitian and… perhaps, a sleep specialist.” “These are standard procedures, Mr. Redfern. It’s a process of elimination.”
PATIENT: “A process of elimination?” "So, more tests. More appointments. More… poking and prodding?" "Fine. Do whatever you need to do. Just… get it over with. But honestly, I don't have much faith in any of this. It feels like you're looking for something that isn't there." "When can I expect the results?"
DOCTOR: “The blood work will take approximately three to five business days. I will have my secretary contact you once the results are available. In the meantime, I will write a requisition for the blood tests and a referral for the dietitian. A sleep study would require a separate referral, we can discuss that at a follow-up appointment depending on the blood work results. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: “No. No allergies. Nothing. I’ve always been… robust, I suppose. Just… tired. And frankly, a bit fed up with all this.” "Is that it? Can I go now?"
DOCTOR: “Yes, Mr. Redfern. You may go. My secretary will schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the blood work results are available. Please bring a list of any over-the-counter medications you may be taking, even vitamins. And… try to get some rest.” “Good day.”
PATIENT: "Good day." "Rest. As if that's possible."
