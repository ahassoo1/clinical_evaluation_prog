DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I'm Dr. Sham. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Good morning to you. It’s this foot. Been botherin’ me for weeks now, and it just won’t heal. It’s a terrible eyesore, really. And painful, of course. A person can't be expected to hobble around with something like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. A foot problem…weeks now, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks! Honestly, it feels like months. I told my daughter, Leilani, about it ages ago, and she keeps saying “Mom, you need to see someone,” as if I don’t have any sense. It’s not like I enjoy walking with a sore foot, you know. It's just... it hasn't gotten better, and I figured I should come. Though I doubt anyone here can actually do anything about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And where exactly on your foot is the pain?
PATIENT: Right here, on the bottom. It's not just on it, it’s in it. A deep ache, and it gets worse when I try to stand. Though, frankly, everything aches these days. It’s old age, I suppose. Not that anyone here would understand.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything specific caused this pain, as far as you recall?
PATIENT: Specific? Goodness, how would I know? I walk, don’t I? I used to walk down to the store every day, before this trouble started. Perhaps it's the shoes. Though I’ve always worn sensible shoes. Leilani says I need new ones, but these are perfectly good. It’s probably just…circulation. My ankles swell up something awful sometimes. It’s just the way things go when you get older. You don't need to ask me about every little thing that happened in the last eighty-nine years to figure it out, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. I understand you've had this pain for weeks, it’s on the bottom of your foot, worsens with standing, and you suspect it might be circulation. Let's do a quick exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better sense of what we're dealing with. Can you describe the swelling?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just… puffy. Both ankles, mostly. Worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet. They get red sometimes, too. And feel warm. Though, honestly, everything feels warm these days. It's this heat, I suspect. Though I don't see why a little puffiness would cause such a terrible sore on my foot. It's quite baffling, really. Is this going to take long? I have errands to run, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just take a look at your foot and ankles. Okay, I see some redness and swelling along the arch of your foot, and your ankles are definitely swollen. There's tenderness when I press here… Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes! That’s exactly where it hurts. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… throbbing ache. A very unpleasant throbbing. You don’t need to poke it so hard, you know. Is this going to require some sort of…invasive procedure? I don’t like needles, and I certainly don’t want anyone cutting into my foot. It’s quite fragile, you know.
DOCTOR: No cutting, I assure you. And we’ll avoid needles if we can. It could be plantar fasciitis, which is inflammation of the tissue on the bottom of your foot. The swelling in your ankles is something we need to investigate further, though. Do you have any pain in your chest or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Oh, plantar fasci-whatsit? Fancy name for a sore foot. Honestly. No, no chest pain. I get a little winded walking up the stairs, but that’s just… age. I don’t go around doing calisthenics, you know. And I haven’t been short of breath, unless it’s exceptionally humid. Is this…serious? Because I have a bingo night next week, and I certainly can't miss that.
DOCTOR: It’s good you don’t have chest pain. The swelling in your ankles, combined with the foot pain… it could be a sign of something more than just plantar fasciitis. It's important to rule out other possibilities, like a blood clot or heart condition. We’ll need to do some blood work, and I'd like to get an EKG to check your heart. And perhaps an ultrasound of your leg. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An EKG? Ultrasound? Goodness gracious. All this for a sore foot? It seems a bit… excessive, don’t you think? I mean, my father lived to be ninety-two, and he never had any of these tests done. Just a bit of liniment and a good rest, that’s all he needed. But… … if you insist. But I warn you, I don’t do well with waiting rooms. And I absolutely refuse to be poked and prodded all day. Can’t you just give me something for the pain? Perhaps a strong cream? Bingo night is very important, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cannington. We’ll try to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. We’ll start with the blood work – just a routine check. And the EKG is very quick – just some stickers on your chest. We can order an ultrasound if needed after the initial results. For the pain, we can try a topical cream, but it may not be enough. I can also prescribe something stronger if necessary, but we want to avoid that if possible. Let's start with the blood work and EKG, and then we’ll discuss the next steps. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood and get you set up for the EKG. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Hmmph. I suppose. But I want it noted on my chart that I’m protesting all this unnecessary fuss. And I expect a prompt return of results. I don't have all day to sit around waiting. And please, tell the nurse to be gentle. My veins aren't what they used to be. Yes, gentle. That’s very important.
DOCTOR: Noted, Ms. Cannington. I’ll let the nurse know to be as gentle as possible. We'll get these tests done quickly, and I'll review the results as soon as they’re available. Let me call her now. Nurse, could you please come to room three?
PATIENT: Oh, finally. About time. I don’t like being kept waiting. It’s very undignified, you know. I hope this nurse knows what she’s doing. I’ve had some bad experiences with nurses in the past. They poke and prod without any consideration for a person’s feelings. It's dreadful, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cannington. I assure you, our nursing staff is excellent. They are very experienced and compassionate. Just try to relax, and we'll get through this. I’ll be back shortly to discuss the next steps once the tests are underway. .
