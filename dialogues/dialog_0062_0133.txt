DOCTOR: Hi Melvenia, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I just need some papers signed, really. I have some health forms here that need… verifying, I guess you’d say. For some things I’m applying for. It’s a bit of a hassle, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I can definitely help with that. It sounds like you need some forms completed for an application. No problem at all. Before I sign anything, though, I always like to get a little bit of your medical history, just to be thorough. It helps me ensure I’m providing the most accurate information. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that’s fine. I don’t have much of a history, to be honest. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. But go ahead and ask what you need to. Let’s just get this over with, please. I have a lunch date I can’t be late for.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. We’ll be as quick as possible. Let's start with the basics. What kind of things are you applying for that require these forms?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… assistance. For seniors. Housing, mostly. And maybe some help with… things. It’s a long process, lots of paperwork. That’s why I need you to sign these, to say it’s all correct. It's very confusing, all these rules and regulations.
DOCTOR: Okay, assistance programs for seniors. That makes sense. It's good you're taking care of this, and I'm happy to help with the forms. Just to confirm, you said you generally have good health… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I haven't been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, probably five years? Maybe more. Just regular check-ups. Nothing major ever. I had the flu once, a bad cold a few times. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but it’s usually fine. Honestly, I mostly just get tired these days. It comes with the age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you haven’t seen a doctor regularly for the past five years, mostly just experiencing some fatigue and you take medication for your blood pressure. What is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… it’s a little white pill. I get it refilled every month. I… I don't remember the name. I just tell the pharmacy to keep sending it. My daughter usually handles all that, to be honest. I'm terrible with names. It starts with an 'A', maybe? Or a 'B'? It’s so frustrating when my mind plays tricks on me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Melvenia. It’s very common to forget medication names! Don't worry about it. We can look it up through the pharmacy if you’d like. In the meantime, do you know the dosage you take, or how often?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. That would be wonderful. I think it’s… one pill. Every morning. It's a small one. And, oh! It’s pink, I remember it’s pink! I really wish I could remember the name. My mind is just… not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, one pink pill every morning. Let me check our system… Ah, yes, I see it. You’re taking Amlodipine 5mg daily. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s it! Amlodipine. See? I knew it started with an ‘A’. Thank goodness you found that. It's such a relief when someone else knows what’s going on. Now, can we please just get these papers signed? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Melvenia. Glad we got that sorted out. Before I sign, just a couple quick questions – have you had any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weight? Not really. I’ve always been… slender. Maybe a little less lately, but nothing drastic. I eat alright, I think. Not a big appetite, to be honest. I’m just a small person.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant weight changes, and a smaller appetite. Have you been experiencing any trouble breathing, any chest pain, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, no trouble breathing. And no chest pain. My ankles… sometimes they feel a little puffy, but I figured that was just from standing too long. It goes away when I sit down and put my feet up. Nothing to worry about, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, no chest pain, and occasional ankle puffiness that resolves with rest. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always asks, and I always say no. I’ve always been lucky that way. I think I'm just a pretty simple person, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And finally, do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Not a drop of alcohol, and I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said it was bad for you, and I listened to her. Good habits, you know?
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Well, Melvenia, everything sounds reasonably stable. Given your history and the answers you've provided, I’m happy to sign these forms for you. Just to be clear, these forms are stating that you generally enjoy good health, and we’ve discussed a current medication of Amlodipine 5mg daily. Do you have any questions for me before I finalize everything?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. I just appreciate you taking the time to do this for me. It's a relief to have it over with. I really need to get to my lunch date now, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Melvenia. Here are the completed forms. It was a pleasure meeting you. However, I do want to mention, since you mentioned some fatigue and occasional ankle swelling, and haven’t seen a doctor in five years, it might be beneficial to schedule a more comprehensive check-up. We could do some blood work to check your thyroid, kidney function, and just get a general overview of your health. It's a good preventative measure, especially as we get older. Would you be interested in scheduling that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Another appointment? Honestly, Doctor, I’m really trying to avoid that. I just want these forms signed and get on with my life. I appreciate the thought, but I’m fine. Really. I’m just a bit… tired. It comes and goes. Thank you, though.
DOCTOR: I understand, Melvenia. You’re welcome to decline, of course. If your fatigue worsens, or the ankle swelling becomes more frequent or severe, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. Here's my card with the clinic number. Have a lovely lunch date, and be sure to take it easy!
