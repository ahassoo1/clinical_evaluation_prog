DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh... good morning. I think... my husband make appointment for me? Something about... learning things? I forget. It's… about my health, I guess. I work with metal, very hard work. It’s…hot.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. It sounds like your husband was concerned about your health, perhaps related to your work. That’s very thoughtful of him. No need to worry about forgetting details, we’ll take our time. So, you work with metal, and it involves hard work and heat, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Very hot. And… loud. Always loud. I… make things with the metal. Sheets. For… buildings? Or maybe roofs. I don't really… look at where they go. My hands… they hurt sometimes. And I get… tired. Very, very tired. Is this… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, so hard work with metal, involving heat and loud noise. You're experiencing hand pain and significant fatigue. It's good you're bringing this to our attention. Those symptoms can be related to your work, and it's important to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the hand pain?
PATIENT: It… ache. All the time, a little bit. But after work… really bad. Like… someone hit my hands with hammer. And… sometimes numb. I wear gloves, but… it still hurt. Is… is it broken? I don't think so. I still can work. Sort of. It just… not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, an ache with numbness, particularly after work, even with gloves. That does give us some clues. It doesn’t sound like a typical break, but we'll need to examine your hands to be sure. Before we do that, could you tell me about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm... long time. Maybe… a year? Or more? Everything blur together, you know? Work is always busy. Always… making things. I… don't really remember when it start. Just… slowly got worse. My husband say I complain more. He say I need to… see doctor. He worry I push myself too hard. He always say that.
DOCTOR: A year or more, a gradual worsening... and your husband is rightly concerned about you pushing yourself too hard. That’s very observant of him. It’s common for these things to develop slowly, and it's good you're addressing it now. Now, aside from the hand pain and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. Sometimes… I get dizzy. Especially when I stand up fast. And… my skin feel very dry. Always dry. I put lotion, but it never help much. Oh! And… I sometimes have trouble sleeping. I… toss and turn all night. My husband snore very loud. It doesn't help. Is that a symptom? Snoring?
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to mention, Ms. Fontanazza. Dizziness when standing, dry skin, and difficulty sleeping – yes, those can absolutely be related and contribute to how you're feeling. Your husband's snoring is… not a symptom you have, but I understand how that can disrupt your sleep! To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? I… don't really have one. I never really… sick. I get small cold sometimes. But… never anything serious. I don't go to doctor. Not until now. My husband say I need… check up. He worry about my… blood pressure? He mention that. I don’t know what that is. I eat okay, I think. Lots of rice. And fish. Not much… vegetable. Is that bad? I forget what the doctor tell me. Always forget.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Fontanazza – no serious illnesses in the past. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember specific medical advice; that’s what I’m here for. We’ll take things slowly. Your husband is right to be concerned about your blood pressure – it's a measure of how your heart pumps blood through your body. We'll check that today. To continue, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. No surgeries. No hospital. I… cut myself sometimes at work, small cuts. But I just put bandage. That’s it. I… very careful, mostly. And… I try not to think about getting hurt. It… scare me. My mother… she get sick very bad when I was young. I don’t want to be like her. I just want to work. And… make my husband happy. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s perfectly natural to want to work and make your husband happy. And it's understandable that your mother’s illness has made you cautious about your health. Now, are there any illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... family... my mother... she had... trouble breathing. Always cough. She get very thin. And my father... he had… problem with his feet. Very swollen. Always hurting. And… my aunt, she had something with her… mind? She forget things. Like me. But… much worse. I don't really know much about it. We don't talk about it much. It… sad.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Fontanazza. That gives me a better understanding of your family’s health background. It's alright that you don’t know all the details; we'll focus on what you do know. Finally, before we move on to a physical examination, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to anything?
