DOCTOR: Hello Carmaleta, welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I just… I want to have a baby, okay? And I don’t want any trouble doing it. My husband… well, he passed, but I want a child. Is that so hard to understand? I'm not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Carmaleta. It’s perfectly understandable. And you’re right, time is precious. I’m so sorry to hear about your husband. That must be very difficult. So, you’re looking into options for having a child, and want to make sure everything goes smoothly. We can definitely explore that. To get started, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, it's… a blur. I went to the doctor when I had to, you know? Usual check-ups, maybe a flu shot now and then. Nothing major. My husband took care of all the real stuff when we were together. I have insurance, private, so that should cover things. I don't really remember names of doctors or anything, and honestly, I don't feel like digging through old papers. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Carmaleta. It’s very common to not remember everything off the top of your head. We have your insurance information, which is a good start. And we can look up some of your past records here in the system, with your permission, of course. It might help us get a clearer picture of things. If we can't find everything, that's okay too. We can focus on what's important now. Do you mind if I take a look to see what’s available?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever gets this over with faster. Just… don't expect much. I told you, I don't remember details. It's been a few years since I really needed a doctor. Just hurry, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, let me just pull up your file… Okay, I see some visits from about five years ago with Dr. Anya Sharma – mostly routine check-ups, some bloodwork, and a flu vaccine as you mentioned. There's a note about slightly elevated blood pressure during one visit, but it was only a single reading. And… it looks like a standard Pap smear in 2020, all normal. Do you recall anything about that elevated blood pressure reading?
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure? Honestly, no. Probably just stressed about something. I always get a little worked up when I go to doctors. Needles and all that. It was probably nothing. Look, is this going to take long? I have errands to do, and… well, I just want to know if I can have a baby, and if I need a million tests to do it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Knowing about the blood pressure reading is helpful, though. It's good to have a baseline, even if it was just a one-time thing. To get a better idea of your current health and what might be involved in trying to conceive, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle and family history, if you don't mind. And then, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more questions? Fine. But keep it brief. And no poking and prodding if you can avoid it. My family history? Honestly, everyone's pretty healthy. Lived long lives, mostly. My mother had… something with her knees when she got old, but that's about it. No crazy genetic diseases or anything. And I try to eat okay, you know? Not a health nut, but I don't eat junk food all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No crazy genetic diseases is very helpful. And trying to eat well is a great start. Let's just clarify a few things. When you say "something with her knees", do you remember if it was arthritis, or something else?
PATIENT: Honestly, no! Old people problems, you know? Swelling, pain… she needed a cane eventually. I was busy with my husband and work, I didn't pay that much attention. Look, are we getting anywhere? I feel like you're asking me about things that don't even matter. I want a baby, not a history lesson about my mother's knees!
DOCTOR: You're right to push back, Carmaleta. I apologize if I’m getting bogged down in details. It’s just that sometimes seemingly small things can be important. However, let's focus on you and what’s relevant now. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies? No, not that I know of. I've taken… pain relievers, maybe? Antibiotics when I was sick. Nothing ever reacted badly. Look, I really don't have time for this. Can we just do some bloodwork or something? See if I'm even capable of having a baby before we waste any more time?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Bloodwork is a very good next step. We can check your hormone levels and assess your overall health. Before we proceed with the bloodwork, would you mind if I just quickly measure your height and weight and take your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Get it over with. Just… be quick about it. I hate being poked and prodded. And don't tell me I need to lose weight or anything, okay? I'm perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick measurement. Don’t worry, I won’t make any judgments. Okay, your height is 164 centimeters, and your weight is 130 pounds. Your blood pressure is 130/85. That blood pressure is slightly elevated, but it’s not a major concern at this point. We can monitor it. Now, let's get you set up for the bloodwork. It will just be a standard panel to assess your hormone levels and overall health. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Hormone levels? What does that even mean? Is something wrong already? I just want to know if I can have a baby, not a complicated explanation about hormones! Look, just tell me if I need a million tests or if I'm okay. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Carmaleta, let me explain simply. Hormone levels are just a way of checking if your body is preparing for a pregnancy. It's a very common test. It doesn't mean something is wrong, just that we're checking everything is functioning as it should. And no, you don't need a million tests at this point. We’ll start with this bloodwork, and then we can discuss the results and figure out the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just… get it over with. And hurry. I have errands.
DOCTOR: Alright. The phlebotomist is ready for you just down the hall. They'll take care of the bloodwork. I'll be here to discuss the results with you as soon as they are available, usually within a few days. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… tell them to be gentle. And get it over with quickly. I’m done here.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll let them know. Thank you for coming in today, Carmaleta. I’ll see you soon to discuss the results.
