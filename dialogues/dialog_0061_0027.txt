DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Josie. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, let’s just get this over with. It’s my stomach. Food keeps… coming back up. It’s a mess, really. And frankly, it’s embarrassing. I’m a busy man. Emergency Management doesn’t run itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds very unpleasant, and I appreciate you coming in despite a busy schedule. “Coming back up” – so you mean vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting? Is that what you call it? Yes, alright, vomiting. Though I wouldn’t use such… common language. It’s more like a regurgitation. And it happens after I eat, usually. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Though rich foods are worse, naturally. Honestly, I haven't had a decent meal in weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, “regurgitation” is perfectly fine. It helps me understand exactly what’s going on. So, it happens after most meals, but it’s worse with richer foods. And you said it’s been going on for weeks?
PATIENT: Weeks, yes. Maybe six? Seven? Time kind of blurs when you’re constantly worried about what’s going to happen after you take a bite of something. It’s not like it’s constant constant, but enough to be… disruptive. And my wife keeps giving me looks. She thinks I'm not enjoying our dinners enough. Women.
DOCTOR: Right, six or seven weeks. So, not with every meal, but frequent enough to be bothersome and affecting your enjoyment of food. I can understand how that would be frustrating, and your wife’s concern too. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s happening. Besides the timing – after meals – are there any other things you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Noticed? Well, it burns. Like…acid. Right in my chest. And it sometimes comes up with a sour taste. Honestly, Doctor, is this something serious? I have a lot on my plate, and I don't have time for…complications.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning in your chest and a sour taste coming up with the regurgitation. That certainly gives us more information. The burning sensation is important. Has it been getting worse over those six or seven weeks, or staying about the same?
PATIENT: Worse, definitely worse. At first, it was just a little…uncomfortable. Now? Now it’s…well, it wakes me up at night sometimes. And it’s starting to affect my appetite. I used to have a hearty appetite. Now I just…pick at things. My wife is thrilled, naturally. She says I'm eating like a bird. Honestly, a bird has it easy. They don't have Emergency Management meetings.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's progressing – started as mild discomfort, now waking you up at night and affecting your appetite. That's concerning. And just to be thorough, do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Like…headaches? No. Fever? Definitely not. Look, Doctor, I'm a practical man. I don't sit around cataloging every little ache and pain. It’s my stomach, it’s burning, food comes up. What more do you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're not one for details, but sometimes even small things can be helpful. Let’s try this: have you noticed any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No! I swallow perfectly fine, thank you very much. I haven't choked or anything, if that's what you're implying. I eat steak, for goodness sake. It’s not like I’m eating mush. Honestly, this is… unnecessary. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to list every possible human sensation?
DOCTOR: Okay, no trouble swallowing. And I apologize if it feels like I'm asking a lot of questions, Josie, it's just important to get a complete picture. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well… now that you mention it. My belt is a little looser. But that could be anything, right? Stress, running around… I’m a busy man, Doctor. I don’t exactly have time to weigh myself every morning. Honestly, I just want something to fix this. I have a disaster preparedness drill next week. I can't be dealing with this…regurgitation then.
DOCTOR: Okay, a looser belt – so some unintentional weight loss. That's another piece of the puzzle. Let’s shift gears a little. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! I’ve always been a healthy man. I eat a good diet – when I can keep it down, that is – and I exercise regularly. Well, I used to exercise more. These meetings… they take up all my time. Smoking is for… well, it’s just a bad habit. I wouldn't dream of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. And you mentioned you used to exercise more. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: A little wine with dinner, sometimes. A glass or two. Nothing excessive. I’m not a… a drinker, if that makes sense. Mostly I drink water. And coffee. Lots of coffee. Emergency Management requires…stimulation. Look, Doctor, are we almost done here? I have a briefing in an hour.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass or two of wine with dinner, and lots of coffee. That’s helpful. Now, I'm going to ask about some less pleasant things. Have you noticed any blood in your vomit, or in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood?! Good Lord, no! Are you trying to upset me? I would know if there was blood. My wife would definitely know. No blood. Absolutely not. This is… frankly, a little ridiculous. I think I’ve answered enough questions for one day. Can we please discuss a solution?
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood in your vomit or stool. That’s good. Alright, Josie, I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your abdomen. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. I haven’t got all day. And please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m listening to your heart and lungs, and everything sounds clear. When I press on your abdomen, it’s a little tender in the upper part, right here. Not severely tender, but noticeable. Do you feel any pain when I do that?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. It’s…uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It's not sharp, thank goodness. It's right there. Honestly, I just want this over with. I have a lot on my mind. Disasters don’t prepare themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And no pain radiating to your back?
PATIENT: No, no pain in my back. Just… that discomfort. It’s been getting worse, I suppose. I've been trying to ignore it. Look, Doctor, are you going to tell me what's wrong, or are we just going to poke around all day? I have a briefing to prepare for. A very important briefing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Josie. Based on what you've told me – the regurgitation after meals, the burning sensation, the sour taste, the weight loss, the tenderness in your upper abdomen, and the fact that it’s worsening – it sounds very likely you have gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Essentially, acid is coming back up from your stomach into your esophagus, causing irritation and these symptoms. It’s a very common condition, and usually manageable with medication and lifestyle changes.
PATIENT: GERD? Is that… serious? Will I need surgery? I don’t have time for surgery, Doctor! Disasters won’t wait for a recovery period! Medication… what kind of medication? And lifestyle changes? What does that even mean?
DOCTOR: No, Josie, GERD itself isn't typically serious, but it can lead to complications if left untreated, like inflammation of the esophagus or changes in the cells lining it. But we're not talking about surgery right now. Usually, we start with medication to reduce the acid in your stomach. There are a few different types – proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs, are very effective. They block the acid production. And lifestyle changes – things like avoiding foods that trigger the reflux, eating smaller meals, not lying down immediately after eating, and raising the head of your bed. We can start with a low dose of a PPI and see how you respond. I'll also give you some information about dietary changes and other things you can do to manage the symptoms. How does that sound?
PATIENT: PPIs… sounds like a lot of pills. Fine. As long as it doesn't interfere with my work. I suppose I can try it. But if it makes me sleepy or gives me side effects, I'm stopping. I need to be sharp. And raising the head of the bed? My wife will never agree to that. She likes the way it is. Just… give me the pills. And a written list of these… changes. And make it quick, Doctor. I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I'll write you a prescription for omeprazole, a PPI. It's a common one, and usually well-tolerated. And I'll print out a handout with information about GERD, dietary recommendations, and lifestyle changes. It’s important to take the medication as directed, even if you start feeling better. And if your symptoms don’t improve after a few weeks, or if they get worse, please let me know. We can consider other options. Here's the prescription, and this handout. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I suppose I’ll see how it goes. And if I develop any…disasters… related to these pills, I’ll be in touch. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Josie. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I hope you feel better soon. And remember, even Emergency Management professionals need to take care of themselves.
