DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It’s… this tiredness. Always tired. Like something heavy on me, you know? Been going on… a while now. Doctor said something about… liver. Not a good thing, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay, “tiredness… a while now.” And you mentioned another doctor said something about your liver?
PATIENT: Yes. Doctor… Patel. He did some tests. Lots of poking. Said liver not working right. I don’t… understand all the words he said. Lots of big words. He gave me… pills. But pills not helping much. Still tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: Right. Dr. Patel. And these pills… do you remember the name of them, or perhaps have a list with you?
PATIENT: No, no list. I… give them to my wife, she handles things like that. She knows. I just… take them. Yellow ones, I think? Small, yellow pills. Twice a day. Not much help. Honestly, I think they make me… more sleepy. Is that even possible?
DOCTOR: Yellow pills, twice a day… potentially making you more tired. Alright. Well, we’ll need to get to the bottom of this. Before we go any further, let’s just cover some basics. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I… eat. Sometimes. Not much appetite, maybe. And my stomach… feels funny sometimes. Bloated, you know? Like too much water inside. And… sometimes I itch. All over. Not all the time, but… it’s annoying. Is that a symptom? It’s just… I feel bad all over, really. Not good.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, decreased appetite, bloating, and itching. The itching… is it a general itch all over, or more localized?
PATIENT: All over. Everywhere. Arms, legs, back… even my face. Not… terrible, but… constant. Like tiny bugs crawling. My wife says I scratch too much in my sleep. She gets annoyed. It’s just… bothersome. And I’m always warm. Too warm, even when it’s not hot. Do you… understand? I'm telling you, something is wrong.
DOCTOR: Right. Constant itching all over, warmth… and you mentioned the bloating. Are you experiencing any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… what? You mean… going to the bathroom? Yes. Sometimes… soft. Very soft. Sometimes… hard. Not regular, you know? Never regular. Doctor Patel didn’t ask about that. He just… poked and prodded and talked about the liver. Everything is… confusing. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Okay. Irregular bowel movements. We need to look at these test results from Dr. Patel, and I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. We'll start with your abdomen. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Abdomen? You mean… you’ll poke me again? Honestly… I don’t like being poked. But… I guess. If you must. Just be gentle, please. My stomach is… sensitive. And quickly, if you can. I have things to do. Not that I have the energy to do them, but… still.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. I will be as gentle as possible. Just lie back on the examination table, and I’ll take a look. I’m just feeling for any tenderness or swelling. …Okay. A little tenderness in the upper right quadrant… and some mild distension. Not significant, but present. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes! There. That hurts a little. Like… a dull ache. Not sharp, but… uncomfortable. Been hurting there for a while, I think. I didn't tell Doctor Patel. He didn't ask about aches. Just poked and talked. It’s… annoying. Makes it hard to sleep. And it feels… full. Like I ate too much, even when I haven't. Is that… bad? Tell me honestly, doctor. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the upper right quadrant, feeling of fullness… and we've already established the irregular bowel movements, fatigue, itching, and warmth. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now. Bowel sounds are present, but a little… diminished. Now, I’d like to check your skin. Can you roll over for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. Skin? What for? I just told you I itch. You already know my skin is not good. But… alright. Do what you need to do. Just… be quick about it. This is… uncomfortable. I don't understand why you need to look at it. You already know.
DOCTOR: I’m just looking for any signs of… well, anything unusual. I see some mild jaundice… a slight yellowing of the skin. And some areas of scratching. This supports what you’ve already told me about the itching. Okay. Based on everything you’ve told me, and what I've found in the exam, it’s still possible this is related to liver issues, as Dr. Patel suspected. However, the jaundice and the itching, along with the diminished bowel sounds, raise some other possibilities. We need to run some further blood work, a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count, to get a clearer picture. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking? Honestly, doctor, I’m getting tired just thinking about it. But… I guess. If it will help me feel better. I just want to know what’s wrong. But tell me… is it serious? Is it… bad? Be honest with me, please. I don't want any surprises. And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to wait forever.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, I understand your concern. It’s impossible to say definitively at this point whether it’s serious without the blood work. However, the combination of symptoms does warrant further investigation. I'm not going to sugarcoat things – it could be something concerning, but it could also be something manageable. The blood work will help us determine the cause. It typically takes 2-3 business days to get the results back from the lab. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a cream for the itching to provide some relief. And I’m also going to order a stool sample analysis to rule out any gastrointestinal issues. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Cream for the itching… that sounds good. And… stool sample? Ugh. But… alright. If it helps. 2-3 days… that’s a long time to wait. But… I guess I have to. Just… tell me everything, doctor. Don’t hide anything. I want to know the truth, no matter what. And… how much will all this cost? I’m on Medicare, but… things still cost money.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. I assure you, I will be transparent with you about everything. Once the results are back, we'll discuss them thoroughly and explore all available options. Regarding the cost, your Medicare should cover a significant portion of the blood work and stool sample analysis. However, there may be a co-pay or deductible involved. I’ll have the receptionist provide you with an estimated cost breakdown before you proceed with the tests. Here’s the lab order and the prescription for the cream. You can pick up the cream at your usual pharmacy. The lab order can be taken to any certified lab. Once you've had the blood work and stool sample collected, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For listening. Doctor Patel… he didn't explain things very well. You seem… more thorough. I just hope… I hope it’s not too bad. I just want to feel normal again. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Grumman. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this and figure out what’s going on. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
