DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it's this light, you see. Been bothering me something awful lately. Feels like my eyes just can’t take it, even on cloudy days. It’s…photosensitivity, that’s what someone at the pharmacy said when I got some sunglasses.
DOCTOR: Photosensitivity, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s the word they used. Honestly, I didn’t even know that was a thing until a few weeks ago. It just…started happening. Everything seems so bright, and it gives me a headache pretty quick. It’s especially bad outside, but even the lights in the store can be a problem sometimes. It's been worrying me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, properly, around… mid-June, I’d say. Maybe the end of May? It was gradual at first, just a little discomfort. But it's gotten worse each week, definitely. I remember noticing it more and more when I was doing yard work, and then just walking around became difficult. I didn't really think much of it at first, thought it was just the summer sun, but it hasn't let up.
DOCTOR: So, roughly six to eight weeks. And is it just your eyes that are affected, or do you experience any other symptoms alongside the light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Good question, Doctor. It's mostly the eyes, yeah. But now that you mention it… my head does feel a bit achy more often than usual, even when I'm not in bright light. And I've been feeling… just a bit more tired, generally. Not sick tired, just… worn out, if you know what I mean? And sometimes my eyes feel gritty, like there’s something in them, even after I blink a bunch. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Gritty sensation… okay. And have you noticed any changes in your vision itself?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. Everything still looks clear, as far as I can tell. No blurry spots or anything like that. It's just… the brightness bothers me a lot, and then the headaches and the tired feeling. I was worried it might be something with my vision, but if everything still looks okay, that's a relief, isn't it? I do have to squint a lot more, though, even with sunglasses on.
DOCTOR: Let's do a quick examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Sure, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get it sorted, if possible. I’m a bit worried, you know? It’s just… things have been a bit difficult lately, and this is another thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll have a seat, I'll take a look at your eyes. I'm going to check your pupils and do a basic visual acuity test. Just follow my instructions, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'll do my best. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: First, could you read the smallest line of letters you can see on this chart?
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… Hmm… it’s a little blurry… …E… F… P… T… Okay, that’s as far as I can get clearly, I think. The ones below that are just a bit fuzzy. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, I'm going to shine a light into your eyes. Just look straight ahead. Pupils react normally. No obvious abnormalities there. Now, let me take a look at the surface of your eyes... Hmm. There's a little bit of redness in both eyes, but nothing dramatic. No ulcers or major inflammation. Do you wear contact lenses?
PATIENT: No, never have. Glasses, yes, since I was a boy, but no contacts. Is the redness a bad thing, Doctor? It doesn’t really feel red, if that makes sense. Just tired, mostly. It’s hard to explain. Everything feels… sensitive, all over. But the light really is the worst of it.
DOCTOR: Sensitivity… alright. It could be a number of things. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, it's unlikely to be anything overly serious, but we need to rule out a few possibilities. Have you started any new medications recently?
PATIENT: That’s good to hear it's not probably something too serious. No, no new medications. I take a daily multivitamin, and sometimes ibuprofen for aches and pains, but that’s it. And I haven’t changed anything about those for years. Nothing new at all. This all just started, like we said, in June. It’s really thrown me for a loop. I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. And do you have any allergies that you're aware of?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Not really. Not that I’ve ever noticed, anyway. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, as far as I can remember. My wife, bless her soul, she was the one with all the allergies, always sneezing and itching. But me? Nothing. I can eat anything, touch anything… No allergies to speak of, Doctor. I wish I could say the same for pollen, though! That stuff gets everybody sneezing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Considering everything, it could be a mild case of photophobia, possibly triggered by stress or fatigue. However, to be absolutely certain, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to rule out any underlying conditions.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work… alright. I can do that. I don’t really like needles, but… if it helps figure out what’s going on, I’ll do it. Is it just a regular blood draw, or…? And will it take long to get the results? I'm trying to schedule some yard work next week, and I don’t want to overdo it if something’s not right.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a standard blood draw. It shouldn’t take long at all. And the results usually come back within a few days – I'd say three to five business days, maximum. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding direct sunlight as much as possible, wearing sunglasses even on cloudy days, and getting plenty of rest. We’ll review the results together and then discuss the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Sunglasses and rest… I can manage that. Three to five days… alright. I’ll avoid the sun as much as I can. It’s been a bit of a summer for staying indoors anyway. Thank you for taking the time to look at me. It's reassuring to have some ideas of what it could be, and I appreciate you running the tests to be sure. So, where do I go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: Here’s a referral order for the lab just down the street, at 14 Elm Street. They're open from 7 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. Just take this order with you, and they'll take care of everything. If you experience any sudden vision changes or severe headaches, don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately, understand?
PATIENT: Yes, understood. 14 Elm Street… Thank you, Doctor. Sudden vision changes or severe headaches… I’ll keep that in mind. I really appreciate your help. I feel a bit better just knowing what to look for. Is there anything else I need to do, or anything else I should be aware of? I don't want to forget something important.
DOCTOR: No, I believe that covers everything for now. Just remember to follow the recommendations, and we’ll discuss the results when they come in. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you then. Try not to worry too much, and get some rest.
PATIENT: Okay, wonderful. Thank you again, Doctor. And thank you to your nurse, too. I will definitely try to rest. I won't take up any more of your time. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Komarov. Take care. .
