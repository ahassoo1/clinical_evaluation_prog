DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I am Dr. Blim. I see you’re 62 years of age. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, you understand? But enough to worry me, so my husband, Ricardo, he made me come. It feels… tight, like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: “Tightness,” you say. And how long has this “tightness” been occurring, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a week ago? But it was very little at first. Just a little uncomfortable. The last three days, though, it’s been worse. Especially when I walk up the hill to the market. It’s a pretty big hill, you know.
DOCTOR: And would you describe this pain as radiating anywhere – down your arm, perhaps, or to your back?
PATIENT: Sometimes! Yes, sometimes it goes into my left arm. Not all the way, just… the shoulder and a little bit down the arm. And, now that I think about it, a little bit in my jaw, too. It’s funny, isn’t it? Not like a toothache, but… achy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Achy,” you say. And does anything specifically relieve this discomfort, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Well, when I stop and rest, it gets better. Definitely better. And I sit down and take deep breaths, that helps a little too. My daughter, Isabella, she’s a nurse, she told me that. She said to breathe slow and deep. It doesn’t make it go away away, but it calms it down some.
DOCTOR: Do you have any shortness of breath associated with this chest discomfort, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Not really… no. I don’t feel like I’m running out of air. I just get… tired, you know? Like I need to stop and catch my breath because of the chest pain, not because I can’t breathe. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like when I used to run up and down the stairs with the kids! Not that I do that anymore, of course.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Ricardo always remembers these things. I have a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years ago. I take a pill for it, every morning. A small white one. And… I think my cholesterol was a little high last time I had it checked, but they didn't want to give me pills for that yet. Just told me to eat less fried food. Which is hard! I love my empanadas.
DOCTOR: And any previous surgeries or hospitalizations, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out. A long, long time ago. And when I was 40, I had a gallbladder removed. But nothing since then. No hospital stays or anything like that. Just the tonsils and the gallbladder. And, you know, the usual little things. A broken arm when I was a teenager, but that was just a cast.
DOCTOR: And what about family history, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a hard one. My father… he had some heart problems when he was older. He had to have a special machine put inside his chest, I think. A pacemaker, maybe? My mother, she lived a long life, but she had diabetes. And my brother, he has high blood pressure like me. Lots of problems on that side of the family, I think.
DOCTOR: Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure, Doctor. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I take a little bit of ibuprofen. But not very often, maybe once or twice a month. Just when I’ve been gardening too much.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications or anything else, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything! Empanadas, arepas, platanos… I’m Colombian, we eat everything! I mean, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Ricardo always says I should be more careful, but… I’m okay.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Are you going to be cold? This little gown doesn't keep you very warm.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, please. Heart rate is regular, but… I detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No tenderness to palpation. Now, let me check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is elevated… 150 over 90. Pulse is 78. Now, let’s check your extremities for edema. No edema noted.
PATIENT: Oh… is that bad, the murmur? My husband, Ricardo, he always says I worry too much. He says I need to relax more. I try, Doctor, I really do. But… it's hard when my chest hurts. What does it mean, the murmur?
DOCTOR: The murmur is… not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, Ms. Chelberg. Many people have innocent murmurs. However, given your symptoms and elevated blood pressure, I’m going to order some further testing to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. I’m ordering an EKG, a chest X-ray, and a complete blood panel, including cardiac enzymes. We’ll also need to schedule a stress test. The lab results will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low dose of aspirin to help with blood clotting and recommend you follow a low-sodium diet. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a lot of tests. And aspirin? I haven’t taken aspirin in years. Is it safe? And a low-sodium diet… that means no empanadas, doesn’t it? My daughter, Isabella, she’s a nurse… would she be able to look at the results with me? I get confused easily with all the medical things. And the stress test… is that going to be hard? I don't do well with… exertion.
DOCTOR: The aspirin is a low dose, Ms. Chelberg, and it's for preventative measures. Your daughter, Isabella, is welcome to review the results with you, though I will provide a full explanation myself. As for the stress test, it will be monitored by medical professionals, and you can stop at any time if you experience discomfort. These are the orders for your tests. The lab is located down the hall to your left, and the scheduler will arrange the stress test appointment. It is crucial you adhere to these instructions, Ms. Chelberg. Your health is your responsibility. Do you have any further questions regarding the testing itself?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. I understand. It’s just… a lot. What if… what if something is very wrong? My husband, Ricardo… he worries so much. And my daughter, Isabella… she'll worry too. Will you… will you tell me everything, even if it's bad? And… how long will the results take? I don't want to keep my family worried for too long.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, I understand your anxiety. However, it is premature to assume anything is “very wrong.” We are conducting these tests as a precautionary measure. I will, of course, explain the results thoroughly, regardless of what they may be. The lab results should be available within 24-48 hours, and we can schedule the stress test for sometime next week. Now, is there anything further I can assist you with at this time?
