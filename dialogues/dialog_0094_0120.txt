DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Yes, well, it's about… having a baby, I suppose. I don’t want any trouble with it, if you know what I mean. I’m not getting any younger, and I’d just like it to… happen. Quickly. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I see. You’re hoping to conceive and are wondering about optimizing your chances. Absolutely, that’s something we can discuss. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh, cycles. Honestly? They're… irregular. Always have been. Sometimes they're close together, sometimes… not so much. I stopped keeping track years ago, it was just too frustrating. Does it really matter? I just want to know if there’s something wrong with me, you know? I’m not a complicated case.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta, and you're right, everyone's body is different. Irregular cycles can sometimes indicate things that could make it harder to conceive, but it doesn’t necessarily mean there's something wrong. It just means we might need to gather a bit more information to understand what’s going on. Do you experience any pain with your cycles?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. It's not… crippling or anything. Just a bit of cramping, like a really bad period cramp. Nothing I can’t handle with some tea and a hot water bottle. Honestly, most women get cramps, don't they? I wouldn’t even mention it if it wasn't you asking. Are we getting somewhere with this, or are we just going in circles? I have things to do today.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. And yes, we are getting somewhere. The cramping is good to know, thank you. It's helpful information, even if it seems minor. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Ugh, history. Let's see… honestly, I don’t really have much of one. Just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing major. I had pneumonia once, years ago. And… well, my husband passed away a few years back. That was… difficult. But other than that, nothing you need to worry about. I’m generally a healthy person. I eat well, I try to get enough sleep… I don’t sit around all day, if that’s what you're thinking. Is this really necessary? All this digging… it feels a bit intrusive.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Carmaleta, and I apologize if it feels intrusive. My intention isn’t to pry, but to get a complete picture of your health so I can provide the best possible care. Knowing your medical history, even seemingly small details, can be important. I'm very sorry for your loss, by the way. That must have been incredibly difficult. Okay, and have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Just the pneumonia, like I said. And a broken arm when I was a child – fell out of a mango tree. A very silly story, really. Look, is this going to take long? I have an appointment later this afternoon and I don’t want to be late. I'm not prone to complications, honestly. I heal quickly. I just want to know if I'm able to have a baby without… a whole lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: We’re getting there, Carmaleta. I appreciate your patience. No surgeries is good to know. Let’s talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, or any issues with fertility?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that's a long story. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my aunt, on my father's side, had something with her stomach. Cancer, maybe? It was years ago, I don't really remember the details. No one really talked about it. As for fertility… honestly, everyone just had babies. It wasn’t a thing people discussed. So, I really don’t know. I’m sure it’s nothing. Everyone has something, don’t they? Can we move on? I'm starting to feel a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Carmaleta. Knowing even a little bit is helpful, and it sounds like there may be some history of hypertension and potentially a gastrointestinal issue. We can certainly move on. Now, let’s talk about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not. Disgusting habit. Alcohol… I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive. A small glass. I’m not a party animal, if that’s what you’re thinking. I'm very sensible. And I eat a good diet, mostly. I try to, anyway. Lots of vegetables, some fish… I'm not one of those people who eats junk food all the time. Honestly, I take care of myself. Is this really going to help, or are we just ticking boxes? I’m starting to think this was a waste of time.
DOCTOR: It is helping, Carmaleta. Every piece of information gives me a clearer picture. Knowing you don't smoke and only have occasional wine is good. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just the occasional pain reliever for headaches, if I need it. Standard stuff. I don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. Honestly, I'm very healthy. I really don't understand why this is taking so long. Can we please just get to the point? I'm a busy woman. I just want to know if there’s something wrong with me, or if I can just… get on with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta, and I apologize for the delay. I assure you, I’m trying to be as efficient as possible. So, no regular medications or supplements. Okay. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not a single one. Honestly, I'm a very simple person. I don't have any fancy medical problems or sensitivities. Just a normal, healthy woman who wants to have a baby. Can we please get to the exam now? I have an appointment later and I'm running late. I’m really starting to regret coming here. It’s all so… invasive and unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Carmaleta. We're finished with the questions. You've been very thorough. If you're comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief abdominal exam. It's standard procedure, and it will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Quickly, please. I really don't have time for this. But if it's absolutely necessary... just be gentle. I don't like being poked and prodded. And no surprises, alright? Just tell me if you see anything "wrong". I'm not one for complicated explanations. Just the facts, if you please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. I’ll explain everything as we go, and will only share relevant information. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 128 over 78, which is within the normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Finally, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and there’s no tenderness or anything concerning. Everything appears normal so far. Would you mind stepping on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Just tell me the weight, alright? I don’t want to dwell on it. I'm perfectly healthy, as I said. Just get it over with. And don’t judge, alright? I have a sweet tooth.
DOCTOR: You weigh 130 pounds and your height is 164 centimeters. Your BMI is 24.2, which falls within the healthy weight range. Everything I’ve examined so far appears normal, Carmaleta. However, given your irregular cycles, I recommend a few blood tests to check your hormone levels and rule out any underlying conditions that might be affecting your fertility. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Seriously? More poking and prodding? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Can't you just tell me if I'm able to have a baby without all this fuss? I'm a busy woman, you know. This is going to take even more time. Fine. If it's absolutely necessary. But make it quick. And don’t tell me anything complicated, alright? Just a simple "yes" or "no" will do. I don't want to hear about estrogen levels or follicle-stimulating hormones. Just tell me if there's something wrong with me, or if I can just… get on with it. Are you sure you can't just give me something to help me get pregnant? A pill or an injection or something? This is all so… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The blood tests will give us valuable information and help me determine the best course of action. We'll check your levels of several hormones, including follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estrogen, and progesterone. It will also help to rule out things like thyroid issues. I promise to keep it as simple as possible and will only share the results that are relevant to your fertility. I will write you a lab order now. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. Regarding medication, there are several options available to help with conception, but it’s important to know why you’re having trouble conceiving first. Starting medication without knowing the cause could be ineffective or even harmful. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss your options in more detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get the paper. And make sure the lab is close by. I don't have time to drive all over town. Honestly, this whole experience has been… frustrating. I just want to have a baby, and it feels like everyone is making it so complicated. Don't bother explaining everything, just the address of the lab. And a phone number. I need to get this over with. Quickly, please. I have an appointment later this afternoon. And don't expect me to come back if the lab is too far away. I’m not prone to wasting time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Carmaleta. Here’s the lab order. The closest lab that accepts your insurance is City General Lab, located at 123 Main Street. Their phone number is 555-123-4567. Once you have the results, you can either schedule another appointment with me, or you can call the office to discuss them over the phone. I understand your frustration, and I want to assure you that I will do everything I can to help you achieve your goal of having a baby. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
