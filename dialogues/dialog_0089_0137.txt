DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay if I call you Doctor Roseburrough? My son, he make appointment for me. I… need paper for… old people place? He say I need check up for that.
DOCTOR: Please, call me Doctor Roseburrough. That's perfectly fine. Ah, yes, I see. Your son scheduled this as part of the assessment for assisted living, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Assisted… living. That right. He worry about me living alone now. Is good son. But I feel okay, mostly. Just… old, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good of your son to be so attentive. “Mostly” is good to hear, but let’s get a good picture of what “mostly” entails. Can you tell me a little more about what's been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. Well… sometimes I forget things. Not big things, just… where I put my glasses, or what I eat for breakfast. Small things. And… my knees, they hurt when I walk too much. Not all the time, but… after I walk to the store, they complain.
DOCTOR: Okay, forgetting things and some knee pain. We can definitely look into both of those. Let’s start with the memory issues. You said small things – like glasses or breakfast. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it more recent?
PATIENT: More recent, I think. Maybe… six months? Before that, I remember things okay. Not perfect, but… good enough. Now… sometimes I have to ask my husband twice. He is very patient man. He just say, "Lindra, you already asked!" But is annoying, you know? For both of us.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's frustrating when your memory isn't cooperating, and even more so when it affects your interactions with loved ones. And is it just recent memories you're having trouble with, or do you find it difficult to recall things from further back as well?
PATIENT: No, not old memories. I remember my childhood… my wedding… everything. Is just… today. What I do this morning. What I need to buy at the store. Things like that. And… sometimes I look at a name… and it take a long time to remember who that is. But is not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more recent memory, specifically things like daily activities and names. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your knees. You mentioned pain after walking. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Is… ache. Dull ache. Not sharp, you know? And… stiff. They feel stiff when I first stand up. After I walk a little, they loosen up, but then… after too much walking, ache come back. And… sometimes they crack. Not loud, but… you can hear it. Is annoying, too.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, stiffness, and cracking… Okay. Do you notice any swelling or redness in your knees?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. And no red. Is just… feel old. They look… normal, I think. My husband, he say they look normal. He is good at looking at things.
DOCTOR: Your husband sounds very observant. Alright. To get a better understanding, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your reflexes, strength, and looking at your knees a bit more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that okay. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle with my knees, please? They complain easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be very gentle. If you could sit here for me, please. First, let's just check your blood pressure and pulse. Then we'll take a look at those knees.
PATIENT: Okay. Is cold in here, a little. But is okay. I am used to cold.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138 over 82, which is a little elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Pulse is 76 and regular. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Can you point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Is… here. And here. Not always hurt both, but… usually. And… when I bend them, it feel… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay. There's some mild tenderness on the front and inside of both knees. No noticeable swelling or redness. I'm going to have you bend your knees as far as comfortable. There's some crepitus – that’s the crackling sound you mentioned – and a slight restriction in the full range of motion. It doesn't seem to be causing you significant pain with movement, is that right?
PATIENT: No, not significant pain. Is more… uncomfortable. Like… old hinges. You know? And… I worry about falling. That is why I walk slow. My son, he say I need to be careful.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're listening to your son. Worrying about falling is perfectly reasonable. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Strength is good, though slightly weaker in both legs, which is common with reduced activity. Okay, Ms. Abdollahi, that was helpful. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some age-related changes in your knees and some mild memory issues. The knee pain is likely osteoarthritis, which is very common. The memory issues, while concerning, don't immediately suggest anything serious, but we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Osteo… what? Is that bad? And… investigate? What does that mean? Will you… poke me with needles? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis simply means the cartilage in your knees has worn down over time, causing pain and stiffness. It’s not necessarily “bad,” it's very common as we get older and is manageable. And “investigate” just means we'll do a few tests to get a better idea of what's going on with your memory. We can start with a simple cognitive screening test right here in the office. It involves answering some questions and doing a few short tasks. As for needles, we may need to draw some blood, but that's just to rule out other potential causes of memory problems, like vitamin deficiencies. We can discuss that further before proceeding. No decisions need to be made right now. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Vitamin… deficiencies? I eat good food. Mostly. My husband, he cooks. He is very good cook. But… a test? Here? What kind of questions? Is hard questions? I don’t want to look silly.
DOCTOR: It’s wonderful that your husband is a good cook! Even with a good diet, sometimes we don’t absorb all the nutrients we need. The cognitive test is very simple, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s not about being “silly” at all. It’s just a quick assessment of your memory and thinking skills. The questions are things like remembering a few words, naming objects, or doing a simple calculation. It’s something most people can do without any trouble. It will take about 10-15 minutes. Would you be willing to try it?
PATIENT: Ten… fifteen minutes? Okay. If is only that long. But… if I forget the words, you won’t think I am… losing my mind? My son, he worry about that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Ms. Abdollahi. Everyone forgets things sometimes. It’s a perfectly normal part of aging. This test is just a starting point, and it won’t determine anything definitive. If we find something that needs further attention, we can discuss it together and explore options. Let’s go over to that table and we can get started. Would you like me to call your husband in to join you?
PATIENT: No, no husband. He is at the store, getting… tomatoes, I think. He likes tomatoes. I can do it myself. Just… try to be patient with me. And… don't laugh if I say something silly.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Ms. Abdollahi. I promise I won't laugh. I'll be as patient as needed. Okay, let's begin. I'm just going to read you three words, and I'd like you to try and remember them. Then I'll ask you to recall them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Ready. But… speak slowly, please? My ears, they don't work so good anymore.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll speak slowly and clearly. Okay, here are the three words: apple, table, penny. Try to remember those three words. Now, I’m going to ask you a few other questions, and then I'll ask you to recall those words again. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Apple… table… penny. Is hard. My mind… is busy.
DOCTOR: It’s okay if it’s hard. Take your time. Now, what is today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s… date? Oh dear. Is August… is it the first? No… my son said… August 2nd. Yes, August 2nd. Is that right? I think is August 2nd.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Ms. Abdollahi. August 2nd. Very good. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh dear. The year… is it… is it 2023? No… my son said… 2025! Yes, 2025. Is very confusing. I forget so many things now.
DOCTOR: It is confusing, and it’s okay to forget. Now, let’s go back to those three words I asked you to remember. Can you tell me what those words were?
PATIENT: Words…? Oh… oh dear. I… I had them. Apple… table… and… and… Is gone from my mind. It slipped away. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. Please don’t apologize. It's very common to have difficulty recalling things, and this test isn’t meant to be stressful. You didn't need to remember them. Based on the results of this quick screening, it seems like we could benefit from some further evaluation of your memory. I'd like to order a comprehensive cognitive assessment with a specialist. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A specialist…? Is that… a brain doctor? Oh dear. I don’t want a brain doctor. What will they do? Will they… poke around in my head?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Abdollahi, not a brain doctor in that way. It's a specialist who assesses memory and thinking skills, usually a neurologist or neuropsychologist. They won't "poke around in your head." The assessment involves a series of interviews and tasks, similar to what we just did, but more detailed. It's a non-invasive evaluation that helps us understand what’s going on and identify potential causes. It's just to get a clearer picture, and there are many possible explanations for memory changes, most of which are manageable. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail, or would you prefer I have your son talk to them directly?
PATIENT: I think… I think my son. He understand things better than me. He can talk to them. But… will it cost a lot of money? I don't want to be a burden. We are on… fixed income, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Ms. Abdollahi. Your son would be happy to discuss the financial aspects with the specialist. I can provide you with their contact information and a referral. We will ensure we understand your insurance coverage before scheduling anything, and we can explore options if there are any costs. Now, let’s talk about your knees. We can start with some basic treatments, like physical therapy and over-the-counter pain relievers. Would you be interested in a referral to a physical therapist?
PATIENT: Physical… therapy? Is that… exercises? My knees don’t like exercises. But… if it help… maybe. My son, he always say I need to be more active. But is hard when it hurts, you know? Is hard.
DOCTOR: It is hard, and it's perfectly alright to be hesitant. Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles around your knees, improve your range of motion, and reduce pain. It won't be strenuous exercises right away, and the therapist will tailor a program specifically to your needs and comfort level. If you're willing, I can give you a referral, and you can try a few sessions and see if it helps. You can always stop if it’s too uncomfortable. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You are very kind, Doctor Roseburrough. And patient. Thank you for not laughing at me. My son will call about the… specialist and the therapy. And… is okay if I call you Roseburrough, right?
DOCTOR: Please, call me Roseburrough. It's my pleasure. I'm glad I could help, Ms. Abdollahi. Remember, taking care of your health is important, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Here's a summary of our visit with a list of instructions for you. Have a lovely day, and please give your son my best. Stop by whenever you need anything.
PATIENT: Thank you, Roseburrough. You too. And… tell your husband I say hello. He sounds like a very good cook.
