DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, frankly, I haven’t got all day. It’s my vision and hearing, both of them gone… mostly. It happened rather suddenly, and it’s quite inconvenient, as you can imagine. A surgeon shouldn't be unable to see or hear properly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie, especially given your profession. Sudden changes in vision and hearing are concerning. "Mostly gone," you say… could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. It's… difficult to explain. Things are blurry, very blurry. And muffled. Like someone put cotton in my ears. It’s not completely gone, I can still see shapes, and I can hear loud noises, but… details are lost. It’s just… unsettling. And I really don’t have time for this. I have patients, you know. Important ones.
DOCTOR: I see. So, blurry vision and muffled hearing… and it came on suddenly. That's helpful. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, dates escape me. It was… a few days ago, perhaps? Last week? It all feels rather… blurred, if you’ll pardon the expression. I was at the hospital, of course, seeing patients. And then… things weren’t quite right. I just assumed it was fatigue, at first. One does get tired, you know. But it hasn’t improved.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Julie, don't worry about exact dates. "A few days ago," that's fine. And it started while you were at the hospital, working. Did anything specific happen that you can recall right before you noticed the changes?
PATIENT: Specific…? No, not that I recall. A rather busy day, as always. Lots of children, lots of worried parents. The usual. I distinctly remember a particularly difficult case – a small boy with a rather nasty fracture. But no… nothing caused it, as far as I'm aware. I simply… noticed things weren’t as sharp as they should be. It’s quite frustrating, really. A surgeon needs her senses, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Julie. Your senses are vital to your work. Okay, so it started gradually while you were working, with no specific incident you can recall. Let's talk a little bit more about the symptoms themselves. Is the blurring and muffling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… fluctuates, I suppose. It's worse in the mornings, usually. And if I'm… stressed. Which, naturally, is quite often. The hospital, you understand. It’s a stressful environment. But yes, it's not constant. Sometimes it's… less noticeable. Though never truly gone. It's just… a persistent annoyance, really. And I haven't the time for annoyances.
DOCTOR: Worse in the mornings and with stress… that's good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the vision and hearing changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… No, not that I’ve consciously noticed. Perhaps a little… dizziness, occasionally. But I attribute that to long hours and insufficient sleep. And a general feeling of… being overwhelmed, naturally. A surgeon’s life, you understand. It’s not conducive to good health. .
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional dizziness. And you feel generally overwhelmed, which, as you say, is understandable. Now, just to get a full picture, have you had any headaches, ringing in your ears, or any pain in your head, neck, or face?
