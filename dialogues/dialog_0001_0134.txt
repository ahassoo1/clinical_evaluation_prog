DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it's been… a bit of a spell since I felt right. Mostly, I just don't feel hungry much anymore, and when I do eat, I get full awful quick. It's been going on for a little while now, I reckon. Not sure exactly how long, though. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, fuzzy. Like… trying to remember a dream, you know? I just… don't keep things straight like I used to. And it’s not just the food. I feel sick to my stomach a lot, even when I haven’t eaten anything. It's just… unpleasant. Is that making any sense? I worry about things sometimes, but mostly I just feel tired.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Kelder, I've got a waiting room full of people, so let’s try and be specific. When you say "sick to your stomach," is that nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Is that… a fancy word for feeling like you’re gonna be sick? Yes, that’s it! Nausea. That's the one. Sorry, Doctor. I don't always know what things are called. It happens more and more these days. It’s just… a queasy feeling, mostly. And it seems to be getting worse, not better. Do you… need me to explain anything else? I'm afraid I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. And how about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh my. Well, that's a… personal question, isn't it? Let me see… They've been… different. Not as regular, and… well, smaller. I haven’t really thought much about it, to be honest. It just seemed to go along with not being hungry, I suppose. Is that… important? I just try not to worry about things too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. I haven't been weighing myself, not regularly anyway. My daughter, bless her heart, she's been worrying about me. She said I look thinner, but I haven't noticed it myself. I used to be pretty active, working with the animals, but… well, I haven’t had the energy for that lately. I suppose I feel weaker, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of… anything like this?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That's a hard one. My mother… she passed away when I was young, from something… I don't rightly recall what. It wasn't this, though. And my father… he was a strong man, worked hard all his life. Never much talked about sickness. My Cherokee side… well, we didn’t have much access to doctors back then, so things weren’t always talked about openly. There was an aunt, maybe? She got sick, but I don’t know what with. Everything’s so hazy. I’m sorry I can’t be more help.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that I can answer! No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything the doctor's given me before. Though, like I said, I don’t take many things. Just what I need, really. My daughter keeps a list, I think. She's very organized. But I don't have any allergies that I’m aware of. It’s mostly just… getting old, I reckon. Everything feels a bit off these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam. Lie back on the table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. My bones aren't what they used to be, so… everything creaks a bit. Just take your time. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen… soft, non-tender, but…slightly distended. No masses palpable. Not much to report there. It's likely just some indigestion. We can run some bloodwork to rule out anything serious, but I wouldn’t worry too much. It's probably just your age.
PATIENT: Oh. That's… good to hear, I suppose. But I still feel awful sick to my stomach a lot of the time. And not hungry. Is bloodwork going to tell you anything about that? And what if it is something serious? I worry about my daughter, you see. She's already been through so much. She'd be devastated if… well, if something was wrong with me. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: The bloodwork will rule out anemia, check your electrolytes, and some basic organ function. It’s standard procedure. Look, Ms. Kelder, I’ve got other patients waiting, and frankly, this sounds like a fairly typical case of age-related digestive issues. But we can run the tests if it will put your mind at ease. I'll order a CBC, CMP, and a TSH. The lab results will be back in a few days. I'll also prescribe you something for the nausea. It’s not a long-term solution, but it should help with the symptoms in the meantime. Now, do you have any other questions, or can we wrap this up?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. That sounds… a lot of words. CBC, CMP, TSH… I won’t remember any of that. So, you don't think it's anything serious? Just… old age? But I feel so weak. And not being hungry… it's not just the food, it's like… my body doesn’t want it. I suppose… if you think the tests are a good idea, I should probably do them. But… what if they do find something wrong? Will you… tell me everything? Honestly? My daughter… she wants me to take care of myself. I don't want to worry her unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Kelder, I'm not going to speculate on hypothetical findings. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. I’ll call you with the results. Let’s just get you scheduled for the bloodwork and get you out of here. The nurse will set that up for you. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. No… I don’t think so. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… trying. I just… wish I knew what was going on. I suppose I’ll just wait for the phone call. Tell your nurse to speak slowly, please. My hearing isn’t what it used to be.
