DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Piet. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… pressure in my bladder, and it’s become quite bothersome lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels…full, even shortly after I’ve gone to the restroom. And sometimes, it’s difficult to… completely empty my bladder, if that makes sense. It's not painful, exactly, just… persistent and uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a feeling of fullness even after urinating, and difficulty with complete emptying. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it a recent development?
PATIENT: It’s been gradually worsening over the past three or four months, I would say. At first, it was just occasional, and I didn’t think much of it. But it's become more frequent and noticeable in the last month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over three to four months, worsening in the last month. Have you noticed any other changes in your urination – like increased frequency, urgency, or any burning sensation when you go?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I have been going to the restroom more often, particularly at night. I wouldn’t say it’s urgent every time, but I definitely feel the need to go more frequently than usual. No burning sensation, thankfully. Just the fullness and the increased trips.
DOCTOR: Alright. Increased frequency, especially at night, along with the fullness and difficulty emptying. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, chills, or back pain at all. It’s really just been focused on the bladder area and the changes in my urination. It hasn’t affected my overall health otherwise, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No systemic symptoms. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had a fairly uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery about five years ago. Otherwise, I don't have any significant medical conditions. I do have seasonal allergies, but that's about it. I’ve never been hospitalized or had any surgeries.
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomplicated pregnancy five years ago, seasonal allergies, no hospitalizations or surgeries. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just an antihistamine for my allergies during allergy season – loratadine, I believe it's called. And occasionally, ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s infrequent. Otherwise, no regular medications or supplements.
DOCTOR: Okay, loratadine as needed for allergies, ibuprofen occasionally. Do you have any allergies to medications themselves?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any known allergies to medications. I’ve taken various medications throughout my life – antibiotics, pain relievers – without any adverse reactions.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And finally, could you tell me a little about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother has type 2 diabetes, and my father has high blood pressure, both managed with medication. My maternal grandmother had arthritis, and my paternal grandfather had heart disease. As far as I know, there isn’t any history of bladder or kidney problems on either side of the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, type 2 diabetes in your mother, high blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your maternal grandmother, and heart disease in your paternal grandfather. No known bladder or kidney issues. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen and a brief pelvic exam. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please proceed. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just listening and feeling your abdomen now. Everything feels normal to the touch – no tenderness or masses. Now, I’m going to perform a brief pelvic exam. I’ll explain everything as I go. …Okay, everything appears normal visually as well. There’s no sign of any obvious inflammation or abnormalities. I'm going to perform a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes. Those are also normal. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it could be a few things. A urinary tract infection is always a possibility, even without fever, although less likely. It could also be overactive bladder, or possibly some pelvic floor dysfunction. To rule out an infection, I'd like to order a urinalysis. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, a urinalysis sounds like a very good idea. It would certainly put my mind at ease to rule out an infection. Please proceed with that. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write an order for the urinalysis now. The lab is just down the hall; they'll take a sample from you. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids, but try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Also, try to urinate when you feel the urge, and don't hold it for too long. Here's the lab order. They’ll let me know as soon as the results are available. If you experience any fever, chills, flank pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds very clear. Thank you for your time and thorough examination. I’ll head to the lab now and get the urinalysis done. I appreciate the instructions, and I will certainly contact the clinic if I experience any of those symptoms. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. We'll get those results back as quickly as possible. Please let the lab know if you have any questions. And don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or you have further concerns. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Piet. You as well. I will.
