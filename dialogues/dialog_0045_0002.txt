DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Stoffregen, have a seat. Eighty-seven, huh?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Eighty-seven, I think. Or maybe eighty-eight? Time… time goes fast, you know? My husband, he usually keeps track.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll get it sorted. Don't worry about that. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… the water. It’s… hard to go. Like it doesn’t want to come out. It’s a little embarrassing, really. It’s been… a while now. Not sudden, you know? Just… slow.
DOCTOR: Slow, you say. Okay. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. A long time. Maybe… a few months? Or longer? It’s hard to say. Things all blend together after a while, you know? My memory… it's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A few months… alright. And is it painful when you try to go?
PATIENT: Painful… not really painful. More… a strain. Like I have to push really hard. And it doesn’t always come all the way out, if that makes sense. It’s just… uncomfortable. And a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you having any problems starting to go, or is it just difficult to completely empty your bladder?
PATIENT: Oh, starting is… hmm. It takes a little bit. I have to… wait a moment. And think about it. It’s not quick, like it used to be. Then, like I said, it doesn't all come out at once. It’s a little dribbly sometimes, after.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mrs. Stoffregen, this is pretty common as people get older. Changes happen. Now, are you having any burning or discomfort when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning? No, not burning. Just… that strain, like I said. And sometimes, after I go, it feels like there’s still… something left. Not painful, just… full. I don't think I have a fever or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any history of urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Urinary… what? Infections? Oh dear… I don’t think so. Not that I remember. My doctor before… he always checked everything. But it’s been a long time. I honestly can't say for sure. I just know I haven’t felt very good lately, with this… problem.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a quick look. I'm going to need to do a simple physical exam. Just to rule things out. It won't be anything unpleasant. I'll just listen to your abdomen, and maybe do a quick palpation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t mind. But please be gentle, dear. My old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, deep breaths, Mrs. Stoffregen. In… and out… Okay. Everything sounds normal. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen here… and here… Any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… a little pressure. Like you said. Nothing painful. It feels… normal. It's just… this trouble with the water, you know? It's worrying me more than anything else.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your bladder does feel a little full, even after you said you went. And I notice a slight tenderness here… on the lower left side. It’s not significant, but we should get a urine sample just to be safe. We'll rule out an infection. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, a urine sample. Yes, I can do that. Where do I… go? Is there a… room? I hope it’s not too far. My legs aren’t as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, second door on the right. There's a private bathroom. I'll leave you to it. There are instructions inside. Just bring the sample back to me when you’re finished, and we'll send it to the lab. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, dear. Down the hall… second door. I think I can manage. It's just… a little walk.
DOCTOR: Take your time.
PATIENT: .
