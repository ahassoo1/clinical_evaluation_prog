DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Just… chest pain. And my heart… feels funny. Like it’s going too fast sometimes. Blood pressure is too high, they said at the pharmacy. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain and a feeling of a racing heart, and the pharmacy noted your blood pressure was elevated. I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz, but it’s good you had it checked, and I'm glad you’re here to discuss it with me. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about the chest pain?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to tell? It hurts. Right here. . Not all the time. Comes and goes. When I walk up the hill to the market, mostly. Or if I get… upset. It’s just old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's located in your chest, comes and goes, and seems to be triggered by exertion – walking uphill – and sometimes by getting upset. You feel it’s likely just related to age. I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Sobkowicz. Just to be thorough, can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Describe it? Like… a squeezing. Not sharp. Dull. Like someone is sitting on my chest. It’s not… pleasant. Look, I don’t have time for fancy descriptions. I have things to do. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. A squeezing, dull pain, like someone sitting on your chest… that's helpful. To get a clearer picture, has this pain been getting worse lately?
PATIENT: Worse? Maybe. Everything is worse when you get old. I don't… keep track of these things. It’s just… there. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Honestly, I just take a rest when it bothers me and hope it goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it fluctuates, and resting helps. That’s good to know. And you haven’t noticed any new symptoms along with the chest pain – like shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, or pain radiating to your arm or jaw?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. Sweating? Only when it’s hot. And my jaw… what would my jaw have to do with my chest? You asking silly questions.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions seem silly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’m just trying to rule out different possibilities. Sometimes pain can radiate to other areas, which is why I ask. Now, do you have any history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… what was that first one? High blood pressure… the pharmacy man said something about that. My wife, she handles the doctor things. I eat a lot of salt, I know that. And my father… he had problems with his heart, I think. A long time ago. He didn’t take care of himself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pharmacy mentioned high blood pressure, you consume a fair amount of salt, and your father had heart problems. I appreciate you sharing that. Let’s talk about your medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Just the little white pill. My wife gives it to me every morning. For… something. I don’t ask. She knows what she’s doing. Don't want to bother with all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, you take a small white pill daily, prescribed by your wife. We’ll need to figure out what that is for documentation. Before we move on, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I’m Korean, you know. We eat… everything. No problems.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Get it over with. Just… don’t take too long. I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. I’m hearing a slightly rapid heart rate, and I detect a bit of… diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes of both lungs. Your blood pressure is elevated, 160 over 90. And your pulse is a bit irregular, and somewhat fast. I don’t feel any significant tenderness in your chest. Do you feel any pain while I'm doing this?
PATIENT: No pain. Just… annoyed. This is taking too long. What does all that mean? Is my heart broken or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. I assure you, we're nearly finished with the exam. As for what it means… the rapid heart rate, irregular pulse, diminished breath sounds and elevated blood pressure aren’t necessarily indicative of a “broken heart”, but they do warrant further investigation. It suggests there may be some underlying issues affecting your heart and lungs. Given your symptoms and the findings of the exam, I'd like to order some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I don't like tests. Are you going to poke me with needles? I hate needles. Just tell me if I'm going to die. That's all I need to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety about tests, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I'll do my best to minimize any discomfort. We’re not trying to cause you any worry. We’d start with a simple blood test to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and rule out any other underlying issues. We’d also do an electrocardiogram, or EKG, which is a painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't involve needles. And finally, a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and heart. These tests will help us determine the cause of your chest pain and racing heart, and develop a plan to get you feeling better. I want to assure you, we’re not jumping to conclusions. We're gathering information. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But make it quick. And no needles. My wife will be angry if I’m late for dinner.
DOCTOR: Okay, no needles, I promise. I'll write the orders for the blood test, EKG, and chest X-ray. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and explain the EKG procedure. The X-ray can be done here at the clinic. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low dose of a medication to help lower your blood pressure. It's important to take this as directed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Medication… more pills? Just what I need. Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. But if it makes me sleepy, I’m blaming you.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Sobkowicz. This medication, Lisinopril 5mg once daily, is generally well-tolerated, but drowsiness can be a side effect in some people. We’ll start with a low dose to minimize that risk. If you do experience excessive drowsiness, please contact the clinic and we can adjust the dosage or try a different medication. I'll also give you a printed sheet with detailed instructions on how to take the medication and potential side effects to watch out for. Do you have any questions for me before I finish?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just get it done. And tell that nurse to be quick with the blood. I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. Here’s your prescription, and the instructions. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please let her know if you’re anxious about needles, and she’ll do her best to make you comfortable. I’ll call you with the results of the tests as soon as they come back, which should be within a few days. In the meantime, if your chest pain worsens or you experience any new symptoms – such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or severe weakness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No. Just… go. I need to get home.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Sobkowicz. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. The nurse will be with you shortly.
