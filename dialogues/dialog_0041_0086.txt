DOCTOR: Hi Kahrin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Results, yeah? I’m really just here for those. I’m Kahrin, by the way. Don’t have a lot of time, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: Right, Kahrin. No problem at all. Results… let me pull those up. Just a moment… Okay, I see here you had some blood work done on… July 18th, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, July 18th. That's the one. Everything look okay? I mean, is there anything bad I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Hmm… Okay, well, a few things are slightly outside the normal range, but nothing immediately alarming. Your white blood cell count is a little elevated, and your Vitamin D is quite low. Everything else looks pretty standard. Do you remember why your doctor ordered those tests in the first place?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, not really. I just went for my yearly check-up, and they said they wanted to run some stuff. I have a pretty good memory, usually, but they didn’t really explain why specifically. Just said routine things. Does the white blood cell thing mean I’m sick? I haven’t felt sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's not uncommon. Sometimes doctors order panels just to get a baseline, and it can be hard to remember specifics. An elevated white blood cell count can indicate an infection or inflammation, but it can also be caused by things like stress, or even recent exercise. Since you haven’t been feeling unwell, that’s a good sign. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about any recent illnesses, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Not really. I had a bit of a cold in, oh, maybe April? But that was ages ago, and it wasn't even that bad. Just a stuffy nose for a couple days. Nothing else. No fever, no anything. I’ve been pretty healthy, actually. I try to eat well and get enough sleep. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And the Vitamin D deficiency is pretty common, especially if you don't get a lot of sun exposure. Do you spend much time outdoors?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I work indoors, obviously, logistics, you know? Lots of computer work. And I live in an apartment, not a lot of direct sunlight. I try to take a multivitamin, but maybe it's not enough. Should I be taking something specific for the Vitamin D?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're a good candidate for a Vitamin D supplement, yes. A multivitamin usually doesn't have a high enough dose to correct a deficiency. I typically recommend 2000 IU of Vitamin D3 daily. Now, about the slightly elevated white blood cell count… since you’re feeling well, we don’t need to jump to conclusions. But just to be safe, I’d like to run a complete blood count again in about a month to see if it’s come down on its own. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… reasonable. A month. Okay. And the Vitamin D thing, 2000 IU… I can remember that. Is there a brand you recommend, or does it not matter? I just want to get this sorted quickly.
DOCTOR: Any reputable brand will do, really. Look for Vitamin D3 – that’s the form your body uses best. They’re pretty readily available at any pharmacy or even most grocery stores. Okay, so to recap: we’ll repeat the CBC in a month, and you’ll start taking 2000 IU of Vitamin D3 daily. Are you allergic to any medications or have any other health conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies, no health conditions. Just… busy. That's pretty much it. I think that covers everything, right? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, I think that does cover everything for today. Just to be clear, if you develop any new symptoms – fever, chills, unusual fatigue, anything concerning – please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We’ll have the lab order for the repeat CBC ready for you. And again, 2000 IU of Vitamin D3 daily. I'm happy to write a quick note for work if you need documentation about your appointment, just let me know. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's it. Seriously. Thanks for not keeping me all day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kahrin. I understand your time is valuable. Get back to work safely. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
