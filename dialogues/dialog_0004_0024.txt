DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit of a strange request, actually. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. My travel insurance company requires it. I lost my husband six months ago, and I'm finally trying to take a trip he and I planned. They just need something official saying I'm fit to travel, you know?
DOCTOR: A letter for fitness to fly… right. While I understand wanting to honor your husband’s plans, insurance companies requesting such letters is… unusual. Still, we can certainly address that. It’s best to be thorough. To properly assess this, I’ll need some information. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – heart problems, lung issues, blood clots, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. No heart problems, lungs are fine… I had pneumonia once, when I was a child, but that was years and years ago. I don’t even remember the details. And definitely no blood clots. I get regular check-ups, just the usual stuff, and everything’s always been normal. I have Medicare, so they keep a pretty close eye on things. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Medicare does tend to be… diligent. It’s good you’re generally healthy, but “generally healthy” isn’t enough for a fitness-to-fly assessment. We need specifics. Have you had any recent illnesses, even a cold or the flu, within the last few months?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I did have a really bad cold in… April, I think it was. It knocked me out for a good week, but it cleared up completely. Nothing since then. Just the usual seasonal allergies. I take an over-the-counter antihistamine for those, but that’s it. I haven’t been to the hospital or anything for it. Does that cold matter? It felt like any other cold, really.
DOCTOR: A cold in April… We’ll document that. It’s important to be comprehensive. And allergies. What antihistamine are you taking, specifically?
PATIENT: It’s… let me see… it’s just the generic loratadine. The kind you get at the drugstore. The store brand, I think. Comes in a little orange bottle. I only take it when the pollen count is really high. I don’t take it every day, just as needed. It helps with the sneezing and itchy eyes, that’s all. I don’t think it has any side effects or anything. I’ve been taking it for years.
DOCTOR: Right. Loratadine. Fine. Now, this is crucial. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fatigue – any of those – even mildly – in the weeks leading up to today?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Absolutely not. I’ve felt completely normal. I've actually been feeling pretty good, all things considered. I’ve been trying to walk more, to… well, to keep busy. But no chest pain, no trouble breathing, no dizziness. And I haven’t been unusually tired or anything. I’m a little stressed about the trip, honestly, but that’s not physical fatigue, you know? I just want to make sure everything goes smoothly. This trip meant a lot to my husband and me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a quick physical exam, just to confirm everything is as you describe. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and assess your overall condition. It’s standard procedure. Please sit back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I appreciate you taking the time to do this, Doctor. It's just… the insurance company is being so difficult. I just want to get this letter so I can finally go.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths, please. In… and out… Good. Lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackles. Heart rate is regular. No murmurs detected. Blood pressure is 128/76. Within normal limits. Pulse is 72 and steady. Overall, your vitals are stable and within acceptable ranges. Do you have any history of anxiety or panic attacks, especially related to travel?
PATIENT: No, never. I get a little nervous before flying, like anyone, but I wouldn’t say I have anxiety or panic attacks. I just… worry about things. Delays, missing connections, that sort of thing. Nothing that keeps me from travelling, though. I flew all the time with my husband. He was the calm one, actually. I always looked to him to handle the logistics. This is the first trip without him, so maybe that’s why I’m a little more on edge.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your history – or rather, lack thereof – and your stable vitals, I can write a letter stating you are medically cleared for air travel. However, I must include a disclaimer. This letter is based on the information you have provided and my examination today. It does not cover unforeseen medical events that may occur during travel. It's important to maintain adequate hydration, rest, and be mindful of your overall well-being during your trip. Do you understand these terms?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. That makes sense. It’s just… a statement saying that you examined me and, based on that examination, I appear fit to travel. It doesn't guarantee anything will actually be okay, but it satisfies the insurance company’s requirement. That’s fine. I just want the letter, honestly. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll generate the letter now. It will include your medical history as we discussed, the findings of my examination – stable vitals, clear lungs, regular heart rate – and the disclaimer, as we outlined. Here you are. Please review it to ensure all the information is accurate. I will also place a copy in your medical record. Do you have any further questions for me today, Ms. Sayar?
PATIENT: Everything looks correct, thank you. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. I really appreciate your help, Doctor Deschane. You’ve been very thorough. I think that’s all I needed. I can finally book the trip. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Travel safely, Ms. Sayar. And do try to enjoy your trip.
