DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It's… well, my daughter, she wants me to come. Something about… before things happen. Before a baby, she says. I don't really… understand all of it, to be honest. She worries about me, you see. I’m Smith, by the way.
DOCTOR: Smith, alright. And your daughter is concerned about something happening before a baby… Is she pregnant, or are you planning something?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, not yet. She wants a baby, someday. She thinks… I’m old. And maybe not… strong enough? I don't know. She says I should check with someone, make sure… everything is okay before she tries. She's a good girl, always thinking ahead. I just… I don’t know much about these things. It was a long time ago when I learned about… well, you know.
DOCTOR: So, a pre-conception check-up, essentially. Your daughter is right to be thoughtful. We can certainly assess your overall health to see if there are any concerns. Let's start with a bit of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions—anything that a doctor has told you about, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had a bad back for a while, years ago. A construction job, you see. But it’s mostly okay now. I get a little stiff sometimes. And… I think the doctor once said my cholesterol was a bit high, but I don't really remember much about it. I stopped going to the doctor much after… well, after my wife passed. It just didn’t seem important then. I don't feel sick, if that makes sense. I eat okay, I think. Not fancy, but… regular.
DOCTOR: Back pain, that’s common. And high cholesterol… we’ll check that. It’s alright that you haven’t been to the doctor regularly, we can start now. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes, for the back. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called? When it’s really bad. But not often. And… oh! My daughter gives me some vitamins. A multivitamin, she says, for old people. Something about… keeping me strong. A little pill every day. I think it's orange. I'm not very good with remembering names.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed, and a multivitamin… Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything serious?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… let me think… When I was a boy, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. That needed a cast. A long time ago. And… oh, my wife, she had surgery a few years before she… passed. But that wasn't me. I don’t think I’ve ever had surgery. I’ve been pretty lucky, I suppose. Mostly just bumps and bruises. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: No surgeries for you. That’s good to know. Now, what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I eat most things. Sometimes my eyes get a little itchy in the spring, maybe from the pollen? But that’s just a little sniffle. Nothing… bad. I’ve never had a real bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember. My wife, she was allergic to cats, but I’m fine with them.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any serious medical problems—like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or problems with their kidneys?
PATIENT: That’s a hard question, Doctor. My family… we didn’t talk much about those things. My father, he worked very hard, died young, something with his heart, I think. But I don't really know the details. My mother lived a long life, but she got… confused near the end. Dementia, my daughter said. And my wife's family… I didn't know them very well. She didn't talk about them much either. So… I don't have much information, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That's alright, many people don't have detailed family medical histories. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My father smoked, and it didn't do him any good. I always said I wouldn’t touch the stuff. And I didn't. No, never smoked a day in my life.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: A little bit. Sometimes, with dinner. A glass of wine, maybe. Nothing much. Not every day, just… occasionally. When my wife was still here, we’d share a glass. Now… not so much. It doesn’t taste the same without her. Mostly just water these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just occasional alcohol. And finally, do you do any regular exercise or physical activity?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I used to, when I was younger, working construction. That was plenty of exercise! Now… I walk to the store sometimes. And I do a little gardening. But that’s about it. Mostly I sit. My knees aren’t what they used to be. Sitting is easier.
DOCTOR: Alright, Smith. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a few other basic things. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I just want to make sure my daughter doesn’t worry too much. If I'm healthy enough… for when the time comes, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning at this point. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Pulses are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Overall, your exam is fairly unremarkable. I would like to order some blood work—a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel—just to get a better idea of your overall health. And I’d like to do a urinalysis as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work, urinalysis… I’ll do it. When do I need to go? And… will it be expensive? I don’t have much money, you see.
DOCTOR: We can get that arranged for you right away. There’s a lab just down the street. They’ll draw the blood and collect a urine sample. It shouldn't take long. And… regarding the cost, I understand your concern. We can explore some options to make it affordable. There are programs available to help, and we can see if they qualify you. Let me have my assistant, Sarah, talk to you about that after the exam. She's very good at navigating those things. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Sarah, you say? Yes, that would be a great help. I don’t understand those things, all the paperwork and… everything. If she can help, that would be very kind. Thank you. I just want to be sure I can do what my daughter wants, you know? If I’m healthy enough…
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Smith. We’ll do everything we can to help. I'll have Sarah come in and get you started with the lab orders and discuss the financial assistance options. Do you have any questions for me at this point before she arrives?
PATIENT: Um… just… is there anything I should do now? Before the blood work? Like, should I eat something? Or not eat something? I always forget these things. I don't want to mess up the test.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. For the lipid panel—the cholesterol test—you should fast for at least eight to twelve hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks other than water. Otherwise, you can eat normally. Just try to have a light meal before you go in. But for the other tests, it doesn’t matter. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. No food for the cholesterol test. Just water. I can do that. Eight to twelve hours… I think I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate it. I'm glad I came.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Smith. I'm glad you did too. We'll get these tests done and then we can discuss the results and make a plan together. I'll have Sarah come in now. Sarah?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll wait for Sarah.
DOCTOR:
