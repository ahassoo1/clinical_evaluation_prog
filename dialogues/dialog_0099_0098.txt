DOCTOR: Alright, Demondre. Twenty-five, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Twenty-five. Just came in 'cause... well, I was nearby and thought I'd check things out. Never really been to a doctor much before.
DOCTOR: "Nearby," you say. Well, that’s…efficient. It's good you're being proactive, I suppose, though preventative care is usually scheduled, not opportunistic. Still. Alright. "Check things out" is a bit vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, sorry. I guess I don't really know what to check. Just... making sure everything's okay, you know? I work on boats a lot, oiling stuff...it’s kinda dirty work. Not sick or anything, just... curious. Does that make sense? I don't even know what doctors usually do when you just wanna see if you're alright.
DOCTOR: "Just wanna see if you're alright." Right. Well, that’s… not a medical complaint. It’s good you’re aware of your occupation, though. Working with oils can certainly present hazards. Okay, let’s try this. Are you experiencing any symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Not really… not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that's probably just from the work. And my hands get kinda rough, but that’s the oil, right? Nothin' else. No coughs, no fevers, no pains… Just feelin’… normal, I guess. Is that a bad thing? Should I be feelin’ something?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a subjective term, Demondre. And it’s certainly possible to be asymptomatic for a variety of conditions. It's good you're not actively sick, I suppose. The rough hands are likely occupational dermatitis - exposure, as you said. But we still need to establish a baseline. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I mean, I get itchy eyes sometimes in the spring, but I always thought that was just pollen. Never really bothered me enough to see a doctor about it. Not allergic to any foods, I don't think. My ex-wife was always the one with allergies, always sniffin' and stuff. Sorry, not much help there.
DOCTOR: "Not much help." Right. Well, pollen allergies are common. We can add "possible seasonal allergies" to the list. Now, any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just try to eat good and get enough sleep when I can. Never really needed anything stronger than… maybe ibuprofen for a headache, once in a blue moon. And that wasn’t even regular.
DOCTOR: Good. Avoiding unnecessary medication is commendable. Alright. And your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical… you mean like, when I was a kid? I broke my arm once, fallin’ out of a tree when I was little. And I had chickenpox, like everyone else. Never been to the hospital for anything serious. Nothing else, not that I remember. I kinda avoided doctors, like I said. Is this… is this normal? Do people usually remember all this stuff?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is…relative, Demondre. Most people don't recite their entire medical history on command. But a broken arm and childhood illnesses are…standard. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Nope, not a single one. I'm all original parts, I promise! Well, except for maybe my heart… my ex-wife kinda broke that… But I don’t think you fix that with surgery, right? Sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: We are documenting medical history, Demondre, not personal anecdotes. While I appreciate your… openness, let's remain focused. Now. Family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mom had… high blood pressure, I think? She was always tired. And my grandpa… he had something with his lungs, but I don't remember what. He smoked a lot, always coughin'. That's about all I know, honestly. My family doesn't really talk about that stuff. Sorry, not much help again. It was a kinda… distant family.
DOCTOR: "Not much help" is becoming a recurring theme, Demondre. High blood pressure and a potential lung condition… noted. Social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No way! Never touched a cigarette in my life. I work around smoke sometimes on the boats, from the engines and stuff, but I don't smoke. That's terrible for you! No, definitely not a smoker. Never will be.
DOCTOR: Good. And alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Uh, sometimes. A beer or two with the guys after work, maybe. Nothing crazy. I don't really drink to get drunk, just to relax. Maybe once or twice a week. Never really been a big drinker, honestly. Does that matter? I'm not an alcoholic or anything.
DOCTOR: "Matters" is a subjective term, Demondre. We are gathering data to establish a comprehensive baseline, not conducting a moral evaluation. Now. Given your occupation, frequent oil exposure, and lack of any discernible symptoms...let's do a quick physical exam. Just to be thorough. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Alright, sure. Physical exam sounds good. Hopefully I don't have anything too bad. I'm kinda strong from the work, so... you might need a strong scale!
DOCTOR: 91 kilograms. Height 1.83 meters. BMI… 29.1. Overweight. Alright. Now, please face me. Let’s check your vitals. Blood pressure, pulse, respiration… Blood pressure is 138/88. Pulse is 76. Respiration 16. Slightly elevated blood pressure, but within acceptable parameters given your… build. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… regular. No murmurs. Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Throat is clear. No signs of infection. Abdomen soft, non-tender. Overall… within normal limits, though your weight is a concern.
PATIENT: Oh, good. So I'm not… dying or anything? That's good to hear. Yeah, I know I've put on a little weight. Work's kinda…stressful, you know? And the food on the boats isn’t exactly healthy. What should I do about it? Do I need to…go on a diet or something?
DOCTOR: "Not dying" is a remarkably low bar, Demondre. And while your immediate condition isn't alarming, neglecting your weight and lifestyle will inevitably lead to complications. We are observing pre-hypertension and a weight bordering on obesity. A "diet" is a temporary restriction. We need to focus on sustainable lifestyle modifications: dietary changes, increased physical activity, and stress management techniques. I recommend reducing your caloric intake, focusing on whole, unprocessed foods, and engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. We can discuss a referral to a registered dietician to assist with meal planning. And frankly, reducing your alcohol consumption would be beneficial.
PATIENT: Wow. That… that’s a lot. Dietician, exercise, less alcohol… It sounds kinda…hard. I work long hours, you know? And the food on the boats is pretty much all we get. Maybe the dietician could help. I guess I could try to walk more when I'm not working. But I don't know… it just seems like a lot to change all at once. Do I have to do all of it at once? Can't I just… start with the walking?
DOCTOR: "Can't I just..." is not a medical strategy, Demondre. Incremental changes are… acceptable, but delaying comprehensive intervention will only exacerbate the issue. We are addressing a potential health crisis, not indulging preferences. Starting with walking is… marginally better than inaction, but it's a woefully inadequate response. Very well. Let's start with the walking, aiming for 30 minutes daily. And I will provide you with a list of resources regarding healthy eating habits. But understand: this is merely a preliminary step. I expect to see significant improvements at your next check-up. We'll schedule that for three months from today. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Three months… okay. No, I guess not. Just… walking and eating better. I'll try my best. Wait. Do I need to… pay you for all this? I didn't really bring my wallet. I just thought I’d pop in for a quick look-see.
DOCTOR: “Pop in for a quick look-see” resulted in a comprehensive medical evaluation, Demondre. The consultation fee is standard. Medicare should cover it, but billing is handled by the clinic administration. I will write the orders, and they will contact you regarding payment. Here is a summary of our discussion and the referral information for the dietician. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And do not neglect the recommendations. Your health is your responsibility. Next patient.
PATIENT: .
