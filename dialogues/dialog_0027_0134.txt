DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's... well, it's my stomach, mostly. It hasn't been right for a little while now. Feels queasy a lot, and I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I get full. It’s just… uncomfortable, really. I don't rightly remember when it started, to be honest. Everything feels a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomfortable... queasiness and feeling full quickly. It's understandable that things feel blurry, Ms. Kelder. We'll take our time. Just try to tell me as much as you can remember, even if it's not a lot. Has anything specific seemed to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? That’s a good question. I don't think so, not really. Maybe… rich foods? But I always liked a good pie, and that didn’t bother me before. Honestly, it just seems to come and go. Sometimes I can eat a little something, sometimes I can’t keep anything down at all. It’s been… worrying me, though. I just feel so tired all the time, too. Not just from the stomach, but… all over. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Kelder. Tiredness along with the stomach issues… yes, that’s good information. You mentioned rich foods might be a trigger, but it’s not consistent. And it's been worrying you, which is completely valid. Let's try to get a bit more detail. When you say "not keeping anything down," how often has that been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not often often, you understand. Not every day. Maybe… two or three times a week, perhaps? It’s hard to say exactly. Some days it’s just the queasiness, and I can sip on some tea. Other days… well, other days I have to be careful where I am, if you catch my meaning. It’s been… a few weeks now, I think. Maybe longer. Everything’s a bit mixed up, you see. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Kelder. It sounds frustrating when things aren't consistent. Two or three times a week of actually being sick… that's helpful to know. And the queasiness is more frequent. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Oh! My appetite’s been terrible, of course. Even before the nausea, I wasn’t eating much. And… I've lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser than they used to. Not a lot, but enough to notice. And… sometimes I feel a bit weak, like I could just… fall over. But that could just be from not eating, I suppose. I don't know. Everything feels so strange these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite, some weight loss, and feeling weak… These are all things we need to investigate. Weight loss is concerning, even if it's not a large amount. And feeling weak alongside everything else is significant. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really. Not a sharp pain, anyway. Sometimes my stomach feels a bit… achy, I suppose. But it’s not like a cramping pain, or anything. Just a dull ache, and it comes and goes. It doesn't keep me up at night or anything. More of a… discomfort, really. Like something’s just… not right. I’ve always had a sensitive stomach, to be fair. But this feels… different. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, coming and going… okay. And you're right, it's important to note that this feels different than your usual stomach sensitivity. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a better picture. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a personal question, isn't it? Well… they've been a bit… irregular. Sometimes I’m constipated, sometimes… not. It seems to depend on what I've managed to eat, if anything. And… they're not as solid as they used to be, sometimes. Sorry to be so… blunt. It’s just been… everything’s been a bit unsettled, you understand. I haven’t been myself lately.
DOCTOR: You’re not being blunt at all, Ms. Kelder. These are important questions, and I appreciate your honesty. Irregularity, both constipation and looser stools… that’s helpful information. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh my. Blood? No! No, I haven't. Not that I've seen, anyway. I… I wouldn't remember that, would I? That sounds awful. I haven’t looked very closely, if I’m being honest. It’s just been… upsetting, dealing with everything. I try not to think about it too much. It’s probably just my nerves, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable that you wouldn't necessarily look, Ms. Kelder, and it's good you're telling me this. That's important information. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… well, I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, you know. It flares up sometimes. And… my heart. The doctor told me years ago I had a little trouble with my heart, but it’s been okay for a long time. I take a little pill for it, every day. And… oh, and I had a touch of pneumonia a few years back. But that was just a bad cold, really. That’s about it, I think. Oh! And I had surgery on my hip, years and years ago. A long time before my husband passed. Everything feels so long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, some heart trouble that’s been stable, pneumonia a few years ago, and a hip surgery… that’s helpful. Do you remember the name of the pill you take for your heart?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a good question. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. It’s a little white pill, I think. I’ve been taking it for so long, I just… take it every morning. I get it from the pharmacy, of course. I don’t rightly remember the name. It’s something… something with an “L” in it, maybe? Oh, I'm so sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… everything’s a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Kelder. We can look it up. Don't worry about it. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to be able to eat anything, but things haven’t been the same lately, have they? Everything seems to upset my stomach now. But allergies… no, I don’t think so. My husband used to be allergic to bee stings, but that was him, not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the heart pill?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the little pill for my heart, I believe. Oh! And I take a little something for my arthritis when my hands are bothering me. It's an over-the-counter cream, you know. Nothing special. And sometimes I take something for a headache, if I have one. But that’s it, I think. Just the usual things. Nothing the doctor prescribed, besides the heart pill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder, thank you for all of this information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. My husband always said I worried too much, but I can’t help it. Everything’s just been… unsettling. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds… regular, but a little bit of a murmur. We already knew about that. Your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. It’s a little tender in your lower abdomen, on both sides. Not anything alarming, but definitely some sensitivity there. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little bit. Not a sharp pain, you understand. Just… discomfort. Like a dull ache, really. It’s… uncomfortable, but I can handle it. It’s just been like that for a while now, hasn’t it? It’s not terrible, Doctor, but it’s definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. I’m not feeling any masses or anything immediately concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I think it would be wise to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying infections or other issues. I also want to order a stool test, to check for any abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Blood work and a stool test… alright. As long as it helps figure out what’s wrong with me. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? Is it going to be… unpleasant? I don’t like needles, if I’m being honest. But I’ll do whatever I need to do.
DOCTOR: The blood work will just be a standard draw, and we’ll try to make it as quick and painless as possible. The stool test is… well, it’s not the most pleasant thing, but it’s a simple collection. We'll give you detailed instructions on how to do it. It's important to get this information so we can get you feeling better. I’m also going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, just to get a more detailed look at everything. We need to rule out anything serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan… is that… is that one of those machines that takes pictures? I don't like being closed in, Doctor. My husband… he wasn't very good with those kinds of things. Is it absolutely necessary? I get a bit… claustrophobic, you see. Everything feels so overwhelming all of a sudden.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a machine that takes pictures, Ms. Kelder. And I understand your concerns about being closed in. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about that. We can absolutely discuss options if you are feeling claustrophobic. We can talk to the radiology department about giving you something to help you relax, or even doing an open MRI instead, although that doesn't provide as detailed of an image. But it's important to get a clear picture of what's going on, especially with the weight loss and tenderness you're experiencing. We need to rule out anything serious. We can start with the blood work and stool test, and then discuss the CT scan again after we have those results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… much better, Doctor. Starting with the blood work and stool test… yes. And then we can talk about the CT scan later. That makes me feel a little bit better, just knowing I have a choice. I don’t want to be closed in, if I can avoid it. My husband… Alright. Let’s do the blood work and stool test. Tell me what I need to do, Doctor. And thank you… for being so understanding.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. We will take things one step at a time. Here's a requisition for the blood work. You can go to the lab just down the hall, and they’ll take care of everything. They'll need a valid ID and your insurance card. I’ll also have the nurse give you instructions for the stool test before you leave. I'll give you a call as soon as the results are back, which should be in a few days. We can then discuss the next steps, including whether or not we need to consider the CT scan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect, Doctor. Blood work, then we’ll talk. Thank you so much for listening to me, and for being so patient. I appreciate it more than you know. My nerves are a little bit better now, just knowing we have a plan. I think… I think I can manage that.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. That’s what I’m here for. Remember, if you experience any worsening symptoms—severe pain, fever, or blood in your stool—please don't hesitate to call us right away. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the instructions for the stool test. Now, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Just… getting this sorted out is a weight off my shoulders. Thank you again for your kindness and understanding. I’ll go get the blood work done, and I’ll wait for your call. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you… from the bottom of my heart.
DOCTOR: You too, Ms. Kelder. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll be in touch soon.
