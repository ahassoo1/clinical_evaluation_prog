DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. It’s…persistent, even with the machine. I’ve been using the CPAP for a good while now, and it should be helping, but I still find myself nodding off during the day. It's just... tiring.
DOCTOR: I see. Daytime sleepiness, despite consistent CPAP use. That is concerning, and certainly frustrating. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about this sleepiness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up or anything, Doctor. But…if I’m sitting quietly, reading maybe, or watching television…that’s when it hits. A real wave of drowsiness. And sometimes, even when I’m driving – not often, thankfully – I feel myself getting very, very heavy-eyed. It scares me a little, to be honest. It happens most afternoons, I'd say. Not usually first thing in the morning.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds quite worrisome, particularly the instances while driving. It's good you're aware of it and haven't pushed yourself in those situations. To clarify, when you say “consistent CPAP use,” how many hours per night would you estimate you’re using the machine, and have you noticed any changes in its effectiveness recently—any leaks, changes in pressure settings, or discomfort that might prevent a full night's use?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm very good about it, Doctor. I try for a full eight hours, every night. Usually, I manage it. As for leaks… I check the mask regularly, and I haven’t noticed anything significant. It’s comfortable enough, I suppose. Not luxurious, but I’ve gotten used to it. The pressure… that's a good question. It hasn’t been adjusted in a while, I don’t think. Maybe a year? It was set when I first got the machine, and I haven’t really thought about it since. I just…turn it on and use it. Should I be checking that?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. It’s quite conscientious of you to use it so consistently. And you are correct to question whether the pressure is still optimal – settings do need periodic review. A year is a reasonable amount of time to warrant a reassessment. Now, let's delve a bit deeper into your overall sleep experience. Besides the daytime sleepiness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… well, I wake up with a dry mouth pretty often. And sometimes, my nose feels a bit stuffy, even with the humidifier on the machine. My wife used to complain about my snoring before the CPAP, obviously. But now… I don’t know if I still snore. I can’t hear it myself! Oh, and… I don’t feel quite as rested as I used to, even after a full eight hours. It's hard to explain. Just… not fully refreshed. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Paske. Dry mouth, nasal congestion, and not feeling fully refreshed despite adequate sleep duration are all pertinent details. To get a more comprehensive picture, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not a great deal, Doctor. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. And I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. Other than that… I’m fairly healthy for an 83-year-old, if I may say so myself! I try to eat a good diet, and I get a bit of exercise when I can. I used to be a very active gardener, but my knees aren't what they used to be. No diabetes, no heart problems… nothing major, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Paske. Well-controlled hypertension and a remote cholecystectomy are helpful pieces of information. Maintaining a good diet and staying active are excellent. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the Lisinopril, Doctor, for the blood pressure. Twenty milligrams a day. And… oh, sometimes I take an over-the-counter antihistamine if my allergies are bothering me. But that’s it, really. Nothing else regularly. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to be allergic to bee stings as a child, but I haven’t been stung in decades. I've had the usual vaccinations, of course, but no unusual allergies that I know of. I eat all sorts of foods without any problems.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, regarding your family history—are there any sleep disorders, like sleep apnea, or any other significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My father… he was a big man, and my mother always said he snored terribly. But they didn't really have things like sleep studies back then, so I don’t know if he had sleep apnea. My brother… he has high blood pressure too, like me. And my sister… she had some heart problems later in life, but I don’t think it was directly related to sleep. Nothing major on either side, as far as I know. They were both very healthy people, overall. Long-lived, too.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s helpful information, Mr. Paske. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never have, Doctor. Never even tried. My wife and I were both very against it. She passed away five years ago, and she felt very strongly about living a healthy lifestyle. I've always tried to follow her example. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: That is admirable, Mr. Paske. And do you drink alcohol regularly, beyond that occasional glass of wine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just that one glass with dinner, a few times a week. It’s mostly for enjoyment, really. I don’t drink to excess. I find it helps me relax. But it’s not a habit, and I could easily go without it if I needed to. I don’t feel any compulsion to drink.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I’d like to ask about your social situation. Do you live alone, or do you have family or friends nearby?
PATIENT: I live alone, Doctor. My wife passed away a few years ago, as I mentioned. But I have a daughter who lives about an hour away. She calls regularly, and she comes to visit when she can. And I have a few close friends in the neighborhood. We get together for coffee and a chat sometimes. I’m not completely isolated, thankfully. I keep busy with hobbies and try to stay active in the community. It helps to have people around.
DOCTOR: That is good to hear, Mr. Paske. Social support is very important. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical examination. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your throat and nose. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I'm used to doctor visits, you know. Been going to them for 83 years! I'll do my best to cooperate. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated today, Mr. Paske, but not alarmingly so. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in your lower lungs, which could be due to congestion. Now, if you could open your mouth for me, I'd like to take a look at your throat and nose. Your throat is a little red, and your nasal passages are a bit swollen, which could be contributing to the congestion. Finally, I’m going to gently palpate your neck to check for any enlarged lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes feel normal. Okay, Mr. Paske, that completes the physical examination. Everything seems relatively normal, although your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and you have some mild congestion in your lungs. Now, I’d like to review the results of your sleep study, if you have it readily available. Do you happen to have a copy with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. I brought all my papers with me, just in case. Here you are. It's a bit of a mess, I'm afraid. My daughter helped me organize it, but she's not very good at filing, bless her heart. It's in there somewhere. The main report should be near the front, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. Let’s see… Ah, here we are. The report indicates you were diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea approximately three years ago, and were prescribed a CPAP machine with a pressure setting of 12 centimeters of water pressure. The AHI, or Apnea-Hypopnea Index, was 15 at the time of the study. However, looking at the compliance data, it shows you've been using the machine consistently for an average of 6.8 hours per night, which is good. But the recent data—from the last three months—shows a concerning trend. Your AHI has increased to 18, despite consistent use. That suggests the CPAP pressure may no longer be adequate. Do you remember any changes around the time your AHI started to increase?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s… concerning. I hadn't realized it had gotten worse. Let me think… around three months ago… not much changed, really. I did gain a little weight, I suppose. My daughter kept telling me I was spoiling myself with too many pastries. And the weather got warmer, which meant I was a bit more congested than usual. I don't know if that makes a difference. But other than that… no, nothing significant. I haven’t changed medications, and I haven’t started any new habits. It just… seemed to happen gradually. I’ve been feeling more tired lately, and my wife used to complain I snored a little bit more, before she passed, of course. But I figured that was just my imagination.
DOCTOR: That is helpful information, Mr. Paske. The weight gain and increased congestion are both relevant factors. Weight gain can worsen sleep apnea, and congestion can make the CPAP less effective. Given the increased AHI, your symptoms, and the physical exam findings, I believe your CPAP pressure needs to be reassessed. It’s likely that your current pressure setting is no longer optimal, and we need to adjust it to better control your sleep apnea. To do this, I’d like to schedule you for a repeat sleep study, or a CPAP titration study, where we can monitor your breathing while you’re using the machine and adjust the pressure setting until it’s at the optimal level. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. If the machine isn’t doing its job, we need to fix it. A repeat study sounds… sensible. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. When would that be possible? And will it be at the same place as before? I don't mind going back there, but it wasn’t the most comfortable night of my life, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the comfort of the study, Mr. Paske. We will schedule it at the same facility as before, but I will make a note on your chart to request a more comfortable room if possible. Let me see… we can schedule it for the week of August 12th. Would Monday or Wednesday evening work best for you?
PATIENT: Wednesday evening would be better, Doctor. Monday I have a book club meeting. It’s a rather lively group, mostly ladies, and I wouldn’t want to miss it. Wednesday works perfectly. And thank you for requesting a more comfortable room. I do appreciate that. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the study? Should I avoid alcohol or caffeine beforehand?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Wednesday evening it is. And yes, you're right to ask about preparation. Please avoid alcohol and caffeine for at least 24 hours before the study. Also, try to maintain your regular sleep schedule as much as possible leading up to the study. And please bring any medications you're currently taking with you. Now, while we wait for the results of the study, I’d also like to discuss some strategies to manage your symptoms in the meantime. Since you've gained some weight, even a modest reduction in weight could improve your sleep apnea. And I can recommend a nasal saline spray to help alleviate your congestion. Would you be interested in those options?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be wonderful. Any help would be appreciated. A nasal spray sounds like a good idea, and I suppose I should try to lose a few pounds. My daughter has been nagging me about that for years! So yes, please do recommend those things. I’ll try my best. And thank you for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It makes me feel much better knowing we're addressing this.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Now, I’ll write a prescription for a nasal saline spray—specifically, I recommend Oxymetazoline 0.05% to help reduce nasal congestion. Use it twice daily, as directed. I will also provide you with some resources on weight management, including healthy eating guidelines and exercise tips. Here is a written summary of our discussion today, including the prescription for the nasal spray, the resources on weight management, and the appointment details for the CPAP titration study on Wednesday evening. Please review it carefully. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. I feel much more confident now, knowing we're taking steps to address this problem. Thank you again for your help. I’ll see you on Wednesday evening then. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Paske. It was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday evening. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and get some rest!
