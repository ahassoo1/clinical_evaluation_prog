DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re thirty-one years of age. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right. I’m here because I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A mass in the lower abdomen, you say. And how long precisely has it been there?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it’s difficult to say exactly. Probably around three months, maybe a little longer. At first, I didn’t think much of it, but it hasn’t gone away, and it doesn’t feel like it’s getting smaller. It's just… there.
DOCTOR: Three months, and no change in size. And can you describe the mass to me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… hard. Not painful, usually. It feels like a firm ball, maybe the size of a walnut? It’s not soft or squishy. It’s located just below my belly button, a little to the left side. Sometimes I can feel it when I cough, like it shifts a bit.
DOCTOR: A firm, non-tender mass, approximately the size of a walnut, located inferior to the umbilicus, left-sided. Shifts with cough... Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this mass?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, no fever, no changes in my bowel habits… nothing like that. I’ve been feeling generally okay, to be honest. That’s why I waited a bit to come in, because it wasn’t causing any trouble. But it’s just… unsettling, you know? Knowing something is there.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. Well, we must investigate these things. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently, Mr. Raghunathan?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. If anything, I think I might have gained a little weight, but nothing significant. My appetite has been normal, and I haven't been trying to lose weight or anything. I eat pretty regularly.
DOCTOR: No weight loss, normal appetite. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I haven’t really been to the doctor much in the past. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. My wife keeps telling me I need to be more proactive about my health, but… well, here I am now. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Adequate, for now. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid needing any surgeries, thankfully. I try to be careful, and I haven’t had any serious injuries that would require them. Just the occasional scrape or bruise, nothing more.
DOCTOR: No prior surgeries. Now, concerning your family history – are there any instances of cancer, particularly abdominal cancers, in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother’s side… my grandmother had some kind of stomach trouble, a long time ago. I don’t know the details, to be honest. It was before my time, and nobody really talked about it much. My father's side, not that I know of. I think everyone lived to a pretty good age, but I don't recall anyone being diagnosed with cancer. I’m not very close with my extended family, so it’s hard to say for sure. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Sufficient. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything. I can eat pretty much anything without any problems, and I’ve taken a few different medications over the years for colds and flu, but never had any issues. My wife always asks me that question before I try anything new, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. I need to palpate your abdomen, listen to your bowel sounds, and perhaps a quick check of your lymph nodes. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Please lie down on your back, Mr. Raghunathan. Relax your abdomen as much as possible. I’m going to start with auscultation, then move to palpation. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all four quadrants. And now palpation…There is mild tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant, consistent with your description. I do note a firm, approximately 2-centimeter, non-mobile mass located approximately 5 centimeters inferior to the umbilicus, left-sided. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Inguinal lymph nodes are non-palpable. Right. Given the findings…it is difficult to determine the etiology without further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… thorough. What kind of investigation are you thinking about? Is it something serious? I’m a little worried now, to be honest. It was just a lump, and now you’re talking about…etiology. That sounds… complicated. Could you explain it in simpler terms?
DOCTOR: Mr. Raghunathan, "etiology" simply refers to the cause of the mass. And whether it is "serious" cannot be determined without further testing. It could be a number of things – a lipoma, a hernia, or something else entirely. To investigate further, I recommend a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal ultrasound. The ultrasound will provide an image of the mass, allowing us to better assess its size, shape, and characteristics. If the ultrasound is inconclusive, we may need to consider a CT scan. I will also arrange for a referral to a general surgeon for consultation. They can discuss the possibility of a biopsy, if necessary. Does that clarify the situation?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… a lot better, thank you. So, tests to figure out what it is, and then maybe a specialist if needed. That sounds like a plan. A CT scan sounds a bit scary, but I understand you want to be thorough. And a biopsy…well, I’d rather not, but I’ll do what I need to do. Okay. Let’s get the tests done. What do I need to do now? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I have just generated the requisitions for the complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. You can have those drawn at the lab located adjacent to the clinic. The abdominal ultrasound will require a separate appointment. I will have the receptionist schedule that for you now. Regarding the general surgeon referral, I will submit that electronically. They will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. Here are the lab requisitions. And this is a sheet with information regarding the ultrasound facility. Do you have any questions about the logistics of these appointments, Mr. Raghunathan?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s pretty clear. Lab next door, receptionist will schedule the ultrasound, and the surgeon will call me. Okay. Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to do all of this. I'm still a little nervous, but I feel better knowing we have a plan. I guess I'll go get the blood work done then.
DOCTOR: Very good. And should you experience any sudden onset of severe pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, present to the emergency department immediately. Do not hesitate. Otherwise, we will review the results of these tests at your follow-up appointment. The receptionist will schedule that once the ultrasound is completed. Have a good day, Mr. Raghunathan.
PATIENT: Okay, I will. Thank you again, Doctor. .
