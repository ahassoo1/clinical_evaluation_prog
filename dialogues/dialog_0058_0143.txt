DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Todoroovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Um... well, it's a bit... complicated. My daughter, she wants a baby. And she thought... she thought I should come talk to someone first. About, you know... things. Before she tries. I’m not really sure what they need me for, to be honest. Old man stuff, probably.
DOCTOR: Right. “Old man stuff.” I see. Well, it’s good your daughter is thinking ahead, involving you. It is important to consider family history and your overall health when planning a pregnancy. Even if you're feeling perfectly fine. So, let's start with a bit of background. Do you have any significant medical problems – anything you've been diagnosed with or treated for over the years?
PATIENT: Significant... hmm. I had my appendix out when I was young, a long time ago. And… I think I had a bad back once. But nothing… serious, really. I've been generally okay. I worked, you know, selling things. Lots of traveling. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I don't really go to the doctor much. If it doesn’t kill you… I don't know if that's helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay. Appendix, back pain… and generally okay. That’s… a start. “Generally okay” isn’t quite a medical diagnosis, Mr. Verrall, but I appreciate the honesty. Has anything ever been told to you that you might need to watch out for?
PATIENT: Told… watch out for? Now that you mention it… there was a doctor, years ago, when I was working overseas. He said something about my… blood pressure. It was a little high, he said. But I was stressed! Lots of deadlines and… I don’t even remember what country I was in. He gave me some pills, maybe. But I stopped taking them, eventually. It felt fine. It all feels very long ago.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood pressure. And you stopped taking the medication. Do you recall when this was, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that’s… hard. Maybe… ten years ago? No, longer. Fifteen? Maybe even twenty. It was before my daughter… before she moved here, that’s for sure. Everything gets mixed up, you know? It was hot, that country. Lots of dust. And I was always flying. I really can’t be more specific, I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fifteen years ago, roughly. No medication currently. And you said you were traveling a lot then… Any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family… um. My father, he… he wasn’t very well when he was older. Heart trouble, I think. He was always tired. He had a doctor, of course. But we didn’t talk about it much, you know? Kurdish families… we don’t really share everything. And my mother… she was strong. Never sick a day in her life. She lived a long time, though. I don’t… I don’t really know about the others. Grandparents, great-grandparents. It was a long time ago, and things were different then.
DOCTOR: Okay. Father with heart trouble, mother healthy. Not much else known. Alright, Mr. Verrall, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just the basics—blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. It will give us a better idea of where we stand. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Spicy food, sometimes makes me cough, but that’s not an allergy. Never had a problem with penicillin or anything like that. I’ve never really needed to take much medication, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies. Very well. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please sit back and relax. I’m going to put this cuff around your arm... it will squeeze for a moment. 158 over 92. Hmm. And your pulse is 84. A bit of a murmur, but nothing alarming. Lungs are clear. Your weight is 141, and you said your height is 168?
PATIENT: That sounds right. 168, yes. I haven't changed much in years. Is... is that bad? The numbers? I don't really understand what they mean.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Verrall, your blood pressure is elevated. Significantly. And the murmur… it requires further investigation. Your weight is also a bit high. Considering your family history and the fact that your daughter is planning a pregnancy, we need to take this seriously. We'll need some blood work and an EKG to get a better picture of your overall heart health. It’s possible this is nothing, but it’s also possible it’s something we need to address before your daughter gets pregnant. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work… an EKG… That sounds… serious. Is something wrong? Will I… will I be okay? I just wanted to help my daughter. I didn’t want any problems. I… I don’t know. I don't understand all this.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Verrall, getting upset won't help. It's better to know what’s going on, than to ignore it and potentially create complications. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. But it's our responsibility to investigate. We'll run the tests, and then we can discuss the results. And if you're truly so anxious about it, I can refer you to a cardiologist for a more specialized opinion. Would you like that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… that sounds very serious. I… I don’t want to see a specialist if I don’t need to. I just want to be healthy for my daughter. Can we just… do the blood work? And the EKG? See what that says first? I don’t want to worry her unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Fine. We’ll start with the blood work and EKG. But if those results are concerning, I will insist on a referral. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… what does the blood work check for? And the EKG? What will they do? I don’t like hospitals. Or… whatever you do.
DOCTOR: The blood work will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a few other things to get a baseline of your overall health. The EKG… that simply records the electrical activity of your heart. It’s non-invasive—they’ll attach some sticky pads to your chest. It doesn't hurt. As for the hospital… you'll just be at the clinic for the tests. It's all very routine. I’ll write you a lab order and an order for the EKG. The nurse will explain everything to you when you go to get it done. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in a week. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A week… yes, that’s fine. The clinic… not a hospital? Good. Okay. Yes, that sounds acceptable. Doctor… you think… you think everything will be alright? For my daughter, I mean.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Verrall, I can’t make any promises. But we’re taking the necessary steps. And the sooner we have the results, the sooner we’ll know what, if anything, needs to be done. Now, let me print these orders for you. .
