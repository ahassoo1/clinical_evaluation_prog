DOCTOR: Hi Lilliana, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... my joints. They feel stiff in the mornings, you know? Especially when I get up. It's just... hard to move sometimes. I don't really know what to tell you, it just is. It's been happening for a while now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiff joints in the mornings… that’s a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about how long "a while now" has been?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long? That’s a tricky one. It feels like… a long time. Maybe… a year? Or more? Everything feels a bit mixed up these days, to be honest. My husband… he passed a few years ago, and things haven't been the same since. I just… try to keep busy with the little ones at the daycare. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Lilliana. Grief can really throw things off, and keeping busy is a good way to cope, but it can also mask things. A year or more of stiffness… okay. And where exactly are you feeling this stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… mostly in my hands, I think. And my knees. Sometimes my shoulders too, but not as often. It's… all over, really, but those are the worst. It's harder to pick up the toys at the daycare, and bending down to help the little ones… that's getting harder too. I don't want to complain, but it is slowing me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, hands, knees, sometimes shoulders. And it’s making it difficult with activities like picking up toys and bending. Is the stiffness worse at any particular time of the day besides the mornings?
PATIENT: Well… not really. It's always there a bit, but mornings are definitely the worst. After I've been moving around for a while, it loosens up a little. Not a lot, but enough to get through the day. Sometimes, if it's been really cold, it feels worse, you know? Like, on rainy days. But mostly, it's just… a constant thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant stiffness, worse in the mornings and potentially with cold weather. Do you experience any pain with the stiffness, or is it just the difficulty moving?
PATIENT: Oh, there’s a little pain, yes. Not sharp pain, but… a dull ache. It’s not terrible, usually. It’s more annoying than anything. Like, when I'm trying to open a jar or something, I feel it. And sometimes at night, my hands ache a bit. It doesn't keep me up or anything, but I notice it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache with movement and sometimes at night. Have you noticed any swelling in your joints, especially in your hands or knees?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. Let me see… No, I don’t think so. They don’t look puffy or anything. Maybe a little bit, sometimes, but I just thought that was… my weight, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s fair. It’s easy to attribute things to weight. Alright, Lilliana, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your range of motion in your hands, knees, and shoulders, and feel for any swelling or tenderness. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, please? My hands aren’t as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m noticing some mild tenderness in the knuckles of both hands, and a slight decrease in the range of motion, especially when you make a fist. Your knees also have a limited range of motion, and I can feel a small amount of fluid buildup. Your shoulders seem okay, with normal range of motion and no tenderness. No redness or warmth noted in any of the joints. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing osteoarthritis. It’s a common condition, especially as we get older, and it causes breakdown of the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain and stiffness. However, to confirm that and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests and an X-ray of your hands and knees. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… X-rays? Blood tests? That sounds… serious. Is it bad? I just thought it was… getting old, you know? Cartilage? What does that even mean? I don't want to be a bother, Doctor. If it's not serious, maybe I can just try to… rest more?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be concerned, Lilliana. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad, and it’s good you’re asking questions. The tests will help us understand exactly what’s going on, so we can make the best plan for you. Think of cartilage like the smooth cushion between your bones. As we age, that cushion can wear down, causing bones to rub against each other, leading to pain and stiffness – that’s osteoarthritis. The blood tests can help rule out other causes of joint pain, like rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory conditions. Resting is good, but we also want to make sure you’re maintaining your strength and flexibility. The tests will help us determine the best approach, which might include physical therapy, medication, or other treatments. It's not a bother at all – it's my job to investigate these things. Would you like me to explain the blood tests and X-ray in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That makes a little more sense, I think. Cushion… wearing down. Yes, that sounds about right. My knees do feel creaky, like old furniture. If you don’t mind explaining the tests… that would be good. I always get so flustered when people start talking about… medical things. Just… keep it simple, please?
DOCTOR: Of course, absolutely. We'll keep it simple. The blood tests are pretty straightforward. We'll take a small sample of blood and send it to a lab. They'll check for things like inflammation markers – basically, signs of swelling in your body. They'll also check for specific antibodies that could indicate other types of arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis, which is different from osteoarthritis. The X-rays are also non-invasive. It's a very small amount of radiation – less than you get from a cross-country flight – and it allows us to see the bones in your hands and knees. We're looking for things like narrowing of the space between the bones, which indicates cartilage loss, and any bone spurs or other changes that are common in osteoarthritis. It'll take a few days to get the results back, and then we can schedule another appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… narrowing… bone spurs… I think I understand. A little scary, but… better to know, I suppose. A few days… that’s good. Not too long. So, what do I need to do now? Do I need to fast for the blood tests? Do I need to… prepare anything for the X-rays?
DOCTOR: That’s a great question. No, you don’t need to fast for the blood tests. You can eat and drink normally before your appointment. For the X-rays, you don’t need to do anything special either. Just wear comfortable clothing, and let the technician know if you’re pregnant or think you might be. They’ll ask you to remove any jewelry or metal objects near the area being X-rayed. I'm going to write an order for the blood tests and X-rays. The front desk will help you schedule the appointments. They'll likely be at a facility nearby, and they can give you specific instructions on where to go and what to expect. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now, Lilliana?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to know. No special preparations… that's a relief. I don't think so… I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I always get so confused.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. It's perfectly okay to be confused – that's what I'm here for. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions at all after you leave. We'll get these tests done and figure out the best plan for you. Let's get those orders written up, and you can head to the front desk to schedule your appointments. Take care, and I'll see you in a few days.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day too.
