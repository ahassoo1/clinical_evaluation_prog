DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Heat intolerance, you say? Honestly, it’s about time someone looked into this. I've been telling folks for years I can't handle the sun like I used to, but nobody listens to an old painter, do they? It's just… everything feels hotter now. Like, unbearably so. Even indoors sometimes. And it’s not just sweating, it's… well, everything feels off.
DOCTOR: “Off,” you say. A rather imprecise descriptor, Mr. Coby. Could you elaborate?
PATIENT: Imprecise? Look, I’m a painter, not a… a scientist. What do you want me to do, take the temperature of my aura? It’s like… weak. I get dizzy, tired… just generally rubbish. It's not a fever, mind you. I know what a fever feels like. This is different. It’s like the heat just… sucks the life out of me. And it’s been getting worse each summer, steadily. I used to be able to work all day in the sun, no problem. Now? Forget about it. I’m lucky if I last a couple of hours.
DOCTOR: Right. Weakness, dizziness… progressing each summer. And you’ve noticed this specifically correlating with heat exposure. Do you experience these symptoms even without direct sun exposure, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Well, not as bad, no. But if it's a really muggy day, even indoors… I start to feel it. A bit lightheaded, sluggish. Like I'm wading through treacle. It's not instant, like when I'm out in the sun, but it creeps up on me. Especially if I've been doing anything physical, even just walking to the shops. It's not a comfortable feeling, I can tell you that much. And it's just… annoying. I’ve got work to do! I can't be collapsing every five minutes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what medications are you currently taking, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Medications? Nothing, Doctor. Never been much of a fan. I’ve always believed in letting the body sort itself out. A bit of rest, a bit of common sense, that's always been my motto. I take a multivitamin now and then, if I remember, but that’s about it. I’ve got no patience for pills and potions. Waste of money, most of 'em. Though, my sister keeps trying to get me on something for my knees... but I told her no. I’ll manage.
DOCTOR: Right. No regular medications. Very well. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions... hmm. Not that I know of. Had a bout of pneumonia when I was a lad, back in Nepal, but that was decades ago. And my knees, like I said, they get a bit creaky. But that’s just old age, isn't it? Nothing a good liniment can't fix. I’ve never been to hospital for anything serious. Always been a healthy man, until recently. This heat thing is… different. It's unsettling. I've got a job to do, and I can't do it if I'm feeling faint every ten minutes. Honestly, I’m starting to think I'm losing my mind.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Well, my father lived to a good age – late eighties, I think – always worked hard, farming mostly. Mother passed earlier, but she was healthy enough for her years. Lots of us are… were… strong. We're Nepalese, you know? We're built for hardship. My brother has high blood pressure, if that's what you're asking. And my sister, she's always complaining about something. But generally, we're a healthy bunch. This… heat thing doesn't run in the family. That’s what makes it so strange. It feels like something’s… wrong. Something new.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational substances, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you’re starting to sound like a police officer. Of course I don’t! I'm a painter, not a… a degenerate. A little bit of tea with my lunch, that’s it. And maybe a small glass of whiskey on a cold night, very occasionally. But that’s for medicinal purposes, you understand? To loosen the joints. It’s hardly a habit. I need a steady hand for my work, and I certainly don’t need anything clouding my judgement. I’ve got a reputation to maintain, you know. Quality work. Dependable. I don’t have time for vices. Really, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this? I’m feeling quite… interrogated.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's proceed to a brief physical examination. I need to check your vital signs and assess your overall condition. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Oh, fantastic. Another poke and prod. Honestly, I knew this would be a waste of time. But alright. If you insist. Just try not to poke too hard, alright? My skin is rather sensitive. And don’t expect me to enjoy this. I’ve never been comfortable with doctors. Too much poking and prodding. Get on with it, then. The sooner it's over, the better.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, Mr. Coby, but not alarmingly so. Lungs sound clear. Now, let me just check your reflexes… Reflexes appear normal. And finally, I’ll need to examine your skin…Your skin is a little dry and flushed, but no obvious rashes or abnormalities.
PATIENT: Flushed and dry, are you surprised? I spend all day working in the sun, even when I try to be careful! It's hardly a medical miracle. Honestly, Doctor, you’re telling me things I already know. I'm a painter, remember? What did you expect, porcelain skin? This isn't getting us anywhere. I came here because I feel weak and dizzy when it’s hot, not because I have a slightly flushed complexion. Are you even listening to me? I'm starting to think you just enjoy poking around. So, what's the verdict? What's wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Based on your history and the brief examination, Mr. Coby, it’s difficult to determine a definitive diagnosis at this stage. However, your symptoms – heat intolerance, weakness, dizziness, flushing – could indicate several possibilities. Dehydration is a strong contender, given your occupation and lack of fluid intake. Heat exhaustion is also plausible. However, given your age, we must rule out other potential causes. I recommend a complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and a thyroid function test to investigate further. And, I strongly advise you to limit your sun exposure and increase your fluid intake, Mr. Coby. Perhaps reconsider your aversion to modern medicine, for your own wellbeing.
PATIENT: So, tests. Wonderful. More poking and prodding, and who knows what else. And "reconsider my aversion to modern medicine"? Honestly, Doctor, you sound like my sister. I appreciate your… concern, I suppose. But I've lived a long life without being dosed up with pills, and I'm not about to start now. Dehydration? Perhaps. I do sweat a lot. But I'm careful to drink when I'm thirsty. And I'm not a fool; I know when I'm overheating. Look, I’ll think about the tests. But I’m not making any promises. And I still think you're missing the point. I need to be able to work. I can't afford to spend my days resting in the shade. So, what’s the most immediate thing I can do? Is there some sort of… cream, perhaps? Something to cool me down?
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, there is no “quick fix.” Unfortunately, a topical cream will not address the underlying issue. To reiterate, limiting sun exposure is paramount. And increasing your fluid intake – consistently, not just when you feel thirsty – is essential. You are experiencing a physiological response to heat, exacerbated by your occupation and, frankly, your disregard for basic preventative measures. A simple electrolyte solution, readily available at any pharmacy, can help replenish lost fluids and minerals. But the cornerstone of management remains avoiding excessive heat. I am going to refer you to a dermatologist, Mr. Coby. They can assess your skin condition further and provide advice on sun protection. And, I strongly recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment with me once you have completed the blood tests. We must address this before it escalates. Do you have any further questions, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: A dermatologist? Honestly. What does a skin doctor have to do with feeling weak and dizzy? I paint, Doctor, not sunbathe! This is ridiculous. Look, I’ll think about the tests. And I’ll try to stay out of the sun. But I’m not promising anything. I’ve got work to do, you know. People are relying on me. And frankly, I’m starting to feel like you’re wasting my time. Is that it, then? Can I go now? I've got a ladder to climb and a wall to paint. And I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Coby. I have provided my recommendations. The decision to pursue further investigation is yours. However, I must emphasize the importance of prioritizing your health. Here is the referral form for the dermatologist and some information regarding heat exhaustion. I suggest you review it carefully. You may go now. But I expect to see you back here with the test results. And, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Yes?
DOCTOR: Please, try to be more proactive regarding your health. Ignoring the warning signs will only lead to more serious complications. And, Mr. Coby… …perhaps consider a less strenuous occupation. .
PATIENT: .
