DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my breathing. It’s been giving me trouble. When I lie flat, it gets worse. That’s why I made the appointment. I don’t like to bother people, so it must be something.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing trouble, especially when lying flat… that is something we should look into. It's good you came in. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a cough, Doctor. Not like a cold or anything. It feels…like something is heavy on my chest. And then I have to really work to get a good breath. It doesn’t happen when I’m sitting up, or walking around. Just…flat on my back. It's been going on for, oh, maybe three weeks now? I tried sleeping in the chair, but that's not very comfortable, you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand. Sleeping in a chair doesn't sound pleasant at all. Heavy on your chest, needing to work to breathe… and it started about three weeks ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about three weeks. Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, not all at once. I thought maybe it was the heat, you know? But it hasn't gotten better. And I’m a little worried. My sister, she had some heart trouble a few years back, and I… well, I don’t want to end up like her.
DOCTOR: It's good you're paying attention to changes and that you came in to get it checked out, especially with your sister's history. We’ll definitely investigate this. Do you have any pain with the breathing trouble?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really pain. It's more… uncomfortable. Like someone is sitting on my chest, as I said. And a little bit…scary. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, or anything like that. Just…pressure. And a little bit of shortness, of course, when I’m lying down.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure and shortness of breath when lying down, no sharp pain. That gives me a little more to work with. Let's do a quick examination, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your oxygen levels. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I want to get this sorted out. I have errands to run, you see. And I don’t want to be laid up. Just please be quick, if you can.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as quick as possible. Alright, your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 76. I'm listening to your lungs now… I hear some slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, especially on your right side. And your heart sounds a little…distant. We'll want to get a chest x-ray to get a better look. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any known heart conditions?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. And no, I don’t know of any heart conditions. My sister had something… atrial fibrillation, I think it was called? But I don’t have that. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, to be honest. Just for checkups. Never anything serious. An X-ray… alright. Will that take long? I have to pick up groceries later.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known heart conditions, and no allergies. That's good to know. Atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat, yes. The x-ray won't take long, maybe 10-15 minutes. The technician will just ask you to stand still for a moment. While we wait for the results, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked, terribly, but I always avoided it. I drank a little wine, now and then, but nothing regular. And I haven’t had a drink in, oh, five years maybe? Since my divorce. It didn’t agree with me. Is that…relevant? I just want to know if this is something serious.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the smoking and drinking. It is relevant, yes. It helps us get a clearer picture. It sounds like you've been pretty healthy overall. Let's talk about your family history. Besides your sister’s heart trouble, were there any other significant illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: My father… he had diabetes, later in life. And his mother, my grandmother, she had…arthritis, I think it was. Bad arthritis. But that’s about it, really. Mostly just old age illnesses. No one had… lung problems, or anything like that. We’re Zuni, you know. We didn’t spend much time inside. Always outdoors.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your father, arthritis in your grandmother. And a Zuni family with an outdoor lifestyle. That’s good information. “Dr. Kamahele, the x-ray is ready.” Excellent. Let’s take a look. Hmm… I see some mild congestion in your lower lobes, which could explain the diminished breath sounds. There's also some enlargement of your heart, but it's not drastic. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing, but it could be early signs of congestive heart failure. Does that… sound frightening?
PATIENT: Congestive… heart failure? That does sound frightening, Doctor. Is that… serious? Like my sister? I just want to know if I can still do my errands. And if I’ll have to…you know, stay in the hospital. I don't want to be a bother. Is that what this is? I just want to get back to my life, you understand. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re frightened, Maribeth. It can be serious, but it's important to remember that it’s often manageable. And it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll end up like your sister. Everyone’s situation is different. The enlargement is mild, and we caught it early, which is good. To get a clearer picture, I want to order an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, and a blood test to check for certain markers that indicate heart strain. Those will give us a much better understanding. As for doing your errands, I don’t want to restrict you completely, but I would advise you to take it easy today. No heavy lifting, and if you feel breathless at all, stop and rest. It's best to avoid any unnecessary strain until we have the results of these tests. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Reasonable, yes. Take it easy…no heavy lifting. I can do that. But the tests…how long will they take? And will I have to come back tomorrow? I have a pottery class on Thursday. I don't want to miss that. And what if it is this… heart failure? What happens then? Will I need…medication? I just want to know what I’m facing, Doctor. Please. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s break it down. The EKG and blood tests should take about an hour, maybe a little longer with the wait times. We should have the results by tomorrow morning. And yes, I will need you to come back tomorrow to discuss them. If it is congestive heart failure, the good news is it's very treatable. Usually, it involves medication to help your heart pump more efficiently and reduce fluid buildup. It might also involve some lifestyle changes, like limiting salt and fluids. We would likely refer you to a cardiologist – a heart specialist – for further evaluation and management. They’ll be the best one to guide you through the specifics. It doesn’t automatically mean a drastic change in your life, Maribeth. Many people with heart failure live full and active lives with proper treatment. But it is important to take it seriously and follow the doctor's recommendations. Does that… ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: A little, yes. Medication… and a specialist. I can do that. No drastic changes… that’s good. Thursday’s pottery class… So, I should just take it easy today, and come back tomorrow morning? And I’ll call if anything feels…worse? I don't want to bother you unnecessarily. I know you’re busy. But I appreciate you explaining it all. It’s… a relief to know what I’m facing, even if it’s not good news. Now, about these tests… where do I go?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Take it easy today, and come back tomorrow morning. And please don’t hesitate to call if anything feels worse, or if you have any concerns at all. That’s what I’m here for. It’s never a bother. For the tests, you’ll go to the lab just down the hall, room 302. They’ll take some blood, and do the EKG right there. Just tell them Dr. Kamahele ordered it for you. The nurse will give you a printout with the results, and you can bring that with you tomorrow. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Room 302, and bring the printout. I can manage that. Thank you for your time. And for explaining everything so clearly. I… I really appreciate it. I’ll see you tomorrow morning, then. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Maribeth. I’m glad I could help. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you tomorrow. .
