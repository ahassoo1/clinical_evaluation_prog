DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Shely, nice to meet you too. Um, well, I’ve just been getting the chills lately. It’s kind of weird, it’s not like a fever chill, just… cold. It's been going on for a few days now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Chills without a fever can certainly be concerning. Could you describe the chills in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. Like, I’ll be perfectly fine, then suddenly I feel really cold, and I shiver for a bit. Then it passes. It doesn't matter what I'm wearing, really. Even if I have a sweater on, it can happen. And it doesn’t seem to be worse at any particular time of day. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Intermittent chills are helpful to know. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the chills?
PATIENT: Let me see... not really. I’ve been a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t these days? No cough, no sore throat, no body aches, no headache. Just the chills and feeling a bit… drained, maybe. I haven't taken my temperature, though. I didn’t think to, since I don’t feel sick, just cold.
DOCTOR: I see. Fatigue along with the chills is worth noting. And it’s good you haven’t experienced other typical illness symptoms. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Um, nothing major, honestly. I had the usual childhood stuff - chickenpox, measles, that kind of thing. I broke my arm when I was ten, but that healed fine. I don't have any ongoing medical conditions, like diabetes or anything. I had surgery a few years ago to get my wisdom teeth out, but it was pretty straightforward. And I’m generally pretty healthy. Oh! And I got divorced last year, which was… stressful, but I’m doing okay now. Is that the kind of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Aslan, all of that is helpful. Stressful life events can impact your health, so thank you for mentioning that. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I used to think I was allergic to cats when I was little, but my aunt has like ten cats, and I was always fine around them. So, no allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing. I try to avoid taking anything if I can, honestly. I just drink a lot of water and try to get enough sleep. And I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. I really try to keep things natural, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's good to know. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... My mom has high blood pressure, but she manages it with medication. My dad had a heart attack a few years ago, but he's doing okay now too, he takes a lot of pills. My grandmother, on my mom's side, had arthritis, but that’s about it. Nothing major on my dad's side that I know of. It’s not like anyone has, like, a really rare disease or anything. They're all pretty healthy, actually, for their age.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Finally, could you briefly describe your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I cut back when I got divorced, didn’t really help with anything. And definitely no drugs. I live a pretty quiet life, mostly work and trying to relax when I can. I spend a lot of time with my niece and nephew, they keep me busy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Ms. Aslan. It gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your temperature, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your throat. It’s a standard procedure to help determine the cause of your chills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just a little chilly, I guess.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat here, and we'll get started. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your throat looks normal. Your temperature is within the normal range. Your lymph nodes don’t feel enlarged. Do you feel any pain or tenderness anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… a general feeling of being cold. It's weird, it's not like a muscle ache or anything. I think I'm just a little stressed out, maybe? It's been a rough year. But I'm trying.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stress can absolutely manifest physically. Given your normal vital signs and the lack of other symptoms, it's possible the chills are related to stress, or perhaps a mild viral infection that hasn't fully developed. However, to be thorough, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. The CBC will check for any signs of infection, and the TSH test will rule out any thyroid issues, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause chills. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. If it puts my mind at ease, definitely. I mean, I don't want anything serious, you know? So, whatever you think is best. How long will it take to get the results? And do I need to do anything special before the blood test? Like, fast or anything?
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to fast for either test. We'll draw a small sample of blood right here in the clinic. It should only take a few minutes. The results typically come back within 24-48 hours. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on stress-reducing activities – things like exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones. Ensuring adequate rest and hydration is also important. If your chills worsen or you develop any new symptoms – like fever, cough, or body aches – please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that all sounds very reasonable. I'll try to do all those things. Stress-reducing… easier said than done, but I'll try! And I’ll definitely call if anything gets worse. Thank you, Dr. Shely. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just brush it off.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Aslan. It’s my pleasure. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood now, and we’ll be in touch soon with the results. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
