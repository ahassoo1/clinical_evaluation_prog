DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It says here you’re 24 years old. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Right. Yes, 24. Look, it's... family history, mostly. My grandmother, on my mother's side, passed away last year. Cancer. And her brother, too. It just... makes you think, you know? I’m probably worrying over nothing, but it's better to be safe, I guess. I just want to make sure I'm okay.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Theriot. Family history is important, and it’s always good to be proactive about your health. It’s definitely not worrying over nothing to want to get things checked out. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about your grandmother's cancer?
PATIENT: Well, I wasn't really close to her, to be honest. Lived in India, we didn’t see her much. But my mother said it was… lung cancer, I think? She smoked for a long time. And her brother… something with his stomach, maybe? Again, I’m not entirely sure. My mother gets very emotional when she talks about it, so I try not to press her. It's all a bit vague, really. But it was definitely cancer, both of them. And they didn’t… live very long after they found it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Lung cancer in your grandmother, and stomach cancer potentially in her brother… and both had relatively quick progressions after diagnosis. I understand it's difficult to get specific details. Beyond your family history, are you experiencing any symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: No, not really. That's the thing! I feel perfectly fine. Which is why I feel a little silly even being here. But you hear stories, right? People with no symptoms at all… And, well, I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I like to be prepared. I eat okay, I exercise… I guess I just want a clean bill of health, to put my mind at ease. It's probably nothing, but... you never know. And frankly, the thought of it being something serious keeps me up at night.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly to want to be proactive and put your mind at ease, Mr. Theriot. In fact, it's very responsible of you. And the anxiety alone is a good enough reason to get things checked out. It’s good you're a perfectionist, in a way—you’re taking care of yourself. Just to be thorough, let's go through a quick review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My weight has been pretty stable. Maybe a pound or two up or down, but nothing significant. Appetite's fine too. I eat when I'm hungry, I don't overeat or anything. I’m… reasonably healthy, if that makes sense. I mean, I'm not a gym rat or anything, but I’m not completely inactive either. I walk a lot, I try to eat my vegetables… Honestly, I'm starting to feel a bit foolish taking up your time with this. I should probably just forget about it.
DOCTOR: You're not taking up my time at all, Mr. Theriot. And it’s good to hear you're maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It’s much easier to address concerns early on, so please don't feel foolish. Okay. Any trouble with digestion—bloating, stomach pain, changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Everything’s… regular, for lack of a better word. I haven’t noticed anything out of the ordinary, honestly. Look, I’m probably wasting your time. My mother is a worrier, and I think some of it has rubbed off on me. It's just... I've read things online, you know? And it gets you thinking. Maybe I should have just ignored it. I feel perfectly fine, and I’m being ridiculous. Really. I apologize.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious, especially with a family history and information available online. And it’s okay to be worried. We can still do a basic check-up to help alleviate your concerns. It won't take long. Let’s quickly go over your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing. I've always been pretty healthy. I get a yearly physical, just the usual check-up. Blood work, the doctor listens to my heart and lungs, makes sure everything's okay... and it always is. That’s why I don’t understand why I'm even here, to be honest. It feels… irrational. I’m a teacher, I don’t have time for this sort of thing. My students need me. Perhaps I’m just stressed from work. It’s a very demanding job.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No prior hospitalizations, yearly physicals—that's all positive. And you're right, a demanding job can cause a lot of stress. Alright, just a few more questions and then we can do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've taken antibiotics a couple of times for colds, over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches… never had a reaction. I'm not really one for taking pills unless absolutely necessary. I prefer to tough it out, if possible. Honestly, this is probably all completely unnecessary. I’m starting to feel like I’m putting you through a lot of trouble for nothing. I should have just stayed home and graded papers. Really. I apologize.
DOCTOR: You're not putting me through trouble at all, Mr. Theriot. And it's good you don’t have any known allergies. Okay, last question before the exam. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I eat reasonably well, I try to get enough sleep, I walk a lot… I’m very… self-sufficient. I don’t really believe in relying on pills or supplements to solve problems. It’s all about a healthy lifestyle, in my opinion. I really am sorry for wasting your time. This is probably a complete waste of both of our time. I should have just ignored my mother’s worries and gotten back to work. I’m… I’m going to stop talking now. Really. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Theriot. No medications, vitamins or supplements. Alright. Given your family history and your expressed anxiety, despite no current symptoms, I think it’s prudent to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and put your mind at ease. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. If it'll get me out of here, then sure. Just… get it over with. I have papers to grade and a lesson plan to finish. Honestly, the thought of spending another minute in here is… stressful. I really need to get back to work. So, yes. Just… please hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and quickly check your lymph nodes. It won't take long. It will just be a quick overall assessment. We'll start with your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be quick about it. My back isn't very good, and these examination tables are… uncomfortable. Honestly, I’m starting to regret this whole thing. I probably should have just ignored my mother’s worries. It's a complete waste of my time. But... go ahead, I guess. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear – I'm not hearing any wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Lymph nodes are normal – not enlarged or tender. Everything feels within normal limits so far. No enlarged lymph nodes anywhere. Everything appears normal on the physical exam, Mr. Theriot. I'm not detecting anything concerning at this time.
PATIENT: Well. That's… good. I mean, it should be good. I’ve always been healthy. It's probably just anxiety, like you said. So… what now? Do I need any tests? Blood work? A scan? Honestly, I’d rather just get it over with if I do need something, but… I’d also be perfectly happy to just go home. Honestly. Just tell me what you think.
DOCTOR: Given your family history and your expressed anxiety, even with a normal physical exam, I do think some baseline blood work is prudent. It will give us a better picture of your overall health and help to rule out any potential issues. Specifically, I’d like to check a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a basic liver function panel. We can also add a tumor marker called CA 19-9, although it’s not a definitive test, it can sometimes be elevated with certain cancers, particularly those affecting the digestive system. We don’t need to do a scan at this time, but we can re-evaluate that if the blood work comes back with any abnormal results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you think. Blood work. Honestly, it feels… excessive, but… if it'll put my mind at ease, then fine. I’ll do the blood work. When will I get the results? And… do I need to schedule another appointment? Honestly, I’m already thinking about the papers I need to grade. So… just tell me the logistics. Please. How long will this all take?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write you a lab requisition for the blood work. It should take about a week to get the results back. The lab will draw blood from your arm, it should only take about 10-15 minutes. You don't need to fast beforehand. Once the results are back, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We can go over the results together and decide if any further testing is needed. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Mr. Theriot?
PATIENT: No. No, that’s… that’s fine. I just… want to get this over with. Thank you. Honestly. I… I need to get back to work. I appreciate your time. Please, just send me the requisition. And thank you. Honestly. I really need to go now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Theriot. Here you go. The lab is located just down the hall on your right. My nurse will be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment once the results are available. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. And please, try not to stress too much. It's good you’re being proactive about your health. Have a good day, Mr. Theriot. .
PATIENT: Yes. Fine. Thanks. .
