DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Shely, you say? Hmm. Well, I been… short of breath, I guess. And my mouth feels like the desert. Eyes too, kinda scratchy. Don't know what's going on, really. It just… happened. Not like a cold or anything. Just poof. Like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Guilds. “Short of breath” and a dry mouth and eyes… and you said this came on suddenly, without any cold symptoms?
PATIENT: Suddenly, yes. Maybe a week ago? Two? Time… it all blurs together, you know? I ain’t been sick, not like a cough or a fever. Just… dry. And gotta stop and catch my breath doing simple things. Used to be able to walk all day. Now? Forget about it. This is… annoying. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Annoying” is a good way to put it, and I appreciate you describing it that way. So, it’s been approximately one to two weeks since this started, with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and dryness in your mouth and eyes. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. … Nah, not really. Maybe a little tired, but I’m old, you know? Always tired. Can’t remember if it's more tired than usual. Used to be able to nap anywhere, anytime. Still can, I suppose. But… no, I don't think so. No cough, no… what do you call it… swelling? No nothing like that. Just… dry and puffing.
DOCTOR: Alright. No swelling, no cough, no fever… just the fatigue, shortness of breath and dryness. And you mentioned the fatigue is difficult to distinguish from your usual level. Now, Mr. Guilds, I'd like to ask about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… … Doctors always ask that. Hmm… I had… something with my heart, a long time ago. But it was fixed! They put a… a thing in it. A little wire, maybe? I don't remember much. Was a long time ago, maybe twenty years? More? They said it was good, all fixed. And… I got high blood pressure, the doctor tells me. I take a pill for it. Small, white pill. That’s about it, I think. Oh, and my knees… they ache. But everyone's knees ache when they get old!
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's helpful. So, a history of a heart condition that was treated with a procedure – likely a stent, based on your description – and a diagnosis of hypertension, which you manage with medication. And you experience some knee pain, which is common. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: … Name? No, I don't think so. It's… small and white, like I said. I get it from the pharmacy every month. They know me there. Old Man Guilds, they call me. That's enough for them. I don’t bother with names. Too much trouble to remember. It’s all just pills, pills, pills these days. They keep me going, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We can certainly confirm the medication name with the pharmacy; that's a very good idea. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, other than the procedure you mentioned for your heart?
PATIENT: Surgeries… … Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a kid. Long, long ago. And… uh… I think I had a mole removed from my back, maybe ten years ago? Small thing. They just cut it off. Didn’t hurt too bad. That’s all I can think of. Nothing major, really. Just the heart and the appendix. And a little bump. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so an appendectomy in your childhood and a mole removal approximately ten years ago. Now, Mr. Guilds, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… … That’s a tough one. My parents… they're gone now, a long time ago. Lots of heart trouble on my mother’s side, I think. And my father… he had something with his lungs, maybe? Smoked too much, that's what they said. Lots of coughing. But beyond that… I don’t really know. My brothers and sisters… haven’t seen them in years. Not much communication, you know? We all went our separate ways. So, heart trouble and… coughing, maybe. That’s all I can really say. Not very helpful, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Guilds. You've given me what you know, and that is very helpful. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoked? … Oh, yes. For a long time. Too long, probably. Started when I was a kid, foolish thing. Quit… oh, maybe twenty years ago? When they fixed my heart. Doctor said I had to. Best thing I ever did, really. Still get a craving sometimes, but I resist. Water now, mostly. Or juice. Not much good for you, that juice, but it tastes good. Yes, I used to smoke. A pack a day, easy. Foolish thing, that smoking. Very foolish.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Guilds. It’s good to hear you were able to quit. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… … Not much anymore. Used to, back in the day. A beer with dinner, maybe a glass of wine on the weekend. But now? No. Not really. Makes me feel… funny. And I don’t need any help feeling funny, you know? My knees ache enough. So, no. Not much alcohol. Maybe a sip now and then, with my son when he visits. But that's about it. Nothing regular. A little sip. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very occasional alcohol consumption. Now, just a few more questions about your current symptoms. You mentioned shortness of breath and dryness. Is the shortness of breath constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. … It's worse when I walk, of course. Gotta stop and catch my breath. And sometimes, even just talking makes it worse. But when I'm sitting still, it's not so bad. It’s like… it depends on how much I do. If I push myself, it gets bad. If I take it easy, it's alright. Not good, mind you. Just… not as bad. It comes and goes, depending on how much I exert myself. A simple thing, walking. Used to love walking. Now? Not so much. It's a bother.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And does anything relieve the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: … Sitting down, mostly. Just… resting. Taking it easy. And… water. Drinking water helps a little. Cool water. Makes my mouth feel better, and… I don't know. Calms me down, maybe. Nothing much really relieves it. Just… slowing down. Taking it easy. It's not like a cold where a hot tea fixes things. It just… is. A nuisance, really. Just sitting and waiting for it to pass.
DOCTOR: Alright. Rest and water provide some relief. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… … Not that I know of. Never really had any problems. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I'm outside, but that's just the bugs, I think. And dust. Dust makes me sneeze. But not an allergy, mind you. Just… dust. And… no, I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Never had a bad reaction to any pills, either. Never had any problems with food. So, no. No allergies. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: … Hmm… let me see… I take something for my knees, sometimes. When they really bother me. It’s a little white pill, like everything else. And… sometimes I take something for sleep, if I can't get to bed. But not every night. Just when I'm really restless. And… that's it, I think. White pill for my knees, and a white pill for sleep, sometimes. But the blood pressure pill is the one I take every day. Always that one.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a medication for blood pressure daily, a medication for your knees as needed, and a sleep aid occasionally. Now, Mr. Guilds, I’m going to ask you if you’d be comfortable if I were to perform a physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? … Well, I suppose so. Can’t hurt, I guess. But don’t poke too much. My old bones are fragile. And be gentle with my ears. They’re sensitive. Just… be careful. I don't want any surprises. Do what you gotta do, I guess. But gentle, alright? Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guilds. I will be as gentle as possible. I understand your concerns. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I do hear some slight crackling in your lungs, especially when you take a deep breath. Nothing alarming at this point, but we will need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated as well. And finally, I'll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your ears look clear, and your throat is a little dry, but no signs of infection. Everything seems relatively stable, but the crackling in your lungs and elevated blood pressure warrant some further investigation.
PATIENT: Crackling, you say? … Sounds bad. Is it serious? I don’t want any tubes or anything. I’ve seen enough doctors in my life. Just tell me what’s going on. Simple, alright? No fancy words. Is it my heart? Is it my lungs? What do I need to do? And… will it go away?
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, let me assure you, I will explain everything as clearly as possible, without any “fancy words.” The crackling I heard in your lungs could indicate a few different things, such as fluid buildup or inflammation. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it does require further investigation to determine the cause. It is possible it could be related to your heart, as heart conditions can sometimes lead to fluid buildup in the lungs. However, it could also be due to other factors, such as a mild infection or even just age-related changes. At this point, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. I also recommend a blood test to check for any signs of infection and assess your overall health. These tests will help us determine the exact cause of the crackling and develop the best course of treatment. We are not discussing tubes or anything invasive at this time. These tests are simply to gather more information. As for whether it will go away, that depends on the cause. If it's a mild infection, it may resolve with antibiotics. If it’s related to your heart, we may need to adjust your medication or consider other therapies. It’s too early to say definitively, but we will work together to find the best solution. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: X-ray… blood tests… … More poking and prodding. Just what I needed. Alright, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But I don’t want to spend all day in a hospital. And I don't drive anymore, you know. Someone has to take me. My son, maybe. He’s busy, though. Will the X-ray show if it's serious? Will I need to be… hospitalized? … I just want to be able to breathe again. That's all. And maybe sleep through the night. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your concerns completely. We will do everything we can to minimize any inconvenience. The X-ray and blood tests can be done here at the clinic, and they shouldn't take very long – perhaps an hour or so. You won’t need to be hospitalized at this time, unless the results show something unexpectedly serious, which I do not anticipate. The X-ray will give us a clear picture of your lungs and help us identify any areas of fluid buildup or inflammation. The blood tests will check for signs of infection and assess your overall health. We can schedule the tests for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. And yes, you’re right – being able to breathe comfortably and sleep through the night is not too much to ask at all. That’s exactly what we’re working towards. We can also discuss options for getting you transportation to the clinic tomorrow. Perhaps your son might be able to help, or we can explore other options. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule those tests for you?
PATIENT: Alright. Tomorrow, then. … If I have to. And see if my son can take me. He’s got a busy schedule, though. Just… don’t keep me waiting all day. And be gentle. My old bones, you know. And explain the results in simple words. No fancy medical talk. Just tell me what’s going on. That's all I ask. Schedule it, then. Tomorrow. Let's get this over with. … It’s always something, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guilds. I have scheduled the chest X-ray and blood tests for you tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. I will make a note to ensure you are seen promptly, and I will personally explain the results to you in plain language, without any medical jargon. I will also make a note regarding your concerns about being gentle, and I will remind the technicians to be as careful as possible. If your son is unable to provide transportation, please let us know, and we will do our best to assist you in finding alternative options. Do you have any questions for me before we finish for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just... tomorrow, then. … Thank you, I suppose. For getting it over with. … I'm going to go rest now. It’s exhausting just thinking about it. ...
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guilds. You’ve had a long morning. Please, take it easy and get some rest. We’ll take good care of you tomorrow. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good afternoon, and I’ll see you in the morning.
