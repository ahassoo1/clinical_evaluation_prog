DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about… a team. A sports team. I gotta get a check-up, I think. For the team. It’s… important. I don’t remember all the details, though. It’s a tryout. Yeah, a tryout.
DOCTOR: A tryout. Right. And for what sport, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Sport? Oh… uh… it involves a… ball. And running. Maybe. I… honestly, it’s been a while. It’s a good team, though. A really good team. I used to… play. A long time ago. I think.
DOCTOR: A ball and running. Okay. And you’re seeking a physical to participate in tryouts. Do you recall when these tryouts are scheduled, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Tryouts… Soon. Very soon. They sent me a… a paper. A letter, maybe? With dates. My daughter… she usually handles these things. I don’t see her much anymore, you know. She probably told me. Dates… I don’t recall. This week? Next week? It’s… a little embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: It is rather important to know the timeframe, Mr. Bartok, to ensure you’re fit to participate. Do you have any memory of why you’re needing this physical now, specifically?
PATIENT: Specific… why now? Well, they said I need it. The team. You gotta have a check-up, right? To play? It’s… common sense. They don’t want old guys dropping on the field, I suppose. I'm in pretty good shape for my age, though. I still get around. It’s just… the details slip my mind, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. Have you been experiencing any symptoms – any pain, shortness of breath, dizziness – that prompted the team to request this physical?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No… not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes. But that’s… just getting older, right? Everyone gets tired. Nothing a little rest can’t fix. No pain… well, my knees ache sometimes, but that's just from… stuff. I don’t think it's anything serious. It’s probably just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: "Stuff" is not a diagnosis, Mr. Bartok. And knee pain, even if you deem it insignificant, is worth investigating. Do you have any history of arthritis, or any previous injuries to your knees?
PATIENT: Injuries? Uh… maybe. A long time ago. Football, I think. High school. It was a long time ago. I don’t really remember. Just… a little bump here and there. Nothing major. I patched myself up, you know? Rubbed some ointment on it. Doctor usually told me to take it easy. Arthritis? I don’t know. My mother had something… with her hands. But I don’t think I have that. It's just… aches. Old age.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination. I'll need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your knee joints. Please lie down on the examination table. And try to recall anything else – anything – relevant to your medical history while I do this. It will make this much easier.
PATIENT: Examination table… Fine. Whatever you need, Doctor. Medical history… uh… I used to be pretty healthy. Ate a lot of rice and beans. Worked hard, never smoked, drank a little beer sometimes… Is that important? I’m not really one for remembering things. My daughter says I need to write it down. But I don’t see the point, really. Just do the examination, Doctor. It’s probably fine. Really.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148/92. Pulse is 78. Respiratory rate is 16. Murmur present. Will document. Range of motion is limited, crepitus present bilaterally. Tenderness to palpation medially on both knees. You have significant crepitus and limited range of motion in both knees, Mr. Bartok. The murmur will require further investigation. Have you had an echocardiogram before?
PATIENT: Echo… what? What’s that? Some kind of… test? No, I don’t think so. Never had one of those. I just… go to the doctor when something hurts. He listens to my heart, tells me to take it easy, gives me some pills, and I go home. Is it important? Will it stop me from playing? Because that would be… disappointing. I'm still good, you know. I can still run a little. Maybe. It's just… the knees. Old age.
DOCTOR: An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart, Mr. Bartok, to assess its structure and function. Given the murmur, it’s necessary. And the knee pain requires an X-ray to rule out osteoarthritis. I am ordering both. Also, I need a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. We need a baseline to see what’s going on. And I strongly advise you refrain from participating in any strenuous activity until we have the results and can determine the cause of your symptoms. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests? Doctor, I just want to play. I don’t understand all these… panels and echoes and X-rays. Is it going to be expensive? I’m on Medicare… Will it stop me from playing? Because if it does… Just… tell me if I can play. That’s all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I cannot simply tell you if you can play without proper evaluation. That would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. Medicare should cover these tests, but you will need to verify with them. The purpose of these tests is not to prevent you from playing, it’s to ensure your safety. We need to rule out any underlying conditions that could put you at risk. I am ordering the tests. Once we have the results, we can discuss your options. Until then, I strongly advise you refrain from participating in any physical activity. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: Fine. Tests. Whatever you say, Doctor. I guess… I guess I’ll get the tests. But if they say I can’t play… Just… write down what I need to do. I’m not good at remembering things. And… maybe my daughter can handle it. If she has time. Just… let me know if I can play. That’s all I really want to know. .
