DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It's August 2nd, 2025. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you. Hmm… what brings me in… yes. Well, it’s rather… frequent trips to the restroom, I believe. More often than usual, certainly. It’s been… a while now, I suppose. I don’t quite recall when it began, truthfully. It’s just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Verbos. Frequent urination can certainly be bothersome. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. When you say "frequent," could you estimate how often you're needing to go to the restroom throughout the day, compared to what was normal for you before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. Before… well, I suppose I didn’t count, did I? Now… let me think. During the day… perhaps every hour, or a little less. And then… a couple of times during the night, I'd say. It wakes me up, you see. Not every night, but… often enough to be disruptive. Is that… helpful? It’s hard to be precise, Doctor. I truly apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. It’s very common for patients to have difficulty with precise numbers. Every hour or a couple of times during the night is helpful information. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the frequent urination?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Let me ponder that. I… I don’t believe so. No pain, no burning… I feel… thirsty, perhaps. But I always have been a bit of a thirsty fellow, so that might not be new. I haven’t noticed any… weakness or fatigue, no. And nothing… unusual in the urine itself, if you understand what I mean. Just… a lot of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, burning, weakness, or changes in the urine itself, just increased thirst and volume. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to ask a bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… yes. That’s… a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. I believe I had… the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. As an adult… I had my appendix removed, many years ago. And… I think I had high blood pressure, at one point. But it was managed, I believe, with medication. I stopped taking it… some time ago. I can’t recall the specifics, Doctor. It was a long while back, and I haven’t seen a doctor regularly for… well, quite some time.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood illnesses, appendix removal, and a history of high blood pressure that was previously managed with medication. It’s alright that you don't recall all the specifics; we can try to access some of your records if that's okay with you. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at present. I stopped taking the blood pressure medication as I said, and I don’t take anything else. Vitamins… no. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly. Though I do enjoy a good pastry now and then. But no regular supplements, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had any… reactions, shall we say. I can eat anything, as far as I know. No hives, no difficulty breathing… nothing of the sort. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard, I believe.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Verbos. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a difficult one. My parents… my father, he had… heart trouble, I believe. Yes, heart trouble. He passed away, quite some time ago. My mother… she lived a long life, thankfully. I don’t recall any… specific illnesses, though she did become rather frail in her later years. As for siblings… I have a sister, but we’re not close, and I haven’t spoken to her in… well, a very long time. I don’t know her medical history, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble in your father. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And… no, certainly not any recreational drugs. I’m a rather… straightforward sort of fellow, you see.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Verbos. That’s very helpful. Now, would you mind if I performed a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please proceed. I’m quite happy to cooperate in any way I can. Though, I must warn you, I’m not the most flexible these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbos. We'll take things at your pace. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 148/92, and your pulse is 76 and regular. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are normal, with no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, but I do feel a slightly enlarged bladder. Finally, I'd like to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and sensation. Your reflexes are normal, and your sensation is intact. Everything seems generally within normal limits, Mr. Verbos, but the enlarged bladder and elevated blood pressure are worth investigating further.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure, you say? Hmm. I suppose that’s not entirely unexpected. I haven’t been as diligent about my diet as I should be, I confess. And the enlarged bladder… that explains the frequent trips, I presume? What sort of investigation are you thinking, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you acknowledge the diet, Mr. Verbos. Elevated blood pressure isn't necessarily serious at this moment, but it's something we want to manage to prevent future complications. As for the frequent urination and enlarged bladder, it could be several things. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. First, a urinalysis to check for infection or other abnormalities. Then, a blood test to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels. And finally, a prostate-specific antigen test, since you are a male over 50. This helps screen for potential prostate issues. Depending on the results, we may need to consider further imaging, like an ultrasound of your bladder. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds very reasonable. Tests are… sensible, I suppose. I’d rather know what’s going on, rather than simply wondering. A urinalysis, blood test, and… a PSA test, you said? I confess, I don’t know much about any of these things, but I trust your judgment. Where do we go from here? Do I need to give any samples immediately? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Verbos. I'm glad you feel comfortable with that plan. Yes, we'll need to collect a urine sample right away. The nurse will provide you with a sterile cup and instructions. Please try to provide a mid-stream sample—that means starting to urinate, then collecting the sample mid-flow. Then, we’ll just need a small blood sample. The lab technician will draw that for you. Typically, the results take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I'd recommend staying well-hydrated, but limiting fluids close to bedtime to see if that reduces the nighttime trips to the restroom. Also, try to incorporate more fruits, vegetables, and lean protein into your diet, and reduce your salt intake. Do you have any questions about any of that, Mr. Verbos?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds perfectly clear. A mid-stream sample, blood test… and I’ll try to be more mindful of my fluid intake and diet. I can certainly manage that. No, I believe that answers all my questions for now. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. It puts my mind at ease, somewhat.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the samples and provide you with further instructions. Have a good day, and please take care. .
PATIENT: .
