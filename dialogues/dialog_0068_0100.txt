DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… well, it’s this drug test thing. Medicare wants me to do it, I think. Something about… checking up on things? Honestly, I don't really remember all the details. It was a letter, and lots of paperwork… it's all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Right, a drug test requested by Medicare. Yes, I see a note here about potential program integrity checks. It’s not uncommon. And don’t worry about the paperwork; it is often confusing. So, to clarify, they haven't specified what they're testing for, just that you need to come in for one?
PATIENT: No, no specifics at all. Just a date and time to come here. And a bunch of numbers on the form. I mostly just signed where they told me to. I'm not good with all that official stuff, you see. I mostly just… operate the big machines. Pavers, tampers, that sort of thing. Not forms.
DOCTOR: Right, machinery operator… okay. And you haven’t been taking any new medications, or had any changes to your current medications, recently?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… I take something for my knees, the arthritis. Been on that for years. And a little something for my blood pressure, but that hasn’t changed. Not that I know of. My daughter helps me with refilling those, mostly. I can’t really remember the names, though. It's a little embarrassing, I guess.
DOCTOR: No need to be embarrassed at all, Ms. Hughston. Many patients find it difficult to keep track. Do you happen to know the dosages of either of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dosages… No, no, I really don't. I just… take the pills they give me. My daughter, Sylvie, she writes it all down. She's very organized. I could ask her, I suppose, but she’s away on vacation right now. Somewhere warm, I think. She deserves it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, since we're unable to confirm the exact medications and dosages at this time, let's proceed with the drug test as requested by Medicare. It will be a standard urine sample. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I used to get poison ivy sometimes when I was a kid, running around in the woods… but that was a long time ago. Nothing serious, never needed an EpiPen or anything. No food allergies, no reactions to anything… I think. Honestly, Doctor, I’m pretty simple. I mostly just drink tea and eat toast. Not much excitement in my life.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Hughston. Alright, then. Let's go ahead and collect the urine sample. The collection room is just down the hall, first door on the left. I'll leave a nurse to assist you and ensure proper chain of custody for the sample. After that, we can discuss the results when they come back. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Chain of custody? Oh dear. Is that… important? I just need to… pee in a cup? Will it be… uncomfortable? I have a bit of trouble starting sometimes, you see. Not a big problem usually, but… I don't want to make a mess.
DOCTOR: Chain of custody just means we need to keep track of the sample to ensure accurate results, Ms. Hughston. It's a standard procedure. And no, it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Just a regular urine sample. If you have trouble starting, don’t worry. Take your time. The nurse will be there to assist you, and we can run the tap water if that helps. We can also postpone it if you're feeling too anxious. It’s entirely up to you. Would you like me to have the nurse explain the process a bit more thoroughly?
PATIENT: Oh, well, if it's just a bit of water, that's alright. I think I can manage that. I don't want to make a fuss, you see. And I should get this done, if Medicare wants me to. Just… try not to rush me, okay? And please tell the nurse to be gentle. I’m not very good with… medical things, as you can probably tell. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hughston. I'll personally speak with the nurse and ensure a calm and comfortable experience for you. Take all the time you need. I’ll be right here if you have any questions or concerns. Let's go ahead and get you started. The nurse is waiting just inside.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I should go then.
