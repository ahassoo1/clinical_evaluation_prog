DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you’re 66 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, sixty-six. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having trouble… going. It takes a lot of effort, and sometimes it just… doesn't happen. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, maybe a month.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty with urination, you say. And this has been ongoing for approximately a month. Could you describe what you mean by “takes a lot of effort”?
PATIENT: Well, I have to push, you know? And even then, it’s not a strong stream, more like… dribbling. And after I do go, it feels like I haven't emptied everything. It’s… uncomfortable. I have to go back again pretty soon after, even if it's just a little bit. It's just… annoying, mostly. And a bit worrying, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Annoying and worrying, yes, I understand. So, straining to initiate urination, a weak stream, a sensation of incomplete emptying… and frequent return trips to the restroom. Do you find yourself getting up frequently at night to urinate as well, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that too. Not every night, but most nights I have to get up at least once, sometimes twice. It’s not as bad as it used to be, years ago, but it’s still… disruptive. I don't sleep as well, naturally. It’s not a full bladder, usually, just… the feeling I need to go.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I haven't changed my diet much. I drink about the same amount of tea as always – maybe a little less in the summer, it’s been quite warm, you know? No new medications, nothing like that. I did have a bit of a cold a few months back, but that’s gone now. Oh! And I did fall last spring, but I didn't break anything. Just a bit bruised, really. I saw a physical therapist for a little while after that.
DOCTOR: A fall last spring… and physical therapy. Right. Now, let’s go over some general medical history. Do you have any other medical problems, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was in my forties. And I have a touch of arthritis in my hands, nothing too bad, just a bit stiff in the mornings. My mother had high blood pressure, but I haven’t been diagnosed with that myself. I try to stay active, walking when the weather is good. Oh, and I have a bit of trouble with my memory sometimes, but who doesn’t at my age, eh? But nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, arthritis, family history of hypertension… and some memory concerns. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Just a few. I take a vitamin D supplement, Doctor, the doctor told me I was low on it a while back. And I have some cream for my hands, for the arthritis. Oh, and occasionally a pain reliever, ibuprofen, if my hands are really bothering me. But that’s it, really. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. That’ll involve listening to your abdomen, and I may need to do a quick neurological assessment, just to check reflexes. And possibly a digital rectal exam to assess the prostate, if you are comfortable with that. It will give me a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A rectal exam? Well… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary, Doctor? I mean, I understand you want to be thorough, but… it doesn’t sound very pleasant. Could we maybe try something else first? Perhaps a urine test?
DOCTOR: A urine test will be helpful, certainly. We will obtain a urine sample. However, a digital rectal examination, while admittedly not the most comfortable procedure, is often crucial in evaluating urinary symptoms in women, particularly to assess for any pelvic organ prolapse or other abnormalities that could be contributing to your difficulties. It provides information a urine test simply cannot. But, we can start with the urine test and discuss the option of the exam afterwards, if the results are inconclusive. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That… sounds a bit better, Doctor. Yes, let’s do the urine test first. And then… we can talk about the other thing. I suppose if you really think it’s necessary. Just… please explain everything very carefully before you do it, alright? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. I will explain everything thoroughly. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll have the nurse prepare a sample cup. She will provide instructions. Please try to provide a midstream sample for the most accurate results. After that, we can discuss the findings, and if necessary, proceed with the other examination. Do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I eat pretty much everything. Though I don't care for beets. But that's a dislike, not an allergy! I used to help my grandmother make pickled beets, and… well, I never liked them. But no, no allergies to anything important.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, if you’ll follow me, the nurse will assist you with the urine sample. After that, we’ll return here to discuss the results.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I hope it doesn't take too long. I have a bit of a bus to catch this afternoon.
