DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my ear, mostly. Feels blocked, you know? Like something’s… full of cotton, maybe? It’s been bothering me for a bit now. Not sure how long exactly. Things just… blur together these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A feeling of fullness in your ear. And you said “a bit now” – can you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… right. Hmm. Not… not recently, definitely. Not this week. Maybe… last month? Or was it before that? It’s hard to say. It just… gradually got worse, I think. I really don’t keep track of these things. It’s not painful, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, so sometime within the last couple of months it started and has gradually worsened, without pain, just a feeling of fullness. Do you notice any hearing loss with it?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… Now that you mention it… maybe? My wife used to say I didn’t listen enough, but… well, she’s not here anymore. So, it’s hard to tell if it’s worse than usual. I just turn the TV up louder, I suppose. Does that count? I don’t know. It's probably just getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay. Turning the TV up louder could be a sign, yes. And I'm sorry to hear about your wife. Let's focus on your ear for now. Have you noticed any ringing in your ear, any dizziness, or any discharge from the ear?
PATIENT: Ringing… no, not really. Sometimes I hear things, but I live near a busy road, so I figured it was just traffic. Dizziness… not that I’ve noticed. I get a little unsteady sometimes, but that’s just my knees, I think. And no, nothing coming out of my ear, thankfully. Just… full. It’s very frustrating. Can we… can we hurry this up a bit? I have some things I need to get done.
DOCTOR: Okay, no ringing, dizziness, or discharge. Just fullness, and it's frustrating. I understand you'd like to keep this brief. Let's do a quick examination of your ear, if that’s alright. It will help me determine what might be going on. I'll need to look inside your ear with an otoscope. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: An… otoscope? Is that going to be uncomfortable? I don’t like things stuck in my ears. I had a bad experience as a child… but go on, I suppose. If it's quick. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s just a lighted instrument I use to look inside your ear canal. I will be very gentle. I'm going to gently pull on your earlobe and then insert the tip of the otoscope. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort at any point. Okay, I'm looking now… I see some cerumen – that’s earwax – built up in the ear canal. It’s quite impacted, actually. That could definitely be causing the fullness you're feeling. Your eardrum looks a little obscured by the wax, but otherwise appears intact.
PATIENT: Wax… right. I never was one for cleaning my ears much. Always thought I’d do more harm than good. So, that’s it? Just wax? Can you… get it out? I’d really like that. The sooner, the better.
DOCTOR: Yes, it appears to be impacted cerumen. Fortunately, that's something we can address. We have a few options. We can try an earwax softening solution you use at home for a few days, then come back to have it flushed. Or, I can perform a cerumen removal procedure here in the office today. It involves using a small irrigation device to gently flush the wax out. The flushing is generally very effective, but there's a small risk of temporary dizziness or a slight chance of a minor ear infection. Which option would you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Everything’s a risk these days. Look, just… get it out now, if you can. I don’t want to have to come back. I really don't. The sooner this is done, the better. As long as it’s not… terribly painful. And quick, please. As quick as possible. I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I understand. We’ll proceed with the cerumen removal procedure today. I’ll explain the steps as we go, and I'll do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I’m going to warm up some water to body temperature. Then, I’ll gently insert a small syringe into your ear canal and irrigate with the water. You might feel some pressure, and you’ll likely hear some swishing sounds. Let me know immediately if you experience any pain or dizziness. I’ll stop right away if you do. Okay, here we go… ... I’m seeing some wax coming out now… a good amount… ... and more… okay, it’s starting to clear up nicely… Alright, it appears I’ve removed the majority of the impacted cerumen. Your eardrum is now visible and appears normal. The ear canal is much clearer. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh. It… it does feel better. Less… stuffy. I can hear you clearer now, I think. Still a little… echoey, maybe. But definitely better. Is it all out? Really? I feel a bit… strange, like something’s missing. But good strange, I think. Can I go now? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Yes, it appears I removed the majority of the impacted cerumen. It’s normal to feel a little strange afterwards, like something is missing - that’s your ear adjusting to being clear. The echoey sensation should subside over the next few days as the ear canal dries. I’m going to give you a prescription for some ear drops to help prevent future wax buildup. Use those as directed. I also recommend avoiding using cotton swabs in your ears, as they can actually push the wax further in. I’ll document the procedure and our findings. And yes, you are free to go now. If the fullness returns, or if you experience any pain, hearing loss, or dizziness, please schedule a follow-up appointment immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you getting that out of there so quickly. It really was bothering me. Hopefully, it stays gone. Goodbye now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and take care.
