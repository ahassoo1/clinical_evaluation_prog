DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Yadao. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's my waterworks, really. I’m having trouble… going. It’s not a complete blockage, but it takes me a long time, and it’s… weak, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Right, trouble with urination. A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to say exactly, time just… slips away, you know? But definitely noticed it more in the last few weeks. It's not painful, just… frustrating. And I have to go back and forth to the bathroom a lot, even after I think I’m done.
DOCTOR: So, no pain, just difficulty starting, a weak stream, and feeling like you don't empty your bladder completely, leading to frequent trips to the bathroom. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that's very good, Doctor. You explained it much better than I could! It's like… it just dribbles, and then stops, and then starts again. It's quite embarrassing, really. I don’t like having to keep going back to the ladies’ room.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be very disruptive. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine? Hmm… let me think. I don’t think so. It looks… normal, I suppose. The usual color. No blood, no foam… nothing like that. I haven't really looked closely, to be honest. I just go about my business. Is there something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: It's good you haven’t noticed anything unusual. Sometimes changes in the urine can be a clue, but it's not always present. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes or anything affecting your nerves?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with some pills. I stopped taking them a while ago though, he said I could. And… hmm… my knees are bad, arthritis, but that’s about it, I think. Nothing else major. No diabetes, no trouble with my nerves… I don’t think so. I used to work at the post office, you know, a lot of standing and walking. That probably didn't help the knees!
DOCTOR: Alright, controlled blood pressure, arthritis in the knees. And you stopped taking the blood pressure medication some time ago. Do you recall when you stopped taking those pills, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you're asking about dates… Let me think… It must have been… two, maybe three years ago? It was after my friend Ona had her hip replaced. We were talking about our medications at her kitchen table, and I realized I hadn’t needed the pills for a while, so I asked my doctor and he said it was fine to stop. It was a long time ago now, everything blurs together. She had her hip done in… 2022, I think? So maybe around then.
DOCTOR: Right. Approximately three years ago. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, not really. Oh! Wait. When I was a little girl, maybe six or seven, I had my tonsils out. But that was a very long time ago. And… nothing else, I don’t think. No surgeries on my knees, or anything like that. I’ve always been lucky, never needed anything major. Mostly just aches and pains from getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Well, my mother had arthritis, like me. Badly, in her hands. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. He wasn’t very good about going to the doctor, you know how men are. But other than that, not that I know of. No one in my family had any trouble with their waterworks, no. My sister’s still alive, but we don’t talk much. She lives in Chicago.
DOCTOR: Alright, family history of arthritis and heart trouble. Let’s talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked. My mother was always very strict about that. And I don’t drink much alcohol, only a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Mostly water, you know, keeps everything flowing. Maybe I need to drink more water, given my current situation! But no, nothing regularly. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and fish. I used to walk a lot, but the knees… they don't allow for much walking these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional small glass of wine. Mostly healthy diet and limited activity due to knee arthritis. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine that I know of. I’m not allergic to anything… food, pollen, dust… nothing like that. I used to get hay fever when I was a girl, but it went away when I got older. No, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I'm very lucky that way too!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Yadao. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We’ll just check your abdomen, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes, and then I’ll need to do a digital rectal exam. It’s a standard part of assessing urinary problems in women, and helps us to assess the tone of your muscles and check for any abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh… A… a rectal exam? Well, I never… Is that really necessary, Doctor? It sounds… unpleasant. I mean, I’ve told you all my symptoms, couldn't we just try some medication first? Or perhaps some exercises? I’m not very fond of… that.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mrs. Yadao, and I wouldn't suggest anything unnecessarily. However, a digital rectal exam is important to assess the prostate gland in men, and to check the tone of the pelvic floor muscles and the surrounding tissues in women. It helps us to rule out any structural problems, and to get a better understanding of what might be causing your urinary symptoms. It's a quick exam, and I will do my best to make you comfortable. We can certainly discuss medication and exercises later, but I need to gather as much information as possible first to make an informed decision about the best course of treatment. It's a standard procedure, and I assure you, it’s very important for a proper diagnosis. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Well… if you say it’s necessary… I suppose. It’s just… I’ve never had one before. What exactly does it involve? And will it hurt? I really don’t like pain, Doctor. And will it be… embarrassing? I'm a modest woman. You understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mrs. Yadao. It's natural to feel anxious about this. The exam involves me inserting a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel the size and shape of your prostate gland, and assess the surrounding tissues. It should not be painful, although you may feel some pressure or discomfort. I will explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. I will ensure your privacy is maintained throughout the procedure, and I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. I have a chaperone available if you would prefer, and we can use a smaller glove size if you are concerned about the size. It's a quick exam, and it will provide valuable information to help us determine the cause of your symptoms. Before we proceed, I will give you a gown and some privacy to change, and you can ask me any further questions you may have. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: A chaperone… yes, that would be nice. A smaller glove size too, if you have one. And please, be gentle. I really don’t want any pain. And… explain everything as you go, like you said. I suppose if it’s necessary to figure out what’s wrong… I’ll try. But I’m still very nervous, Doctor. Very nervous indeed. Perhaps you could tell me exactly what you're looking for, so I know what's going on? It might help me relax a little.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Yadao. I’m happy to explain further. I'll be checking the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate gland. We're looking for any enlargement, tenderness, or irregularities that might indicate a problem. I will also be assessing the tone of your pelvic floor muscles, which are important for controlling urination. Weak muscles can contribute to urinary symptoms. By feeling these areas, I can get a better understanding of what might be causing your difficulty starting, weak stream, and frequent urination. It's a quick exam, and I’ll explain each step as I go. I'll also check for any tenderness or masses, and assess your anal sphincter tone. I'll let the nurse know to bring a chaperone, and we will find a smaller glove size for you. Does that make you feel a little more comfortable?
PATIENT: A little, yes. Knowing what you’re looking for does help. The muscles… that sounds… worrying. Are weak muscles a serious problem, Doctor? And what if you do find something wrong? I don’t want to hear anything dreadful. Perhaps it’s just a little bit of old age, you know? I’m 66 years old. Things start to… wear out. Perhaps it's nothing serious at all. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again, that’s all. Please be quick, and be gentle. And please, explain everything. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Yadao. It's good to be prepared and knowing what to expect can certainly ease anxiety. Weak pelvic floor muscles are common as we age, and they can contribute to urinary symptoms, but they are often treatable with exercises. It doesn't necessarily mean there is anything serious wrong. If I do find anything unusual, I will explain it to you in detail, and we will discuss the best course of action together. It might be something simple, or it might require further investigation, but I won't surprise you. We'll take things one step at a time. And I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. Now, if you’ll excuse me for just a moment, I’ll get the nurse to bring the chaperone and the smaller glove size, and give you a few moments of privacy to change. The gown will be in the changing room. Just lie on your side, knees bent, and relax. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright. Thank you, Doctor. Hurry back, please. And… be gentle. I’m really very nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Yadao, we’re ready when you are. Just lie on your left side, knees bent, and relax. The nurse will stay with you throughout the procedure. I will explain everything as I go. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. I’m just going to apply a small amount of lubricant to my gloved finger… and then I’ll gently insert it into your rectum. It might feel a little strange at first, but it shouldn’t be painful. Take a deep breath, and relax your muscles.
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Just… be quick, please. And… gentle. Very gentle. I’m trying to relax, but it’s… difficult. Tell me what you’re doing, like you promised. Don’t just… surprise me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Yadao, I’m just gently inserting my finger now… and I’m slowly palpating your prostate gland. I’m checking its size, shape, and consistency. It feels… slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. There's some mild tenderness on the right side, but no hard nodules or masses. I’m now assessing the tone of your pelvic floor muscles. They feel… somewhat weak, as expected for your age, but not severely so. I’m also checking your anal sphincter tone, which feels… normal. Just relax your muscles, and try to breathe normally. This won't take much longer. Are you comfortable?
PATIENT: Weak muscles… that’s what I was afraid of. Is that bad, Doctor? Will I need… surgery? Or some kind of… injection? I really don’t like needles. The tenderness… is that serious? Is it inflammation? Or something worse? Please, tell me honestly. I can handle it, I just… need to know. And please, be done soon. This is… unpleasant. Very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Yadao, we’re finished with the examination now. You can get changed at your leisure. I understand it was unpleasant, and I appreciate your cooperation. As for your concerns, the mild tenderness is likely due to inflammation, possibly from the weak pelvic floor muscles. It’s not necessarily serious, but it does warrant further investigation to rule out any other potential causes. The weak muscles are common at your age, and can often be improved with pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. Surgery is rarely necessary for weak pelvic floor muscles, and injections are not typically recommended. We can start with a trial of pelvic floor exercises and see if that improves your symptoms. I can provide you with a handout explaining the exercises in detail, and I can also refer you to a physiotherapist who specializes in pelvic floor rehabilitation if you’d prefer. Would you like me to explain the exercises now, or would you prefer to discuss the referral option?
PATIENT: Exercises… Kegel exercises, you said? I’ve heard of those. Squeeze and release, right? But… will they really help? It all sounds… so complicated. And what if they don’t work? I don't want to spend weeks squeezing and releasing if it's all for nothing. A physiotherapist… that sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. I have my garden, you know. I can't be running off to appointments all the time. Could we just… try medication first? Perhaps something to strengthen the muscles? Or something to help me relax? I really don't want to do exercises. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again, without all this fuss. Is there anything else we can try? Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mrs. Yadao. Exercises aren’t everyone’s first choice, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to explore other options first. Unfortunately, there are no medications specifically designed to strengthen pelvic floor muscles. There are medications that can help with urinary frequency and urgency, such as antimuscarinics, but they come with potential side effects, such as dry mouth and constipation. They would address the symptoms, but not the underlying cause. Before we dismiss exercises entirely, I can show you a quick demonstration, and you can decide if it's something you're willing to try. They only take a few minutes each day, and can be done discreetly at home, while you’re watching television or reading. If you find they’re not effective after a few weeks, we can certainly explore other options, such as a referral to a physiotherapist. However, a physiotherapist might be more expensive, yes, but they can provide you with personalized guidance and support, and ensure you’re performing the exercises correctly. It’s worth considering if the exercises aren't effective. Perhaps we can start with the handout, and you can try the exercises for a week or two. If you’re not seeing any improvement, we can then discuss the referral option. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: A week or two… alright. A week or two. But if it’s too difficult, or if it doesn’t help… I want a referral then. No more fuss. I just want this sorted out. And I really don't want to spend a lot of money on physiotherapy if it's not going to make a difference. My garden needs me, you know. I can’t be spending all my time squeezing and releasing. What are the side effects of the other medication, the antimuscarinics, you said? Is it just dry mouth and constipation? Anything else I should be aware of? I don’t want to end up with a whole new set of problems. I’m 66 years old, I don't need any more complications.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Yadao. I understand your concerns completely. Antimuscarinics can sometimes cause other side effects, although they are not common. These can include blurred vision, constipation , difficulty emptying your bladder, dizziness, and, in rare cases, confusion, particularly in older adults. They can also interact with other medications you may be taking. Given your age and the potential for side effects, I wouldn’t recommend starting with antimuscarinics at this time. Let's focus on the exercises for a week or two, and see if they provide any improvement. If they don’t, we can then discuss the physiotherapy referral in more detail. I can give you a call in two weeks to check on your progress. And if you experience any side effects from the exercises, please don’t hesitate to call my office. In the meantime, I'll write you a prescription for a stool softener, just in case the exercises cause any constipation. And I'll make a note in your chart about your concerns about the physiotherapy referral. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A stool softener… alright. That’s… sensible, I suppose. Anything to avoid… problems. And a call in two weeks… yes, that’s good. Please remind me about the exercises, though. I’m terrible with instructions, you know. Squeeze and release, right? How long for? And how often? I don’t want to do it wrong. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again. That’s all. And… please don’t forget to write down those instructions for me. I’m hopeless with remembering things.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mrs. Yadao. I've written down everything in detail, just for you. Squeeze and release for 10 repetitions, three times a day, while you're sitting, standing, or lying down. You should feel a gentle contraction of the pelvic floor muscles, but it shouldn't be painful. Remember to relax between each repetition. I’ve also noted your concerns in your chart, and I’ll be sure to remind you about the physiotherapy referral during our phone call in two weeks. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you… very much. You’ve been very patient with me. And… thank you for writing down the instructions. I’ll try my best with the exercises. But if they don’t work… please remember about the physiotherapist. I think I’ll just… go home and have a lie down. It’s been… a lot. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Yadao. Rest up, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. We'll see how the exercises go, and we can discuss the physiotherapy referral if needed. Goodbye, Mrs. Yadao. Take care.
