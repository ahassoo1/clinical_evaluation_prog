DOCTOR: Hi Teah, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Georgiou, nice to meet you too! It’s good to be here. I’m just in for my yearly shots, you know, keepin’ up with things. Routine immunization visit, I think the lady on the phone called it.
DOCTOR: Okay, great! Routine immunizations are very important, absolutely. And you’re right to stay on top of things. Let me just pull up your chart here… Teah Fornes, age 53… Okay, perfect. Just to confirm, are you generally healthy, with no new medical concerns since your last visit?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s me. And yeah, pretty much. No big changes, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ older, ha! Nothing I haven’t dealt with before. I haven’t been sick sick, if that makes sense. No new worries to bring in today.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! “Usual aches and pains” – I understand completely. It’s good you’re not experiencing anything new or concerning. Now, just to be thorough, and since it has been a year, let’s quickly run through a few things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... No, not really. I mean, I don’t like shellfish, but that’s a preference, not an allergy, ha! Seriously though, nothing I’m aware of. Never had a bad reaction to anything a doctor’s given me. I think I’d remember that!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, that’s excellent. And you're right to be mindful of remembering reactions – that’s very important. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my knees sometimes, when they're botherin' me extra bad. It's just ibuprofen, the regular kind you get at the store. Nothing fancy, and I don’t take it every day, just when I need it. Oh, and a daily multivitamin, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for your knees and a daily multivitamin. Got it. Now, a quick question about your medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Nothing major, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, fallin’ off a horse. But that healed up fine. Nothing that’s been a problem since. Oh! And I’ve had the usual – chickenpox when I was little, flu shots every year… you know, the usual stuff. I haven’t had anything serious that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, a broken wrist that healed well, and routine childhood illnesses and flu vaccinations. That’s good to know. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, family... My mom had high blood pressure when she got older, and my dad, well, he just… his heart gave out. It wasn't sudden, he'd been sick for a while. My brother's fine, as far as I know, but we don’t see each other much. No real history of anything really serious on either side, if that makes sense. Nothing like cancer or anything. Mostly just… folks livin’ long lives.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of hypertension in your mother and heart disease in your father. And no significant history of cancer or other major illnesses. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not me. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I might have a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs, thank you very much. I like my peace and quiet too much!
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. That’s excellent! Alright, Teah, that gives me a good overview. Now, just to be complete, let's do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look in your ears and throat. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds good to me, Doc. Go right ahead. I always get a little nervous when they put that cold thing in my ears, ha! But I trust you. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Now, let me just take a quick look in your ears… Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Throat looks healthy, no redness or swelling. Lymph nodes are normal, not enlarged. Everything seems good so far. All right, Teah, everything seems to be in good order. Your vital signs are stable, and your physical exam is normal. Now, based on what you've told me and my exam findings, it looks like you're a good candidate for your yearly vaccinations. Would you like to go ahead with those today?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful to hear! That's a relief, honestly. Yes, absolutely, let's do the shots. Get ‘em over with and be done with it, right? What all do I need today? Is it just the flu shot, or are there others I should be gettin’?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, let’s get them done. You're right, best to get it over with! Based on your age and health history, I recommend the flu shot, a tetanus booster – it's been ten years since your last one according to your chart - and the pneumococcal vaccine, which helps protect against pneumonia. They can all be given together. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, that makes sense. Pneumococcal, huh? I hadn’t even thought about that one. Yeah, that sounds good to me, Dr. Georgiou. If you think I should get ‘em, I trust your judgment. Let’s do all three. I’ve got things to do today, so let's get this done! You just tell me what to expect, okay? I don't like surprises!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no surprises. You might feel a little pinch with each injection, and there might be some soreness at the injection site for a day or two. It’s perfectly normal. I’ll start with the flu shot, then the tetanus booster, and finally the pneumococcal vaccine. Just take a deep breath and relax, and we'll be done in a moment. Okay, first one done. And the second one. And the last one. All done! There you go. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Ooh, okay, yeah, that was… a little poke, definitely. But not awful, not awful at all. My arm feels a little… heavy, I guess? Is that normal? I'm sure it'll be okay. I don’t think I need a bandaid, honestly, those little spots are barely there. Thanks, Doc. Now what? Just gotta wait a bit to make sure I don’t keel over or somethin’?
DOCTOR: A little soreness and heaviness in your arm is perfectly normal, Teah. That’s just your body reacting to the vaccines. It should subside within a day or two. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen if you need them. And no, you don’t need to wait around – you’re perfectly fine to go! I'll just print out a vaccination record for you to keep. Here you go. This shows which vaccines you received today. Now, just a couple of things. If you experience any severe allergic reactions, like difficulty breathing or swelling of your face, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, mild side effects like fever or muscle aches are common and should resolve on their own. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect, thanks for that. Good to have that on hand. And yeah, I understand about the allergic reaction stuff, I'll be lookin' out for that. No, I don’t think I have any other questions, Doc. You explained everything really well. I appreciate you not makin' me feel like a silly hypochondriac with all my questions! Thanks again for takin’ such good care of me. I’ll see you next year, I guess!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah! It’s my pleasure. And please, never hesitate to ask questions – that’s what I’m here for. It was lovely meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you next year as well. Stay healthy! Have a wonderful day!
