DOCTOR: Good morning, Miss Snerling. Dr. Blim. I understand you’re here today. Please, tell me in your own words what brings you in. And try to be concise; my schedule is rather full.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Blim. It’s… well, it’s difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, like I might fall. It’s not constant, but it’s concerning. I work… I work with drills, for oil, and it’s… not a good feeling to be off balance when operating machinery. I apologize if that isn’t a very clear explanation. My memory isn’t what it used to be, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Unsteady, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… hard to describe the feeling. Not exactly dizziness, though I sometimes feel a little lightheaded with the unsteadiness. It’s more like… my feet aren’t quite cooperating with my brain, if that makes any sense? I feel like I have to concentrate just to walk sometimes, and even then… well, it doesn’t always work. Is that… helpful? I truly am sorry for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: "Feet not cooperating," right. And this occurs…when, specifically?
PATIENT: That is… a good question. It doesn't seem to have a particular pattern. Sometimes it's when I first get up in the morning, but not every morning. Other times, it happens mid-day, even when I’ve been sitting still. And… occasionally while I’m working. Though I try very hard not to let it happen then. I wish I could be more precise, Doctor. It feels… random. It’s been worse lately, I think. Perhaps a month or so?
DOCTOR: “Worse lately,” you say. And has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Well… my husband, Samuel, passed away about six months ago. That was… a significant change. And… I suppose work has been a little more demanding lately, with a new project starting. Other than that… no, not that I can recall. It’s difficult to think clearly, sometimes, with everything. I apologize. Is it important to know about Samuel? It just feels… rude to bring him up unless it’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Relevant is a strong word. Grief can manifest in a multitude of ways. But we must rule out more… concrete causes first. Let’s move on. Do you experience any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing…? No, not that I’ve noticed. I sometimes hear a faint humming, but I attributed that to the machinery at work. It’s a rather noisy environment, you see. Not a pleasant sound, but not… ringing. Is ringing a symptom of something serious, Doctor? I apologize for asking, I just… I worry. Samuel always handled these things.
DOCTOR: The machinery is duly noted. Ringing, or tinnitus, can indicate a number of things. But let’s focus on your symptoms. Have you experienced any headaches alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. Not severe ones, more like a dull ache at the back of my head. They come and go, and I usually just take some over-the-counter pain relievers, and they subside. They don’t seem directly related to the unsteadiness, though. Sometimes I have a headache and don’t feel unsteady, and vice versa. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m just rambling now. I truly apologize for the lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: “Not directly related,” you say. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen for the headaches, as I mentioned. And… a vitamin D supplement. The doctor at the clinic recommended it, a few years ago, after a blood test. Nothing else, I assure you. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. Samuel always said it was best to let the body heal itself, if it could. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Vitamin D, duly noted. Now, let’s discuss your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… That’s a difficult question, Doctor. I had a rather bad bout of bronchitis as a child, but I recovered fully. And… Samuel mentioned something about my blood pressure being slightly elevated during a check-up, years ago, but I don't recall any specific diagnosis or treatment. I’ve generally been quite healthy, all my life, to be honest. Apart from the occasional cold, that is. I truly apologize if I’m not being very helpful. My memory is… fragmented, at best. I wish I could recall more details.
DOCTOR: "Slightly elevated." I see. And have you ever had any surgeries, Miss Snerling?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… No, not that I recall. I had my tonsils removed as a child, I believe, but that was a very long time ago. And… nothing else. I distinctly remember Samuel being the only one who ever needed surgery. A rather complicated procedure on his knee, years ago. He recovered well, thankfully. I apologize for constantly mentioning Samuel. I just… he always remembered everything. I wish I had his memory. It’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s another difficult question, Doctor. My mother had arthritis, I believe, but it wasn’t particularly severe. And… Samuel’s father had heart problems, I think. He passed away when Samuel was quite young. Apart from that… I’m not sure. My family wasn’t particularly forthcoming about medical details. It was considered… impolite to discuss such things, I believe. I apologize for the lack of information. I truly wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… everything feels so hazy.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please stand up and follow my instructions. I'll need to assess your balance and coordination. It’s a standard procedure.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’ll do my best. Please be gentle, if you don’t mind. I'm rather worried about falling. And… if you could explain what you’re doing as you go, that would be very reassuring. I apologize for being such a bother. I just… I dislike surprises.
DOCTOR: Please stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes. Try to maintain your balance for thirty seconds. I’ll be observing you for any swaying or loss of equilibrium. Minimal swaying noted. Now, let’s try a tandem stance. Place the heel of one foot directly in front of the toes of the other. Same procedure – close your eyes and maintain your balance. Increased unsteadiness noted in tandem stance. And finally, I’ll need to assess your gait. Please walk normally across the room, and then turn around and walk back. Slightly wide-based gait with some hesitation during turns observed. Alright, please sit down.
PATIENT: That… was a little unsettling, Doctor. I felt quite unsteady, especially with my eyes closed. And the walking… I felt as though I might stumble. Is that… normal? I apologize for my clumsiness. I truly am worried something is seriously wrong. I feel rather foolish admitting it, but I'm starting to panic.
DOCTOR: "Unsettling," you say. Your examination reveals some mild balance issues, but nothing immediately alarming. However, given your history of unsteadiness and recent loss, further investigation is warranted. I suspect this could be related to a few possibilities, including inner ear issues, neurological factors, or even medication side effects, though you report minimal medication use. To rule out more serious causes, I’m going to order a basic blood panel to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and complete blood count. I'll also need to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. And finally, I recommend a referral to an audiologist for a hearing and balance evaluation. Do you have any questions regarding these tests?
PATIENT: An MRI…? That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? I’ve never had one before, and I’m rather claustrophobic, I believe. And… what exactly are you looking for? I apologize for my apprehension, but this is all rather overwhelming. And… how long will it take to get the results? I worry about delaying work further. Perhaps it’s just stress…? Samuel always said I worried too much. Is there… anything else I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: An MRI is a standard procedure to rule out serious pathology. It is non-invasive, though I understand your apprehension regarding claustrophobia. The facility can provide mild sedation if necessary. We must eliminate all possibilities. As for the timeline, the blood work results should be available within 48 hours. The MRI, however, may take a few days to schedule and a further 24-48 hours for the radiologist to interpret the results. Concerning other issues... the possibility of inner ear dysfunction is real. Given your symptoms, we cannot dismiss it. I’m also considering the possibility of a migraine variant affecting your balance. However, a thorough investigation is crucial. We need to rule out any red flags before we proceed. Do you have any known allergies to contrast dyes?
PATIENT: Contrast dyes…? I honestly don’t recall, Doctor. Samuel always handled my medical appointments, and I rarely paid attention to such details. I believe I've never had any issues with allergies in general, but I’m not certain about dyes. I truly apologize for my lack of knowledge. Is it common to use dyes with an MRI? And… what exactly are red flags? I’m starting to panic again. Perhaps I should just try to relax and see if it subsides…? Samuel always said worrying never solved anything, but… this feels different. I feel as though something is seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, contrast dyes are sometimes used with an MRI to enhance the images. We will, of course, assess your risk factors before proceeding. As for "red flags," I'm referring to signs of a stroke, tumor, or other serious neurological condition. Given your hesitancy and lack of clarity, I am going to refer you to a neurologist immediately. They will be better equipped to perform a comprehensive neurological examination and determine the appropriate course of action. I will provide you with a referral order now. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And, for your peace of mind, I will also order an EKG to rule out any cardiac issues that may be contributing to your symptoms. Do you have any questions before I complete these orders?
PATIENT: A neurologist…? This sounds… very serious, Doctor. Is it that bad? I feel as though I’m falling apart. An EKG too? I haven’t even had a cold in years, let alone heart problems. I… I don't understand. Samuel always said I was perfectly healthy. Is… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Should I avoid driving? Should I be resting? I feel so helpless and confused. Perhaps I should just go home and lie down… Samuel always knew what to do. This is all so overwhelming. And… what if they find something terrible? I apologize for my emotional state, but I'm starting to panic uncontrollably. I truly am frightened.
DOCTOR: Miss Snerling, you are understandably anxious. However, it is crucial to remain calm and rational. I am ordering these tests as a precautionary measure, to rule out any potential issues. It does not necessarily indicate a serious problem. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid strenuous activity. Driving is permissible, but only if you feel comfortable and confident. And yes, rest is always beneficial. Frankly, your emotional state is not helping. I understand you have experienced a recent loss, but you must focus on your health and cooperate with the medical professionals. We are here to help, but we need your assistance. I have completed the referral order and the EKG request. The nurse will provide you with the necessary paperwork and schedule the appointments. Do you have any further questions, or may I conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No… I believe that is all, Doctor. Thank you… I suppose. I apologize for my… emotional state. I just… everything feels so uncertain. I’ll… I’ll schedule the appointments. And I’ll try to remain calm. It’s just… difficult. Thank you again. .
