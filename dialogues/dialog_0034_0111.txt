DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s rather straightforward. I’ve noticed a… darkening of the skin, you see. And I tire easily. Honestly, I haven’t the time for this, but my wife insisted. It’s probably nothing, but she worries unduly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. It's good that you're here, and it’s always wise to check things out when you notice a change. A darkening of the skin and fatigue… alright. To start, could you tell me where you’ve noticed this darkening?
PATIENT: Everywhere, really. It’s not… localized. Arms, face… the usual places, I suppose. It's a general dullness, not some specific spot. And frankly, I work outdoors, you know. Reinforcing iron. It’s a physical job. Perhaps it’s just the sun. Though I do take precautions, of course. One isn’t foolish.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s a generalized darkening, and you’ve been working outdoors. That's helpful information. And you mentioned fatigue—how long have you been feeling tired, and would you describe it as a constant tiredness, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, for months now. It’s not a sudden thing. A gradual… wearing down. Constant, yes. A persistent… lack of pep. Honestly, at my age, one expects some decline. It’s not as if I’m running marathons, you know. I simply wish to ascertain it’s nothing…serious, so I can get back to work. Time is money, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about getting back to work, Mr. Drahota, and I appreciate you clarifying it’s been a gradual onset. "Lack of pep" is a good way to describe it. To get a better picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past history? Goodness. That's a… extensive question. I've lived eighty-five years, Doctor. There have been… bumps and scrapes. Nothing significant. A cold here, a flu there. I’ve always been a robust individual. I don’t recall any… major illnesses. I think I had the measles as a boy. My wife keeps the records, you see. Perhaps you should ask her. It's all rather a blur. Honestly, I don't see the relevance. I feel… unwell now. What does measles from seventy years ago have to do with this?
DOCTOR: You’re right to question the relevance, Mr. Drahota. I apologize for the broad question; it’s just standard procedure. Since your wife keeps the records, perhaps we can look those up shortly. In the meantime, have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Good heavens, no! I eat a sensible diet. Rice, vegetables, some pork. I wouldn’t dream of indulging in sugary sweets. High blood pressure? I’ve never had it checked, to be frank. And heart problems? I’ve always had a strong heart. I’ve done manual labor my entire life. It's a testament to my constitution. Really, Doctor, I think you're asking rather unnecessary questions. I’m a working man, not some… delicate flower. If my wife is so concerned, she can provide you with all the details. I simply want to know if I can continue working.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I apologize if I’m taking up your time. It's good to hear you've maintained a good diet and have been physically active. However, even healthy individuals can develop medical conditions, which is why these questions are important. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely not. I rely on my own strength. I take no pills, no potions, nothing of the sort. A healthy lifestyle, Doctor. That’s the key. Perhaps a little ginseng now and then, for… vitality. But nothing regular. Vitamins? My wife occasionally tries to foist them upon me, but I usually decline. Honestly, these modern remedies… I have little faith in them. I've lived a long life without needing such… crutches. Now, can we please get to the bottom of this so I can return to work? My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I appreciate you clarifying that you mostly avoid medications and supplements. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, Doctor, that's… a rather lengthy and unhelpful topic. My parents… they lived long lives, both of them. But they weren't ones for… going to doctors. They believed in hard work and resilience. I recall my grandfather was… strong, but that's about it. There weren't detailed records, you see. We weren’t a family of hypochondriacs, constantly fretting over every little ailment. It's all rather vague, I'm afraid. Do you really think my ancestors’ health has anything to do with a bit of fatigue and a darkening of the skin? I find it rather… irrelevant.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Drahota. While family history isn’t always definitive, it can sometimes provide clues. Since detailed records aren't available, we can move on. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! A civilized man doesn't indulge in such… vulgar habits. And alcohol… occasionally. A glass of rice wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. A small indulgence. I don't frequent bars or anything of the sort. A moderate lifestyle, Doctor. That's the key. I’ve always been careful with my health. Now, can we please move on? This is becoming… tedious. I have work to return to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Thank you for clarifying. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I’ve always had a robust constitution. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not in eighty-five years. Dust, pollen… I tolerate everything. Honestly, Doctor, I think you’re grasping at straws. I’m a healthy man. A bit tired, perhaps, and a little darker, but fundamentally sound. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to get this over with. I have a schedule to keep. Let’s get to the exam, shall we? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your skin. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Mr. Drahota, at 160 over 95. I'm going to listen to your heart now. I hear a slight murmur when listening to your heart. Nothing immediately concerning, but something we should keep an eye on. Now, I'll listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. As you mentioned, your skin does have a generalized darkening. I don’t see any specific rashes or lesions. I will palpate some of the areas. The texture feels normal. Now, do you have any questions about the exam so far?
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure? A murmur? Good heavens. I knew I shouldn't have bothered with this. Is it serious, Doctor? Will it prevent me from working? That’s all I care about. I have a job to do, and I can't afford to be sidelined by… ailments. Honestly, all this poking and listening… I still maintain it’s probably just the sun. I work outdoors, you know. Now, are you going to tell me if I can continue working, or are we going to continue with this endless examination? I’m losing valuable time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Drahota. It’s good you’re asking these questions. The elevated blood pressure and murmur warrant further investigation, but they don’t necessarily mean you can’t continue working immediately. However, we need to determine the cause and ensure it doesn’t pose a significant risk to your health. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. I'd also like to check your kidney function. Additionally, an EKG would be helpful to evaluate the murmur. These tests will help us rule out any underlying conditions causing the fatigue and hyperpigmentation, and assess your overall health. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? Good heavens, the indignity of it all! Honestly, Doctor, it’s becoming rather excessive. I suppose… I suppose I have no choice. If it’s the only way to ascertain I can return to work, then very well. But I expect a swift turnaround. I haven’t got all day to sit around waiting for results. And please, no unnecessary poking or prodding. I’m a working man, not a… laboratory specimen. Just tell me what needs to be done, and let’s get it over with. I trust you understand the urgency of the matter. My livelihood depends on it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your urgency, Mr. Drahota, and I will ensure the tests are processed as quickly as possible. We'll get you in and out efficiently. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re expecting you. The EKG will be done in the same room after the blood work. It’s a quick and painless procedure – just some sticky pads on your chest. Here are the forms. The lab technician will explain the process. Once the tests are complete, we’ll review the results together and discuss a plan. In the meantime, I recommend limiting strenuous activity until we have the results. I'll also want to discuss some lifestyle modifications, regardless of the test results, to help manage your blood pressure and overall health. Do you have any questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve lived a long and productive life. I don’t need lectures on healthy living. I’ve always taken care of myself. But very well. I’ll go to the lab. Just… please, make it quick. I have work to return to. And if these tests reveal something serious, I expect a clear explanation and a swift resolution. I haven’t got time for… complications. Thank you. I believe that will be all. I trust you’ll expedite the results. Good day, Doctor.
