DOCTOR: Right, Ms. Woodring. Triana, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so if we could just get right to it, that’d be great. It's been…awful.
DOCTOR: "Awful" is…not very specific. We need something to work with here. What exactly is awful?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? What do you want me to say? I’ve been…well, let's just say I've been glued to the bathroom for three days. Diarrhea. Non-stop. And nothing seems to help. I've tried…things. Over-the-counter stuff. It just keeps going. I’m losing weight, and frankly, it's embarrassing. Is that specific enough for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's marginally better. Three days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Starting…let me think…Sunday, I think it was. And it’s not getting better. It’s actually…worse, if that's even possible. Honestly, I’m starting to think it’s something I ate, but I haven't changed my diet recently. I eat pretty normally.
DOCTOR: Normally…right. And what does "normally" entail?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t need a lecture on my eating habits. I eat…food. Fish, mostly. We’re Tlingit, you know? It's part of our culture. And some rice, vegetables…standard stuff. I don't eat a lot of junk food, if that’s what you’re getting at. This isn’t a weight issue. It’s a…bathroom issue.
DOCTOR: I'm simply gathering information, Ms. Woodring. Cultural context is helpful, but details are essential. Any recent travel?
PATIENT: Travel? No. Why would I be traveling? I haven’t left town in months. I barely have the energy to walk to the store, let alone go anywhere. This has really knocked me off my feet. I just want this to stop. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Not really. I felt a little warm yesterday, maybe, but I didn't bother taking my temperature. Honestly, I just feel weak and tired. And… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. It’s not just the, you know… the running. It's cramping, too. Really bad cramping.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you trying to gross me out? Really? Look, I’m not going to…no. No blood. Not that I've seen, anyway. I try not to…look too closely. It's unpleasant enough as it is. This whole thing is just…disgusting. I just want a pill or something to make it stop. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Let's just have a quick listen and feel. Just routine, Ms. Woodring. Don’t tense up. Is it painful anywhere specifically?
PATIENT: Ow! Okay, yes. Right… there. That hurts. And…a little bit all over, to be honest. It's just a general ache. Like… everything is cramping. I told you. Can we just skip the poking and prodding and get to the medicine, please? I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness is present in the lower quadrants, and guarding is mild. No rebound tenderness noted. Bowel sounds are…hyperactive. It's not surprising you feel uncomfortable. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No vomiting, thankfully. Just…the other thing. Constantly. And the cramping. Honestly, I'm getting dehydrated, I can feel it. I’ve been trying to drink water, but I can barely keep anything down. This is just…awful. Really, really awful. And it's been three days. Three days of this! Can we please just do something? I don’t understand why we’re still talking. I'm a grown woman; I know I'm sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Likely viral gastroenteritis. Self-limiting, usually. But three days is a bit long. I'm going to order a stool sample just to rule out anything… more serious. And I'll prescribe you something for the symptoms. Don’t expect miracles. It's a pill, not magic. Plenty of fluids, bland diet, rest. If it doesn’t improve in 48 hours, or if you see blood…then, and only then, you come back. Understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes, I understand. Blood. Bland diet. I get it. Three days of this, and now I have to jump through hoops. Honestly. Look, thank you, I guess. But I’m really not feeling well, and I just want to go home and try to sleep. If it’s not better in two days, I'll call. Don't expect a happy phone call.
