DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. VODZAK, nice to meet you too! Um, well, I've been getting chills lately. It's a bit weird, honestly. Not a fever or anything, just… cold. Like when you're getting a cold, but without the other stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills without a fever or other cold symptoms. That is a bit unusual. Can you tell me a little more about these chills?
PATIENT: Yeah, it’s just… they come and go. Sometimes it's just my arms and legs, other times it’s like my whole body. It doesn't really seem to be connected to being cold, either. I was just perfectly comfortable yesterday, and then bam, chills. It’s been going on for about a week, I think. Maybe a little longer? It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: A week or so, coming and going… and not related to temperature changes. Hmm. Are the chills constant when they happen, or do they fluctuate in intensity?
PATIENT: They definitely fluctuate. Like, sometimes it’s just a little shiver, and other times I'm really shaking. It’s not awful shaking, but noticeable, you know? Enough that I've grabbed a blanket a couple of times even when the house is warm. And it seems worse in the evenings, maybe? I haven't really kept track, to be honest. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, more pronounced in the evenings, fluctuating intensity… that gives us a little more to work with. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the chills?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I mean, I’ve been a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t? Work’s been busy. No aches, no sore throat, no cough, no stomach problems… Just the chills and maybe a bit of extra tiredness. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I think my appetite has been a little off. Not that I'm not eating, just not as hungry as usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of decreased appetite along with the chills and fatigue. No other associated symptoms. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else. And I had my tonsils out when I was younger, but that’s about it. No allergies, no asthma, nothing major. I generally feel pretty healthy, honestly. This is just… weird. I'm not usually one to come to the doctor for every little thing.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No significant past medical history. Any surgeries other than your tonsils?
PATIENT: Nope, just the tonsils. And that was… ages ago, when I was maybe eight? Definitely haven’t had any surgery since then. I try to avoid hospitals if I can!
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Um, my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some issues with his heart a few years back, but other than that, everyone's pretty healthy. Nothing really running in the family that I know of, like autoimmune stuff or anything. They’re both Moroccan, if that matters? I know sometimes things can be more common in certain backgrounds.
DOCTOR: That’s good information. Knowing your family history is helpful. Yes, sometimes there are genetic predispositions to certain conditions. And being of Moroccan descent is good to note. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. I do drink… maybe a glass of wine with dinner a couple of times a week? Nothing crazy. And I try to eat pretty healthy, lots of vegetables, but I do have a sweet tooth, so I indulge sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate alcohol consumption and a bit of a sweet tooth. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. I try to get everything I need from my diet, and I haven’t really felt the need to take anything extra. I do use a multivitamin occasionally if I feel like I haven't been eating well for a few days, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no regular medications or supplements. That simplifies things. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement!
DOCTOR: Great. Let's start with your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit – normal. Pulse is 72 and regular. Blood pressure is 120 over 80 – also within the normal range. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I'll also palpate your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Finally, I’ll check your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal in size and consistency, no nodules detected. Everything seems normal so far physically, which is good.
PATIENT: Okay, that's good to hear! I was starting to get a little worried there. So… what do you think it is? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's good that the physical exam didn’t reveal anything concerning, so I don’t believe it’s anything immediately serious. However, the chills without any other obvious symptoms are a bit puzzling. There are a few possibilities we should investigate. It could be a mild viral infection that’s not fully presenting with typical symptoms. Sometimes these can cause unexplained chills and fatigue. Another possibility, though less likely given your normal thyroid exam, is a subtle thyroid issue. Finally, we should rule out any vitamin deficiencies, particularly Vitamin D, as that can sometimes manifest as fatigue and unexplained chills. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These will include a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a Vitamin D level. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever it takes to figure out what's going on. Blood tests are fine. I just want to feel normal again. Do I need to do anything to prepare for them? Fasting or anything?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. Alright, for these tests, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. So, ideally, you would have your last meal around 8 pm tonight and come in tomorrow morning for the blood draw. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take long. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s perfectly fine. 8 pm sounds good. No food after that. I can definitely manage that. Thank you, Dr. VODZAK. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure out what’s going on. Is there anything else I need to do before tomorrow?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I can help. No, there’s nothing else you need to do specifically. Just try to get some rest tonight. If your symptoms worsen significantly – if you develop a fever, severe muscle aches, or shortness of breath – please don't hesitate to call the clinic or go to the nearest emergency room. I’ll have the lab order sent over electronically to the lab downstairs. You can go there anytime tomorrow morning. They will likely ask for your insurance information. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You explained everything really clearly. I appreciate it. I’ll see you tomorrow then, I guess. Thank you again, Dr. VODZAK.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Get some rest, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good evening, Jailenne.
