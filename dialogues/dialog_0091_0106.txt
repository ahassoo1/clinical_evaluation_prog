DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, finally. It's about my foot. It's been…troublesome. A sore, really. A nasty one, and it just won't heal. I’ve had it for…oh, goodness, it must be close to three months now. It's on my right foot, and it’s quite painful when I walk.
DOCTOR: I understand. A sore on your right foot for approximately three months that’s causing you pain with walking. That certainly sounds troublesome. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the sore itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What do you want to know? It's…red, of course. And it’s…well, it’s not a neat little thing. It's kind of…spread out. Not huge, but not tiny either. And it weeps. It leaks. Honestly, it's disgusting. I have to bandage it every day, and sometimes the bandages stick and it hurts to take them off. I keep it as clean as I can, but…it just doesn't get better.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so forthcoming, Ms. Cannington. It's helpful to have that detailed description. “Red, spread out, and weeping,” with difficulty removing the bandages…that gives me a clearer picture. Has there been any change in the appearance of the sore recently?
PATIENT: Oh, changes? Yes! It seems to be…deeper, I think. That’s why I’m here, you know. It wasn't this bad before. And the skin around it…well, it’s gotten a bit darker, almost purple-ish. I'm a medical scientist, you know, I should be able to handle this myself, but... honestly, it's worrying me. It just doesn't behave like a normal sore should.
DOCTOR: I see. “Deeper, and the surrounding skin is darker, almost purple-ish.” That’s certainly concerning, and it’s wise of you to seek medical attention despite your background. To clarify, when you say you’re a medical scientist, what field were you in, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Well, don't act so surprised. I specialized in cellular pathology, mostly. I spent years looking at tissues under a microscope, identifying…well, all sorts of things. Cancer cells, infections, that sort of thing. But that was a long time ago. And this isn’t a neatly contained tissue sample, is it? It’s…a foot sore. A messy, awful foot sore. And frankly, I suspect it has something to do with this…diabetes. The doctor kept harping on about it.
DOCTOR: Cellular pathology – that’s excellent background, Ms. Cannington. That expertise will be helpful as we discuss this. And you are right to mention the diabetes. That can certainly contribute to foot sores and slower healing. Do you currently take any medications for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Several. Let me see… there’s Metformin, of course, been on that for years. And then there's… hmm… Glipizide, I think? And something for the blood pressure, but I can't quite recall the name. They change them around sometimes. Honestly, keeping track of it all is a bother. And I take something for the cholesterol, too. A little orange pill, I believe. I used to write it all down, but…well, things slip your mind these days, don't they?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can be difficult to keep track of everything. Metformin, Glipizide, a medication for blood pressure, and something for cholesterol. That's very helpful. Do you experience any allergies to any medications, or have you had any reactions in the past?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I'm aware of. I've taken all sorts of things over the years. I used to be very careful about documenting everything, being a scientist and all, but…well, things get lost. I had a bit of an upset stomach once with…something, a long time ago, but I can’t recall what it was. Nothing serious. I'm not prone to allergies, if that's what you're asking. Mostly just annoyed by all the pills, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, just some mild stomach upset in the past. I appreciate you letting me know. Now, to get a better understanding of the sore itself, would you mind if I took a look at your right foot?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Finally getting to the point, are you? Yes, go ahead. It’s not a pretty sight, I warn you. I’ve done my best to keep it covered, but it’s…rather unpleasant. Just try not to make a mess, alright? I’ve had quite enough of messes lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. I see the sore here on the dorsal aspect of your foot. It’s approximately 3 centimeters in diameter, with some surrounding erythema and induration. There is some serous drainage present, and the wound bed appears…granulated, but with some areas of exposed tendon. Palpation elicits significant pain. I also note some peripheral edema in your foot and ankle. The pulses are diminished, but palpable. The diminished pulses and surrounding edema are concerning, Ms. Cannington. I want to be thorough, and I’d like to check your sensation in your foot as well. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exposed tendon? Goodness. That doesn't sound good at all. And diminished pulses? I knew something wasn’t right. This is why I came to you, you know. I may be a scientist, but I’m not a…a foot doctor. Yes, check my sensation, whatever that means. But be gentle, alright? It's already quite painful. I suppose you have some sort of…pokey thing for that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cannington. I’ll use a monofilament to assess your ability to feel light touch. It’s a gentle test, and it will help me determine if there is any nerve damage. I’ll start with the top of your foot, and then move to the bottom. Please let me know if you feel any pressure or pain. I’m noting decreased sensation in several areas, particularly around the wound site and along the lateral aspect of your foot. This, combined with the exposed tendon, diminished pulses, and edema, is concerning for a potential diabetic foot ulcer with possible underlying osteomyelitis and vascular insufficiency.
PATIENT: Osteo-what now? Honestly, you're using all sorts of fancy words. I may be a scientist, but you're losing me. Underlying…vascular…insufficiency? Is that bad? It sounds dreadful. So, what does this mean? Am I going to lose my foot? Don't beat around the bush, young man. I want a straight answer. I've lived a long life, and I’m not afraid of hearing the truth.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, you are right to ask for a straight answer. “Osteomyelitis” means an infection in the bone. “Vascular insufficiency” refers to reduced blood flow to your foot. Given your history of diabetes, diminished pulses, decreased sensation, and the appearance of the ulcer, we need to take this very seriously. The concern is that the ulcer is not healing properly, and there's a risk of the infection spreading to the bone and surrounding tissues. Without adequate blood flow, healing is significantly impaired, and the risk of amputation does increase. However, I want to assure you that we are not at that point yet. We need to perform some further investigations to determine the extent of the infection and assess the blood flow to your foot. I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count and inflammatory markers. We will also need to obtain an X-ray of your foot to look for any signs of bone infection. And I recommend a vascular study, such as a Doppler ultrasound, to assess the blood flow in your arteries.
PATIENT: Blood tests? X-rays? More tests? Honestly, it's one thing after another. And a…Doppler…ultra-sound? Are you trying to scare me, young man? I understand you’re a doctor, but you’re using all sorts of frightening terms. I came here for a simple foot sore, and now you're talking about…amputation? Look, I've lived a long life. I've seen things. I've done things. I don't want to end up losing my foot over some silly sore. What are the chances…what are the chances we can fix this without resorting to such drastic measures? Tell me the truth. Don't sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your fear, and I apologize if I’ve overwhelmed you with medical terminology. I assure you, I am not trying to scare you, but I believe it’s important to be upfront about the potential risks. The chances of successful treatment without amputation depend on several factors, including the severity of the infection, the extent of vascular insufficiency, and your overall health. If we can identify the infection early and restore adequate blood flow to your foot, the chances of healing are significantly improved. We will start with the blood tests and X-ray to assess the extent of the infection. The vascular study will help us determine if there are any blockages in the arteries that are preventing blood flow to your foot. Based on the results of these tests, we can develop a treatment plan that may include antibiotics to fight the infection, wound care to promote healing, and potentially vascular intervention, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, to restore blood flow. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to avoid amputation. However, if the infection is severe and cannot be controlled with antibiotics and vascular intervention, amputation may be necessary to prevent the spread of infection and protect your overall health. I want to be transparent with you about this possibility, but I emphasize that it is not our primary goal. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: Angioplasty…bypass surgery… Honestly, it sounds like I'm falling apart. I'm 89 years old! Do I even have the strength for all that? And what if it doesn't work? What if all those tests show it's…too late? Look, I’ve always been a practical woman. A scientist, remember? Let’s be realistic. What are the chances of…success? If the odds are slim, I’m not sure I want to put myself through all that trouble. I’ve lived a good life. Perhaps it’s time to…accept things as they are. But before I make any decisions, I want to know…honestly…what are my options, even if they’re not the ones I want to hear? Tell me everything. All of it.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, you are right to ask for a complete and honest assessment. I admire your practicality and courage in facing this situation. Let's discuss all your options, even the ones that may be difficult to hear. First, we have the aggressive treatment path, which involves antibiotics, wound care, and vascular intervention. The success of this approach depends on several factors, including the type of bacteria causing the infection, the severity of vascular insufficiency, and your overall health. If the infection is localized and we can restore adequate blood flow, the chances of healing are significantly improved. However, there is a risk of complications, such as infection recurrence, wound dehiscence, and vascular graft failure. The estimated success rate for this approach is approximately 60-80%, but it can vary depending on the individual case. Second, we have a more conservative treatment approach, which involves antibiotics, wound care, and close monitoring. This approach is typically reserved for patients who are not candidates for vascular intervention or who have significant comorbidities. However, the risk of infection recurrence and amputation is higher with this approach. The estimated success rate for this approach is approximately 30-50%. Finally, we have the option of palliative care, which focuses on relieving symptoms and improving quality of life. This approach is typically reserved for patients who are not candidates for any form of curative treatment. However, it can provide comfort and support during a difficult time. Given your age and overall health, we need to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of each approach. I recommend that we start with the blood tests and X-ray to assess the extent of the infection. We will also need to consult with a vascular surgeon to assess your candidacy for vascular intervention. Based on the results of these tests, we can develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your individual needs and preferences. Do you have any further questions about these options?
PATIENT: Vascular surgeon… another specialist. It never ends, does it? Look, I appreciate you laying everything out like this. Honestly, I do. But… what are the chances, realistically, that I'm even a candidate for this vascular intervention? I'm 89 years old, and I haven't exactly been taking care of myself lately. I’ve got a bit of a heart condition, and my kidneys aren’t what they used to be. If the chances are slim… if I’m not a good candidate… then what’s the point of all the tests? It seems like a waste of time and money, honestly. If I’m not going to be able to have the surgery, then I’d rather just… focus on making myself comfortable. Perhaps some pain medication and…a nice chair. That’s all I really need at this point.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, your concerns are entirely valid. Given your age and medical history, the question of candidacy for vascular intervention is a crucial one. It’s wise of you to consider the potential benefits and risks before undergoing further testing. To determine your candidacy, we would need to consult with a vascular surgeon who can review your medical records and perform a thorough vascular assessment. This assessment typically includes an ankle-brachial index to measure blood flow in your legs and feet, as well as a Doppler ultrasound to identify any blockages in your arteries. The surgeon will also need to assess your overall health and determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery. However, based on your description of your medical history, it is possible that you may not be a suitable candidate for vascular intervention. The presence of a heart condition and kidney problems can increase the risk of complications during and after surgery. If this is the case, we can focus on optimizing your comfort and quality of life with pain medication, wound care, and close monitoring. We can also explore other options for managing your symptoms, such as compression therapy and nutritional support. If you would like, I can schedule a consultation with a vascular surgeon to assess your candidacy for intervention. However, if you would prefer to focus on comfort care, we can proceed directly with that approach. The decision is entirely yours, and I will support you in whatever you choose. Would you like me to schedule that consultation, or would you prefer to discuss comfort care options at this time?
PATIENT: No. No consultation. I've had enough tests in my life to last several lifetimes. If the chances are slim, and it sounds like they are, then there's no point in putting myself through all that trouble. Let’s talk about…comfort care. Pain medication. What are my options? I don't want to be in agony. And what about…wound care? Can you keep it clean and bandaged? I don’t want it to get infected. Honestly, that’s all I really care about at this point. Keeping it clean and comfortable.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. We can absolutely focus on maximizing your comfort and preventing infection. I completely understand your decision. For pain management, we have several options available. We can start with oral pain medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to relieve mild to moderate pain. If these medications are not effective, we can consider stronger pain medications, such as opioids, on a short-term basis. However, we will carefully monitor your response to these medications and adjust the dosage as needed to minimize any side effects. For wound care, we will keep the wound clean and bandaged to prevent infection. We can use a variety of dressings to promote healing and absorb any drainage. We will also monitor the wound for any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus. If we detect any signs of infection, we will start antibiotics immediately. We can also consult with a wound care specialist to optimize your treatment plan. I can also arrange for a home health nurse to visit you regularly to monitor your wound, provide wound care, and adjust your pain medication as needed. This will help ensure that you are receiving the best possible care in the comfort of your own home. Would you like me to schedule a visit with a home health nurse?
PATIENT: Yes. A home health nurse…that would be wonderful. I can’t manage all that on my own. Just someone to keep it clean and bandaged… and make sure I’m not in agony. That’s all I ask. And please… no more tests. I’ve had enough poking and prodding to last a lifetime. Thank you, young man. Thank you for listening to me. And thank you for not trying to scare me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cannington. It was my pleasure. I completely understand your concerns, and I am happy to provide you with the best possible care in a way that feels comfortable and respectful. I will schedule a visit with a home health nurse as soon as possible. They will contact you directly to arrange a convenient time. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening pain, signs of infection, or any other concerns. I’m also going to write a prescription for acetaminophen with hydrocodone for breakthrough pain. It's important to use it only as directed, and we will regularly monitor your response. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. You’ve been very kind, young man. Thank you again. And… please, don't worry about me too much. I've lived a long life, and I’m ready for whatever comes. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go home and take a nap. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cannington. Get some rest. And please, remember that we are here for you if you need anything at all. Take care, and have a peaceful day. .
