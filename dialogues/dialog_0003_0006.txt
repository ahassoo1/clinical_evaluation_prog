DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, for the past... maybe a week now, I've been coughing up a little bit of blood. It's not a lot, but enough to worry me. It scares me, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Coughing up blood... hemoptysis, as we call it. And it’s been approximately one week. Now, Ms. Weichers, when you say “a little bit,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. It's... like, streaks. Thin red lines mixed in with the mucus when I cough. Not every time, but often. Sometimes it's brighter red, sometimes darker. It's not a big pool, Doctor. More like... spots, really. Does that make sense? I apologize, I am not good at explaining.
DOCTOR: “Streaks” and “spots”… alright. And is this accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I have been feeling quite tired lately. More tired than usual, even after a full night of sleep. And… a little bit of a chest pain, when I take a deep breath. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. And I think maybe a small fever, but I haven't taken my temperature to be sure. It's just a feeling, you know?
DOCTOR: Fatigue, discomfort with deep breaths, and a subjective feeling of fever. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t tried to lose weight. But… my clothes do feel a little looser, now that you mention it. I didn’t think much of it, I thought maybe it was the heat. But yes, probably a little bit of weight loss. It’s not drastic, though. I don't weigh myself very often.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I was very healthy for most of my life. A few years ago… my husband, he passed away, and after that, I had some problems with… sadness, and the doctor gave me some medicine for that. But that was a long time ago. Otherwise, no major illnesses. I did have pneumonia once, many years ago. And I had a surgery on my knee, a long time ago. But nothing else, really. Do you need to know about… allergies? I don’t think I have any.
DOCTOR: Depression treated in the past, history of pneumonia, and knee surgery. No known allergies. Do you smoke, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. My husband, he smoked for a long time, but I never did. I always thought it was very bad for you. I always told him to stop, but... well. It's not something I do, or have ever done.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let’s have a listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. I will try my best. It sometimes feels a little tight in my chest, so please let me know if I need to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. I do hear some… diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, bilaterally. And some… crackles. It's subtle, but it's there. Now, let’s check your oxygen saturation. 96%. That’s acceptable, though not optimal. I also want to take your temperature now, just to confirm your subjective feeling of fever.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. I trust your judgement. I do feel a bit warm, but maybe it is just my imagination. It is a bit stuffy in here, isn't it? Thank you for checking. I am a little nervous, if you don’t mind me saying so. It's just… blood, you see. It always makes me worry.
DOCTOR: 100.2 Fahrenheit. A low-grade fever. And yes, blood is concerning, Ms. Weichers. It warrants investigation. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. These will help us determine the cause of the hemoptysis. I also want to rule out any infectious causes.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. An X-ray and blood work. I am happy to do whatever you think is best. Will the X-ray… hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a small appointment next week with my friend, and I would like to know if I need to reschedule.
DOCTOR: The X-ray is painless, Ms. Weichers. It's just a brief exposure to radiation. And the results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. I will have my nurse contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity. And if the bleeding increases, or you develop shortness of breath, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. No strenuous activity, and go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I will remember that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing we are doing something to find out what is happening. It is… a relief, really. Would it be alright if I asked… what could it be? I know you probably don't want to worry me, but… I always like to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Ms. Weichers, it could be a number of things. Pneumonia, bronchitis… even a less common cause like bronchiectasis. Less likely, but we must consider it, is the possibility of a mass. The X-ray and blood work will give us more information. I don't want to speculate before we have concrete data. Worrying yourself prematurely serves no purpose. My nurse will be in shortly to draw blood and schedule the X-ray. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. A mass. That sounds… frightening. No, Doctor, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… thank you. For everything. I will wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. .
