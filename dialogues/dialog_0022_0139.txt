DOCTOR: Good morning, Yamir. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… need check for referee. For fitness. I want to be sure I’m okay to do this job. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fitness-for-duty exam. That's perfectly reasonable. To get a better understanding of what we need to assess, could you tell me a little more about the job?
PATIENT: It’s… running a lot. Basketball mostly. High school games. Sometimes college. Need to be fast. And strong enough to… not get hurt. It’s… a lot of moving. I don't know how to explain good.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, you're explaining it just great. So, you’re a basketball referee, primarily high school and sometimes college games. That involves a good amount of running, quick stops and starts, and being physically present to avoid collisions. That gives me a good starting point. To start, have you had any injuries recently – anything in the last few months that might affect your ability to perform your duties?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Not really. Maybe… pulled muscle in leg last year? But it’s okay now. Old injury. Nothing now. I think. It doesn't hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pulled muscle in your leg last year that has resolved. Good to know. And just to be thorough, have you had any significant medical problems in the past – things like heart issues, asthma, diabetes, or any surgeries?
PATIENT: No heart problems. No asthma. No… sugar problem. I had… appendix out when I was young. Long time ago. That’s all. I think. Maybe doctor told me something else… but I forget.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s common to forget details. We can try to pull up your records if you’d like, or we can just continue and focus on the present. So, just to confirm, you’ve had your appendix removed, and otherwise you’ve been generally healthy?
PATIENT: Generally healthy, yes. That’s right. Records… maybe okay. But I don't know if they have everything. I moved here… a few years ago. From… different state.
DOCTOR: Okay, we can definitely try to get your records from your previous state. It might take a little time for them to arrive. In the meantime, let's talk about any medications you’re currently taking, or any allergies you have. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. No medicines. Nothing. I eat… everything. Except maybe too much sugar sometimes. But that’s not allergy.
DOCTOR: Good. No allergies or medications. That simplifies things. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer?
PATIENT: My… father had heart problem. Old. He passed away. Mother… she okay. High blood pressure, maybe. Old too. Nothing else I know. I don’t talk to family much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your father and potentially high blood pressure in your mother. Thank you for sharing that. Now, before we do a physical exam, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I… work. I referee. I try to eat healthy. Sometimes I don't. I sleep… okay. Not much exercise except refereeing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so work and refereeing are your primary activities. That gives me a good sense. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No smoking. Maybe… one beer sometimes with friend. But not much. Never… other things. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, very minimal alcohol use. That’s good to know. Alright, let’s move on to the physical exam. I’m going to check your height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. Sounds okay. Let’s get it done. I want to finish soon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. First, let’s check your height and weight. Okay, your height is 174 centimeters, and your weight is 134 pounds. That puts your BMI at… approximately 22.2, which is within the healthy range. Now let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 128/76. That's slightly elevated, but within acceptable limits. Now I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and range of motion in your limbs. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Yes. I can stand.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are normal and symmetric. Range of motion is full in all extremities. No pain with movement. I’m also going to palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Everything feels normal there. One last thing, I’d like to check your pulse in your feet to assess circulation. Pulses are strong and equal bilaterally. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what I’ve seen so far, everything appears to be normal. However, given your father’s history of heart problems, I would recommend an EKG to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: EKG? What is that? Is it… painful? I just want to be sure I’m okay for referee. I don’t want… big problems.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t involve any needles or pain at all. We just attach some small, sticky pads to your chest, arms, and legs. It takes only a few minutes and can give us a lot of information about your heart health. It’s a standard precaution given your family history, and it will give us more confidence in determining whether you’re fit to referee. Would you like me to schedule one for you today?
PATIENT: …Okay. If it’s not painful. And it’s quick. Yes. Schedule it. I want to get this done. Soon.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve scheduled you for an EKG this afternoon at 3:00 PM. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. The results will be sent to me, and I’ll review them as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, based on the physical exam and your history, you seem to be in good general health. However, we need the EKG to rule out any hidden cardiac issues. I would advise you to avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s all. Just want results quick. And… thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. I’ll prioritize reviewing the EKG results as soon as they become available. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have them. You’ll receive a call from the clinic. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness before then, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Thank you for coming in today, Yamir. We’ll get you taken care of. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you. You too. .
