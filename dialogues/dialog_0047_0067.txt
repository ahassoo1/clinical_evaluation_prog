DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It’s been… a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Everything’s a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: A while, you say. Right. And where exactly is this pain, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Oh… um… here. Not… not a sharp pain, more like a… ache. Deep inside. It feels worse when I try to take a big breath, like I said. Sometimes it goes into my back a little. Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: And has anything… specific brought this on?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm… no, not that I recall. I do a lot of… well, I used to do a lot of work. Construction. Building things. Maybe that had something to do with it? Lifting, carrying… It was a long time ago, though. Before my divorce. A long, long time. Honestly, Doctor, things just… fade.
DOCTOR: Right. Construction work. And you said this has been going on for “a while.” Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… Maybe… six months? Or more? It comes and goes, you see. Some days it's barely there, other days… well, like today. I mostly try to ignore it. Old man things, I figure. I don't want to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: "Old man things," you say. Well, Mr. Ruocco, ignoring things doesn’t usually make them go away. And it's my job to find out what's going on. Let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant – heart problems, lung issues, arthritis, anything at all?
PATIENT: Not that I remember. Doctors… I didn't see many. Too busy working, mostly. And then… after the divorce, things got… messy. I don’t really keep track of that sort of thing. Maybe some high blood pressure, a long time ago. But nothing… serious. I don’t think so. I’m sorry, Doctor. I’m not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: Right. And what about family?
PATIENT: Family… My wife… we're divorced now. No children. I had a brother, but he passed away years ago. Heart trouble, I think. He didn't take care of himself. Always smoking… I try to eat okay, mostly rice and vegetables. It's just… getting old is hard. Everything hurts, and nobody seems to care.
DOCTOR: Now, Mr. Ruocco, I need to ask about your smoking history. Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Well… Yes. A long time ago. When I was younger. During the war. Everyone smoked. It helped with the… stress. I quit… oh, must be forty years ago now. Maybe more. I haven't touched a cigarette since. I try not to think about it. It was a bad habit.
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t taken many medications in my life. A little pain reliever now and then, but nothing… regular. I try to tough things out. It’s how I was raised. Maybe I should have taken better care of myself… but it’s too late now, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Please take a few deep breaths when I ask.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Deep breaths… I can do that. Hopefully, it won't hurt too much. Just tell me what to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your breath sounds are a little diminished, particularly on the lower right side. I also detect a slightly irregular rhythm. Now, I’m going to feel your chest to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. A little crepitus here, which could indicate some fluid buildup. I also want to check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen levels are a little low, at 92%. We need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: Low oxygen? That doesn't sound good… Fluid? I don’t understand. What does this mean, Doctor? Am I… sick? I just want this pain to go away. Is it my heart? Oh dear… I don’t want to end up like my brother. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, please remain calm. I'm not going to jump to any conclusions. However, the diminished breath sounds, irregularity, low oxygen and crepitus do require further investigation. We need to rule out some serious possibilities, including pneumonia, fluid around the lungs, or a heart condition. To do this, I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. A blood test would also be helpful to look for signs of infection. I will also want to check your blood pressure and repeat the oxygen saturation test. Do you understand?
