DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you are with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Yes, well... I suppose I’ve just been feeling… not quite myself lately. I’m hoping you can help me get back on track. I’m looking for a… a fresh start, really. A bit of a “jumpstart,” if you will.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling "not quite yourself" is certainly a good reason to seek medical attention. A "jumpstart" sounds like a positive goal. To help me understand what's been going on, could you elaborate on what specifically you mean by not feeling like yourself?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to put into words. It’s not one big thing, you see. Just… a general lack of energy, mostly. And I haven't been sleeping well. I wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. And, honestly, Doctor, my memory hasn’t been the best lately. Small things, mostly. Forgetting where I put my keys, or… what I was just saying. It's a little worrying. I just want to feel… sharper, you know? More like me again.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Pitzel. It sounds quite frustrating to experience a combination of fatigue, sleep disturbance, and memory concerns. It’s good you’re addressing it now. So, to clarify, this has been a gradual onset, not a sudden change?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Very gradual. It didn't happen overnight, thankfully. It's been… over the last six months, I would say. Maybe longer. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started, because it was so slow. It just kind of… crept up on me. I thought it was just… getting older, at first. But it’s starting to affect things, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: That’s a very astute observation, Ms. Pitzel. It's wise to investigate changes, even gradual ones. Six months is a reasonable timeframe to consider. Now, regarding the fatigue – would you describe it as being constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. It's definitely worse in the afternoons. Mornings are usually… manageable. But by mid-afternoon, I just feel… drained. Like I’ve used up all my energy. And it’s not just physical, you understand? It's mental fatigue, too. It’s hard to concentrate, even on things I enjoy. It's like… a fog. And then it lifts a little bit in the evenings, but I'm too tired to do much about it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Pitzel. A pattern of worsening fatigue throughout the day, coupled with mental fog, is helpful information. Now, let’s move on to your sleep. Could you describe a typical night for you?
PATIENT: Well, I usually try to go to bed around ten, maybe ten-thirty. But it takes me a long time to fall asleep. I toss and turn a lot. And then, even when I do fall asleep, I wake up several times during the night. Not necessarily fully awake, but… aware. And then, like I said, I don’t feel rested when I wake up. I just feel… old. I’ve tried a few things, you know? Warm milk, reading… but nothing seems to really help. My husband says I sometimes talk in my sleep, too. Though I don't remember any of it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Pitzel. Difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep, along with your husband’s observation about talking in your sleep – that provides a more complete picture. Before we continue, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I have been a little more irritable lately, I suppose. Not snapping at people, exactly, but… less patient. And I’ve had a few headaches. Nothing severe, just… nagging headaches, mostly in the temples. And… now that you mention it, my appetite hasn't been great. I'm not losing weight, but I just don't feel hungry very often. It’s probably nothing, really. Just… a few little things. I don’t want to bore you with all of this.
DOCTOR: Please, Ms. Pitzel, don’t hesitate to share anything that comes to mind. These “little things,” as you call them, can be very important. Irritability, headaches, and decreased appetite – those are all useful pieces of the puzzle. Now, let’s briefly review your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been well-controlled with medication for several years now. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. My husband, Luis, he worries more about my health than I do! He’ll be relieved to hear I’m finally getting this checked out.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Pitzel. Controlled hypertension and a remote gallbladder removal – thank you for sharing that information. And it’s wonderful you have a supportive husband. Now, are you currently taking any medications other than the ones for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes. Just the Lisinopril for the blood pressure, twenty milligrams daily. And… I take a Vitamin D supplement, because my levels were a little low during my last check-up. It's just over-the-counter, nothing special. Oh! And occasionally, I'll take an ibuprofen for a headache, but not very often. That's it, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Pitzel. Lisinopril 20mg daily, Vitamin D supplement, and occasional ibuprofen – very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had any allergic reactions to anything. Luis always jokes that I could eat anything. Though I don’t, of course! I try to eat a healthy diet. He’s the one with the sensitive stomach, not me. We went to Colombia last year, and he had to be so careful about what he ate. I, on the other hand, enjoyed everything!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Pitzel. No known allergies. Now, briefly, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well… my mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my father had heart problems later in life. He had a stroke, I think, when he was in his seventies. And my older brother has high cholesterol. That’s about it, really. Nothing major, on Luis’s side of the family. His mother lived to be ninety-five, so I think we’re in pretty good shape, genetically speaking.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Pitzel. Family history of diabetes, heart disease, and hypercholesterolemia. And finally, could you briefly describe your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well… I’m retired now, so I don't have a stressful job anymore, thankfully. I enjoy gardening, mostly. And I like to read. I try to stay active, but it's been harder lately with the fatigue. I walk a little bit most days, when I have the energy. And Luis and I enjoy cooking together. We eat mostly healthy foods, like I said. We don't smoke, and we only drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Nothing too exciting!
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Ms. Pitzel. That gives me a very good understanding of your situation. Based on what you’ve told me, the fatigue, sleep disturbance, memory concerns, and other symptoms you've described could be due to a number of factors. It could be related to stress, even though you're retired, or a vitamin deficiency, despite the supplement. It could also be something more systemic. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, Vitamin D levels, B12 levels, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We’ll also test for inflammation and rule out any underlying infections. I’d also like to get an EKG just to be cautious given your family history. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on and get back to feeling like myself again. An EKG is fine. Blood tests, too. I trust your judgment. Just let me know when and where, and I’ll be there.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad to hear that. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they will schedule you for the blood draw and EKG. I recommend fasting for 12 hours before the blood tests to ensure accurate results. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms and let me know if anything changes significantly. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Fasting for twelve hours, I can do that. And I’ll be sure to let you know if anything changes. Thank you again for your help.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. It was my pleasure. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
