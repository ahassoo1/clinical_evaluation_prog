DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Schaust. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it's… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they’re starting to droop. It’s been happening gradually, over the last few months, I think. It’s just… worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schaust. Feeling weaker and noticing changes like drooping eyelids can certainly be unsettling. It's good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's… it’s not like I can’t do things, but it takes more effort. Especially towards the end of the day. Like, carrying groceries is harder than it used to be. And climbing stairs… I find myself needing to rest halfway up sometimes. It started with just feeling tired easily, but now it’s… more noticeable. It's mostly in my arms and legs, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, the weakness is progressive, primarily affects your arms and legs, and is exacerbated by exertion, particularly later in the day. And you’ve noticed it’s been worsening over months. To get a more complete picture, could you describe any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven’t really noticed anything else, specifically. Though, I suppose I have been a bit more clumsy lately. Dropping things, bumping into furniture… things like that. I just thought I was being distracted, to be honest. And… now that I think about it, my vision has been a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, so I assumed it was just a need for a stronger prescription. It's probably not related.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased clumsiness and blurry vision. Even though you wear glasses, it’s good you mentioned the vision changes; we’ll want to consider that. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, measles, chickenpox, things like that. But nothing… serious. I haven’t been hospitalized, and I don’t take any regular medications. I had my tonsils removed when I was a teenager, but that was… a long time ago. I've generally been quite healthy, honestly. That's why this is all so concerning.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No significant past medical history. And you've had your tonsils removed, but otherwise, generally healthy. Have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had… arthritis, I think, in her hands. It was quite painful for her towards the end. And my grandfather… on my father’s side… he had something with his nerves, I believe. It made him unsteady on his feet. But beyond that… not that I’m aware of. It wasn't something talked about much, to be honest. My family isn't one for… sharing health information.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of arthritis in your mother and a possible nerve condition in your grandfather. Knowing these details is helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a facilities manager, so I’m on my feet a lot, going between different buildings. It’s not heavy work, mostly checking things, making sure everything is running smoothly. I live alone, since my divorce a couple of years ago. I try to eat reasonably well, though I admit I sometimes rely on convenience foods when I'm busy. I don't smoke, and I only drink alcohol socially… perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I don't really have much time for hobbies these days, to be honest. It's mostly work, and then… relaxing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schaust. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can eat pretty much anything. And I've never had any issues with insect bites or anything like that either. I’m quite fortunate, in that regard. I don't think I've ever needed an EpiPen or anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Schaust. To get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms, I’d like to perform a physical examination. This will involve checking your reflexes, muscle strength, coordination, and vision. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your expertise. Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I’m a little nervous, but… I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, we’ll move on to a neurological exam, looking at your reflexes, strength, and coordination. After that, I’ll examine your eyes. Your vital signs are within the normal range. Now, if you don’t mind, please sit here on the examination table. I’m going to test your reflexes. Could you relax your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Relaxed. Arms and legs… just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now the other side. Your patellar reflexes are… diminished bilaterally. That means they're weaker than expected. Now, I’m going to test your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. Is that alright? It feels… a little weaker than usual, but I’m not sure if that’s just me being anxious.
DOCTOR: That’s good strength, but I agree, perhaps not maximal. Now, I’m going to ask you to resist as I try to push your arms up and down. Please try to push back with the same force. Your strength is… reduced in both arms and legs, as we suspected. Now, let's take a look at your eyes. Could you follow my finger as I move it in an “H” pattern?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I’m following it… yes. It’s a little… shaky, perhaps, and a bit blurry when it moves quickly. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Your pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. However, I did notice some nystagmus, which is that involuntary shaking of your eyes, and some difficulty tracking smoothly. Okay, Mr. Schaust. That completes the physical examination. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam – the progressive weakness, drooping eyelids, diminished reflexes, reduced strength, and nystagmus – I’m concerned about a few possibilities. The most concerning is a potential neuromuscular disorder, possibly myasthenia gravis or a similar condition. However, other possibilities, such as a vitamin deficiency or certain infections, need to be ruled out as well.
PATIENT: Myasthenia… gravis? That sounds… serious. What does that even mean, exactly? And what kind of tests would need to be done to figure out what’s going on? I’m a little scared, to be honest. I just want to know what I’m dealing with.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schaust. It is a serious condition, but it's also manageable with treatment. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles, causing weakness and fatigue. It doesn't mean you're physically deteriorating, it means your immune system is mistakenly attacking the connections between your nerves and muscles. To get a definitive diagnosis, we'll need to run some tests. First, I'd like to order a blood test to check for specific antibodies associated with myasthenia gravis. We’ll also do a test called an electromyography, or EMG, which measures the electrical activity of your muscles. That helps us see how well your nerves are communicating with your muscles. Depending on the results of those tests, we may also consider a more specialized test called a single-fiber EMG. Finally, we will do some basic bloodwork to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. It sounds like a lot, but I want to get to the bottom of this. The blood tests and the… EMG… I'll do whatever you think is necessary. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I need to see a specialist if it is myasthenia gravis? I'm not even sure I know what that means. Is it treatable? I apologize for all the questions, but… I'm a bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: You’re not overwhelming me at all, Mr. Schaust. These are all very important questions, and it’s good you’re asking them. The blood tests should take about 3-5 business days to come back. The EMG will require a separate appointment, and the results typically take another 2-3 days. If the tests confirm a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, you will need to see a neurologist, a specialist in disorders of the nervous system. They are best equipped to manage the condition long-term. The good news is that myasthenia gravis is treatable. There are several medications available that can help improve muscle strength and reduce fatigue. In some cases, surgery to remove the thymus gland may also be considered. With proper treatment, many people with myasthenia gravis can live full and active lives. I’m going to order those tests for you now. The lab results will be sent directly to me, and I will contact you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – such as difficulty breathing or swallowing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Sudden worsening… emergency room. I’ve got that. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. And thank you for being so patient with my questions. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect. So… just wait for the lab results, and I’ll hear from you. Is there anything I should do or avoid in the meantime? Any exercises I shouldn’t be doing?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous exercise or activities that significantly worsen your fatigue. It’s okay to stay active, but listen to your body and don’t push yourself too hard. It’s also a good idea to get plenty of rest. Avoid getting overly stressed, as that can exacerbate your symptoms. Also, avoid any new medications without consulting me or a specialist. I’m going to write a detailed summary of our conversation and the plan for testing and a referral to a neurologist for you to take with you. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, and for writing everything down for me. It’s a huge relief to have a plan in place. I’ll just… wait for the results, and try to take it easy. Thank you again, Doctor Shely. I feel much better knowing I’m being taken care of.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
