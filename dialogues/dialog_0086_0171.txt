DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: My nails. They… look funny. Not good funny. Just… funny. I don’t even know why I’m here, really. Just… they changed. It’s been a while, I think. A long while.
DOCTOR: “Changed” how, exactly?
PATIENT: Well… they’re not… shiny anymore. And kinda… thick? Like, not the good thick, you know? Like… old lady thick. I used to get them done, pretty colors… but I haven’t been in ages. Honestly, I just noticed they don’t look right. I don’t know what else to tell you. It’s just… a nail problem. Is that even a doctor thing?
DOCTOR: Well, changes in nail appearance can be indicative of underlying issues, though it’s often not serious. Medicare does cover a lot, so it’s good you came in. Let’s have a look. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with your nails?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. Maybe a little… when I try to open these jars sometimes. But I have trouble with jars anyway. Old age, you know? No, the nails don’t hurt. Just… ugly. And different. Is that a medical thing? Being ugly?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Thut, we’re not here to discuss aesthetics. We’re trying to determine why your nails have changed. Have you noticed any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm… I don’t know… maybe a little red sometimes? Around the edges? But I wash my hands a lot! You gotta, you know, with all the germs. And sometimes they crack, the skin, but I put lotion on. The good kind. I don’t think it’s anything… important. Is it? You make it sound like it is.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let me just take a quick look at your hands myself. It’s just a standard examination. If you could just sit there for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. I hope you have clean hands. Some doctors don’t. It’s really awful. Not sanitary at all. Go ahead. But don’t take too long. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your nails do appear thickened and slightly discolored – a yellowish hue. The skin around them is a little dry and inflamed, consistent with some irritation. It looks like you might have some onychomycosis, a fungal infection of the nail. It’s fairly common, especially with age and certain health conditions. Do you have any history of athlete’s foot or other fungal infections?
PATIENT: Fungal? Like… in my feet? Oh, goodness no. I always wear shoes, even in the house. Can’t be too careful. My mother always said… never go barefoot. Catch something awful, she said. But… I think my grandson had something on his feet once. Red and itchy, I remember. I don't know if it was the same thing though. He’s always getting into trouble, that boy. So… this is serious? Is it catching?
DOCTOR: It’s not an emergency, Ms. Thut, but it is something we should address. Fungal infections aren’t typically serious, but they can be persistent and uncomfortable. It's not highly contagious, but it's best to avoid sharing nail clippers or other personal items. We'll need to confirm the diagnosis with a lab test - a small sample of the nail will be sent off. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of, like diabetes or a weakened immune system?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, my blood pressure is a little high sometimes. The doctor gave me a pill for it. Little pink one. And my knees ache, especially in the winter. But that’s just old age, I reckon. Immune… what now? I try to eat healthy. Lots of fruit. And I take vitamins. The good kind. I don’t know about… immune. Is that a problem? I don't go around getting sick all the time. Much.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure is good to know. We'll want to keep that under control. It can affect circulation, and that can contribute to fungal infections. As for your immune system… it’s just something we ask about because a weakened immune system can make you more susceptible to infections. We’ll do some blood work to get a better overall picture of your health. I’m going to have the nurse come in and draw some blood. Then we’ll send the nail sample to the lab. It should take about a week to get the results.
PATIENT: A week? That’s a long time. I have things to do. What if it’s something awful? Will I have to… lose my nails? My grandson likes painting them sometimes. It’s nice. Oh dear. This is all very upsetting. I don’t like hospitals. Or doctors. Or… tests. It all feels very… serious. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, please try to remain calm. It’s highly unlikely you’ll have to lose your nails. The vast majority of fungal infections are treatable with topical medication, or sometimes an oral antifungal. It's important to know what we're dealing with before we start treatment. I understand you're anxious, but delaying the diagnosis won’t help. The nurse will be in shortly. Just try to relax, alright?
