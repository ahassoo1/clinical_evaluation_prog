DOCTOR: Alright, Kahrin, so tell me. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Just the results, please. I got the email saying they were ready, and I wanted to hear what they say. I don't really…do well waiting around for things like this.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I understand wanting to get things sorted. However, simply telling you the results without any context isn’t particularly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: Look, with all due respect, I’ve got a pretty tight schedule today. Can we just…skip to the important bits? I remember everything the nurse told me when I had the tests done, so I don’t need a rehash of how they did them. Just the outcome. Good or bad, whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Right. Very well. Let's be concise. Your blood work showed slightly elevated cholesterol. Not alarmingly so, but enough that we should address it. And your vitamin D levels are…low. Quite low, actually. It's not unexpected, given your…location, but still requires attention. Everything else appears within normal ranges. Do you understand those terms – cholesterol and vitamin D?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. Cholesterol is…like, the fat in your blood? And vitamin D is from the sun, right? I’m usually pretty good about sunscreen, so I figured the vitamin D might be low. Is it…serious? Like, do I need medication?
DOCTOR: "Serious" is a strong word. It's not immediately life-threatening, no. However, chronically low vitamin D can contribute to fatigue, bone weakness...a whole host of unpleasantness. And elevated cholesterol, while currently manageable, is a precursor to more significant problems if left unchecked. As for medication, let's not jump to that right away. I prefer a more...holistic approach. We can start with a high-dose vitamin D supplement. And frankly, while sunscreen is important, you may need to be more…strategic with your sun exposure. Brief periods, midday, without sunscreen, can help. Do you spend much time outdoors?
PATIENT: Not as much as I'd like. I work mostly indoors, logistics, you know? Lots of phone calls and spreadsheets. It’s a pretty standard office job, so… not a lot of sunshine. I can try to get out more during lunch, I guess. What kind of supplement are we talking about? And how long do I need to take it for?
DOCTOR: Right. Logistics. Not ideal, as I suspected. We'll start with 5000 IU of vitamin D3 daily for three months, then retest. We’ll see where your levels are then. It's an over-the-counter supplement; I can write you a prescription if you prefer for insurance purposes, though it may not be covered given your…situation. As for the cholesterol, we’ll start with dietary changes. Reduce saturated fats – red meat, processed foods, full-fat dairy. Increase your fiber intake. Lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains. Simple enough, really. Are you a…fussy eater?
PATIENT: No, I'm not fussy. I actually like cooking. I just… don’t always have the time to do it a lot. Take-out is pretty convenient. But I can definitely try to eat better. Red meat isn't my favorite, so that’s easy. And I like salads. Okay, so vitamin D supplement and more salads. Got it. Do I need to worry about anything else? Like, any side effects from the vitamin D?
DOCTOR: Convenience is the enemy of health, you know. As for side effects, very high doses of vitamin D can cause nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness. However, 5000 IU is a standard dose and those side effects are rare. Just be sure to drink plenty of water. More importantly, it's crucial to be consistent. Don't start and then forget about it after a week. And, if you experience any unusual symptoms – abdominal pain, persistent fatigue – stop taking the supplement and contact the office. Do you think you can commit to this, Kahrin?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Honestly, I just want to feel better. I've been tired a lot lately, and I figured it was worth checking out. Salads and a pill, I can manage that. Can I get a written summary of everything we discussed? Just so I don't forget anything? I’m good with remembering things, but a reminder wouldn't hurt.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll print out a care summary for you. It will include the dosage of the vitamin D, dietary recommendations, and a list of potential side effects. It also includes my contact information should you have any questions. Now, do you have any other concerns today?
PATIENT: No, that's it. Just the results and the plan. Thank you. I appreciate you not making me wait through a whole lecture about everything. I can get going now, if that's okay? I have a delivery schedule to manage.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to recheck your vitamin D levels. And try to prioritize your health, Kahrin. It's a rather…expensive commodity to neglect. Good day. .
PATIENT: .
