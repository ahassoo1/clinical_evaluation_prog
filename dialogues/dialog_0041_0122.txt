DOCTOR: Hi Venus, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Please, call me Venus. I… well, I am here because of my memory. It is becoming… troublesome. I find I forget things. Small things, mostly, but… concerning. I am Alvara, Venus Alvara. I am 53 years of age, and recently, my blood pressure has been… high.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. Troubles with your memory, and some high blood pressure readings. Right. Just to clarify, when did you start noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a difficult question. Not a sudden thing, you understand. More… gradual. Perhaps six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It is hard to pinpoint. I remember… very well details from many years ago, but yesterday’s grocery list… that is another story. It feels… frustrating, yes. Like a film, but… pieces missing.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over about six months. And you said it’s mostly small things – like grocery lists?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Grocery lists, where I placed my keys, names of acquaintances… not important people, thankfully, but still… unsettling. I do not forget who people are, just… the precise name sometimes. And… I repeat myself, I think. Ask the same questions again. My housekeeper, she points it out. It is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Repetition, difficulty recalling names… and the feeling like you’re forgetting things. I understand that can be worrying, and even embarrassing. Just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any changes in your mood, sleep, or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Those… yes. My sleep is… not so good. I wake often, and then I am thinking. Worrying, mostly. About… everything, really. My husband, he passed three years ago. And now this… my memory. My appetite, it fluctuates. Some days, I eat very little. Others… normal. I am… a little sad, yes. But I do not think it is a deep sadness. More… a worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, some sleep disturbance, changes in appetite, and increased worry. And I'm sorry to hear about your husband. That must be very difficult. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure, Doctor. High blood pressure. The doctor told me… a few years ago. I take… pills for it. A small, white pill. I do not remember the name, unfortunately. And… nothing else. No surgeries, no… serious illnesses. I used to be very healthy. Very active. Now… less so. I prefer to stay at home. It is… safer. I do not want to fall, for example. That would be… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the high blood pressure, managed with medication – a small, white pill, you said. And you've been generally healthy in the past. Do you know if you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I have… eaten many things in my life. And never a problem. Fruits, vegetables, meats… everything. And I have never reacted to any medicine. The doctor gave me… many pills, over the years. And always, I was fine. I believe I would know if I had an allergy. I am… very aware of my body. Or, I was. Before this… memory.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No known allergies. Let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of memory problems or dementia in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a good question. My mother… she forgot things toward the end. But she was very old. Very, very old. And my father… he was always a little… absent-minded. But not so serious. Just… misplacing things. I do not believe anyone in my family had… serious memory problems. No, not like this. It is… worrying, that it may be different with me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to confirm, you said your husband passed away three years ago?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Three years ago, in May. A very… sad time. He was a good man. A strong man. He… liked to garden. And read. He always read. I miss him very much. Perhaps… the stress of his passing has affected my memory. It is possible, yes? I worry… constantly. And worry, I believe, can cause many things.
DOCTOR: It absolutely can, Venus. Stress and grief can definitely contribute to memory issues. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything else that might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. I trust your judgement. If you think it is necessary, I will cooperate fully. I just… wish to know what is happening. And to stop this… forgetting. It is very unsettling. Please, begin whenever you are ready.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll start with your blood pressure, just to see where it’s at today. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam – just checking your reflexes and balance. It won’t take long. Okay, blood pressure is 155/90. A little elevated. And pulse is 78, regular. Do you experience any dizziness or headaches when your blood pressure is high?
PATIENT: Sometimes, Doctor. A slight dizziness. Not frequent, but… present. And… a dull headache, occasionally. Behind the eyes, mostly. I usually take a small rest, and it passes. I thought it was… just age. Or stress. Now… I am not so sure. It is good you are checking, Doctor. I am… grateful.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, breathing normally. Alright, now I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. I used to be very good at… focusing. I am following… now? Is that correct? I hope I am not… making this difficult. I sometimes… lose track.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Venus. You’re doing great. Just follow it slowly. Alright, now I’m going to test your reflexes. This might be a little surprising. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. A little diminished, but could be normal variation. Now, can you stand up and walk for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is this… alright? I am a little unsteady, perhaps. I do not like to fall. It is… frightening.
DOCTOR: You’re doing fine, Venus. Just walk normally. Alright, you can sit back down. That’s all for the quick exam. Everything seems within normal limits, but we should do some further testing to determine the cause of your memory issues. There are a lot of possibilities, from stress and medication side effects to early signs of cognitive decline. Would you be willing to get some blood work and possibly a brain scan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Whatever is necessary. I just want to… understand. And to stop this forgetting. Blood work, a scan… whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. It is… unsettling, not knowing. So, please, tell me what you recommend. And I will cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We’ll start with blood work to rule out any vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or other underlying medical conditions that could be affecting your memory. Then, I’d like to order an MRI of your brain just to get a clearer picture and rule out any structural issues. The MRI is non-invasive, but it does take a little while. We can discuss the results when they come back, and then we'll decide on a course of action. It could be as simple as adjusting your medication, reducing stress, or doing some cognitive exercises. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at the moment. You have explained everything very clearly. Blood work, MRI… I understand. And… I trust your plan. Perhaps… you could tell me a little about these “cognitive exercises”? Are they… difficult? I do not want to… feel foolish. I just want to… regain my memory. Is that possible, Doctor? Is there… hope?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Venus. Cognitive exercises are like mental workouts – puzzles, memory games, things like that. They’re designed to stimulate your brain and help improve your cognitive function. They’re not difficult at all, and they’re definitely not meant to make you feel foolish. We can start with some simple ones and gradually increase the difficulty as you progress. There are even some apps and websites that can help. And yes, there is hope. Even if we can’t fully restore your memory, we can often slow down the progression of memory loss and help you cope with the challenges it presents. It's important to remember that everyone's situation is different, and we'll tailor a plan specifically to your needs. I’ll have my nurse schedule you for the blood work and MRI. She’ll also give you some information about cognitive exercises. Do you have any other concerns right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… very reassuring. Cognitive exercises… I will try them. And I trust your guidance. Thank you. It is… difficult, feeling like your mind is… slipping away. But I am grateful for your help. Truly. I believe… I have nothing further to ask at this moment. I will await the nurse.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venus. It's my job to help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns that come up before your appointment. I’ll let the nurse know you're ready. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
