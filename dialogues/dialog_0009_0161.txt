DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Helaina. Honestly? It’s… a little embarrassing to talk about, but my daughter, Laila, she told me I should come in and ask about something to help prevent… well, you know. Getting sick. She said there’s a pill I can take, even though I’m… my age. I don't really understand all the details, but she was very insistent. She's a good girl, always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Helaina. It’s never embarrassing to discuss your health with your doctor, and it’s wonderful that Laila is so proactive about your well-being. It sounds like you’re referring to preventative medications for illnesses common as we get older. We have several options, and it’s great you’re thinking ahead. To help me understand what would be best for you, could you tell me a little more about what specifically you’re concerned about preventing?
PATIENT: Well… Laila said it was about… protection. Not just getting sick with a cold or the flu, but something… more serious. She mentioned something about… sexually transmitted infections, even though I haven’t… well, it’s been a long time since I’ve been with anyone. But she said it's good to be prepared, just in case. And I know there's that thing going around… HIV, I think she called it? She said this pill could prevent that too. Honestly, I'm a bit confused. I mostly want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to stay healthy for my grandkids. I just want to be around for them.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Helaina. It's very responsible of you to consider all of this, and Laila sounds like a very caring daughter. It sounds like you’re asking about pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. It's a medication taken to prevent HIV infection, and it can also offer some protection against other sexually transmitted infections, although it's not a complete shield. It’s excellent you’re thinking about this, and it’s never too late to prioritize your health. Before we discuss whether PrEP is right for you, I’d like to get a more complete picture of your medical history and lifestyle. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Ask away. I don’t mind. I’ll tell you anything I can. I just… I’ve never really had to talk about this sort of thing with a doctor before. It feels a little strange, but if it helps, then go ahead. I’m a pretty open book.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Helaina. Many people haven’t needed to discuss this before, and it’s completely normal to feel a little uncomfortable at first. I appreciate your openness. Let’s start with your general health. Do you have any current medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. The doctor told me a few years back my cholesterol was a little high, so I try to eat healthier. Mostly salads, you know? And I walk a lot. But other than that, I’m pretty good. No diabetes, no heart problems. I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it’s not too bad. Just aches a bit when it rains. And… oh! I wear glasses, as you can see. That's about it, I think. I get my check-ups yearly, though. Last one was in February, and everything was fine.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Helaina. It sounds like you're very proactive about your health, which is wonderful. Managing your cholesterol and staying active is excellent. And thank you for letting me know about the arthritis – that’s good information to have. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let's see... when I was a little girl, maybe seven years old, I had my tonsils taken out. That was a long time ago, of course. And… oh! When I broke my wrist when I was in university. I was very clumsy. Other than that, no. No major surgeries, no hospital stays. Nothing like that. Just the usual colds and flus over the years. Nothing serious enough to require a hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful, Helaina. Tonsillectomy as a child and a broken wrist – good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a tough one. My family is… large. And scattered all over. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my aunt, on my father’s side, she had… something with her heart, I believe. But honestly, I don’t know a lot of the details. We weren't very close, and nobody really talked about health problems much when I was growing up. It was considered… private, you know? So, I'm not much help there, I'm afraid. I know there was some cancer on my grandmother's side, but I don't know what kind. I wish I knew more, but it's hard to say. It’s a very big family.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Helaina. Family medical history can be difficult to track, and it’s common not to have all the details. It sounds like there's a possibility of some heart issues and cancer in the family, which is good to be aware of. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked, and it was awful. I promised myself I'd never start, and I haven't. I don't drink alcohol either. It doesn't agree with me. And I certainly don't use any drugs. Never have. I’m a very plain woman, Doctor. I mostly drink tea and read books. I try to live a healthy life, as much as I can. I've never been one for parties or… that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Helaina. It sounds like you have very healthy habits. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve had a few shots over the years, of course, and never had a reaction. I used to get hay fever when I was a child, but I grew out of it. And sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I use certain soaps, but it’s not a serious allergy. Nothing major, I can assure you. I don't carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I'm a pretty straightforward case, Doctor. No allergies to worry about, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, Helaina, thank you for sharing all of that with me. That gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, you mentioned you were concerned about protection against sexually transmitted infections, even though you haven't been sexually active recently. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, well… it's embarrassing, but my daughter, Laila, she's very modern, you know? She said it’s important to be prepared for anything. She said even if it’s been a long time, it’s good to know what my options are. And she was very worried about HIV, with everything going around. And… honestly? I’ve been seeing a gentleman lately. He's a very nice man. We’ve been… spending time together. It hasn’t been… physical yet, but it could happen. And Laila insisted I get checked and talk about protection. She's a good girl, very responsible. I just want to be safe, for both of us. I don’t want to risk anything. It's been a long time, and I don't want to worry either one of us. It feels a little silly, at my age, but she convinced me it was important.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Helaina. It’s very responsible of you to consider all of this, and Laila sounds like a very thoughtful daughter. It’s wonderful that she’s encouraging you to prioritize your health, and it's always good to be prepared, no matter your age. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, before we discuss options like PrEP, I’d like to do a brief physical exam and run some blood tests just to get a baseline of your health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A physical exam and blood tests… alright. Let's get it done. I just want to make sure everything is okay. And to be safe, for both of us. Lead the way. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your vital signs – I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick examination of your general health. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but within an acceptable range. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Overall, your general physical condition appears good. Now, I’d like to draw some blood for a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and some tests to screen for sexually transmitted infections. We’ll also check your HIV status. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. Honestly, the more tests, the better, as far as I’m concerned. I just want to know everything is okay. And I appreciate you being so thorough. It puts my mind at ease, knowing you’re checking everything. I trust you completely. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. This will just take a few minutes. Okay, all done. Keep pressure on this site for a few minutes to prevent bruising. The lab results typically take 3-5 business days. Once I have those results, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action for you. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’m just… relieved to have finally talked to someone about this. And grateful for your kindness and patience. It’s a bit overwhelming, but I feel much better now. Three to five business days… alright. I'll wait for the results. Thank you. Truly, thank you. And… perhaps I’ll see you then? .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Helaina. It was my pleasure to meet you and discuss your health concerns. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you then. Have a wonderful day! .
