DOCTOR: Right. Melvenia Tippens, 76. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Memmolo. It’s these forms. I need them notarized, I guess? They're for… well, just to verify some health stuff. It's a bit of a hassle, honestly.
DOCTOR: Notarizing forms isn’t exactly what I do here, but… alright. What "health stuff" are these forms related to?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… it’s for a program, a senior assistance program. They need proof of… well, everything, it seems. Blood pressure, allergies… just general health information, to make sure I qualify. It’s a lot, and my eyesight isn't what it used to be, so I figured having a doctor sign off on it would be easier than trying to get everything myself. Do you need a list of what they want? I have it somewhere…
DOCTOR: A list would be…helpful. Honestly, this is a lot of administrative work for…nevermind. Yes, a list, please. And perhaps you could briefly tell me why they need all this information?
PATIENT: Here we are! Honestly, I think it’s just to be sure I’m healthy enough for some of the activities they offer. You know, day trips, exercise classes... things like that. They probably want to make sure I won’t, well, collapse on one of the trips, I suppose. It’s a good thing, really. But it's still a mountain of paperwork. I don't understand why they can't just ask me a few questions.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Blood pressure, allergies, current medications…standard things, really. Do you know your blood pressure, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, I used to! My daughter, she has one of those machines...she checked it last time she visited, maybe… six months ago? It was… normal, she said. Around 120 over… something. I’m terrible with numbers, honestly. Is that good? I don’t really remember the second number. It was definitely under 140, I think. She would have told me if it was bad, wouldn't she?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is…vague. And your daughter isn’t a medical professional. We’ll check it now, just to be certain. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, or any other heart conditions?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty healthy, really. Just a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that's about it. My doctor back home – well, he retired a few years back – always said I had a strong heart. He always commented on it! I don’t understand why they need to be so thorough if I’ve always been alright. Can we just get this signed, please? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let’s just get this over with. Roll up your sleeve. And while I’m checking your blood pressure, tell me, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had a bit of a rash once, years ago, after taking some pink pill, but I don’t remember what it was for. It wasn’t anything serious, just itchy. My mother always said I had sensitive skin. I don't take much medicine these days, just a little something for the arthritis when it flares up. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get this over with. 152 over 88. Not ideal. You said you have no allergies?
PATIENT: 152? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? No, I’m sure I don’t. Like I said, just the rash years ago, but I don’t even remember what caused it. Maybe it was the soap? Or the laundry detergent? I really don't keep track of these things. Is that… bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s…elevated. And “not keeping track” isn’t very helpful, Mrs. Tippens. Are you currently taking any medication for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Just this. A friend gave it to me, she said it really helped her. I don’t know what’s in it, exactly. It's… herbal, I think? There’s no label, you see. I just take one a day when my knees are bothering me. Is that alright? I didn't think it was a big deal…
DOCTOR: “Herbal” and “no label”?
PATIENT: Well, she said it was all natural. From the mountains, she said! It smelled nice, like peppermint and… something else. I thought it would be alright. She's a very trustworthy woman! I just wanted to feel better… My knees ache so much sometimes. I don't understand what I did wrong… Is it going to be okay?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Tippens, taking unlabeled supplements is…not advisable. It could interact with other medications, or cause unforeseen complications. We need to figure out exactly what you’re taking. And frankly, your blood pressure is concerning enough without adding unknown substances to the mix. I'm going to need to refer you to a specialist for further evaluation. I can give you a list of doctors in the area. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don't. Not anymore. It ran out a few years back… I’ve been avoiding going to the doctor because of the cost. I didn’t think a little knee pain was worth… all this. Can’t you just sign the forms? It’s just for a senior program… They’ll help me get some exercise classes and things. I really need those…
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Tippens. I can technically sign the forms, but I have to document that you’re refusing recommended medical care and are presenting with uncontrolled hypertension. And honestly, taking a mystery supplement isn’t helping things. I strongly advise against participating in any strenuous activities until we get your blood pressure under control. Here’s a list of free clinics in the area. Take it. I've documented everything. That’s all I can do for you today. Next! .
