DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s about getting some shots. A friend of mine is hoping to get a visa, and I believe they need to get some vaccinations first. I'm trying to help them figure out what's needed, and honestly, it’s a bit confusing. I thought maybe you could tell me what’s required these days?
DOCTOR: Right, vaccinations for visa purposes. Not exactly my area of expertise, to be frank. It depends entirely on where your friend is travelling from and to, and what their specific immigration status is. It’s not a one-size-fits-all situation. Are you aware of their destination country?
PATIENT: No, I’m afraid I don’t have all the details yet. They’re still working things out, to be honest. I believe it might be… Canada? But they were also talking about Mexico, and maybe even further south. It’s all a little up in the air. Is there a general place I could start looking for information? Perhaps a website or an office I could contact? I’m not very good with computers, so something simple would be best.
DOCTOR: Well, this makes things… difficult. Honestly, trying to give advice without knowing the destination is irresponsible. There are different requirements for each country, and even different regions within countries. Look, the best thing to do is have your friend contact the embassy or consulate of the country they plan to visit. They will have the most accurate and up-to-date information. It’s a bit of legwork, I know, but it’s the only way to get it right. Do you have any other health concerns you want to discuss today, Mr. Skarbek?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. That's my main concern for now. I just wanted to be sure I was pointing my friend in the right direction. The embassy or consulate… yes, that makes sense. I'll have to ask them to look into that. Thank you for your time and for not laughing at me for being so confused. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: It’s… common. People often overestimate what I can do. Honestly, I’m an internal medicine doctor, not a travel agent. If you or your friend develop any symptoms – fever, rash, anything unusual – don’t hesitate to come back and see me. Otherwise, I think we're all set here. Have a good day, Mr. Skarbek.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will. Thank you again. Have a good day to you as well.
DOCTOR: You too. .
