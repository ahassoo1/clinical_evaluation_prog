DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s my… my sinuses, I think. They’ve been bothering me. It’s hard to… explain exactly. It just feels stuffy, mostly. And a little… pain, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, stuffy and a little pain. Can you tell me a bit more about the pain?
PATIENT: It's… not a bad pain, Doctor. More like… pressure? Around my… forehead, I guess. And maybe my cheeks. It comes and goes, you know? It’s hard to say when it’s bad. Sometimes I feel it more when I bend over… or maybe not. I don't really know. It's been like this for… a while now. A few weeks, maybe? I'm not very good at remembering dates.
DOCTOR: A few weeks of pressure around your forehead and cheeks, worse with bending over sometimes. Alright. And is this accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmmm… let me think. I think I've been… tired a lot. More than usual. And maybe… a little bit of a cough? Not a bad cough, just… little ones. Nothing that keeps me up at night, you understand. And sometimes… my nose feels… blocked. Like I can't breathe good through it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, fatigue, a mild cough, and nasal congestion along with the sinus pressure. Have you had a fever or any chills at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. I haven’t felt hot, or cold… just… tired. I'm not sure… it's hard to tell sometimes. I don't get sick very often, you see. When I do, it's usually just a little cold. This feels… different, but not bad different. Just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any change in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: My… smell? Hmm. No, not really. I can smell things, I think. Everything smells… normal. I cook every night for my husband, you know? I can smell the food. I don't think… no. My taste is okay too. Everything tastes the way it should. I haven't noticed anything different there. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be. Okay, good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. I’ve had… little things. Like the flu, a few times. And maybe a bad cold when I was a kid. But nothing serious. No… nothing a doctor ever told me was a… a condition. My husband says I should go more often, just to check. But I don't usually bother them. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad to be healthy and not need to see a doctor often. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been very lucky. No surgeries. Nothing like that. Just… regular check-ups when I was younger. But I haven't seen a doctor in… a long time. I don’t think I’ve needed to. Everything usually goes away on its own, you see. I just thought this… sinus thing… it’s been lasting too long. That’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… My mother… she had… I think it was high blood pressure? And my father… he had problems with his… his stomach. But they’re both… they’re both gone now, Doctor. It was a long time ago. I don’t really know much about their health problems. We didn’t talk about it much. I have a sister, but I haven't seen her in years. I don’t know what she’s been up to. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or are you exposed to secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor! Never. I don’t smoke, and I stay away from people who do. My husband, he used to… a long time ago. But he stopped years and years ago. It’s bad for you, you see. Very bad. We have a clean house, very clean. No smoke at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit, Doctor. Sometimes, with dinner. A glass of wine, maybe? Or a beer. Not every night. Not much. My husband likes a beer sometimes too. We don't… we don't drink a lot. It's more of a… a habit, I guess. Not something we think about. It doesn't bother me, you see. I sleep fine. Everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to take some pills for… for headaches, a long time ago. But they didn’t really help, so I stopped. I get itchy sometimes, if I’m in the garden. But that’s just from the plants, I think. Not a real allergy. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I don't take many medicines, you see. Just when I really need to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, check your ears and throat, and feel your sinuses. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: That’s… that’s alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. Just… be gentle, please? I don't like when things are… poked and prodded. But if you think it will help… then go ahead.
DOCTOR: Take a few deep breaths for me, please. In… and out… Your breathing sounds clear. No wheezing or crackling. Again, clear. Your ear canals are clear. Your throat is a little red, but no signs of infection. There’s some tenderness here, on both sides… particularly when I press on your forehead. No swelling. Okay. Everything seems relatively normal, but your sinuses are definitely tender to the touch.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s where it hurts, Doctor. That’s why I came. It’s not a bad pain, but it’s… annoying. I just want it to go away. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it serious? Do I need… medicine? I don't like taking pills, you see. But if it will help… I'll do it.
DOCTOR: Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis – an inflammation of your sinuses. It’s very common, often caused by a viral infection, like a cold. The redness in your throat supports that possibility. Since it's been a few weeks, it could be a bacterial infection, but it's also possible it's a lingering viral issue. We can try some conservative measures first, since you prefer to avoid medication. I recommend over-the-counter nasal saline rinses a few times a day to help clear congestion and keep the nasal passages moist. A warm compress on your forehead and cheeks might also help with the tenderness. Staying well-hydrated is also important. If these measures don't improve your symptoms within a week, we can discuss the possibility of antibiotics. However, antibiotics aren't effective against viruses, and we want to avoid using them unnecessarily. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Saline rinses… and a warm compress. I think I understand, Doctor. No pills yet. Just… rinsing and warm water. That sounds… good. Much better than medicine. I can do that. I have some salt at home, I think. How often should I rinse, Doctor? And how warm should the water be? I don’t want to burn myself.
DOCTOR: Good. We'll start with the conservative approach. For the saline rinses, I recommend two to three times a day. You can use a Neti pot or a squeeze bottle – either one is fine. Make sure to use distilled or sterilized water – not tap water. As for the temperature, it should be lukewarm – comfortably warm, like body temperature. Not hot at all. If it's too hot or too cold, it can irritate your sinuses. I’ll also recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, if you’re experiencing significant discomfort. These can help with the forehead tenderness. If your symptoms don't improve after a week, or if they worsen at any point – if you develop a fever, severe headache, or facial swelling – please call the office immediately. We may need to consider other options, such as a CT scan or antibiotics. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Two or three times a day with lukewarm water… distilled, not tap. And pain relievers if it hurts. I think… I think I understand, Doctor. But I'm not very good at remembering things. Could you… could you maybe write it down for me? Just so I don’t forget anything important? And… about the fever? What temperature is too high? I don’t want to worry for no reason.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's always a good idea to have something written down. Sinusitis Care Saline nasal rinses 2-3x daily Over-the-counter pain reliever as needed Call the office if: Symptoms worsen Fever of 100.4°F or higher Severe headache Facial swelling A fever of 100.4°F or higher is considered a sign of infection, so it's important to let us know if you develop that. Facial swelling is also something we'd want to check out immediately. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor! This is very helpful. 100.4… yes. I can remember that. No, I think that’s all my questions, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you writing it down. I’ll try the rinses and the warm compress, and I’ll call if things don’t get better. Thank you again for your help. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns, or if your symptoms worsen. Get well soon. Have a good day as well. And please, remember to take it easy. .
