DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have time for pleasantries. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of my left ear. And my face… it feels droopy on that side. It’s quite alarming, really. I expect you to figure it out quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I assure you I will do my best to determine the cause of these symptoms as efficiently as possible. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are indeed concerning. To begin, could you describe the hearing loss in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? It’s gone. I can’t hear anything on the left side. It wasn't gradual, it just… was. Like someone flipped a switch. And looking in the mirror, the left side of my face… it just hangs. It's quite obvious, isn't it? I shouldn’t have to explain this further.
DOCTOR: You are right to be concerned, and I appreciate you clarifying. “Like someone flipped a switch” is a very helpful description. And you're correct, a noticeable facial droop warrants immediate attention. To help me understand the situation fully, could you tell me if you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hearing loss and facial drooping?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… no dizziness. No headache, thankfully. My vision is fine. And no tingling anywhere. Really, it's just the ear and the face. Honestly, I'm a bit surprised you need me to spell this out. Is this what you do all day? Ask people to describe the obvious? I’ve been a radiologist for thirty years; I understand detailed observation.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I apologize if my questions seem redundant given your medical background. However, a thorough assessment is crucial to rule out various possibilities, even when the presenting symptoms appear straightforward. Now, regarding the timeline – when exactly did you notice these symptoms begin?
PATIENT: This morning. I woke up, and it was just… like that. Maybe around 7:00 AM. I don't keep a precise log of when my body decides to malfunction, if that’s what you’re expecting. I had a cup of tea, got ready for the day, and then realized I couldn't hear on the left side when I turned on the news. And then I saw my face in the mirror. It was quite a shock, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And prior to this morning, had you experienced any other symptoms at all – perhaps any unusual weakness, numbness, or changes in your speech?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I felt perfectly fine yesterday. I did have a bit of a busy day reviewing scans, but that's normal. No weakness, no numbness, no slurred speech. I'm quite articulate, as you can see. This all came on very suddenly. It’s… unsettling. I expect this isn't good, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Nissenbaum, sudden onset of these symptoms is concerning, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. To proceed, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, focusing on your cranial nerves. This will involve some simple tests to assess your facial movement, hearing, and other functions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get on with it. I have appointments to reschedule, you know. And frankly, I don’t have time to waste explaining basic anatomy to anyone. Cranial nerves. Yes, I know what those are. Let’s just be efficient.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, if you’ll look straight ahead, I’m going to shine a light into each of your eyes to check your pupils and reflexes. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Next, I’ll ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and close your eyes tightly. There’s some weakness on the left side of your face, as you’ve noted. Now, can you stick out your tongue?
PATIENT: Yes, I can stick out my tongue. As you can see, it doesn’t go straight. It veers to the left. Honestly, is this really necessary? It's quite obvious there's a problem. You’re making me nervous now, poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I apologize for any discomfort. These examinations are necessary to help determine the exact location and extent of the problem. Now, I'm going to check your hearing again. I'll hold this tuning fork on the mastoid bone behind your ear and ask you to tell me when you can no longer hear it. The sound does seem to diminish on the left side. Given your symptoms – sudden onset of facial drooping, hearing loss, deviation of the tongue – my primary concern at this moment is Bell’s palsy, though other possibilities need to be considered. Do you have any history of diabetes, hypertension, or recent viral infections?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Hypertension… well, my blood pressure was a little high at the clinic, as you just noted, but my doctor said it was probably just stress. And a recent viral infection? No, nothing. I’ve been perfectly healthy, thank you very much. This is all very alarming. Bell’s… what was that? Some sort of paralysis? Is it serious? I really need to know. I have things to do. People relying on me.
DOCTOR: Bell’s palsy is a condition caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, which controls movement of the muscles on one side of the face. It can cause sudden weakness or paralysis, as you've experienced. In many cases, it resolves on its own, but it’s important to rule out other, more serious causes of your symptoms first. Given your history and the findings of the examination, I would like to order a CT scan of your head to rule out a stroke or other structural problem. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Fine. Whatever it takes to figure this out. But I expect the results quickly. I can't sit around waiting. And I assume you have someone who can interpret the scans? I’ve reviewed countless scans myself, but I’d prefer a second opinion in this case. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. Get it done. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concern and the need for a swift diagnosis. I will personally ensure the CT scan is ordered immediately, and I will review the results myself, with a radiologist confirming the findings. We have excellent radiology support here. In the meantime, while we await the scan results, I am going to prescribe a course of oral corticosteroids – prednisone – to reduce inflammation of the facial nerve. This is a standard treatment for Bell's palsy, and it may help improve your recovery. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Fine. Corticosteroids. I've heard of those. Side effects? I expect there are side effects. I really don't need any additional complications. Just tell me what I need to do, and let's get this over with. This has been… most unpleasant. And frankly, a bit insulting to my intelligence.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Common side effects of prednisone include increased appetite, fluid retention, and temporary changes in mood. More serious side effects are rare, but we will monitor you closely. I will provide you with a written information sheet outlining the potential side effects and precautions. I'll write the prescription now. While awaiting the scan results and initiating the corticosteroids, it’s important to protect your left eye from drying out, as you may not be able to close it fully. I will prescribe artificial tears and an eye ointment. I will also recommend you gently tape your eye shut at night. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Tape my eye shut? Honestly. Very well. Artificial tears. Eye ointment. Tape. I suppose I can manage that. No, I don't have any questions. Just… get the scan done. And please, expedite the results. I have a life to get back to. This whole experience has been… thoroughly inconvenient. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Nissenbaum. I have already placed the order for the CT scan, and I will personally follow up to ensure a rapid turnaround. A nurse will be in shortly to review discharge instructions and provide you with the prescriptions. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of symptoms or have any concerns. Thank you for your patience. .
