DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don't have a lot of time. It's my throat. It hurts. Just… hurts when I swallow. Is that all I need to tell you?
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore throat. I understand you're short on time, so we'll try to be efficient. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More… more what? It hurts. I already told you that. It’s like… sandpaper. And it's been… a few days, I think. Not a week. Definitely not a week. I don't really keep track of things like that. Is there a quick fix?
DOCTOR: Alright, sandpaper is a good way to describe it. A few days of sore throat. And you're hoping for a quick fix, I understand. To help me figure out the best course of action, could you tell me if you've had any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I just feel… unwell. Tired, probably. Everyone gets tired. Is a little tiredness a symptom? I don't know what you want me to say. I just want this over with. I have things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie, and I apologize if I’m asking too many questions. It’s just that “feeling unwell” can mean a lot of different things, and it helps me narrow down what might be going on. Let's try this: have you had a fever, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: Fever… I don't think so. My husband used to take my temperature, but… well, that was a long time ago. And I don't have anything to take it with now. Chills… sometimes I feel a little cold, but that's just the air conditioning. It's always too cold in places. Body aches… I'm a woman of a certain age, Doctor. Things ache. It’s normal. Really, is this necessary?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever that you're aware of, chills you attribute to the air conditioning, and aches you consider normal. That's helpful. Have you noticed any cough, runny nose, or any difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: A cough… Yes, a little. Not a bad one. Just when I lie down. It's… irritating. Runny nose… sometimes. Mostly just when the dust is bad. And breathing… I breathe. Everyone breathes, don't they? I don’t have trouble breathing, no. Are you a real doctor? This feels like a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Tammie, I am a real doctor. I apologize if my questions seem tedious, but it’s important to gather all the information to make the best assessment. Okay, so a cough when lying down, and a runny nose sometimes. Have you noticed any white patches or redness in your throat, or any difficulty swallowing besides the pain?
PATIENT: Patches? I can't see down my throat, Doctor. Do you expect me to have a little mirror? And redness… well, it probably is red. It hurts, doesn’t it? And swallowing is difficult! I already told you that! Honestly, I think I’m done with this. Is there anything you can just give me to make it stop?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. You're right, you've already mentioned the difficulty swallowing. Let's try something different. Would you mind if I just take a quick look at your throat?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And don't poke around too much. I don't want to catch anything from this place. Hurry it up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. Your throat is definitely red and a little swollen, which explains the pain. I don't see anything that's immediately alarming, but it does look like you have a sore throat, likely caused by a viral infection. It's good that there’s no fever or other signs of a more serious issue. I'm going to listen to your lungs, just to be sure everything sounds clear. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But don't go sticking anything up there. Lungs… what about my lungs? I didn’t come here for a lung exam. Can’t you just give me something? Anything? I need to get home.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Tammie, and I won’t do anything that makes you uncomfortable. Listening to your lungs is a quick and easy way to rule out any secondary infection like bronchitis or pneumonia, which can sometimes follow a sore throat. It doesn't involve sticking anything in your lungs, just listening with my stethoscope. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. Again… and out… Okay, your lungs sound clear. That's reassuring. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, it’s most likely a common viral sore throat. Unfortunately, there’s no quick cure for a virus. We focus on managing the symptoms. Would you like to try some over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: Remedies? Like what? I don't want to spend a fortune on things that won’t work. Look, I just want to feel better. Can't you just give me a shot? A strong shot? That's what my husband used to do. He always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: I understand you're looking for a quick solution, Tammie. Unfortunately, antibiotics won't help a viral infection, and a shot wouldn’t be beneficial in this case. Antibiotics only work against bacteria, and viruses are different. Giving you antibiotics when they aren't needed can actually do more harm than good in the long run. But there are things that can help relieve your symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with the pain and inflammation. Lozenges or throat sprays can soothe your throat. And plenty of rest and fluids are very important. I can recommend a specific brand if you’d like, and also discuss the proper dosage. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… acetaminophen… it all sounds like a lot of trouble. And I don't trust those brands. Too many chemicals. Fine. Tell me the dosage. But if I get sicker, I’m blaming you. And make it quick, please. I really need to get going. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. I understand your hesitation, and I want to assure you that these medications are generally safe when used as directed. For ibuprofen, you can take 200-400 milligrams every 4-6 hours as needed, but don't exceed 1200 milligrams in a 24-hour period. For acetaminophen, you can take 500-1000 milligrams every 4-6 hours, but don't exceed 3000 milligrams in a 24-hour period. It's important to read the label carefully and follow the instructions. And if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a few days, please come back or see another doctor. I also recommend drinking plenty of fluids, like water, tea, or broth, and getting plenty of rest. Do you have any other questions for me?
