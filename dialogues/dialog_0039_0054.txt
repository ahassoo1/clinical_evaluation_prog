DOCTOR: Hello Rayshon, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... cough. I got cough, yeah? Long time cough. And… tired all the time. Feel weak. And my nose… always blocked, then runny. Happens a lot. I don’t really know what to tell you, sorry. It just… been happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. A long-lasting cough, fatigue, and a stuffy, then runny nose… I understand. It has been happening for a while, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, long time. Maybe… six months? Or more? I forget exactly. Work… busy. Change tires, fix flat… all day. Maybe the dust? I don’t know. My wife… she tell me go see doctor. She worried. I think so too, now.
DOCTOR: Six months or more… alright. And your work involves changing and fixing tires, so there's a good amount of dust exposure. That could definitely be a factor. It's good your wife encouraged you to come in, it’s always helpful to have someone looking out for you. Now, can you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s… wet cough. Sometimes. Lots of… stuff coming up. Other times… dry. Scratchy. It’s worse at night. Keeps me awake. And… when I catch cold, it gets really bad. Like, can’t breathe bad. Not all the time, just when sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, a wet cough sometimes, dry and scratchy other times, worse at night… and it gets significantly worse when you have a cold, making it difficult to breathe. That’s helpful to know. When you say "can't breathe bad," can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Uh… like… chest tight. Like someone sitting on my chest. And… have to work hard to get air in. Wheezing sound, my wife say. I can feel it too, like… whistling. Not all the time, just when really sick. Makes me scared a little bit.
DOCTOR: Chest tightness, working hard to breathe, and a whistling sound – wheezing – when you're sick… I understand why that would be scary. Okay. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches with these colds, or even generally?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes. Not high fever. Just… warm. And… body ache. Like… after hard work. But… not always. When really bad cold, yes. But other times… just cough and tired. Not much fever.
DOCTOR: Alright, some fever with the worse colds, body aches occasionally… good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Uh… I think… maybe lose a little weight? My wife say my pants a bit loose. But I… busy with work, don't really pay attention. Eat okay, I think. Not much change. Maybe eat a little less when sick. But not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, potentially a little weight loss, but mostly stable appetite. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Uh… lung problems? No. I don’t think so. Never been to hospital before. Just… normal doctor check up when young. School time. Never had… those things. Asthma… what is asthma? Sorry, I don’t know much about that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, no need to apologize. Asthma is a condition that causes your airways to narrow, making it hard to breathe. We’re just trying to rule things out. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been seriously injured?
PATIENT: Uh… no surgery. Never. And… no serious injuries. Small cuts, small scrapes from work. Nothing bad. I careful with tires, mostly. Don't want to get hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear. No surgeries or serious injuries. Now, thinking about your family… do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have asthma, allergies, or any lung problems?
PATIENT: Uh… my father… he cough a lot when old. But… just old man cough. Never go see doctor. My mother… healthy. Never sick. And… I think my brother okay too. No allergies. No… special problems. Sorry, I don't really know much about my family’s health.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s common not to have that information. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. Just… drink water. And… my wife sometimes give me… cough syrup when bad cough. But… not regular. Just when really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications, just occasional cough syrup as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… no allergies. I think. Never had… rash or… trouble breathing from food or anything. My wife cook everything. She careful. Never try… new food I don’t know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your lungs and check your breathing. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. That’s okay. Listen to lungs… fine. I trust you, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a few deep breaths for me, please… and again… Alright. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, especially on exertion, and your breathing is a bit labored. I’ll also check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. Your oxygen level is a little on the lower side, at 92%. It should ideally be above 95%. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve heard during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of asthma or chronic bronchitis. However, to be sure, I would like to order some tests. A chest X-ray and a lung function test would be helpful. Would you be able to get those done?
PATIENT: Chest X-ray… lung function test? Uh… okay. I think so. My wife can help. But… how much it cost? I… not have much money. And… where I go to do those tests? Sorry, I don't know… hospital?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s important to know the costs. The chest X-ray usually costs around $150-200, and the lung function test is around $80-120. It may vary slightly depending on the facility. There's a clinic about 30 minutes from here that offers a discount for uninsured patients. The chest X-ray will be about $100 and the lung function test $60 there. I can write you a referral, and they have a payment plan option if needed. They are at 123 Main Street. Would you like me to write down the address and phone number for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Write down the address and phone number. 123 Main Street… okay. Payment plan… good. I need that. I work hard, but… money tight. My wife will be happy. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This referral is good for 30 days. Once you have the results, please bring them back to me so we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler. It will help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe when you’re feeling tight. It's not a long-term solution, but it can provide some relief. Do you have any questions about any of this so far?
PATIENT: Bronchodilator… inhaler? What is that? I never use inhaler before. Is it safe? And… how to use it? I don't want to do something wrong. Sorry, I ask too much questions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Rayshon! It's important to understand everything. A bronchodilator inhaler is a small device that you breathe into. It delivers medication directly to your lungs to help open up your airways and make breathing easier. It's generally very safe, but sometimes it can cause a slight increase in heart rate or jitteriness. Here’s how it works: You’ll shake the inhaler well, exhale completely, then put the inhaler in your mouth, and press down on the canister while slowly inhaling. Hold your breath for about 10 seconds. We will go over the technique again today. I will watch you, and we can practice a few times to make sure you're comfortable with it. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Uh… shake, exhale, put in mouth, press while inhale, hold breath. Yes… I think so. It looks… complicated. But you explain good. I will try. You watch me, yes? I scared to do wrong. And… what if it doesn't work?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I'll watch you, and we'll practice until you feel comfortable. It seems complicated, but it gets easier with practice. It’s good to be cautious. Now, let’s try it. Exhale completely, and put the inhaler to your mouth. If it doesn’t work immediately, don’t worry. Sometimes it takes a few puffs to feel the effect. If it still doesn’t provide relief after several attempts, or if you experience any side effects like a racing heart or dizziness, please contact me immediately. We’re starting with a low dose, and we will adjust it as needed based on your response. And remember, the tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help us determine the best treatment plan. Are there any other questions I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you very much, Doctor. You very kind. I feel… better now. Knowing what to do. And you explain good. I will go do the tests. And… call if something wrong. Okay.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshon. I’m glad I could help. And yes, please call if anything feels off, or if you have any concerns at all. Don't hesitate. Here's a summary of everything we discussed today, as well as the referral and prescription. Get some rest, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the test results. Take care, and please call if you need anything. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Bye bye.
