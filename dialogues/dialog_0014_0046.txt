DOCTOR: Alright, Marialena. Nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Osterholm. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing a… a consistent pressure in my bladder, and it’s become quite bothersome. It’s been happening for a little over a week now, I believe.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. It started, if I recall correctly, on July 25th. It’s not painful, exactly, just… a constant feeling of needing to go, even when I’ve just gone. It’s a little disruptive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It interferes with my work, mostly. I’m a graphic designer, and it's difficult to concentrate when I'm constantly thinking about where the nearest restroom is. It’s… rather inconvenient when I’m with clients, as well.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s try to figure out what’s going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever, no pain in my back, and my urine seems… normal in color, if that makes sense. I haven’t noticed any blood. I suppose I have been drinking more water, trying to alleviate the pressure, so I'm going to the restroom more frequently, naturally. Is that helpful information?
DOCTOR: More water… alright. And have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my… bowel habits? Not that I've consciously noticed, no. Everything seems… regular, as it has been. I haven’t had any difficulty in that regard, if that’s what you mean. Perhaps a little more frequent due to the increased water intake, but nothing alarming.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of bladder problems or urinary issues?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My grandmother, on my mother's side, actually had some issues with incontinence later in life, but I don’t believe it was ever specifically diagnosed. She just… preferred to stay close to home. My mother, thankfully, has always had a very strong bladder. I don’t recall any other relatives with similar problems. Is that the sort of information you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: It is. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any regular medication. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but it's infrequent—perhaps once or twice a month. And I take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one, nothing special. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, so I avoid medication whenever possible. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. No reactions to food, medications, or anything else, to my knowledge. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I haven’t had any issues with pollen or animals, either. Is there anything else I should mention?
DOCTOR: No, I think that covers the basics for now. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. We'll start with a basic abdominal palpation and then I'll want to do a quick urine sample, just to rule out an infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. A urine sample and an examination are sensible precautions. Please, proceed when you are ready. I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Good. Let's start with the abdominal palpation. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll need you to relax your abdomen as much as possible. I'm just going to gently press on different areas to check for any tenderness or abnormalities.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ll do my best to relax. Please let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. No immediate tenderness, which is good. Everything feels… normal, structurally. I’m going to listen to your abdomen now. Bowel sounds are present and… normal. No signs of obstruction. Now, I need you to collect a urine sample for me. There’s a specimen cup in the bathroom. Just try to collect a midstream sample, if you can. Do you know how to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. I’ve done that before. A midstream sample, ensuring cleanliness. I’ll head to the bathroom now and return with the sample when I’m finished. It will only be a moment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take your time. I'll be here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I believe that's a sufficient sample. It was… straightforward enough.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll send that off to the lab. It'll take a few minutes for the results. While we wait, I'll just ask a few more questions about your… lifestyle. Do you engage in any strenuous physical activity?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I enjoy hiking when I have the time, and I walk my dog most days—usually around three miles. It’s not particularly strenuous, but it keeps me active. I also do some light yoga for flexibility. Nothing too demanding, as I spend a lot of time sitting at my computer for work. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any issues with… constipation?
PATIENT: Constipation? No, not usually. As I mentioned before, my bowel movements have been regular. The increased water intake has, if anything, made them more regular, not less. I haven’t experienced any difficulties in that regard. I eat a fairly healthy diet with plenty of fiber, so I haven’t had any issues with that. Is that relevant, Doctor? It seemed a bit of a… leap from hiking.
DOCTOR: Just covering all bases. It can sometimes be a contributing factor. Okay. The lab results are back. No infection detected. Which is good. That rules out a simple UTI. Given your symptoms, and the lack of any infection, it’s likely… functional bladder dysfunction. Meaning your bladder is functioning normally, but you’re experiencing discomfort due to… unknown causes.
PATIENT: Functional bladder dysfunction? Unknown causes? What does that mean, exactly, Doctor? Is it… serious? And what can be done about it? I apologize for the direct questions, but I am a little anxious. I rely on my physical health for my work, and the uncertainty is unsettling.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, in the sense that it's not life-threatening. But it is disruptive, and we need to manage it. Functional bladder dysfunction can be caused by a number of things—stress, diet, even just… the way your nerves are wired. It's difficult to pinpoint an exact cause. We can try a few things. First, a bladder diary. I want you to record every time you urinate for the next week—the time, the amount, and whether you felt a sense of urgency. This will help us get a better picture of what’s going on. Second, we can try some pelvic floor exercises—Kegels—to strengthen your bladder muscles. And third, if that doesn't help, we can consider referring you to a urologist. They can do some more in-depth testing to rule out any other potential problems. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That… sounds reasonable, yes. A bladder diary and pelvic floor exercises. I can certainly keep a diary. And I believe I understand how to perform Kegels. It’s a little frustrating that there isn't a clear cause, but I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. A referral to a urologist if necessary is also reassuring. I will start the diary immediately. Is there anything else I should be doing or avoiding in the meantime? Perhaps certain foods or drinks?
DOCTOR: Avoid caffeine and alcohol. They can irritate the bladder. And try to drink plenty of water—but not too much right before bed. Smaller, more frequent sips throughout the day are better. And try to manage your stress levels—easier said than done, I know. I’ll print out a guide to pelvic floor exercises and a sample bladder diary for you. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review your diary and see how you’re doing. If your symptoms worsen significantly before then, don't hesitate to call. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. The guides are very helpful, and the instructions are clear. Two weeks for a follow-up is perfectly acceptable. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate your patience and your willingness to explore the possibilities. I will begin the diary immediately and follow your recommendations. It was a pleasure meeting you, Doctor Osterholm. I hope to have better news in two weeks.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Follow those instructions, and we'll see where we stand in two weeks. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes.
