DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbose. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, please, try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s a bit… awkward to explain, truthfully. I’ve been… going to the restroom rather frequently. More than usual, you see. It’s been happening for a little while now, I believe. Though, pinning down exactly when it started… that escapes me, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: "Rather frequently," you say. An imprecise metric, unfortunately. And you can’t recall when this began?
PATIENT: Imprecise, yes, I understand. It's… difficult. Perhaps a month? Or two? It's all a bit of a blur, Doctor. I apologize for the vagueness. I haven't been keeping a strict log, naturally. It simply… happens. More often than it should, I presume. And, usually, at night, if that is relevant.
DOCTOR: Nighttime frequency. Alright. And is this accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I don’t believe so. No pain, no discomfort… just the… increased visits. I do feel a bit thirsty, perhaps? Though, it's been rather warm lately, so that may simply be the weather. I'm not sure if that's connected. Is that helpful, Doctor? I’m attempting to recall anything unusual, but my memory… it isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Thirst, potentially related to warmer weather. We’ll account for that. Any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Changes in my urine… now that is a question. Let me consider. I haven’t… visually inspected it closely, if you understand. It appears normal, I suppose. The usual colour. No blood, I don’t think. No… foam. I really haven't been paying close attention, Doctor. I feel rather foolish discussing this in such detail, truthfully. It seems rather… personal. Is there something I should be looking for specifically?
DOCTOR: No, no need to apologize. It’s a necessary inquiry. Let’s move on. Any changes in your fluid intake?
PATIENT: Fluid intake… yes. I drink… tea, mostly. Several cups throughout the day. Perhaps more than usual recently, now that I think of it. Not dramatically, but… I've found myself reaching for the kettle more often. I suppose that could be connected to the thirst, if you're correct. I don't drink much soda, and hardly any alcohol. Does that provide any useful information, Doctor? I hope I'm not being too vague again.
DOCTOR: Tea. Alright. Do you have any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical history… hmm. That’s… a difficult question. I’ve had the usual colds, naturally. A bout of the flu a few years ago, I believe. Nothing… serious. No major illnesses, no surgeries. I had my vaccinations, as required. I believe I was a rather healthy man, generally. I haven't seen a doctor regularly in… some time, truthfully. My memory is failing me regarding specifics. Would my general practitioner’s office have records, Doctor? Perhaps they could provide more detail? I truly apologize for the lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: We can attempt to obtain records, though that can be a protracted process. Family history, then. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… yes. My father… he suffered from diabetes, I believe. Type 2, I think it was. And my mother had… high blood pressure, I recall. Nothing else immediately springs to mind. My siblings were relatively healthy, as far as I know. I haven't kept close contact with them in recent years, so I may be forgetting something. It was a long time ago. I hope that is relevant, Doctor? It’s rather unsettling to think about, truthfully, the possibility of inheriting something.
DOCTOR: Diabetes, hypertension. Alright. And finally, let's discuss your current medications and any allergies you may have.
PATIENT: Current medications… none, Doctor. I do not take any prescription medications regularly. I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for… aches and pains, but nothing consistent. As for allergies… I believe I am allergic to… dust, perhaps? It causes me to sneeze, occasionally. And a mild reaction to certain pollens, during the spring. Nothing life-threatening. I haven’t been to an allergist to confirm, though. Is that sufficient information, Doctor? I’m attempting to be thorough, but my recollection is… imperfect, as you've likely gathered.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's perform a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your abdomen.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you'll excuse me. I apologize for my slowness. This table… is rather high, isn't it? Proceed as you wish, Doctor. I shall endeavour to remain still.
DOCTOR: No acute tenderness to palpation. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. Bowel sounds are normoactive. Tympanic to percussion. No palpable masses. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I trust everything is as it should be? I do occasionally experience… minor indigestion, but I assumed that was simply due to… dietary indiscretions. Proceed at your own pace, Doctor. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, within normal limits. No edema noted in extremities. Based on this preliminary examination and your reported history, Mr. Verbose, the most likely cause of your symptoms is benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. This is common in men your age, and can cause increased urinary frequency, especially at night. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'm ordering a urinalysis and a PSA test. We'll need a blood draw as well. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Benign… what was it? Prostatic… hyperplasia? That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Is that something I should be concerned about? And a PSA test… is that a test for… something unpleasant? I must admit, I am not familiar with these terms. Could you… perhaps explain it in simpler language, Doctor? I understand you are a medical professional, but I am not. And a blood draw… I dislike needles immensely. Is it absolutely necessary? I trust you wouldn’t recommend something without good reason.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbose, BPH is an enlargement of the prostate gland, which can obstruct urine flow. It’s not inherently serious, but it requires monitoring and potential treatment. The PSA test checks for elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen, which can indicate prostate cancer, but also rises with BPH or infection. It's a screening tool, understand?
PATIENT: An enlargement… yes. I see. And the obstruction… that explains the frequency, I presume. A screening tool… so it doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it helps you… investigate? Cancer… that is… unsettling to hear. But you say it could be caused by the enlargement, or even an infection? That is… slightly reassuring, I suppose. An infection… is that easily treatable? And the blood draw… how much blood will you need, Doctor? I do get rather faint, sometimes. Is there anything I can do to prepare? I apologize for my nervousness. It’s simply… a lot to process.
DOCTOR: An infection is often easily treated with antibiotics, yes. As for the blood draw, it's a standard vial, approximately five milliliters. We’ll have you lie down during the procedure to minimize any discomfort. The phlebotomist is very experienced. If the PSA is elevated, we may refer you to a urologist for further evaluation. This could involve imaging studies, or a biopsy. I'm also prescribing tamsulosin, an alpha-blocker, to help relax the muscles in your prostate and improve urine flow. It's a common medication for BPH. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: A biopsy… that sounds… invasive, Doctor. I trust it is not something we need to consider immediately? And tamsulosin… is that a new medication? Will it have any… side effects? I dislike taking medications unnecessarily. And allergies… I believe I mentioned a mild reaction to dust and certain pollens, but nothing serious. I do not believe I’ve ever reacted to any medications before. Though, my memory… as you know, it’s not perfect. Is there a list of potential side effects I can review? And how long will I need to take this… tamsulosin, Doctor? I am attempting to understand the full scope of this… treatment plan.
DOCTOR: A biopsy is a potential next step, Mr. Verbose, not an immediate one. As for tamsulosin, common side effects include dizziness, lightheadedness, and nasal congestion. I’ll provide you with a printed information sheet. You’ll typically take it as long as it provides symptom relief. Here's the information sheet. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the lab results and assess your response to the medication. The lab technician will take the blood samples now. Do you have any further questions before I leave?
PATIENT: Dizziness and lightheadedness… that is… worrisome. Given my tendency to faint, perhaps it would be prudent to start with a lower dosage? And nasal congestion… I already suffer from a slightly stuffy nose, especially in the mornings. A lower dosage… or perhaps a different medication? And the lab technician… will they explain the procedure? I do get rather anxious around needles. I understand you are busy, Doctor, but I simply wish to be fully informed and prepared. Is that unreasonable? Perhaps you could briefly explain the blood draw procedure to me? It would greatly alleviate my anxiety.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbose, I've already explained the procedure as thoroughly as I intend to. A lower dosage is possible, but we typically start with the standard dose to assess your response. The lab technician will explain the blood draw procedure. They are trained to handle patients with anxiety. I have other patients waiting. Please excuse me.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well. That was… less than reassuring. .
