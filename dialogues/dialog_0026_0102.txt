DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Finco, you say? A lovely name. Well... it’s a bit hard to explain, really. I just... I find myself sighing a lot these days. Deep breaths, you know? It just happens. I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time, my daughter tells me. She brought me, actually. Says I should get it checked. Old age, maybe? I don't rightly know.
DOCTOR: Okay, sighing a lot… and your daughter is the one who noticed it, that’s good of her. It is good you came in. And you’re right, it could be a lot of things, Mr. Vantine. Sometimes it's just a habit, sometimes it’s something else. To help me figure it out, could you tell me a little more about when you notice it happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… when, you say? That’s… tricky. It doesn’t seem to be at a certain time. Not after eating, not when I’m walking… I suppose… when I’m thinking. Yes, that’s it. When I’m thinking about… things. Old memories, mostly. Or… just worrying, I guess. Though, what is there to worry about at my age? It just… comes over me. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Vantine. Absolutely. Thinking and worrying can certainly cause a change in your breathing. And it’s very common to reflect on things as we get older. Now, besides the sighing, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me see. Well, my appetite isn't what it used to be. Not much hungry these days, even for my favorite prahok. And... I feel a little tired, I suppose. But everyone feels tired at my age, right? It’s hard to say what’s normal and what isn’t. My sleep… it comes and goes. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, just… thinking. Then I can't get back to sleep. Does that count as a change?
DOCTOR: Yes, those all count as changes, Mr. Vantine. Changes in appetite, feeling tired, and difficulty sleeping – those are all things we need to talk about. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing quite a bit. Now, have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath with any of this?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. A little ache sometimes, but nothing bad. Just… old age again, probably. Shortness of breath… hmm. Sometimes, when I walk up the stairs, I get a little winded. But I take my time, you know? Slow and steady. It’s not like I’m running a race! I don’t think it’s anything serious. I just get tired easily these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little ache and some breathlessness with stairs. Thank you for telling me that. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… Oh, yes! Actually, now that you mention it, my daughter said something about that. She said my feet were looking a bit puffy. I didn’t pay much attention, to be honest. I thought it was just the heat, you know? It’s been very warm lately. But she’s usually right about these things. She's a good girl, my daughter.
DOCTOR: It’s good you have a daughter who looks out for you, Mr. Vantine. Puffy feet can be a sign of a few different things, so it’s good we’re noting it. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh dear. That's a difficult one. It's been so long. I had… something with my heart, I think. A long time ago. I was in the hospital for a bit. But the doctors fixed it, I think. And I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but they gave me some pills and that seemed to help. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t remember much. It was all a long time ago, and I don’t see the doctor very often. I mostly just try to take it easy. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s okay, Mr. Vantine. Don't worry about remembering everything. We can look through your records to get a clearer picture. It’s good to know you had some heart trouble and blood pressure issues in the past. Do you know what medications you were taking for those conditions?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no, not a clue. I used to take little white pills, and then some pink ones, I think. But I stopped taking them a long time ago. The doctor told me it was okay. Said I didn't need them anymore. I don't remember who the doctor was, though. It was a long time ago, and I've seen so many. I just… stopped taking them when he said so. I don’t like taking pills if I don’t need them.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information to have. And we’ll definitely double-check that medication list. Now, are you allergic to any medications, or do you have any allergies to food or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with food, or anything else, really. My skin gets a little itchy sometimes, but that’s just the heat, I think. And I get bitten by mosquitoes all the time, but that's not an allergy, is it? I just swat them away. No, I don't think I have any allergies, Doctor. I'm a pretty simple man.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I'm retired, so I mostly stay home. I like to watch the news, and I sometimes listen to Khmer music. I used to be a police officer, you know. First-Line Supervisor of Police and Detectives. A long time ago. But now… I just take it easy. I don't do much exercise, to be honest. I walk a little, but not much. I eat whatever my daughter cooks for me. Mostly rice and fish. It's a simple life, Doctor. A very simple life. And I used to smoke, a long time ago. But I quit when my daughter was born. I didn't want her to see me smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, enjoying news and music, previous police work, moderate walking, and a history of smoking but you've quit—that's all helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your feet. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I don't mind at all. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. My old bones aren't what they used to be, you know. But I’m a tough old man. Go ahead, please. Whatever you need to do to help me feel better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit up on the table for me, that would be great. Alright, Mr. Vantine, just take some nice, deep breaths for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 86. Not alarmingly high, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. I do notice some mild swelling in both of your ankles, and your skin feels a little warm to the touch. Your pulses are a little weak, but present. Overall, everything seems okay, but the swelling and weak pulses are something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elevated, you say? And swelling? My daughter said something about that. I suppose I should listen to her more often. Weak pulses… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I just want to be able to keep enjoying my simple life, you know? Watching the news, listening to music… I don't want to end up in the hospital. What do you think is going on, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Vantine, and I want to assure you we'll figure out what's going on. The elevated blood pressure and swelling in your ankles could be related to a few different things. The weak pulses are something we need to investigate further. It could be related to poor circulation, but we need to do some tests to be sure. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, I think we need to rule out a few possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and look for any signs of inflammation. I also want to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And finally, I think an ultrasound of your legs would be helpful to assess the blood flow in your legs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh dear. More tests. It seems like all I do these days is go to the doctor and get tests. But… if that's what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. Yes, alright. Order the tests. Whatever you need to do to help me feel better. Will they be expensive, Doctor? I don't have much money, you see. I'm retired, and my pension doesn't go very far. And I don't have any insurance. I just… hope it won't be too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Vantine. It's a valid worry, and I want to assure you we'll do everything we can to minimize the expenses. I'll speak with the lab and see if they offer any financial assistance programs for uninsured patients. We can also prioritize the most essential tests first and discuss the others if needed. I'm also going to connect you with our social worker who can help you explore options for affordable healthcare and financial assistance. They're very knowledgeable and can provide valuable resources. Let's start with the blood work and EKG first. I'll write you a referral to the lab and the cardiology department. Do you have any questions about where to go or how to schedule the appointments?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Connecting me with the social worker… that sounds very helpful. Thank you. I don't have any insurance, you see, and I get so confused by all the paperwork. I don't think I can remember directions very well, Doctor. And I don't have a computer, so I can't look things up online. Could you maybe write down the addresses and phone numbers for me? And… maybe explain how to get there? I live near the market, on Sok Wat Sokha Street. Perhaps you know it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Vantine. I’m happy to write down the directions for you. Here you are. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, and their phone number is 555-1234. To get there from Sok Wat Sokha Street, you’ll want to take the number 7 bus heading east. Get off at the corner of Main Street and Elm Street, and the lab will be right across the street. The cardiology department is located at 456 Oak Avenue, and their phone number is 555-5678. To get there, you'll need to take the number 10 bus heading west from Sok Wat Sokha Street. Get off at the Oak Avenue stop, and the department is just a short walk down the street. Do you understand the directions, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Hmm… number 7 bus east… and number 10 bus west… Elm Street and Oak Avenue… It’s a bit confusing, Doctor. I haven’t taken the bus in a long time. But… I think I can manage. My daughter can help me, I suppose. She’s very good with directions. Thank you for writing it down, Doctor. That’s a big help. And thank you for being so patient with me. I appreciate it very much. Is there anything else I need to know? Or anything else you need from me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. I’m happy to help in any way I can. The most important thing is to get these tests done as soon as possible. For now, there’s nothing else I need from you. Just try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity until we get the results back. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, to discuss the next steps. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Vantine. I wish you all the best, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor Finco. Thank you for everything. I feel a little better now, knowing we’re doing something about it. I’ll try to rest, and I’ll let you know how it goes with the tests.
