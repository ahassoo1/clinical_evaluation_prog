DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, yes. It’s rather unusual, and I confess my memory isn’t what it once was, so pinpointing when it started is proving tricky. Perhaps a few days ago? I truly can't be certain.
DOCTOR: A few days ago. Alright. And where is this swelling located, Mr. Tomassoni?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s mostly in my… …around here, I believe. My neck, mostly. And perhaps a little bit on my face? It’s not terribly painful, just… noticeable. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I wish I could offer a clearer description.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Tomassoni. We’ll get there. Just try to be as precise as possible. When you say “around here,” is it on one side of your neck, both sides?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I believe… both sides, yes. It’s not dramatically different on either side, thankfully. It’s more… a general fullness, if that makes any sense? It doesn’t feel like a specific lump, more… expanded, perhaps? It’s very difficult to articulate, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Expanded, you say. And has anything changed recently that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Triggered it… that is… No, not that I can recall. I haven’t been ill, haven’t changed my diet… I’ve been working, as usual, with my patients. Honestly, Doctor, my life is rather… routine. That's part of why this is so unsettling. I don't usually have sudden changes.
DOCTOR: Routine. Very well. And what is your profession, Mr. Tomassoni?
PATIENT: I am a Speech-Language Pathologist, Doctor. I work with patients who have difficulties with communication and swallowing. It's quite rewarding work, though sometimes demanding. It involves a lot of close contact, naturally, but I maintain strict hygiene protocols, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Speech-Language Pathologist. That is… pertinent. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… perhaps a slight… thickening of my voice? It’s very subtle, I hadn't consciously registered it until just now. As for swallowing… no, not really. I haven’t choked or anything, and food goes down normally. It's more like a mild effort required, if that makes sense? A slight… resistance, perhaps. It’s hard to describe, Doctor. I’m so sorry for being so imprecise. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: Slightly helpful. Alright, Mr. Tomassoni. I’m going to need to examine your neck and throat. Please sit up straight and open your mouth for me. I'll need to palpate your lymph nodes.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. Please, do take your time. And don’t hesitate to let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I trust your expertise completely.
DOCTOR: Alright… I’m feeling some mild swelling in several of your cervical lymph nodes, bilaterally. No immediately concerning masses, but they are… enlarged. Not significantly, but noticeable. Your thyroid feels normal to palpation. No tenderness. Do you have any history of allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a little… sensitive, yes. Just there, on the right side. As for allergies… not that I am aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, to my knowledge. I haven’t taken any new medications recently either, if that's relevant. No, nothing at all. My life truly is rather uneventful, you see.
DOCTOR: Uneventful is… not necessarily a medical diagnosis, Mr. Tomassoni. Have you experienced any fever, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I haven’t felt particularly warm. Night sweats… no, I don’t recall being unusually damp at night. And weight loss… that’s possible, perhaps? I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes might be a little looser. But I’ve also been quite busy, perhaps not eating as much. It’s difficult to say, Doctor. I truly apologize for being so vague. I wish I had a better grasp of these details.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tomassoni. Given the swelling, the mild tenderness, and your history as a Speech-Language Pathologist, I’m concerned about the possibility of an infectious process, potentially mononucleosis or something similar. It's also important to rule out more serious etiologies. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a monospot test, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test to start. We'll also need to consider imaging if these initial tests aren't definitive.
PATIENT: Imaging… that sounds… serious, Doctor. Mononucleosis… I suppose that’s possible, given my line of work. I do come into contact with a lot of people. I trust your judgment completely, Doctor. Whatever tests you deem necessary, I am happy to comply. What should I expect during these tests? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: The blood tests are routine. A simple blood draw. The monospot test will give us a quick indication of possible mononucleosis. The TSH test assesses your thyroid function. Results typically take 24-48 hours, but the lab is often backlogged. As for imaging… we'll discuss that if the blood work is inconclusive. It would likely be a CT scan or possibly an MRI. It’s important to remember that these are just preliminary steps, Mr. Tomassoni. We need to gather more information before we jump to any conclusions. In the meantime, I recommend rest, hydration, and avoiding close contact with others until we have a clearer understanding of what’s going on. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Rest, hydration… yes, of course. And avoiding contact… that will be difficult, given my profession, but I will manage. Just… what are the chances, Doctor, that it is something serious? I realize you need more information, but… a general sense? I am, admittedly, a little anxious. And… will these tests affect my ability to work? I have patients who rely on me, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tomassoni, I understand your anxiety, but speculating without concrete data is unproductive, and frankly, unprofessional. While the possibility of a serious etiology exists, it is equally possible this is a benign viral infection. As for your work… avoid close contact with others. If your symptoms worsen, you should absolutely take sick leave. Worrying excessively will only exacerbate your anxiety, and it will not change the results of the blood tests. I’ve ordered the tests. We will discuss the findings when they are available. In the meantime, focus on resting and maintaining good hygiene. Do you have any further questions specifically related to the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No… no, I believe that covers it. The tests… yes. Thank you, Doctor. I apologize for my… incessant questioning. I simply wish to understand what is happening. I will, of course, follow your instructions. Rest, hydration… and avoid contact. Thank you again, Doctor. .
