DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, really. And it won't heal. It’s just…unacceptable, frankly. I've had doctors before, and they never could figure things out either.
DOCTOR: Right. “Troublesome.” And how long has this “troublesome” sore been…troubling you, Louine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It started…sometime last year, I suppose. After my husband passed. Everything just sort of…blurred after that. But the sore itself? At least six months, maybe longer. It’s not improving, that’s what I know. And I have always been very careful about my health, you know. Very careful.
DOCTOR: Six months. And where exactly on your foot is this sore?
PATIENT: Right here. See? It’s on the sole. It started small, just a little redness. Now…well, now it’s a proper hole, nearly. It’s quite unpleasant, I assure you. And it hurts when I walk. Though I don't go around complaining, you understand.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. And is it constantly painful, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly when I put weight on it. Walking, standing… things like that. It throbs, you see? And sometimes, especially at night, it just aches. It’s a persistent discomfort. Not that you would understand. You young people don’t know what real pain is.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Well, yes. Of course there's drainage. It's an open sore, doctor. What did you expect, perfume? It’s… a yellowish fluid, I suppose. And it makes a mess of my slippers. Honestly, it's quite inconvenient. A perfectly good pair of slippers, ruined.
DOCTOR: And have you tried anything to treat it yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. I’ve been very diligent. I’ve kept it clean, of course. Washed it with soap and water. I even tried some of that…antiseptic stuff. Hibiclens, I believe it was called. Didn't do a bit of good, naturally. And I put a bandage on it, but it just gets soaked through. I've had doctors before, and they always said to keep it clean, so I have. But it just won't heal! It's frustrating, I tell you. Utterly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, obviously. I'm eighty-nine years old, doctor. What do you think? I have a touch of the… sugar, they call it. Diabetes. Been managing it for years, though. Mostly with diet. Though it's hard when you can't eat anything nice anymore. And my arthritis, naturally. It's in my hands, mostly. Makes it hard to do things. But I manage. I always have. It’s not like you need to know every little detail.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications for these conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. There's the metformin, for the sugar. And…something for the arthritis, a little white pill. I take it every morning. Honestly, I can’t remember the name. They change them all the time, you see? Doctor keeps switching them. It's all a blur. My daughter helps me with the pills, mostly. She keeps track of everything. I just know I take them.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s take a look at your foot more closely. I’m going to need to do a quick exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. But don’t poke and prod too much. It's sensitive, you know. And wash your hands first. I don’t want any of those…germs. Honestly, you young people and your lack of hygiene… But alright, go ahead. But be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to gently palpate around the sore and check your pulses in your foot. Just let me know if anything is particularly painful. Palpating now…the skin around the sore is quite warm to the touch. There's some redness extending beyond the visible ulcer. Dorsalis pedis pulse is weak, but present. Posterior tibial pulse is also weak. I'm also noting some swelling around the ankle.
PATIENT: Oh! That’s tender! See? I told you it was sensitive. And what did you say? Weak pulses? What does that mean? Is something wrong? You’re making me nervous now. You young doctors always talk in riddles. Just tell me straight. Is my foot going to fall off?
DOCTOR: No, your foot is not going to fall off. Weak pulses simply mean that the blood flow to your foot is somewhat reduced. This is not uncommon in people with diabetes, and it's something we need to address. The warmth and redness suggest there may be some infection present. We'll need to run some tests to confirm. I'm going to order a blood test to check your blood sugar and look for signs of infection, and I'd like to get an x-ray of your foot to rule out any bone infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Oh, goodness. I hate tests. They always poke and prod and take so much blood. And x-rays? Are they safe? I don't want any radiation. Honestly, it’s all so…invasive. But alright. If you have to. But be quick about it, and don’t take too much blood. And tell me everything clearly. No riddles, understand? Just tell me what’s wrong, and what you’re going to do about it. And don't expect me to understand all the fancy medical terms. I'm an old woman, not a doctor. Now, hurry up, I have a bingo game to get to later.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've ordered the tests. A phlebotomist will come to draw your blood shortly. The x-ray technician will then take images of your foot. It won't take long. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. In the meantime, it's very important that you keep the sore clean and dry. Avoid putting any pressure on your foot as much as possible. And try to elevate it when you're resting. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Clean and dry, yes, yes. I already do that. I’m not a complete fool, you know. Elevate it… well, I suppose I can try. Though it’s hard to sit still for long. And what about the bingo game? Is it alright to go? I’ve been looking forward to it all week. Don’t tell me I have to stay home and…and rest. Honestly, doctors these days…
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not saying you can't go to your bingo game, but I strongly advise against it. Putting pressure on your foot could worsen the infection and delay healing. It's really not worth the risk. It's a foot infection, Louine. It's not life-threatening, but it does require treatment and rest. I'm going to write you a prescription for a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the sore. And I'll see you back here in a week to check your progress. Now, do you have any other questions?
