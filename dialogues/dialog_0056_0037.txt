DOCTOR: Hi Margret, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… having some trouble breathing. A little bit of wheezing, you see. It’s been going on for… a little while now, maybe a week or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week of some breathing trouble and wheezing. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It feels… tight in my chest sometimes. And I make a whistling sound when I breathe out. Not all the time, but when I walk, or… if I try to do something quick. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… difficult. It makes me stop and rest.
DOCTOR: Alright, tightness in your chest and wheezing with exertion, causing you to need to rest. Do you notice anything that makes it worse, besides walking or quick movements?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I think… yes. When it is very warm and humid outside, it feels worse. And sometimes, if I am… smelling strong smells. Like cleaning products, or… perfume. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense. So, warm humid air and strong smells seem to trigger it. Have you noticed if it's worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… perhaps a little bit worse in the mornings. When I first wake up. It usually gets better as the day goes on, if I am not doing too much. But… yes. Mornings are not so good.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse in the mornings, improving throughout the day with activity restriction. And just to be thorough, have you had a fever, cough, or any chest pain along with this breathing trouble?
PATIENT: No, no fever at all. And no cough, Doctor. Not a single one. And… no pain. Just the… the tightness. It is not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It worries me a little because I like to stay active, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to know there's no fever or cough, and just tightness. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or COPD, or any other lung conditions before?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. I have been to doctors before, of course, but… no, I don't recall anyone saying I had asthma, or… what was the other one you said? No, I don't think so. My family, we didn't have much trouble with lungs, if that makes sense. But I am getting older, you see. Things change.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And you're right, things can change as we get older. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: I take a small pill for my blood pressure, Doctor. Just one every morning. And… allergies? I think I am allergic to… cats. Yes, cats make me sneeze. But no other allergies that I know of. I haven't had a reaction to any medicine before, not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blood pressure medication and a cat allergy. Thank you. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement. Just tell me if it will be… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a nice, deep breath for me… and again… Okay, good. I am hearing some wheezing in your lungs, particularly on the exhale. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little on the lower end of normal. Your heart rate and blood pressure are good. Based on what you've told me and what I'm hearing, it sounds like you might be experiencing some symptoms of asthma, or potentially COPD. The wheezing and the triggers you mentioned - warm air, strong smells, and morning worsening - are common with those conditions. However, to be sure, I’d like to order a chest x-ray and a pulmonary function test. That will help us understand exactly what’s going on and determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound okay with you?
PATIENT: Asthma? Oh dear. I have heard of that. And COPD… is that serious, Doctor? X-ray and a… what was the other test? Yes, if that is what you think is best. I trust you. But please explain everything to me. I like to understand what is happening, you see. It makes me feel better. Is it something I can… manage? With medicine, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand wanting to know everything. COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and it's a progressive lung condition. It's often caused by smoking, but can sometimes develop even without smoking. Asthma, on the other hand, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. It can be managed very effectively with medication, and many people live full and active lives with it. The pulmonary function test is a simple breathing test where you'll blow into a tube, and it measures how much air you can inhale and exhale and how quickly you can do it. The chest x-ray will help us rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Based on the results of those tests, we can create a plan to manage your breathing. That might include inhalers to open up your airways, and potentially other medications to reduce inflammation. We can also discuss lifestyle changes to help you avoid triggers. It’s very manageable, and we'll work together to find what works best for you. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that does make a little more sense. Inhalers, you say? Like… I breathe them in? And avoid the smells, and the warm air. That I can do. It sounds… a little scary, but if it can help me breathe easier, then I am willing to try. Can I still… walk? I enjoy my walks very much. It keeps me healthy. I don’t want to stop being active.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, most people with asthma or COPD can still be active! We’ll work with you to find a level of activity that's comfortable and safe. Often, that means taking your inhaler before you exercise, and listening to your body. We may need to adjust your medication based on your activity level. I'll write you an order for the chest x-ray and pulmonary function test now. The receptionist will schedule those for you. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… the tests, how long will they take? And will they… hurt? I worry a little about being in a small space. And… what if it is asthma? Is it… contagious? My grandchildren visit, you see. I don’t want to worry them.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions. The chest x-ray should only take about 10-15 minutes, and it's completely painless. You’ll just stand or sit while a machine takes a picture of your lungs. The pulmonary function test will take a bit longer, maybe 30-45 minutes, but it doesn’t hurt either. You’ll just be breathing into a tube. As for the small space, you can let the technician know you feel anxious, and they can accommodate you as best as possible. They can often make adjustments to make you more comfortable. And no, asthma is not contagious. It’s a chronic condition, not an infection. You won’t pass it on to your grandchildren. They can visit without any worries at all. Does that ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: Oh, that is very good to hear about the grandchildren. And no pain… that is good too. And it won't take too long. Yes, that does ease my mind a great deal, Doctor. Thank you. You have been very kind and explained everything so well. I appreciate it very much. I think… I think that is all my questions for now. I will just… wait for the receptionist then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. I’m glad I could ease your worries. Yes, just wait for the receptionist, and she’ll schedule your tests. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your breathing, or develop a fever, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Margret.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
