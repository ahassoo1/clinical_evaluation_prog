DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this tiredness… daytime sleepiness, really. Even though I’m using my machine every night, you see. It’s just… I still feel awfully drowsy during the day. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. Daytime sleepiness despite using your machine – that’s certainly something we need to investigate. Just to clarify, is this a new issue, or has it been gradually worsening?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… gradual, I’d say. It didn't happen all at once. For a long time, the machine seemed to be doing a pretty good job. I felt much better, actually. But over the last few months, maybe six months or so, the tiredness started creeping back. Not as bad as before I started the machine, thankfully. But enough to be a nuisance, you know? Makes it hard to really enjoy things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I completely understand. It’s good to know the machine initially provided relief, and it’s helpful that you can pinpoint when the symptoms started returning. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the tiredness itself?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I’m falling asleep during the day, if that’s what you mean. It’s more of a… heavy feeling. Like I haven’t quite rested, even after a full night’s sleep. And I find myself yawning a lot. A lot. It affects my concentration, too. Reading, things like that. I used to enjoy a good book, but now… I have to reread passages several times. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Paske. So, not excessive daytime sleepiness in the sense of falling asleep, but more a persistent feeling of fatigue and difficulty concentrating, despite using your machine. And the yawning is a good observation. Now, to get a more complete understanding, I’d like to ask you a few more questions. First, could you describe your typical sleep schedule?
PATIENT: Certainly. I try to go to bed around ten, ten-thirty most nights. I used to be a night owl, but getting older changes things, you know? And I wake up around six, six-thirty. I don’t usually have trouble falling asleep, thankfully. Though sometimes I wake up once or twice during the night to… well, to go to the bathroom, mostly. Nothing dramatic. I get about seven, maybe eight hours of sleep, I suppose. It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, seven to eight hours of sleep, going to bed around ten or ten-thirty, and waking up around six or six-thirty. And occasional awakenings during the night for bathroom breaks. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let's see… I was diagnosed with high blood pressure maybe fifteen years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I had my gallbladder removed, oh, twenty years ago now. Nothing serious. And… the sleep apnea, of course, which is why I’m here. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. No major illnesses. I try to stay active, walk a bit when the weather allows.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and the sleep apnea. That's a good summary. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And… oh, a small dose of Atorvastatin, 10 milligrams, for cholesterol. The doctor said it was a precaution. And that’s it, I believe. Just those two.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg and Atorvastatin 10mg. Thank you. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I don’t have any known allergies. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. My wife used to joke I could eat anything, but she's gone now. So, I don’t have anyone to remind me of any sensitivities, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. No known allergies, that's good to know. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father had heart disease, unfortunately. He passed away when he was in his early seventies. My mother had arthritis, mostly. And… I think my uncle had diabetes, type 2, but I’m not entirely sure. It was a long time ago, and family history wasn’t something we talked about much. My brother is still alive, healthy as a horse, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart disease in your father, arthritis in your mother, and possible diabetes in an uncle. And your brother is currently healthy. That’s helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, could you tell me a little about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Well… I live alone, as I mentioned, since my wife passed. I don’t really have a lot of close friends anymore, unfortunately. I try to stay busy, though. I read, I do some gardening when the weather’s nice. I used to enjoy going to the movies, but it's harder to get out these days. As for… less healthy habits? I don’t smoke. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner, but I’ve cut back considerably. Maybe one or two glasses a week now.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, stay active with reading and gardening, and have reduced your alcohol consumption to one or two glasses a week. That’s all very good information. Now, Mr. Paske, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 76. A little elevated, but within an acceptable range. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me... and another... Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to take a look at your throat and ears. Open wide for me, please… Throat is clear, no significant findings. Ears are also clear. Finally, I’ll just check your neurological reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything appears to be within normal limits on this initial examination, but we’ll need some further testing to determine the cause of your fatigue.
PATIENT: That sounds thorough, Doctor. Thank you. So, what sort of further testing are you thinking of? Is it something serious? I must admit, I get a little anxious about these things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious, and I want to assure you we are taking a careful and methodical approach. At this point, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test – to check your thyroid function – and a sleep study to re-evaluate your sleep apnea. The sleep study is particularly important, as it’s possible your machine settings need adjustment or that your sleep apnea has worsened. The blood tests will help rule out any underlying medical conditions, like anemia or vitamin deficiencies. The TSH test will assess your thyroid function as that can cause fatigue. I don’t want to jump to any conclusions, but these tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and allow us to formulate a targeted treatment plan. It’s likely to be something manageable. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. A thorough approach is exactly what I’d want. All those tests… that all makes sense. And a re-evaluation of the sleep apnea is probably a good idea, you’re right. I haven’t had it checked in a while. So, how do we go about getting these tests done? Will the clinic schedule them, or do I need to go somewhere else? And roughly, how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll schedule all the tests here at the clinic. I’ll write you a lab requisition, and the front desk will arrange the appointments for you. The blood tests can be done any day next week. We'll schedule the sleep study for the following week. It will require a referral to the sleep center, but we handle all the paperwork here. As for the results, the blood tests usually come back within 3-5 business days. The sleep study takes a bit longer, usually a week to ten days for the results to be interpreted by the sleep specialist. Once we have all the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions about the scheduling process or the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Scheduling here at the clinic is perfect, and I understand about the sleep study taking a little longer. The timeframe for the results sounds reasonable. I think I’m all set for now. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for being so thorough. It’s a relief to feel like someone is taking my concerns seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. We always strive to provide comprehensive and compassionate care, and your concerns are our priority. The front desk will get everything scheduled for you before you leave. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You've been very patient and helpful. I really appreciate it. I’ll just let the front desk handle the scheduling, and I’ll wait for them to contact me. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Paske. It was a pleasure meeting you. We'll be in touch soon to schedule your appointments. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day.
