DOCTOR: Hi Kile, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Doctor… Rosanova, you say? Good to meet you too. I… well, I just moved here. New area. Needed to find a… a doctor, yes? For the… the healthcare. The social healthcare. It's all very… new. I don't really need anything, you understand. Just… getting settled. Medicare, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Getting settled with new healthcare can be a bit overwhelming, especially with Medicare. That's perfectly alright – a check-up to establish care is a great first step. I see you recently moved to the area – welcome! And thank you for choosing me as your doctor. Just to get a good overview, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to come in today, beyond just establishing care?
PATIENT: Establishing… yes. That’s a good word. Look, I do makeup, you know? For… the theatre. And… things. I've been doing it a long time. Very good at it, actually. But… honestly? I don't remember why I'm here. The lady on the phone… she said I should come. Routine check, she said. Something about being new. Is that not enough? I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Kile. Sometimes those routine check-ups are just to make sure everything is running smoothly, especially with a change in location and insurance. It’s good you came in! Let’s just do a quick review of your medical history, if that's okay, to cover all bases. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly, or have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… illnesses? Oh, goodness. That was… a long time ago. When I was a boy, I think. Something with… the throat. Very bad. But that was… Russia. Different doctors, different everything. I don't remember much. I haven’t seen a doctor… regularly, no. Not really. Makeup is… preventative, you know? Keeps everything… looking good. Does that count? And surgery... maybe? I had something done on my… foot, I think. Years ago. Really, I'm a very healthy man.
DOCTOR: Okay, a throat issue as a boy and a possible foot surgery. That’s helpful. We can look into records if you'd like, but no worries if you don’t recall the specifics. Let's talk about your family. Are there any health problems that run in your family—anything like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she was always… frail. Delicate. She didn't live a long life. Something with… her heart, I think. Always tired. But she wasn’t a healthy woman, you understand? Always complaining. My father… he was… strong. Very strong. Worked in… the factories. Never sick a day in his life. That I remember. No… cancer, I don't think. No one talked about such things. It was… different then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mother with heart issues and a father who was generally healthy. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Drink everything. I am Russian, you know? We are… hardy people. Maybe a little… sensitive to the cold, but that is not an allergy. I use… many products for my makeup. Very strong chemicals, actually. But I’ve never had a reaction. Never. It would ruin my work, you see?
DOCTOR: Good to hear. No known allergies are always good. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription or over-the-counter—vitamins, supplements, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't take pills. I used to… when I was younger, maybe? For… nerves. The theatre is… stressful. But I stopped that long ago. I take… vitamins, sometimes. For my skin. Very important, you see? To look good. But nothing… regularly. Just when I remember. It's usually fish oil, I think. For… the shine. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Fish oil for the shine is perfectly acceptable! No need to worry about that. Okay, last few quick questions before we move on to a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational… drugs? Oh, goodness no. Absolutely not. I am a professional. I need a clear head for my work. Drink? Sometimes. A little vodka, with… friends. Mostly on holidays. Not every day, you understand? And smoking… I used to, years ago. When I was very young. But I quit. Long ago. Bad for the skin, you see? Very bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, Kile. That’s a really good overview. Thank you for being so open. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It won't take long. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Hmm. Physical exam… yes. I suppose. As long as it doesn't mess up my… look. I have a very important… client, next week. A very discerning… actress. She expects perfection. But… yes. Go ahead. But be gentle, please. And try not to… smudge anything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kile. I will be very careful. I promise to be as gentle as possible and preserve your… artistry. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Let's start by having you sit up on the table and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright. But hurry, please. I haven’t got all day. And… be careful with the stethoscope. It looks like it might… smudge.
DOCTOR: Okay, taking a listen now… Heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute, but regular. Lung sounds… I'm hearing some mild wheezing on both sides, particularly when you exhale. This could be related to a past smoking history or simply a bit of congestion. I'm also noticing a slight pallor to your skin. Are you feeling more tired than usual, or have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: Pallor? What is… pallor? I always look a little… pale. I work indoors, you know? Not much sun. And tired? Well, yes. A little. But who isn't these days? It's the stress. The pressure. The discerning actress! She expects… miracles. And I deliver, you understand? Miracles! But it's… exhausting. And the wheezing… that's probably just… the air conditioning. It’s very dry in here.
DOCTOR: That’s possible, Kile. Dry air can certainly irritate the lungs. I'd like to take a look in your ears and throat now, just to rule out any signs of infection or irritation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: In my… throat? Oh, goodness. Be careful! That's where I… work! Very delicate instruments, you know. Very easily… disturbed. But… alright. Go ahead. But gently, please. And no sudden movements. I have a very important… client.
DOCTOR: Alright… throat looks a little dry and slightly irritated, but no obvious signs of infection or major inflammation. Your tonsils are normal in size. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, Kile. And we confirmed the pulse is 88. Given the elevated blood pressure, mild wheezing, and slightly pale appearance, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Elevated… blood pressure? Oh, goodness. Is that bad? Everything is always… elevated these days. The stress! The discerning actress! She is… demanding. A complete… blood count? Basic… metabolic panel? What does that even mean? Will it… mess up my schedule? I have a very important… client! And what about… the makeup? Will it interfere with the… artistry?
DOCTOR: It's okay, Kile. Slightly elevated blood pressure isn’t immediately alarming, but we want to rule out any underlying causes. The blood tests are routine and will give us a better picture of your overall health. They won’t interfere with your schedule – it just requires a quick visit to the lab, and it should only take a few minutes. And no, the tests won’t affect your makeup at all. They’ll just need a small sample of blood. Based on what we've discussed today, I also recommend a lifestyle check, including discussing diet and exercise. And given your past smoking history, we should talk about quitting resources, just in case. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… check? Diet and… exercise? Oh, goodness no. I haven't got time for all that. I work! Very long hours. And quitting… resources? I quit years ago. You heard me. Years ago. It was a very difficult… process. And now, I have a very important… client! She expects me to look… flawless. I can't be… distracted by all this. Are you sure these tests are… necessary? Maybe I just need a little… rest. And a very strong cup of tea. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Kile. You’re very busy, and I appreciate you expressing your anxieties. While rest and tea are certainly helpful, the blood tests will give us a more objective assessment of your health and rule out any potential issues. Given your elevated blood pressure and wheezing, I strongly recommend we proceed with the tests. It’s better to be proactive and ensure everything is okay, especially with your demanding schedule. If everything comes back normal, you can have peace of mind. How about this?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! But if it interferes with my schedule… I’m holding you responsible. My client… she is very… influential. And she does not appreciate… delays. But I want a very clear explanation of everything. And no unnecessary… poking and prodding. I have a reputation to uphold. And my face… it’s my livelihood.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kile. No unnecessary poking and prodding, I assure you. I'll make sure the lab technician is aware of your concerns. I'll also explain everything thoroughly, step-by-step, before it happens. Here's the order for the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall, and they're open until 5 PM today. Once you've had the tests done, they'll send the results directly to my office. Once I have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Down the hall, you say? Very well. But if I’m kept waiting… I will be most displeased. And make sure they don’t… smudge anything. And I expect a prompt follow-up. My time is… valuable. And my client… well, you understand. Very well then. I suppose I should go. If you’ll excuse me. I have a very important… appointment.
