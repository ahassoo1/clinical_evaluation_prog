DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It's driving me crazy, honestly. Not all over, really, but mostly on my arms and back. It's just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. Itching can certainly be very disruptive. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started, oh, maybe a month ago? It’s not really…rash-like, you know? Just red and bumpy, and it feels itchy, deep down. Sometimes it’s worse at night, which makes it hard to sleep. I’ve tried lotions, regular lotion, but nothing seems to really help for very long. Do you need to know what kind of lotion? I just get whatever’s on sale, usually.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. And no, the specific brand of lotion isn’t critical right now. A month ago is a good timeframe. You mentioned it's worse at night—are there any other times it seems to be particularly bad, or anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, it does seem worse after I shower. Hot showers, especially. I like a nice hot shower, you see. Makes my bones feel better. Cooler showers don’t seem to bother it as much. And… honestly, when I’m busy, I don’t notice it as much. Distracted, I guess. Is that… strange?
DOCTOR: Not strange at all, Ms. Cassimatis. It’s very common for itching to be modulated by distraction, or even stress. The fact that it's worse with hot showers is also a useful clue. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the itching – any fever, fatigue, weight changes, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, no fever or anything like that. I’ve been a little tired, maybe, but I'm seventy years old, Doctor! A little tired is just…normal, you know? No weight changes, definitely not. I like my food too much for that. And everything…down there…is regular, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of that with me, Ms. Cassimatis. It’s important information. And no, I don’t mind at all. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, years ago, I had high blood pressure, but I haven’t really been to a doctor in a long time. It was…managed, I think. I stopped taking the pills, to be honest, when my husband…well, never mind. It's been a while. And no, nothing else that I know of. I used to be very healthy, always walking and dancing, but lately…not so much. Just the itching, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it’s alright to share when things have changed. It’s good that we’re talking about this. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Years ago, I had my gallbladder out. That was… a long time ago. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, but that was just for a couple of days. Nothing serious. No other surgeries, no. I try to stay out of hospitals, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cassimatis. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… My mother, she had arthritis, badly. And my brother, he had skin problems when he was a kid, some kind of allergy, I think. Nothing too serious. My father was healthy as a horse until the day he died, really. And my husband… well, he had a heart condition. But that was…later in life. Does that help? Is that the kind of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Knowing about the arthritis and your brother’s skin condition is useful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional Tylenol for aches and pains, you know? Nothing regular. And sometimes, a little vitamin D in the winter, because I don’t get out in the sun as much. But that’s it. No herbal supplements, no prescriptions. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cassimatis. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. No allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cassimatis, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to take a closer look at your skin and rule out any other possible causes for the itching. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Ms. Cassimatis, I'm examining your arms and back now. I see some areas of redness and small bumps, as you described. The skin feels a little dry overall, but there doesn’t seem to be any significant swelling or tenderness. I'm not seeing any signs of a rash, like blisters or open sores. It appears localized, primarily on your arms and back. Your skin also feels a bit dry overall. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m seeing, it's likely this is a case of dry skin, possibly exacerbated by hot showers. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, such as eczema or a mild allergic reaction. I'm going to recommend we start with a simple test to help narrow things down. Would you be agreeable to a patch test?
PATIENT: A patch test? What does that involve, Doctor? I've never had one of those before. Is it painful? I don’t like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Cassimatis. A patch test is not painful at all; it doesn’t involve any needles. We apply small amounts of different common allergens to your back, covered with a patch. After a couple of days, we remove the patches and see if any of those areas develop a reaction. It helps us identify if you're sensitive to something you’re coming into contact with – things like fragrances, detergents, or metals. It's a relatively simple and painless way to get some answers. Alternatively, we can try a course of treatment for dry skin first, and see if that provides relief. This would involve using a fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day, and avoiding very hot showers. We could also try a mild topical steroid cream to reduce the itching. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I really don’t like the idea of having things stuck to my back, if I’m honest. And waiting a couple of days… I just want to feel better now, you know? The cream and the lotion sound much better. I can definitely try avoiding hot showers. I’ll miss them, but I can try. Let’s try that first. The cream and the lotion, please.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Cassimatis. I think that's a very reasonable approach. I’m going to prescribe a mild topical steroid cream – hydrocortisone 1% – to apply to the affected areas twice daily for one week. And I recommend you switch to a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer, like Cetaphil or Eucerin, and apply it generously several times a day, especially after showering. I’m also going to give you a handout with more detailed instructions on caring for dry skin, and some tips on avoiding irritants. It's important to avoid harsh soaps, detergents, and fragrances. And as we discussed, try to limit hot showers and baths. We’ll see how you’re doing in a week. If the itching doesn't improve, or if it gets worse, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can consider the patch test at that time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much. A handout is good, I sometimes forget things, you know. And I will definitely try my best with the showers and the creams. I appreciate you listening to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could help. It’s my pleasure. Here is the handout, and I've also sent the prescription to your pharmacy. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. Thank you again for your time and your help. I feel much better already, just knowing what to do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, if anything changes or you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: .
