DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I'm Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Grumman is the name. Doctor, yes? I…feel tired. Very tired. Not just a little tired, like after work. Like…old tired. And the other doctor, he say something about my liver. Not good, he say. That's why I'm here, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. “Old tired,” you say. And this other doctor mentioned concerns with your liver… I see. Can you elaborate on when this fatigue started?
PATIENT: When? Hmm. That's a good question. Not easy to say exactly. Maybe…six months ago? Things just got…slower. Harder to do things. I used to walk to the market every day. Now? No. Too much. And I sleep. A lot. But still tired. It’s…frustrating. It’s not like I’m doing nothing all day. I work, you know. With the cloth. Not easy work.
DOCTOR: “With the cloth…” Are you referring to a tailoring or upholstery business?
PATIENT: Upholstery. Yes. I make things for people. Sofas. Chairs. Things like that. But…it takes longer now. I have to stop and rest. My wife, she helps more and more. She's a good woman. But it shouldn’t be like this. I’m not…old. Not that old.
DOCTOR: I understand. Prolonged fatigue can be…vexing. We’ll need to investigate this further. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think. My stomach…sometimes it feels bad. Not pain, exactly. Just…full. And maybe a little sick. Not throwing up, you understand. Just…uncomfortable. And my skin…it feels itchy. All over. My wife says I look yellow. I don’t know about yellow. I don’t look in the mirror much. It doesn't change anything.
DOCTOR: Itchy skin and a sense of fullness…and your wife’s observation about your skin tone is pertinent. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel…movements? You mean…going to the bathroom? What kind of changes? Look, doctor, I’m not a doctor. I just tell you I’m tired and I feel sick. You ask me about…what did you call it? Bowels? That’s…personal. I don’t understand why you need to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, these questions are necessary. Changes in bowel habits can be indicative of underlying medical conditions affecting the liver, as you mentioned another doctor raised concern. It’s important we get a complete picture. Are your stools lighter in color than usual?
PATIENT: Lighter? I…I don't look at them! I go to the bathroom, I flush. What am I supposed to do, take pictures? This is ridiculous. I told you, I'm tired. My stomach feels bad. My wife says I look funny. Isn't that enough? You're asking me…childish things. I don’t know about colors. And I don’t want to talk about it anymore.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll proceed with a physical examination, then. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your abdomen, and palpate your liver to assess for enlargement or tenderness. It is crucial we gather objective data.
PATIENT: Palpate? You want to feel my liver? Like I’m some kind of…animal? Look, doctor, I don’t like this. I came here because I'm tired, and now you want to poke and prod? I don't trust doctors who poke and prod. It's…unprofessional. Maybe I should just go home. I’ll just…rest more. That's what my wife says.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, with all due respect, a physical exam is a standard component of a medical evaluation. It allows me to objectively assess your condition, and determine the appropriate course of action. I understand your discomfort, but refusing a basic examination hinders my ability to provide you with proper care. However, if you are absolutely opposed, we can order some baseline blood work. It won't be as comprehensive, but it's a starting point. But please understand, it will delay a proper diagnosis. What do you prefer?
PATIENT: Blood work…yes. That…I can do. No poking. Just…needles. My wife, she always takes my blood pressure. I don’t like it, but I let her. No poking, though. Absolutely no poking. And make it quick. I don’t want to spend all day in this…place. Just the blood work, yes? And tell me what it means. In simple words. No doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. We’ll also include a bilirubin level, given your wife’s observation. I will explain the results in as plain language as possible. It will take some time for the lab to process the results, and we’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – increased fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or noticeable yellowing of your skin – you must seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Worsen? Yes, I understand. No more poking, yes? And quick. I don't want to wait long. My wife…she worries. So, no poking, quick blood work, and you tell me what it means. In…normal words. That's all. When can I go? I need to get home.
DOCTOR: The lab technician will be with you shortly. They will draw the necessary blood samples. The results typically take 2-3 business days. I will have my receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for you at that time. In the interim, try to rest and maintain adequate hydration. I understand your reluctance, Mr. Grumman, but cooperation is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Fine. Two or three days. And no poking. Doctors… always poking and prodding. .
