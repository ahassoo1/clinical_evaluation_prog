DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, doctor, it’s about… them wanting me to do things. Things I don’t need. All this poking and prodding, honestly. I've lived a long life, you know. Eighty-three years. I think I’d know if something was truly wrong with my feet.
DOCTOR: Eighty-three years is quite a long time, yes. And I respect that you have a good sense of your own body. But sometimes, things do change gradually, and it's good to have a look, just to be sure. Now, these “things” they want you to do… are we talking about bloodwork, a physical exam, something else?
PATIENT: Oh, it's a little of everything, really. They want to take pictures of my bones, poke at my circulation… just a whole fuss. Honestly, I think they just want the money. My nephew, he says they’re all like that these days. Always looking for something to bill Medicare for.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Wynell. And I assure you, I am not here to simply run unnecessary tests. My priority is your well-being. However, imaging and circulation checks can be helpful, even in someone who feels otherwise healthy. What specifically about your feet is bothering you, if anything?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Well… they’re feet, aren’t they? They get tired, of course. I used to be a dancer, you know. A very good one. But that was… a long time ago. It’s not like they hurt, hurt. More… achey sometimes. But everyone gets aches and pains at my age. I just don’t see the need for all this… fuss.
DOCTOR: A dancer, you say?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A very good one. I danced all over… well, never you mind where. Important places. Proper places. Before… before my husband. He didn’t like it, you see. Said it was… improper for a married woman. A shame, really. I had talent. Real talent. But that's neither here nor there. It's just… I don’t want them poking around my feet trying to find something that isn't there just because I’m getting old.
DOCTOR: I see. So, these aches… when do you notice them most?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly in the evening, after I’ve been on them all day. I like to garden, you see. Roses mostly. Very delicate things, roses. Need a firm hand, but a gentle touch. And sometimes… sometimes after I’ve been standing for a while, they just feel… heavy. Like lead weights. But nothing a good sit-down and a cup of tea can’t fix. Honestly, I think a little rest is all they need. Not all these… machines.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the appearance of your feet recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… they're a little… wider, maybe? I always had small feet, you know. Size five. Elegant. But I suppose things… spread out a little as you get older. It's just natural. I certainly haven't been paying close attention to them. Why would I? They're feet.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any numbness, tingling, or discoloration in your feet?
PATIENT: Discoloration? Goodness, no. They’re not purple or anything dreadful. Maybe a little… veiny. But that’s just age, I expect. I certainly don’t go around looking at the color of my feet, doctor. It's rather a morbid thought, isn’t it? Honestly, I think they’re trying to scare me into agreeing to all these tests.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s do a quick examination, just to be thorough. I understand your concerns about unnecessary tests, and I won't push for anything you're not comfortable with. But a simple physical assessment can give us a better idea of what's going on. I'll just check your pulses, look at the skin, and assess your range of motion. Sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But don't go poking and prodding too much. And don't expect me to be pleased if you find something. It's probably nothing. Just old age. I've lived a long life, you know. A very long life.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Let's start with checking your pulses. Please extend your legs for me. Dorsalis pedis...and tibial pulses. Both are present, but a bit diminished. Not overly concerning at your age, but worth noting. Now, let me take a look at the skin... Skin is dry, some age spots present, and mild swelling in the ankles. Any history of diabetes, Wynell?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Heavens, no. I’ve always been careful about what I eat. My mother always said too much sugar rots your teeth. And I take good care of my teeth, thank you very much. No, no diabetes. None at all. Though my sister, bless her soul, had something… something with the sugar. Not me, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, let’s just see how well your feet move. Can you point your toes for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that good enough? Honestly, they're not as flexible as they used to be. I haven't danced in… well, a very long time. And it's cold in here. Makes the joints stiff, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… limited. And now, can you bring your toes back up?
PATIENT: Ouch. That’s… not so easy. See? They're just old, doctor. Old and stiff. I told you. No need to poke and prod. Honestly, I think I’d rather be gardening.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and my brief examination, it appears you have some mild limitations in your range of motion and some decreased circulation in your feet. The swelling and dry skin are also common with age. While this doesn’t immediately suggest anything critical, I do think we should order a few basic tests just to rule out anything more serious. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Tests? I knew it. I knew they'd want to run tests. Honestly, it's always about the money. I don't like it. I really don't like it. But… alright. If you insist. But I’m warning you, if it's just a waste of my time and money, I’m going to be very unhappy.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Wynell. We’ll start with a simple blood test to check your blood sugar and kidney function. We’ll also order an X-ray of your feet to rule out any bone or joint issues. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially given your history of dancing and some limitations you're experiencing. I'll write you a referral to the lab and the radiology center. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh, heavens no. I don’t take any of those… fancy chemicals. Never have. I believe in natural remedies, you see. Good tea, a little rest, that’s all you need. As for allergies… I used to be allergic to roses, but I got used to them. And a little bit of pollen never hurt anyone. Honestly, I think all these tests are just a way to scare old people into spending their money.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known medication allergies then. I'll write the lab order and radiology request. The lab will draw a small amount of blood, and the X-ray technician will take some images of your feet. Both are relatively quick procedures. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just… don't expect miracles. I’m an old woman, doctor. Old women have aches and pains. It’s just part of life. And honestly, I’m sure the tests will show nothing. But if you insist… well, I suppose I’ll go get them done. But I’m holding you responsible if they’re a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've included all the information you need on these papers. The lab and radiology center are both located near the hospital. Please bring your insurance card with you. And I assure you, I'm only ordering these tests to provide you with the best possible care. We'll discuss the results thoroughly at your follow-up appointment. Here is a handout with general foot care advice in the meantime. Do you have any difficulty walking or with balance?
PATIENT: Balance? Oh, no, not really. I used to be a dancer, you know. Excellent balance. Though… I do stumble sometimes. But that’s just… age, I suppose. And the rug in my hallway isn’t very secure. My nephew keeps saying he’ll fix it. He’s a good boy, that nephew. But… no, I don’t have any serious problems with my balance. Just the occasional stumble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, if the stumbling worsens, please let us know. And, as I mentioned, if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up, don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a card with our contact information. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think that's all. Honestly, I'm ready to go home now. I’ve wasted a perfectly good afternoon sitting here. And all for tests that are probably unnecessary. But… thank you, I suppose. Though I’m still not convinced this was a good idea.
DOCTOR: Alright then. Please take care, Wynell. And do try to rest your feet in the meantime. We’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: Hmmph. Yes, well. We’ll see. Honestly… poking and prodding… all for nothing, probably.
