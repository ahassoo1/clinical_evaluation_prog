DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Good morning. Look, I don't usually do this whole…doctor thing. But my mother insisted. She’s been on my case about this family history for years. Basically, a lot of heart problems on her side. My grandfather died young, heart attack. My uncle…same story. She’s convinced I’m next, and I just want to…get it over with, I guess? Reassure her, mostly. And myself, I suppose, though I doubt I need reassuring. I’m pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re taking your mother’s concerns seriously, even if you feel fine yourself. Family history is important, and it's always better to be proactive. We can definitely look into it and see what makes sense for you. So, to start, you mentioned a grandfather and uncle with heart attacks. Do you know roughly how old they were when that happened?
PATIENT: Um…let me think. My grandfather…he was probably in his early sixties, maybe? Sixty-two, sixty-three, something like that. And my uncle…oh, that was awful. He was younger. Only fifty-eight, I think. It was…sudden. Didn’t even make it to the hospital. That’s what my mother’s always going on about. “Sudden,” she says. Like it's contagious. Honestly, it’s a bit dramatic.
DOCTOR: I see. That is concerning, especially with your uncle's early onset. Sudden cardiac events can be frightening. We’ll definitely want to take a thorough look at your risk factors. Besides the family history, have you ever experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or fainting spells?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Look, I’m an engineer, I spend most of my day at a desk. I get…stressed, sometimes. Deadlines, you know? But it’s not like I’m running marathons or anything. I eat reasonably well, I guess. Not a health nut, but I don’t live on junk food. So, no, I haven't had any of those…symptoms. Frankly, I feel perfectly fine. This is probably a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so upfront about that, Blain. It's good to hear you're feeling well and maintain a generally healthy lifestyle. Even without symptoms, it’s still valuable to assess your risk, especially given your family history. Let's just run through a quick review of your medical background to be thorough. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No. Never. I had a physical a couple of years ago when I…well, it doesn’t matter. Everything was normal. I don’t even bother going regularly, to be honest. I'm young, I exercise occasionally, I'm not overweight…what's the point? I’m wasting my time here. Is this going to involve a lot of blood tests? Because I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and I assure you, we’ll only do what’s necessary. It sounds like you were healthy at your last physical, which is good to know. We may need to do some blood work, yes, but we can discuss that in detail before anything is done. It would be primarily to check your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and potentially some inflammatory markers. Before we get to potential tests, let's talk about your lifestyle a little more. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I find it disgusting. My ex-wife smoked, that was…one of the reasons. I wouldn't touch the stuff. And I drink…socially. A couple of beers with friends on the weekend, maybe. Nothing excessive. I'm not a party animal, if that’s what you’re getting at. I prefer quiet evenings, reading. Or working, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. So, no tobacco use and only moderate alcohol consumption – those are both positive factors. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't believe in loading up on pills unless absolutely necessary. A little ibuprofen for a headache sometimes, that’s it. I try to deal with things naturally, if possible. I’m not a fan of side effects, or doctors, for that matter. So, no, nothing regular. Are we almost done here? I have a grading deadline looming.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No regular medications or supplements. That simplifies things. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. But if you find something wrong, I’m getting a second opinion. I don't trust these things. Just…be quick about it, please. I really don’t have a lot of time for this. And don't poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is good, 122 over 78. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Everything sounds and feels normal so far. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now, just to complete the basic exam.
PATIENT: Fine. Just…hurry up. I have a stack of student papers waiting for me, and honestly, this is taking up valuable grading time. I'm starting to think my mother was right about me being a hypochondriac. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, abdomen sounds normal. No tenderness or masses detected. Everything seems normal on the physical exam so far, Blain. Given your family history, I would recommend a lipid panel – that’s a blood test to check your cholesterol levels – and a basic metabolic panel to check your blood sugar and kidney function. We could also do an EKG, a simple test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. It's quick and painless. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Look, I knew this was going to happen. Tests, tests, tests. My mother’s going to be thrilled. Fine. Do them. Get it over with. But I want the results explained to me in plain English. None of that medical jargon. And if everything's normal, I don't want to be bothered again. Is that clear? And no lectures about diet and exercise. I already know I should be doing those things. Just tell me if there’s a problem.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Blain. We’ll explain everything in plain English, no medical jargon. And no lectures, I promise. We’ll focus on the results and what they mean for you. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and do the EKG. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. In the meantime, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. Absolutely none. I'm pretty boring that way. I haven’t even had poison ivy. I'm just…remarkably un-allergic. So, no, nothing. Can I go now? Seriously, I need to get back to work. My students are probably plotting my demise as we speak.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, that's good to know. And yes, you can absolutely go now. The nurse will be in shortly to get the tests started. I’ll review the results as soon as they come back and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them, likely in a week or so. Thank you for coming in, Blain. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness before your follow-up appointment. It’s always better to be safe. .
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Goodbye.
