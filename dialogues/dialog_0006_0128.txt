DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Gorga, is it? Yes. Well, it’s my joints, you see. They’re…stiff. Mostly in the mornings. It takes a while to get moving, like an old rusty gate, almost. It’s been…a little while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Things aren’t so clear these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, stiffness… mornings, you said. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s…a tricky one. Months, I think? Maybe longer. It’s hard to say. Before my…well, before things, I was always up and about, doing things with the children. Now… it just feels like a long time. I really don’t keep track so well anymore. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Voner. It’s perfectly alright. We’ll figure it out. So, just to clarify, the stiffness is worse in the mornings, and it eases up…how much does it ease up throughout the day?
PATIENT: Yes, mornings are the worst. Definitely. It…it doesn’t go away completely, you know? But it’s…less. Like, I can move around. I work with the little ones, so I have to. It hurts a bit, mostly just aches, but I can do it. But getting started…that's the hard part. It feels…locked, almost. Does that make any sense at all? I'm probably not explaining it very well.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense. "Locked" is a good way to describe it. And where exactly are you feeling this stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, a little bit! But mostly…my knees, you see? And my hands. Makes it hard to…to pick things up, sometimes. And the little ones like me to build things with them, but it’s…slower now. I used to be so quick. It’s not so bad, really. I just get tired easier, I think. Is it my hands, or my knees, or…everything? I forget!
DOCTOR: Alright. So knees and hands, primarily. Any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Let me see… No, I don't think so. Maybe a little, sometimes, but I just thought it was…my weight, you know? I've put a bit on since… well, never mind. Redness…no, not that I’ve noticed. I don't really look at them, if I'm honest. I just try to ignore it and get on with things. Do you think it should be red? I don't know much about these things.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't necessarily need to be red. Just checking. Alright, Ms. Voner, I’m going to do a quick exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to…feel better, you know? It’s hard to keep up sometimes. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Not a bother at all. Let’s just take a look. If you could just sit here on the table for me, and we’ll start with your hands. Now, can you open and close your hands for me, nice and slow?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Slowly, you say? Like this? Oh, that feels a little… tight. But I suppose it always does in the mornings. It’s like… pushing through mud, almost. Is that what you want to see? I hope I’m doing it right. I'm not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Ms. Voner. I’m just checking for tenderness and range of motion. Hmm. A little stiffness, some tenderness on the base of the index finger on both hands. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you point your toes and bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s…a bit uncomfortable. Yes. Like a creaky door. There! I think that’s as far as they go this morning. It’s… a bit sore on the inside of both knees, I think. Is that what you’re looking for? I'm probably not very helpful. I don't want to complain, but… it’s just how it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. Some tenderness along the joint line of both knees, and a limited range of motion. No significant swelling that I can detect. So, Ms. Voner, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some joint stiffness, most prominent in the mornings, affecting your hands and knees. It's difficult to say definitively without some further testing, but it could be osteoarthritis. Have you ever been told you have arthritis before?
PATIENT: Osteo…what-itis? Oh, dear. No, never. No one has ever told me anything like that. My husband, bless his soul, he always took care of these things. I just…ignored it, mostly. He said I worry too much. Is it…bad? Should I be worried? I don’t like the sound of that name. It sounds serious.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Ms. Voner. Osteoarthritis is very common, especially as we get older. It simply means there’s some wear and tear on the cartilage in your joints. It doesn’t mean you need to stop doing things. We can manage it. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work, just to rule out other possibilities, and an X-ray of your knees and hands. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Wear and tear, you say? Well, I have been using them for a long time! Yes, alright. Blood work and… pictures of my bones? That sounds… a bit strange. But if it will help, then yes, do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… how long will it take? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: The blood work is just a quick draw, shouldn't take more than a few minutes. And the X-rays are painless, just a brief exposure to radiation. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll write you a requisition form, and they can take care of everything. It shouldn’t take long at all, maybe an hour or so. Then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend trying some over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with the discomfort. And gentle exercise, like walking, can also be beneficial. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay…pictures and blood work. And pills. Yes, alright. Ibu…what-profen? I think I remember my husband using those. Gentle exercise…walking, you say? I do like a little walk. Yes, I can manage that. Walking and pills and…pictures. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything so clearly. I feel a little better now, just knowing what’s going on. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or…avoiding?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Voner. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a bit. As for avoiding anything… try to avoid activities that cause significant pain in your joints. Listen to your body. And since you're not currently insured, I want to make sure you have access to the most affordable options. There are some programs that can help with the cost of medication, and I can get you some information about those. I’m going to print out a handout with some information about osteoarthritis, exercises you can do, and pain management techniques. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor, about the programs. Yes, I could really use some help with that. These pills can be expensive, I remember. And a handout… that’s wonderful. I’m always forgetting things, you see. Let me see… questions… Hmm. No, I think you’ve covered everything. You've been so patient with me. Thank you again, Doctor Gorga. I really appreciate it. I'll go get those pictures taken now, and I'll see you soon, I hope? .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Voner. I'm glad I could help. Yes, we'll schedule a follow-up as soon as the results are back. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
