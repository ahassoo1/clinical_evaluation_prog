DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um... well, to be honest, it’s a bit hard to explain. I’ve been… not speaking as clearly as I usually do, I think. It’s like my words are a little…slurred, maybe? I noticed it a few days ago. I’m not entirely sure when it started, just that it’s happening now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. “Slurred speech” is a good way to describe it. And it’s been happening for a few days now, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few days. It doesn’t seem to be getting worse, exactly… just… present. It’s difficult to pinpoint when it began, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be, I’m afraid. Does that make sense? I apologize for not being more specific.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Adyn. Don’t apologize at all; it’s common to have trouble remembering exactly when something started. We'll figure it out. So, this slurred speech… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I think… it comes and goes. It’s not always there. Sometimes I feel perfectly normal, and then other times… it’s more noticeable. Like, when I’m tired, maybe? Or when I'm speaking quickly. I really can’t say for sure what triggers it, though. I apologize again; I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, you’re doing just fine. It's helpful to know it’s intermittent and seems potentially linked to fatigue or speed of speech. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – any weakness, numbness, dizziness, headaches, difficulty swallowing, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Weakness… no, not really. Numbness either. Dizziness… occasionally, but I get that sometimes anyway, so I’m not sure if it’s related. Headaches, yes, a bit, but I get those fairly often too. Difficulty swallowing… no, I don’t think so. And no changes in my vision that I've noticed. It's all very… confusing, I’m afraid. I do have Medicare, if that’s relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, your insurance information is helpful, thank you. And thank you for clarifying. “Confusing” is a perfectly valid way to describe it, especially when new symptoms are appearing. Just to be thorough, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now that you mention it… I did have a bit of a cold about two weeks ago. Nothing major, just a stuffy nose and a sore throat for a few days. It cleared up quickly, though. I didn't think it was connected to this, but… maybe it is? I really don’t remember feeling unwell right before the speech started, but it’s hard to say for certain, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is hard to say, but a recent cold is definitely something to consider. Okay. I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your neurological function – your reflexes, strength, coordination, and cranial nerves. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I hope it doesn't take too long, if that's not too much to ask? My husband is expecting me home later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as efficient as possible. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Cranial nerves appear intact. Your tongue is midline. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. No wheezes or crackles. Do you have any history of allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. Not to medications, food, or anything else. I've never really had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My husband always says I'm very… resilient. Though, that might be why I don't remember things as well, come to think of it… I’m just rambling now, aren’t I? Please, ignore me.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all. Resilient is good! And no allergies is excellent. Okay. Given your recent cold, intermittent slurred speech, and no other neurological deficits on exam, it’s possible this is post-viral. Sometimes a virus can temporarily affect the nerves that control speech. However, to be thorough, I would like to order a basic blood panel, just to rule out any other underlying causes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it would help rule things out, then yes, please do. A blood panel is fine. I'm happy to do whatever you recommend. Will it take long to get the results? And… is it covered by Medicare? I apologize for asking, my husband handles most of the finances.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, it's perfectly reasonable to ask about coverage. The blood panel is covered by Medicare, yes. It will likely take 2-3 business days to get the results back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then, or I can call you with the results if you prefer. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if the slurred speech becomes constant, you develop weakness, dizziness, or difficulty swallowing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. Two to three business days is fine. And I appreciate you explaining about the emergency room. I will certainly go if anything worsens. Perhaps a follow-up appointment would be best? That way, we can discuss everything properly. I think my husband would prefer that too. He worries terribly, you see. Would next week work?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Next week works perfectly. Let's schedule you for Tuesday at 2 PM?
PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday at 2 PM sounds wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and your help. I feel much better knowing we're taking this seriously. I really appreciate it. I suppose that's everything then?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything for today. I'll have the lab order sent electronically to the lab near you. They'll contact you to schedule a blood draw. This sheet summarizes everything we discussed today – the symptoms to watch for, the lab order information, and the appointment details. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before then. Have a good day, Adyn, and please take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Panjoj. I will, and I appreciate everything. You've been very kind. Goodbye.
