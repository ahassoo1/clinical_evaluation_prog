DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. Well, it is… difficult to explain. I have trouble… finding the right words. It has been happening for some time now, and it worries me a little. It is not constant, but… often enough.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to take your time. "Happening for some time" – can you give me a rough estimate of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… a rough estimate… that is… difficult. Perhaps… six months? Maybe longer. It feels like a very long time, but the time… it goes quickly, does it not? I do not remember exactly when it started, I'm afraid. It was after… well, after my wife passed.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Sherrell. Grief can certainly affect us in many ways. So, this difficulty with finding the right words started around six months ago, following your wife’s passing. Can you describe what happens when you have trouble finding words?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. It is… like the word is on the tip of my tongue. I know what I want to say, what the object is… but the word… it escapes me. Sometimes, I can describe it… go around it… but it takes… effort. And sometimes… sometimes I cannot find a way at all. It is frustrating, mostly.
DOCTOR: So, the word feels accessible, you know what you mean, but it just won't come out. You've also noticed you sometimes have to describe things instead, and occasionally can't find a way to express yourself at all. That sounds quite frustrating, as you say. Is this happening more frequently now, or has it been fairly consistent over the last six months?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe… it is getting worse, yes. At first, it was only… occasionally. Perhaps once a week, maybe less. Now… now it happens… several times a day, I would say. It does not happen all the time, but… it is frequent enough to be concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s increasing in frequency, from occasionally to several times a day over the last six months. Do you notice any specific situations where it's more likely to happen?
PATIENT: Specific situations… let me see. It seems… worse when I am tired, perhaps. Or… when I am speaking quickly. When I am trying to explain something complicated, it is also… more difficult. Simple conversations… those are usually okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, speaking quickly, and complex explanations seem to make it worse. Simple conversations are generally easier. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. I have been… a little more forgetful, I suppose. Not major things, but… small things. Where I put my keys, or… the name of an acquaintance. But I am an older man… perhaps it is just age.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that, Sherrell. Increased forgetfulness can be relevant. And it's good to be aware of changes, regardless of age. Do you have any difficulty with things like remembering recent events, or following conversations?
PATIENT: Following conversations… no, not usually. But… remembering recent events… sometimes. It is not a complete blank, but… details escape me. Like… what I had for breakfast this morning. Or… what I spoke about on the telephone yesterday. Small things, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some difficulty recalling recent details, but generally able to follow conversations. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, I have high blood pressure, I believe. The doctor has been prescribing me medication for it for many years now. And… I had a heart scare, perhaps ten years ago. A small blockage, but they fixed it with a… a stent, I believe they called it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sherrell. That’s helpful to know. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes, I take something for my cholesterol. A small pill, every evening. And… occasionally, when my arthritis flares up, I take some ibuprofen. But that is only when needed, not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so medication for high blood pressure and cholesterol, and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I do not believe so. I have never had a reaction to any medication, that I am aware of. Perhaps… a slight stomach upset with some pills, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a brief physical and neurological exam. This will just help me get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, that is perfectly alright. I understand. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just follow me over here. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate, and then do some simple balance and coordination tests. Okay, your blood pressure is 145/88. A little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Heart rate is 72, regular rhythm. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… I hear a slight murmur, which we know about from your previous cardiac evaluation. Reflexes are normal. Now, let's do some simple tests to check your coordination. Could you please extend your arms out in front of you, close your eyes, and touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Here… like this? It is… a little difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. It’s a little unsteady, but not overly concerning at this stage. Now, could you please try to walk heel-to-toe for about ten steps?
PATIENT: One… two… three… This is… harder than it looks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. It requires quite a bit of concentration. Alright, you can stop now. Thank you. Based on what you’ve told me, the physical exam findings, and your history, it sounds like you are experiencing some cognitive changes that could be related to a few different things. We need to rule out other potential causes before we can say anything definitively. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 levels, and a metabolic panel. I'd also like to schedule a brain MRI to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your brain. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a brain MRI… yes, that sounds… thorough. If you think it is necessary, Doctor, then yes, of course. I want to understand what is happening. It is just… a little frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherrell. It's natural to feel frightened when you're facing the unknown. But it's important to remember that these tests are simply gathering information. They will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a plan to address them. The blood tests are relatively straightforward, and the MRI is non-invasive. We'll get the results back in a few days, and I'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Sudden changes… yes, I will remember that. I suppose… what could it be, Doctor? Is it… something serious?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Sherrell. There are several possibilities, and it's too early to say definitively without the test results. One possibility is a mild form of cognitive impairment, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including age, high blood pressure, and vitamin deficiencies. Another possibility, though less likely, is early-stage dementia. However, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. The MRI will help us rule out any structural problems in the brain, such as strokes or tumors. We also need to consider other potential causes, such as medication side effects or underlying medical conditions. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and develop a plan to address your specific needs. I understand this is a lot to take in, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you every step of the way. We’ll address this together. Do you have any other questions, or is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. I will… I will try not to worry too much. And I will remember about going to the emergency room if things change.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Sherrell. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns between now and your follow-up appointment. We'll schedule that for you on your way out. Here's a written summary of our discussion and the tests we’ve ordered. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You have been very kind. Goodbye. .
