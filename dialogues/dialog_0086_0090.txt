DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. I believe I’m here for a check-up before a… a surgery I’m considering. Honestly, the details are a little fuzzy. It has to do with… well, improving my appearance, I suppose. I apologize for not being more precise. It was recommended by a specialist, but I don't recall the name at the moment.
DOCTOR: Improving your appearance…right. Well, that’s… broad. Let’s try to narrow it down. What sort of surgery were you discussing with this specialist?
PATIENT: That’s… the difficult part. I think it had to do with my face. Perhaps… lifting? Or something around the eyes? It was presented as a way to… refresh things. It’s terribly embarrassing to admit how little I remember. My husband… he handled most of the arrangements. It's been some time since then. Would it help if we looked at any paperwork? Perhaps that would jog my memory.
DOCTOR: Paperwork is always a good idea. It’s not uncommon to get overwhelmed with details, especially when it involves… elective procedures. We'll find something. But before we dive into that, let's start with a basic overview. Are you currently experiencing any pain or discomfort in your face or around your eyes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. No pain, no discomfort. Just… dissatisfaction, I suppose. A feeling of… things not being as they once were. It’s more of an emotional feeling than a physical one. I do get headaches sometimes, but those are infrequent and I usually just take something for them. I don’t think those are related, though. I haven't noticed any swelling or anything like that. Do you think it’s alright if I ask what kind of specialist would normally recommend this sort of thing? Perhaps knowing the specialty would help me remember the name.
DOCTOR: Well, given your description… it sounds like you likely consulted with a plastic surgeon. They’re the specialists who handle procedures aimed at improving cosmetic appearance. And while headaches aren't directly related to a cosmetic consultation, we should still document them. How often would you say you get these headaches?
PATIENT: A plastic surgeon… yes, that sounds right. Thank you. The headaches… hmm. Not regularly. Maybe once or twice a month? They’re usually mild, and over-the-counter pain relievers help. They don't last very long, usually just a few hours. I wouldn’t say they disrupt my daily life. Is it important that I mention anything else about them? Like, if I feel stressed when they happen, or if anything specific triggers them? Perhaps we really should look at that paperwork...
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly be a factor in tension headaches, so yes, it's good to be aware of any potential triggers. But for now, let's focus on the reason you’re here. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any underlying medical conditions we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. Nothing I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything. As for medical conditions… I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up completely. And I’m slightly anemic, but my doctor monitors that, and I take iron supplements as needed. Otherwise, I’m generally quite healthy! I try to eat well and get plenty of rest. And my insurance is up to date, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay. Anemia is good to know. And it's always helpful to confirm insurance. Now, Ms. Brightful, before we dig into potential surgical options, I need to get a better understanding of what you hope to achieve with this procedure. Can you be more specific about what bothers you about your appearance?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult to articulate. It’s not one specific thing, Doctor. It's more of a general…tiredness, I suppose. A loss of…youthfulness. My skin feels…less firm, and I’ve noticed some wrinkles around my eyes and mouth. I suppose I just want to look…refreshed. To look more like…myself, from a few years ago. It's silly, I know. But it’s important to me. I don’t want to look drastically different, just…better. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Brightful. Many people feel that way. And it’s my job to understand your expectations. However, "refreshed" is very subjective. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds…sensible. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary. Where would you like me to start? Is there anything I should prepare for? I apologize for being so…vague. It's just…everything feels a bit distant.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize. We’ll get there. Please, have a seat. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’d like to take a look at your skin, focusing on the areas you mentioned – around your eyes and mouth. I’ll also assess the overall texture and elasticity of your skin. It's a standard examination, nothing to worry about. If you don’t mind changing into a gown, we can begin.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’ll be just a moment. Thank you for being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: Whenever you’re ready, Ms. Brightful.
PATIENT: I apologize for the delay. It's been…some time since I’ve done this. I’m ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize. Please, have a seat. Skin turgor is slightly diminished, consistent with age. Some fine lines and wrinkles present around the eyes and mouth. No obvious lesions or areas of concern. Overall skin condition is fair, with expected signs of aging. Capillary refill is within normal limits. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I do hope everything is alright. I haven't felt any particular problems, but I suppose that's why I'm here. Is there anything I should be doing, like holding my breath, or…anything at all?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Auscultation and palpation unremarkable. Everything appears normal so far. However, given your history of anemia, I'd like to order a complete blood count to assess your iron levels. It’s just a routine precaution.
PATIENT: That sounds…sensible. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. A blood test is no trouble at all. Do you think…do you think I’m a good candidate for this surgery, Doctor? Based on what you’ve seen so far? I understand if you need more information, or if it's too soon to say.
DOCTOR: That’s a complex question, Ms. Brightful. Based on this brief examination, your overall health appears stable enough to consider a cosmetic procedure. However, being “healthy enough” isn’t the only factor. You mentioned you wanted to look "refreshed," but your expectations need to be realistic. It’s crucial to understand the potential risks, benefits, and limitations of any procedure. And frankly, it sounds like you haven’t given much thought to those details. Before we proceed any further, I need to understand exactly what you hope to achieve, and what you're prepared to accept. Do you have any photographs of how you looked in the past, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh… photographs. I… I hadn’t thought of those. My husband… he had some, I believe. But… Everything is packed away, Doctor. I haven't… I haven't been able to bring myself to go through them. Perhaps it’s best if we just…focus on what’s possible now? I just want to look a little…better. I don’t need to look like I did before. Just…not so tired. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Very well. In that case, Ms. Brightful, I’m going to order that blood work. And I’m going to recommend a consultation with a qualified therapist. You mentioned feeling emotionally distressed, and it’s crucial to address those feelings before undergoing any elective procedure. We need to ensure you’re making this decision for the right reasons. And frankly, I'm not comfortable proceeding until we've explored that further. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… a therapist? I… I hadn’t expected that. I understand you want what’s best for me, Doctor. And I appreciate your concern. But… I just want to look a little better. Is that so much to ask? Perhaps…perhaps I could just think about the therapist, and we could focus on the blood work for now? I promise I’ll consider it. But I really just want to get this over with, if possible.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, I understand your frustration. However, as a physician, my priority is your well-being, both physical and emotional. Undergoing a cosmetic procedure while emotionally vulnerable is simply irresponsible. I will not proceed with any further evaluation or testing until you agree to schedule a consultation with a therapist. That is my final decision. I suggest you take some time to consider your options. And frankly, I recommend you discuss this with your husband. Perhaps he can provide some much-needed support. I wish you all the best. .
