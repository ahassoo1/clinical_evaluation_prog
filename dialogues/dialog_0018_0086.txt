DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, like we discussed. I'm Kahrin, by the way. Let's just get straight to it if that's okay? I have things I need to do today.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kovtun. Efficiency is appreciated. Just to confirm, you are here today regarding the lab results from your recent blood work and urine analysis, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Blood and urine. Anything weird show up, you can just tell me straight. No need to beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Kovtun. I understand you prefer a direct approach. Let’s review the findings together. Your complete blood count was within normal limits, which is reassuring. However, your urine analysis did show some elevated protein levels, and a small amount of blood was detected. To clarify, have you experienced any symptoms such as swelling in your ankles or feet, changes in your urination – perhaps more frequent trips to the bathroom, or difficulty urinating – or any flank pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. Elevated protein and a little blood… Okay. No, nothing like that. No swelling, no changes in how often I pee, and definitely no pain. I haven’t even noticed anything different, honestly. That's why I was surprised when they called about needing to discuss the results. Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you haven’t noticed any symptoms, Ms. Kovtun. Elevated protein in the urine, or proteinuria, and the presence of blood, or hematuria, can indicate a number of things. It doesn’t necessarily mean something serious, but it does warrant further investigation to determine the cause. Some possible causes include a urinary tract infection, kidney stones, or, less commonly, a kidney problem. It could even be related to strenuous exercise, although you didn't mention any recent intense activity. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a repeat urine analysis, and also a 24-hour urine collection to measure the protein levels more accurately. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… a repeat test and the… 24-hour thing. Yeah, alright. Fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. What exactly is involved in the 24-hour collection? I've never done that before. And… is it expensive? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your concerns, and I will explain everything as clearly as possible. The 24-hour urine collection involves collecting every drop of urine you produce over a 24-hour period. The laboratory will provide you with a special container and instructions. You'll start by emptying your bladder first thing in the morning and discarding that urine. Then, you collect all subsequent urine in the container for the next 24 hours, keeping it refrigerated. It's important to collect every instance, even overnight. As for the cost, without insurance, the repeat urine analysis is approximately $75, and the 24-hour collection is around $150. I will have the lab draw a basic metabolic panel as well, which is $40, to check your kidney function. We can discuss payment options with our billing department. Before we proceed, do you have any history of kidney problems, urinary tract infections, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never had any kidney problems, haven't had a UTI since I was a kid, and definitely no diabetes. As for the collecting… all of it, even overnight? That sounds… inconvenient. But alright, I guess. $75, $150, $40… okay. So total $265, right? Can I at least get a better idea of why you want to do all this? What are we looking for, exactly? Just a general idea is fine.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Ms. Kovtun, the total would be $265. I understand your concern about the inconvenience, and we will provide you with clear instructions to make the collection as manageable as possible. To answer your question, we are investigating the source of the protein and blood in your urine. The combination of these findings suggests potential damage to the kidneys' filtering units, called glomeruli. It could be an early sign of a kidney problem, such as glomerulonephritis, but it could also be caused by other things, like an infection. The 24-hour urine collection will help us quantify the amount of protein being lost, which will give us a better understanding of the severity of the issue. The BMP will help assess how well your kidneys are currently functioning. To rule out other possibilities, I would also like to check your blood pressure, and perform a brief physical examination, including checking for swelling in your legs and feet, and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay…glomeruli…right. So you’re checking for kidney problems, basically? And the blood pressure check and listening… yeah, alright, fine. Do what you need to do. The quicker we figure this out, the better. I really don't have time to be running back and forth for tests if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Kovtun. We’ll do our best to gather as much information as possible during this visit to minimize the need for further appointments. First, let me check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is within the normal range. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound clear, and I don’t detect any swelling in your legs or feet, which is a good sign. Given your blood pressure and the physical exam findings, I’m not overly concerned about acute kidney injury. However, the elevated protein and blood in the urine still warrant further investigation. To summarize, we’ll proceed with the repeat urine analysis, the 24-hour urine collection, and the BMP. I will provide you with the lab requisitions and instructions for the 24-hour collection. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything. Just… give me the papers. I'll get it done as quickly as possible. And… can you just tell me roughly how long it’ll be before I get the results? I'm trying to plan things, you see. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab typically takes 3-5 business days to process these tests. I will have the results sent directly to my office, and my staff will contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any symptoms such as flank pain, fever, decreased urination, or swelling, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
