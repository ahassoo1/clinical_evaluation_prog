DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I'm Dr. TodoroVICH. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… it’s rather inconvenient to be here. I have a very busy schedule. But, well, things haven't been… right. My vision, it's… gone blurry, and the hearing… it’s fading. It just happened rather suddenly, you see. I don’t have time for this, frankly.
DOCTOR: Right. “Suddenly” is a bit vague, Ms. Julie. Can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor, do you really need a precise date? It was… within the last few days, I suppose. A week, perhaps? It's all rather muddled. I haven't been keeping a calendar of my ailments, you know. I simply noticed it when I was trying to read… a very important document. And then the sounds… muffled. It's most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Really, Doctor. I haven’t been… straining my eyes, if that’s what you’re implying. I lead a perfectly normal life. Perhaps it’s the lighting in my home? Though I doubt it. Everything is quite… tasteful. It simply is. I haven’t changed anything, and I certainly haven’t been exposed to anything… unpleasant. It’s a mystery, truly. A most inconvenient mystery.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Julie, to help me understand what’s going on, I’m going to need a bit more information, even if things seem to have come on suddenly. Let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medical history? Good heavens. As if I'd be here if I had a litany of problems! I assure you, Doctor, I take excellent care of myself. A little… fatigue, perhaps. But that's simply the stress of managing everything. I did have a… disagreement with my ex-husband, a terribly unpleasant man, but I hardly think that would affect my eyesight. As for other conditions… no, nothing of any consequence. Really. I’m a very healthy woman, all things considered. Though, this is… quite bothersome. Do you have any idea what could be causing this? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Certainly not! I find hospitals… rather common. And surgeries… well, a minor procedure on my hand years ago. A silly thing, really. A ganglion cyst. But it was quickly resolved. A perfectly competent surgeon, though rather lacking in… social graces. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been quite fortunate with my health. This… this is most unusual. I simply cannot abide a prolonged illness. It's simply not done.
DOCTOR: Alright. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family? A… complicated subject. My mother had some… digestive issues, I believe. And my brother… well, he wasn’t very careful with his diet. Not terribly relevant, I assure you. There wasn’t any… predisposition to anything of this nature. We are a rather… refined family. We don’t typically suffer from… ailments. Though my aunt Beatrice did have a touch of arthritis, late in life. But that was simply… old age. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t see what any of this has to do with my current situation. Are you any closer to a diagnosis? I have a very important appointment later.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Heavens, no! I pride myself on maintaining a natural… equilibrium. I occasionally take a… digestive biscuit, if I'm feeling particularly… unsettled. But that’s hardly a medication. Vitamins… perhaps a multi-vitamin, occasionally. But I can’t recall the brand. It was recommended by… someone. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very healthy woman. I don’t need medications. Are we getting anywhere with this? I truly cannot afford to waste an entire afternoon on this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Before we proceed, I need to ask about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, Doctor, I find the very notion… common. I haven’t the slightest idea. Perhaps to… dust? Though that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I do avoid shellfish, purely a matter of… taste. But that's hardly relevant. I’ve always been rather… resilient. And I certainly haven’t had any… reactions to anything. Really. Are you quite certain you can help me, Doctor? I’m beginning to suspect this is a waste of my time. I have a luncheon with… important people.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie. Just to be thorough, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a simple check of your vision and hearing, and perhaps a brief neurological assessment. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An… examination? Really, Doctor? Is that truly necessary? I assure you, I’m perfectly fine. It’s simply a… temporary inconvenience. But if you insist… though I do hope it won't be too… undignified. And please be gentle. I have… delicate sensibilities. And do hurry. I have a luncheon. A very important luncheon. Do you have a comfortable chair? This one is rather… hard.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Please, have a seat. We’ll start with your vision. Could you please look straight ahead?
PATIENT: Very well. But I must warn you, Doctor, I have rather discerning taste. I expect a proper explanation for all of this. And I do hope this won’t ruin my makeup. It's quite expensive, you know. Proceed, if you must. But be quick. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie, please read the letters on this chart, starting with your right eye. Just read the smallest line you can make out clearly. And please, don't strain. Okay. And now the left eye.
PATIENT: E… P… T… F… Oh, honestly, these letters are terribly small. And blurry! I can barely see a thing. This is ridiculous. Now, the other eye… F… P… T… No, I can’t make them out. This is simply preposterous! Are you certain this chart is properly illuminated? It’s quite… drab. And my eyes are rather sensitive, you know. This is proving to be a most unpleasant experience. Are you any closer to a diagnosis? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm just going to take a quick look in your ears to check your hearing. This won't be uncomfortable. Just tilt your head slightly to the side. Okay. Your ear canals appear clear. However, there is a slight… diminished response to the tuning fork test. We'll need to do further testing to determine the extent of any hearing loss. Reduced visual acuity in both eyes, diminished response to tuning fork test.
PATIENT: Diminished… response? What does that even mean? Are you suggesting I’m going deaf? This is absurd! I hear perfectly well, thank you very much. I heard everything you said, perfectly clearly. Though, I must admit, I have been having a little trouble with the… higher frequencies lately. My bridge partner’s voice is rather shrill, you know. But that’s hardly a medical condition, is it? Are you certain you're a competent doctor? This is all rather… unsettling. And I have a luncheon. A very important luncheon with… influential people. I simply haven’t the time for… prolonged examinations.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your concerns. While your ear canals appear clear, the diminished response to the tuning fork test suggests there may be some hearing loss. Similarly, the reduced visual acuity warrants further investigation. To get a more accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan, I recommend a consultation with an ophthalmologist and an audiologist. They can conduct more specialized tests to determine the cause of your vision and hearing changes. I can provide you with referrals to specialists in the area. I'm also going to order a complete blood count and a thyroid panel just to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms.
PATIENT: An… ophthalmologist and an audiologist? More appointments? More examinations? Honestly, Doctor, this is simply preposterous! I haven't the time for all of this! And a… blood count? I haven’t been unwell! I simply want to know what's causing this and have it fixed. Quickly. I have a very important luncheon, you know. And I absolutely must look and feel my best. Is there nothing you can do immediately? Perhaps a… magic eye drop? Or a… hearing aid? I simply cannot attend this luncheon looking… diminished. And the influential people… they are terribly judgmental. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather inconvenient. Perhaps I should just call my ex-husband. He always had a solution for everything, though I wouldn't admit that to anyone.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration, but a proper diagnosis requires thorough testing. I cannot provide a treatment without knowing the underlying cause of your symptoms. Magic eye drops and a hearing aid would simply mask the problem, and could potentially delay a more serious diagnosis. I strongly recommend you follow up with the specialists I’ve referred you to. They will be able to conduct the necessary tests and provide you with a personalized treatment plan. I will also order the blood work to rule out any other potential causes. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your vision or hearing, such as complete loss of vision or sudden severe hearing loss, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Very well. But I must warn you, Doctor, if this causes me to miss my luncheon, I will hold you personally responsible. It’s a terribly important event, you know. The influential people… they simply must be impressed. And I absolutely must look my best. And frankly, I doubt these specialists will be able to solve anything quickly. They always take forever, and they’re terribly expensive. But I suppose I have no choice. No, I don’t think I have any further questions. Just… hurry up with the blood work, and please make sure the specialists are… competent. And efficient. And I expect a full report. Immediately. And please don’t tell anyone about this. It would be terribly embarrassing. .
