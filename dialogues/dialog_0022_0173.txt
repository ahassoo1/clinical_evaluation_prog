DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, well, I've just been getting these chills, you know? Like, not a fever, just…cold. It's been happening on and off for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills coming and going for a few days. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about these chills?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. It’s hard to explain… They just sort of…come over me. Like a sudden coldness, even when it's warm in here. And then they go away. It doesn't really seem to be connected to anything, like being outside or anything. It just…happens. They aren’t bad bad, just uncomfortable, you know? Like needing an extra sweater.
DOCTOR: Right, so sudden onset of coldness, not related to environmental factors, and generally mild – feeling like you need an extra layer. Do you notice anything else happening when you get these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm...that's a good question. Let me think. No, not really. I don't get any aches or anything. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but honestly, I'm usually pretty tired, so it's hard to say if that's related. No cough, no sore throat, no stuffy nose…just the chills. And then they're gone. It's weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms like aches, cough, or sore throat. Just the chills and sometimes a bit of fatigue, which you already experience normally. And these chills have been happening for how many days now?
PATIENT: Around…three or four days, I think? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started. It was after I went to visit my sister, but she felt fine, so I don’t think I caught anything from her. I just noticed it started sometime after that weekend.
DOCTOR: Three or four days, starting after a visit with your sister who was feeling well. Good to know. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all, even if they don't seem directly related to the chills?
PATIENT: Um... let me think… Oh! Actually, yeah, now that you mention it, my appetite has been a little off. Not that I’m not eating, just…not as hungry as usual. And maybe a little bit of a headache, but it’s really mild. Like, I don’t even need to take anything for it. It comes and goes, like the chills, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a decreased appetite and mild, intermittent headaches also present. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you are currently being treated for?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. I mean, I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but I lost some weight and it went down, so my doctor said I was good. Nothing else, really. No diabetes or anything like that. Just…the blood pressure, which is fine now. I think. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of high blood pressure that resolved with weight loss, but currently no active medical conditions. And you haven't seen a doctor recently. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. I'm pretty healthy, all things considered. My mom always said I was lucky. I just don't understand these chills. They're just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Good to know. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um, my grandmother on my mom’s side had…arthritis, I think? And my dad’s brother has heart problems, but he didn’t take care of himself. Smoked a lot and didn't eat well. Other than that… not really. Nothing major that I know of. It’s not something we talk about a lot in my family, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a family history of arthritis in your maternal grandmother and heart problems in your paternal uncle, related to lifestyle factors. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never smoked a day in my life. I don't really drink alcohol either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a blue moon. And definitely no drugs. I just…don't do that sort of thing. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables. And I walk whenever I can. I'm not a huge fan of the gym.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no drug use. You maintain a generally healthy lifestyle with a diet rich in vegetables and regular walking. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat whatever. I mean, I don’t like olives, but that’s not an allergy! Seriously, no allergies. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not anything at all. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I mean, I’ll take something for a headache if it’s really bad, like ibuprofen or something, but that’s it. No regular medications, no vitamins, no supplements. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. That simplifies things. Alright, Jailenne, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, take your temperature, and check your blood pressure. Then I’ll take a look at your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Sounds good. Go ahead. I hope it’s nothing serious. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is also normal. Now, let me just take a quick look at your throat… Your throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. And your ears look normal as well. Everything seems to be… unremarkable so far. Now, do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No pain at all, anywhere. Honestly, that’s the weirdest part. Everything feels fine, besides the chills. It’s just… frustrating. Is there anything else you can check? Or…what do we do now? I’m really not sure what’s causing this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jailenne. Everything is unremarkable with the physical exam, which makes it a little more challenging. Given your symptoms – the intermittent chills, mild fatigue, decreased appetite, and no other significant findings – and the fact that the exam is normal, it’s unlikely to be a serious infection. However, we should still rule out some possibilities. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to get a better picture of your overall health and see if there are any subtle abnormalities. These are just standard blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests are fine. I just want to find out what’s going on. Hopefully they’ll show something. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and trying to figure this out.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, I'll write the orders for the CBC and BMP now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take the blood samples right away. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, make sure you’re getting enough rest and staying hydrated. You can continue to eat a healthy diet, as you’ve been doing. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe headache, body aches, or difficulty breathing – please contact the clinic immediately. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor. Rest, hydration, healthy diet… and watch out for those other symptoms. I can do that. I’ll go to the lab now and get the blood work done. I really appreciate your help. I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. The nurse will give you the lab requisitions as you head out. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, Jailenne, and I hope you start feeling better soon.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thanks again. Bye bye!
