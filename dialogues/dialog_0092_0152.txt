DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter from my regular doctor… said my cholesterol was a little high. Hyper… something. I don’t remember exactly what she called it, but she wanted me to come talk to someone about it. I mostly just want to understand what that means, you know? And what, if anything, I need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It sounds like your primary care physician has identified some elevated cholesterol levels and would like us to discuss them further. “Hyperlipidemia” is the term she likely used – it simply means you have higher than optimal levels of cholesterol in your blood. I see here that your cholesterol was checked on July 15th. Let’s take a look at those numbers. Before we do, though, can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, hyperlipidemia. That’s a mouthful! Well, overall… I think I’m pretty healthy. I try to walk most days, about thirty minutes. I eat… reasonably well, I suppose. Not a lot of fried food. I don’t smoke, never have. I’ve had a few aches and pains, you know, getting older… but nothing serious. Medicare covers everything, thankfully. I’m single, live alone, so it's mostly just me looking after things.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you’re active and mindful of your diet, Ms. Geho. Those are both excellent habits. And it’s good to know you have Medicare coverage. Okay, looking at these results… your total cholesterol is 245, your LDL cholesterol – that’s often called the “bad” cholesterol – is 160, your HDL cholesterol – the “good” cholesterol – is 45, and your triglycerides are 150. Do any of those numbers mean anything to you, or should I explain them a little further?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, numbers… they all sort of blur together! No, I don't really know what any of that means, Doctor. I’m sorry, I’m not very good with medical stuff. Could you explain it, please? Just… the important bits. Like, is it bad bad? Or just… needs watching?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no need to apologize at all, Ms. Geho. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed by medical jargon. That’s what I’m here for. Essentially, cholesterol is a waxy substance that your body needs to build healthy cells, but too much of it can build up in your arteries and increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. Your total cholesterol is a bit elevated – we generally want that below 200. The LDL cholesterol is the main culprit, and yours is also a little high – ideally, we’d like to see that below 100. HDL cholesterol is a good thing – it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries – and yours is at a reasonable level, but could be better. Your triglycerides are also a little on the high side. So, it’s not “bad” bad in the sense that you need immediate intervention, but it does need attention. It’s something we should address to lower your risk of future problems. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Okay, that… that helps a little. So, high LDL is the one to worry about? And the HDL is good? Like, I want that number to go up? And the total cholesterol is just… everything combined? It sounds like it’s not a crisis, which is good to know. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. Is it something I can fix with diet, do you think? Or will I need… pills? I really don't like taking medication if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: You've got it exactly right – high LDL is the one we focus on, and higher HDL is definitely a good thing. Total cholesterol is simply a measure of all the cholesterol in your blood – it’s a useful number, but the individual components – LDL, HDL, and triglycerides – give us a more detailed picture. And you’re right to ask about diet and medication. Often, we can make significant improvements with lifestyle changes. In your case, given that you're already active, let's focus on your diet first. We'll aim for a heart-healthy diet – lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats. Reducing saturated and trans fats, as well as cholesterol intake, is important. I’d like to also discuss your family history. Have any close relatives – parents, siblings, or grandparents – had heart disease, high cholesterol, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good. Diet first sounds much better than pills! Let’s see… family history… My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather… he had a stroke, I believe. He was a heavy smoker, though. My father was pretty healthy, actually, lived to be 85. No heart problems that I know of. My brother is… well, he doesn’t really talk about his health, to be honest. So, I’m not sure about him. Is that helpful? It’s a bit of a jumble in my head, trying to remember.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. A history of high blood pressure and stroke in your family does increase your risk, but it's good to know your father was healthy. The fact that your brother doesn't discuss his health makes it difficult to assess that part of the risk. Okay. Given your cholesterol levels and family history, I recommend we start with a three-month trial of dietary changes and increased physical activity. I'm going to refer you to our registered dietitian, Sarah Miller. She can work with you to create a personalized meal plan that fits your lifestyle and preferences. I’ll also give you a handout with general guidelines for a heart-healthy diet. After three months, we’ll recheck your cholesterol levels to see how you’ve responded. If your levels haven’t improved sufficiently, we can discuss the possibility of medication. Does that sound like a reasonable plan to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. A dietitian is a great idea, actually. I could definitely use some help with the meal planning. I try to eat well, but I’m not very creative in the kitchen, to be honest! So, three months of trying harder with the food, and then we’ll check the numbers again. And then we talk about pills if needed. Okay, I can definitely do that. Is there anything else I should be doing, like… special exercises? Or anything I need to avoid completely?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a very proactive attitude, Ms. Geho. Regarding exercise, continue with your walking – that’s fantastic. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. You don’t need to do anything strenuous, but incorporating some strength training exercises two to three times a week can also be beneficial. The dietitian can provide you with some safe and effective exercise recommendations. As for things to avoid, limit saturated and trans fats as much as possible. These are found in red meat, processed foods, fried foods, and some baked goods. Also, try to reduce your cholesterol intake – avoid foods high in cholesterol, such as organ meats and egg yolks . Limiting sugary drinks and processed carbohydrates is also beneficial. I'm going to give you a handout summarizing these recommendations. And I'll send a referral to Sarah Miller, the dietitian, with your contact information. She'll reach out to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all pretty clear, actually. You’ve explained everything very well, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to go through it with me. So, just three months, see the dietitian, try harder with the food… and then we’ll see what happens. Sounds manageable! Thank you again. I think that’s everything. I’ll let you get back to your other patients.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Geho. I'm glad I could help. It sounds like you have a good plan in place, and I’m confident you’ll see positive results. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We are here to support you. Here's the handout and the referral to the dietitian. Have a wonderful day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too! I will. I appreciate your help.
