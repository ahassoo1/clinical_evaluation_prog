DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. Welcome to my practice. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor… Para… how do you say it? It’s nice to meet you. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to, anyway. It just doesn’t… feel right.
DOCTOR: Paraskevopoulos. It's a Greek name, quite common, actually. And thank you. “Tummy feels big,” you say. And a decreased appetite. Could you elaborate on when you first noticed this sensation of fullness, Ms. McConnon?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Greek, you say? My… my husband, he liked history. Maybe he knew it. When did I notice…? That’s a hard one. It feels like… a little while now. Maybe a few weeks? It’s not a sudden thing, not like I woke up one day and… poof. It just… slowly got bigger, and I just didn’t feel hungry. It's hard to remember exactly when it started, you understand? My mind… it doesn't work like it used to.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. McConnon. Memory can be… unreliable as we age. A few weeks, then. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the memory… it’s a bother. Other symptoms… hmm… let me think. Well, I feel a little tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And sometimes… sometimes my ankles feel a bit puffy, you know? Like they’ve been holding water. Does that make sense? It's not always, just… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. McConnon. Fatigue and ankle swelling. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh dear. What does that mean, exactly? I’m sorry, Doctor, I don’t always understand these fancy words. I just… go to the bathroom when I need to, you know? Hasn’t been… different, not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little less often, now that I don’t eat as much, but… is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. McConnon, that’s precisely what I meant. Any change in frequency. It’s good to know it hasn’t been dramatically different. Now, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. I haven’t thrown up, not at all. And no… pain. It doesn't hurt, Doctor. It just feels… full. And uncomfortable, sometimes, especially when I lie down. Not a sharp pain, just… heavy. And a little bit… strange. I just wish I knew what was going on.
DOCTOR: Very well. I see. “Heavy” and “strange” discomfort, exacerbated when lying down. Now, Ms. McConnon, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination if you don't mind. It will involve listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope and gently palpating it to assess for any abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… alright. If you think it will help. I don't mind, dear. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I get a little… tired easily, you know? Listening and… palpating… is that poking? It's alright, just be gentle, please. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McConnon. Gentle is the key. Let me explain what I'm doing as I go. Breathe normally, if you would. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Alright, I'm breathing… This doesn’t hurt… not really. Just… feels a little odd, when you press. Oh! That spot… yes, that’s a little bit uncomfortable. Not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache, maybe? There. Like a heavy feeling, right there. It's hard to explain…
DOCTOR: I see. There appears to be some mild distension of the abdomen, and your reflexes are… within normal limits for your age. I also detect a slight fluid wave. Given your symptoms – the abdominal fullness, decreased appetite, fatigue, ankle swelling, and the findings on examination – I suspect ascites, which is a buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity. This could be caused by a variety of factors, Ms. McConnon. We need further investigation. I am going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal ultrasound to get a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye, should we need it for the ultrasound?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Fluid… in my tummy? That doesn’t sound good. Allergies… let me think. I don’t think so. I haven’t taken much medicine in years, Doctor. Maybe… maybe a rash once, when I was a little girl, from some cream? But that was a long time ago. I don’t remember what it was. I just try to avoid taking pills if I can. What does the… ultrasound do, exactly? Is it safe? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: A rash from childhood is unlikely to be relevant, Ms. McConnon. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the organs in your abdomen. It’s completely painless and non-invasive. There is no radiation involved, so it's very safe. It will help us determine the cause of the fluid buildup. We’ll need to rule out several possibilities, including liver disease, heart failure, and even certain types of cancer. I want to be thorough. Do you have any family history of liver problems, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… less scary, if it doesn’t hurt. No pills… that’s good. Family history… hmm. My mother… she was always tired. She had trouble breathing, I think. Maybe heart problems? I don’t really remember, it was a long time ago. And… my brother, he had some kind of sickness with his liver, I think. But he lived in Russia, and we didn’t see him very often. It was… a long time ago, dear. It's all so blurry now… I wish I could remember more clearly. Does any of that help?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. McConnon, thank you. A history of fatigue in your mother and liver problems in your brother are both relevant. Given your symptoms, physical exam findings, and family history, my preliminary differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and malignancy, although further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause. I’m going to order the blood tests and schedule the abdominal ultrasound for tomorrow morning. We’ll get the results back within a few days. I will also want to check your blood pressure and heart rate today, to get a better baseline. I would also like to ask about your diet: can you describe a typical day of eating for you, Ms. McConnon?
PATIENT: Oh dear, so many possibilities… It’s a little overwhelming, Doctor. But I trust you to figure it out. Diet… well, I don’t eat much these days. It just doesn’t taste good anymore, you see? Usually, I have a little bit of toast with jam for breakfast. And maybe a small bowl of soup for lunch. Sometimes… sometimes I skip lunch altogether. And for dinner… maybe a little bit of chicken, if I’m feeling up to it. But I don’t really have much appetite. It's mostly… just liquids, these days. Tea and juice. I used to love to cook, when my husband was alive… but now, I don’t bother. It's too much trouble. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. McConnon. Your reduced intake, combined with the other symptoms, suggests potential malnutrition, which we will need to address regardless of the underlying cause. Let’s start with those blood tests and the ultrasound. After we have the results, we can formulate a more specific treatment plan. I will have my nurse draw your blood now. Then, we will schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning at 9 AM. Do you have transportation arranged for tomorrow?
PATIENT: Oh, malnutrition… that sounds serious. Alright. Blood tests and ultrasound… yes, let’s get it done. Transportation… hmm. That’s a problem. My… my neighbor used to take me places, but she moved away last month. I live alone, you see. I don’t have anyone to… to drive me. Is there a bus? Or… can someone from the clinic… perhaps? I don’t want to be a bother… but I don't know what I'll do.
DOCTOR: You are not a bother at all, Ms. McConnon. That's perfectly understandable. Unfortunately, we don't typically provide transportation services directly, but let me see what I can do. I will ask my nurse to see if she knows of any local volunteer organizations that offer rides to medical appointments. We can also explore options with social services. In the meantime, let's focus on getting those blood tests done. We'll figure out the transportation issue together. Now, before the nurse comes in, do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials used in medical procedures?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much. You are very kind. Latex… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t had many medical procedures in my life, you see. But maybe… maybe a little bit of itching once, from a bandage? But it wasn't too bad. I don't remember specifically what it was made of. I'm mostly just worried about the tests themselves... I don’t like needles very much. Are they very painful?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. McConnon. Many people feel uneasy about needles. The blood tests will involve a small prick, and there may be a brief moment of discomfort, but it's usually very quick. I will make sure the nurse is gentle and efficient. We'll use the smallest gauge needle possible and apply a topical anesthetic if you’d like, to minimize any discomfort. We'll be right here to support you through the entire process. My nurse, Emily, will be in shortly. She’ll explain everything in detail and answer any questions you may have. Do you have any final questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you so much for being so patient with me. And for explaining everything so clearly. I’m just… a little scared, you see. But I trust you to take care of me. I suppose I’ll just wait for Emily, then. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. McConnon. And rest assured, you are in good hands. We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. Emily will be right with you.
