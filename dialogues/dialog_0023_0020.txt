DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… for a check-up, I think? My… the hospital, they said I need to talk to a doctor. About… everything. It is hard to remember all the things.
DOCTOR: Alright. A general check-up following hospital discharge, you said. That’s perfectly reasonable. It is often difficult to recall everything after a hospital stay. Let’s try to piece it together. Could you tell me what brought you to the hospital in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. The hospital. It was… my chest. It hurt. A bad pain, and… I was very short of breath. Like I could not get enough air. It happened… a few weeks ago, I believe. It was very scary.
DOCTOR: Chest pain and shortness of breath… a few weeks ago. Was this pain constant, or did it come and go?
PATIENT: It came and went, Doctor. Not all the time. Sometimes it was just… a little uncomfortable. But then it would get very sharp, and… hard to breathe. And it went to my arm, too. My left arm.
DOCTOR: Went to your arm… and which part of your arm specifically, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: Oh… the whole arm, I think. From my shoulder… all the way to my hand. It felt… weak, too. Not just pain, but… like I couldn't hold anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And did anything specific trigger this pain – any activity, exertion, stress, or even just a particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I do not think so. It just… happened. Maybe when I was walking up the stairs, sometimes. But not always. It was… unpredictable. Very worrying.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable, alright. And how long did these episodes typically last?
PATIENT: Oh… a few minutes, maybe? Sometimes longer. It is hard to say exactly. When it was bad, it felt like… forever. I would have to sit down.
DOCTOR: A few minutes, potentially longer during severe episodes requiring rest. Do you recall if anything relieved the pain – resting, medication, anything at all?
PATIENT: The nurses… they gave me something. A pill. It helped… a little. And resting, yes. Just… sitting very still. That was the best thing. But it came back, you know? Even after the pill.
DOCTOR: Do you remember the name of that pill, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: Oh… no, Doctor. I do not. There were so many pills. White one, I think. Small. They gave me many different ones. I am sorry. My memory is not good.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright. We can look through your hospital records. Let’s move on for now. Have you experienced any other symptoms since this began – nausea, sweating, dizziness, palpitations, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I felt a little dizzy sometimes, yes. And… very tired. More tired than usual. Sweating… maybe. It was hot, you know? But I am not sure if that was just the weather.
DOCTOR: Dizziness and increased fatigue. And you suspect the sweating may have been related to the weather. Now, regarding your medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or any heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. My husband… he had high blood pressure. I think I had a little problem with that too, a long time ago. The doctor gave me a pill for it. But I stopped taking it. It made me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: You were previously diagnosed with high blood pressure and were on medication, which you discontinued due to side effects. Do you recall which medication you were taking?
PATIENT: Oh… no, Doctor. I do not remember the name. It was… a small white pill, I think? Like the one at the hospital. Everything feels the same now. I am so sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to pull up your hospital records now. It seems we’ll need to rely on those to get a clearer picture. It appears you were admitted for acute chest pain, and initial work-up indicated… possible angina. They performed an EKG, troponin levels, and a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Angina? Is that… bad? I do not understand all these words.
DOCTOR: Angina is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It’s often a symptom of underlying heart disease. The tests they performed were to determine if you had a heart attack or if your heart muscle was being damaged. It appears your troponin levels were elevated, but not drastically, and the EKG showed some abnormalities. They initiated treatment with aspirin, nitroglycerin, and a beta-blocker.
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… frightening. Beta-blocker? Is that the pill that made me feel funny? And the aspirin… I take that for my knees, sometimes. So, is my heart… broken?
DOCTOR: "Broken" is not a medically accurate term, Ms. Benites. It appears you had some evidence of cardiac ischemia, meaning reduced blood flow to your heart. The beta-blocker helps slow your heart rate and reduce the workload on your heart. The aspirin helps prevent blood clots. They also performed a stress test during your hospitalization. The results were… inconclusive.
PATIENT: Inconclusive? What does that mean? So, they do not know what is wrong? And the blood flow… is it getting enough blood? I feel so confused, Doctor.
DOCTOR: "Inconclusive" means the results were not definitive. The stress test did not clearly indicate whether your chest pain was due to blocked arteries or another cause. It appears they have started you on a regimen of aspirin, beta-blocker, and a statin to lower your cholesterol. It is crucial that you continue taking these medications as prescribed. I recommend a cardiac catheterization to get a clearer picture of your coronary arteries and determine the extent of any blockages. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cardiac… what-er-ization? That sounds… scary. Like they put something in my heart? And I am not good with remembering all these pills, Doctor. I forget things so easily. Can I just… stop taking them, if they make me feel bad? I do not want anything put in my heart.
DOCTOR: A cardiac catheterization involves inserting a thin tube into a blood vessel to visualize your coronary arteries. It is the most accurate way to diagnose coronary artery disease. And absolutely do not stop taking your medications without consulting me first. Discontinuing these medications could lead to a heart attack or stroke. It is simply unacceptable. Look, Ms. Benites, I understand you're anxious, but your health is paramount. We need to investigate this further. I’m going to refer you to a cardiologist for a full evaluation and to discuss the possibility of a cardiac catheterization. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? More doctors? I… I do not know, Doctor. It all sounds so… complicated. And frightening. Is there… anything else I can do? Maybe just… take it easy? I do not want any tubes in me. It sounds very painful.
DOCTOR: "Taking it easy" is not a treatment for a potential heart condition, Ms. Benites. We need to determine the cause of your chest pain. A cardiologist is a specialist in heart disease – they are best equipped to assess your condition and recommend appropriate treatment. The discomfort associated with a cardiac catheterization is minimal, and it is far less risky than ignoring a potential heart problem. I’m going to write a referral to Dr. Novak, a highly-respected cardiologist in the area. You will schedule an appointment with him. I also strongly recommend you keep a detailed log of your symptoms – when they occur, how long they last, and what alleviates them. It will be helpful for Dr. Novak. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… understand. I will try. But… I am very scared. And I do forget things. But I will try to write down the… the symptoms. Please… just no tubes. Is there anything else I can do to… not need the tubes?
DOCTOR: There is no guarantee you won’t need further investigation, Ms. Benites. However, diligently following Dr. Novak’s recommendations – lifestyle modifications, medication adherence – may reduce the need for an invasive procedure. I am also going to order a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels and a complete blood count. It’s imperative you schedule these tests as soon as possible. Here is the referral to Dr. Novak and the lab requisition. Do not delay in scheduling these appointments. And Ms. Benites, it’s crucial you understand the severity of this situation. Ignoring this could have serious consequences. Are there any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. I… I hope Dr. Novak is… nice. And that the tubes are not… too bad. I will try to remember everything. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Dr. Novak is an excellent physician. And Ms. Benites, please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Schedule those appointments promptly. Some people simply don't take their health seriously…
