DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. Welcome. I'm Dr. VanOchten. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my blood, I think. My daughter, bless her heart, she said I should come get it checked. Something about needing to know what type it is. I don’t quite remember why, but she was very insistent. It's just… getting old, you know? Things slip your mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Nini. It's good your daughter encouraged you to come in. Knowing your blood type is always a good idea, and can be important for several reasons. Just to be clear, are you experiencing any symptoms currently – like unusual bruising, bleeding, or feeling very tired?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no symptoms, dear. Nothing like that. I feel… alright, for my age, ha! Just a bit… slow, sometimes. Not bruising or bleeding, no. Just… regular old lady stuff, I suppose. Though, I do get a little winded walking up the stairs… but that’s been happening for years, I think. Is that what you meant?
DOCTOR: Okay, no unusual bleeding or bruising, just some shortness of breath with exertion that's been ongoing. That's helpful to know. And you said your daughter specifically wanted you to have your blood type checked?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. She kept saying “blood type, blood type…” Like it was very important. Something about… emergencies, I think? Or maybe for a doctor, if something happened. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. She's a very practical girl, my daughter. I trust her, I just don't remember the details she explained. Do you need me to tell you her name? Perhaps she called ahead?
DOCTOR: Yes, it looks like your daughter, Isabella Nini, did leave a message requesting we check your blood type and do a general check-up. That’s very thoughtful of her. Let’s start with some basic questions, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been told you have a specific blood type before?
PATIENT: Oh, Isabella! Yes, she's a good girl. And no, I don't think I've ever been told. I've had blood tests, of course, over the years… but no one ever said anything about a "type." I mostly remember needles and waiting… not much else, honestly. It was all a long time ago. I worked with rigging, you see, and you don't spend much time thinking about blood types when you're hauling steel! Though, there were a few scrapes and bruises... but they just patched me up, never mentioned any types.
DOCTOR: Rigging, that sounds demanding work! Alright, so no prior knowledge of your blood type. Let's move on to your medical history then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you’re asking things I really don’t recall. I… I think I had my blood pressure checked regularly when I was younger. The doctor said it was a little high sometimes, but nothing that needed… medicines, I don’t think. And my heart… well, it feels alright. Gets a bit fluttery now and then, but that’s probably just my age, isn’t it? I had a good, strong heart when I was working, hauling those beams... I’m not sure about anything else. I mostly just tried to stay active and eat… reasonably. I don’t really go to doctors much.
DOCTOR: Okay, some occasional high blood pressure in the past, but currently not on any medication. And no known heart problems other than occasional palpitations. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… There was that time I broke my wrist, a long, long time ago, falling off a scaffold. They fixed it up, put it in a cast. That was… probably in the 60s, I think? And… oh! When I had my gallbladder out. That was… I suppose it must have been the 70s. I was in the hospital for a few days. But other than that… not much. I was always lucky, I think. Mostly just bumps and bruises from the work. I tried to avoid hospitals if I could. It all feels so distant now.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken wrist in the 60s, gallbladder removal in the 70s. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a little something for my arthritis in my hands. It’s just… a white pill, I think. Helps with the stiffness. And… sometimes I take a vitamin D, because my daughter says I don’t get enough sun. But that’s about it. Nothing fancy. And honestly, I sometimes forget to take even those! I don't really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. Do you need to know the name of the arthritis medicine? Isabella probably knows.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you happen to remember the name of the arthritis medication that would be helpful. But no worries if not. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything over the years! No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I used to get stung by bees sometimes when I was younger, working outdoors, but it just hurt for a bit. Nothing serious. I think I'm alright with everything. It’s funny, my daughter is always asking about allergies. She’s very careful. I suppose I'm just not as sensitive as she is! I can’t think of anything I’m allergic to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mrs. Nini. No known allergies or sensitivities. Now, just a few questions about your family history… Are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a sad question. No, my parents are both gone, a long, long time ago. And my brother… he passed away a few years back. Heart trouble, I think. He didn’t take care of himself like he should have. And I… I never married, never had any children of my own, except for Isabella, of course. She's my whole world. I don't know much about their medical histories, to be honest. We weren’t very close, my brother and I. It's just… been a long time. Do you need to know anything specific?
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, Mrs. Nini. No need to share anything you're not comfortable with. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, would you mind if I just listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all, dear. Go right ahead. My heart’s probably just old, like me! And my lungs… well, I used to smoke a few cigarettes when I was younger, but I quit a long time ago. I’m not sure what you’ll find, but you’re very welcome to listen. I trust you, Doctor. Just let me know if anything seems… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Nini, just take some nice, deep breaths for me. I do hear a slight crackling in your lungs when you breathe deeply. It’s not alarming, but it's something we should keep an eye on. Your heart rate is a little fast, but that could be due to some anxiety or just your activity level. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG just to get a better look at your lungs and heart. And we’ll do a blood test to check your blood type and some basic bloodwork. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. A chest X-ray and an EKG… That sounds… serious. Is something wrong? The crackling… that doesn't sound good, does it? And my blood pressure is high? I thought I was alright. I just get a little breathless sometimes, that’s all. Is it something I did? I haven't been doing much hauling lately, so maybe I'm just getting… weaker. Yes, alright, go ahead and do the tests. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… tell me if it’s something I should be worried about. Isabella would be very concerned.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, it’s good that you're being proactive. It’s not necessarily something to be worried about, but it’s best to investigate these things. The crackling could be a sign of a few different things – like some mild fluid buildup, or just some changes related to aging. The fast heart rate and elevated blood pressure could be related to stress, or other factors we can explore. The tests will give us a clearer picture. We’ll start with the bloodwork and EKG, and then get the X-ray scheduled. It’s a routine procedure. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend that you continue to monitor your activity level and try to manage any stress you may be experiencing. And we can discuss some lifestyle changes that might help lower your blood pressure. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Monitor my activity… and manage stress. Easier said than done, dear, with an old mind like mine. But I’ll try. Isabella will be glad to hear I’m trying, at least. So, blood tests first, then the EKG, and then… the X-ray? Will it take long? I don’t like being stuck in hospitals, you know. It brings back… memories. But if you think it’s necessary, I’ll do it. Just… let me know when to expect the results? And what if… if there’s something wrong?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Nini. We'll try to make this as comfortable as possible. The blood tests will just take a few minutes, and we can get those done right here in the office. The EKG is quick and painless – it just involves placing some sticky pads on your chest. The X-ray will be scheduled at the imaging center down the hall, and it shouldn’t take long at all. We'll get the results back as soon as possible – usually within a day or two. If there’s anything concerning, we’ll discuss it with you immediately and come up with a plan. We’ll start with the blood work now. Let’s get started, and we’ll take it one step at a time. I'll have the nurse come in and draw some blood. Would you like a glass of water?
PATIENT: Yes, a glass of water would be lovely, thank you. One step at a time… that sounds… good. I just hope Isabella doesn’t worry too much. She gets very anxious, that girl. And I hate causing her stress. Alright, blood work it is. Just… try to be gentle, dear. I haven’t had blood drawn in years. It always makes me a little… lightheaded. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Nini. We’ll be very careful. The nurse is very experienced and gentle. And we’ll have you lie down if you start to feel lightheaded. Don’t hesitate to tell us if you’re feeling uncomfortable at any point. Let me get the nurse, and we’ll get this done quickly. One step at a time, as you said. Nurse Ramirez, could you please come in and draw some blood for Mrs. Nini?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. You’re very kind. I suppose it's best to get it over with. I just… don’t like needles, never have. It’s silly, I know. But there you go. .
