DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. It’s nice to meet you. My name is Dr. Andraca. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Andraca. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Oh, it’s just these hiccups. Been going on for… well, a good few days now, and they’re not letting up. Quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for a few days. I understand how frustrating that can be. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to start? They just come and go, really. Not tied to anything specific that I can tell. I eat, I drink, I sit, I stand… hic …doesn’t matter. Sometimes they’re just a little flutter, other times they’re a good, strong jolt. I tried holding my breath a few times, like my mother always said, but that didn't do a thing.
DOCTOR: I see. So they're unpredictable, varying in intensity, and home remedies haven't been effective. Are they constant, or do they come and go in bouts?
PATIENT: It's more bouts, definitely. They’ll happen maybe ten times in an hour, then nothing for a couple of hours. Then bam, they start up again. It’s not like they’re every second, thank goodness. But they’re frequent enough to be… unsettling. Especially when I’m trying to sleep. Do you think it could be something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good to know they aren't constant, and that there are periods of relief. It’s understandable to be concerned when something like this persists. While hiccups are usually harmless and resolve on their own, prolonged hiccups can sometimes indicate an underlying issue. To get a better understanding, let's go through a little more detail about your overall health. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hiccups – anything like heartburn, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your breathing?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all. Just the hiccups. No heartburn, definitely not sick to my stomach, and breathing is normal. Swallowing is fine, too. I eat a good lunch every day, so I’d notice if that was off. Hmm… Actually, now that you mention it, I have been a little more tired than usual lately. But I just figured that was my age catching up with me!
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. And it’s good you’re able to eat normally. The fatigue is worth noting, though – we’ll keep that in mind. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago – must be thirty years now. And I had a bit of a scare with my heart a long time back, but they put a stent in and it’s been fine ever since. I take a little medication for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And that’s pretty much it, really. Nothing major. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, a stent placed for a heart condition, and currently taking Lisinopril for blood pressure. That’s good information. Do you recall any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to love gardening, and I’d get stung by bees occasionally, but nothing more than a bit of swelling. My mother always said I was a tough Fijian girl! I do take a daily multivitamin, and sometimes I'll take something for my arthritis when it flares up, but that's just over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies, daily multivitamin, and ibuprofen for arthritis as needed. That’s good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a bit sad, really. My mother lived to be 95, very healthy right up until the end. My father, though, he had heart trouble. He passed away when I was quite young, maybe in his sixties. And my brother… he had diabetes, and it gave him a lot of trouble. That’s about it, really. Not a lot of serious illness on my mother’s side.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your father and brother. It sounds like heart disease and diabetes run in the family. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone, but I keep busy! I volunteer at the local library a couple of times a week, and I love to read, of course. I try to walk every day, just around the neighborhood, nothing strenuous. I used to be a very good cook, but these days I mostly just make simple things for myself. And I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner most evenings. Not too much, mind you. I don't smoke, never have.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re staying active and engaged. Okay, Mirriam, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if anything feels… odd. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding!
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, although I do hear a slight murmur, which we already know about from your history. Your lungs are clear. When I press on your abdomen, it’s soft, and there’s no tenderness. I don’t feel any masses or anything unusual. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. And your pulse is 78, also within a normal range. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, the prolonged hiccups are likely not due to any serious underlying physical cause. However, because they've persisted for several days, and given your fatigue, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests just to rule out any electrolyte imbalances or other potential issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I'm happy to get some tests done if it will put my mind at ease. Electrolyte imbalances… is that something to worry about? I just want to get back to my reading! These hiccups are ruining my enjoyment.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re willing to get some tests done. Electrolyte imbalances aren’t necessarily something major to worry about, but they can sometimes cause hiccups, and it’s a quick and easy thing to check. It’s just a precaution. I'll also order a complete blood count to assess your overall health and rule out any signs of infection. And because of your fatigue, I’d like to check your thyroid levels as well. I’ll write up the lab orders now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. It should only take a few minutes. In the meantime, are you taking any other medications or supplements that you haven’t mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh! Now that you mention it… I do take a little glucosamine and chondroitin for my arthritis sometimes. Not every day, just when it’s really bothering me. And… let me think… occasionally, if I’m feeling a bit anxious, I’ll take a chamomile tea before bed. But that’s it, really. I'm trying to keep things simple these days. I didn't think those little things mattered.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Mirriam. Even small things can sometimes be relevant. I’ve added the glucosamine and chondroitin and the chamomile tea to your record. Okay, I’ve finished writing the lab orders. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, continue to stay hydrated and try to get plenty of rest. If the hiccups become significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and being so thorough. I'll try to relax and not worry too much until the results come back. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. That’s what I’m here for. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, and try to enjoy your reading when the hiccups allow.
