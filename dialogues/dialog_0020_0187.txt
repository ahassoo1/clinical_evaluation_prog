DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Beinborn. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Beinborn, you say? My chest… feels funny. And my heart… it goes bump-bump-bump too fast sometimes. Blood pressure, they said it was high. Waste of time, if you ask me. Old man, what do you expect?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. “Funny” – can you tell me more about that feeling?
PATIENT: Just… tight. Like someone squeezing. Not pain, pain is for young people. Just… uncomfortable. And makes me tired. Why you need so many details? Just fix it, okay? I got things to do. My wife… she needs help with the garden.
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling uncomfortable and want to get this sorted quickly, and that you have things to do. I do need to ask some questions to understand what's going on and make sure I can help you best. It’s important to get a clear picture. When did you first notice this tightness in your chest?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. When? A few weeks, maybe? Hard to say. Everything feels the same these days. Before the garden started needing so much work, I guess. It's been worse since I started lifting the heavy pots. But I always lift heavy pots! What do you think I do all day?
DOCTOR: So, it’s been a few weeks, and it seems to be getting worse with activity, specifically lifting… like with the garden work?
PATIENT: Yes! Finally. You understand. Lifting, bending, even just… walking up the hill to get the mail. It’s always something. Makes me want to just sit inside all day, but then the garden… my wife would kill me. She likes the garden. More than she likes me, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the chest tightness and the fast heartbeat, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmmm… sometimes I get a little… dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… whooshy. And I get… winded. Easier to get out of breath. Like climbing stairs, you know? Not that I want to climb stairs. Stupid stairs. Old man problems. What else would you expect?
DOCTOR: Alright, dizziness and getting winded easily… and these symptoms happen when you’re active?
PATIENT: What do you think? When I’m sitting perfectly still, everything is fine. Of course it happens when I do things. You ask too many questions. Is this going to take all day? My wife made me kimchi, it's getting cold!
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m asking a lot of questions, Mr. Sobkowicz. I just want to be thorough. It’s important to rule things out. Now, have you had any pain in your arms, jaw, neck or back?
PATIENT: Pain? No! Like I said, pain is for young people. Just… uncomfortable. Tightness. And maybe a little… ache. But pain, no. Don't be silly. What are you, a detective now? It’s just old age, I tell you!
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just tightness and some ache. And you feel it’s likely related to age. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… something. The doctor, years ago, said I had to watch my salt. And my cholesterol… yes, that's it! Cholesterol was bad. But I don't feel sick. I take a little red pill every morning. That's all I know. My wife handles the doctors, mostly. She's good with that sort of thing. I just… do the things. Is this helping, or are we just wasting time?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a red pill for your cholesterol, and you've been told to watch your salt intake. Do you remember what the doctor said about the cholesterol?
PATIENT: No! How am I supposed to remember what some doctor said twenty years ago? He said it was bad. That's it. Bad cholesterol. He put me on a pill, my wife refills it, and I take it. It’s not rocket science! Look, can we just get to the part where you give me something to make it stop? I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s difficult to remember details from years ago. Let me ask about other medications. Aside from the red pill for cholesterol, are you taking anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… oh! The little white one. For my blood pressure. The nurse at the clinic gives it to me. Every month. Small pill. That's all I think. My wife probably knows more, she keeps all the bottles. Don't bother asking me the names, I wouldn’t know. It's just a lot of pills, okay? Old man problems. Everything's falling apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a red pill for cholesterol and a small white pill for your blood pressure. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgery. Years ago. Appendix, I think. When I was young. And… oh! I broke my arm, when I was a boy. Fell out of a tree. But that was ages ago. Hospital… not really. Just overnight for the appendix. And when I had my gallbladder taken out. But it was a long time ago. Nothing lately. Why does it matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix, broken arm, and gallbladder removal. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has had heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Family? My mother… she had something. High… something. Blood. Always complaining about her blood. And my father… he was strong. Never got sick. But he died young. Fell off a ladder. Not related to… whatever we're talking about. They’re all gone now. What good does knowing about them do? It won’t change anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Are you kidding? I haven't smoked in fifty years! And drink… a little soju sometimes. With dinner. Just a small cup. And drugs? What do I look like, a criminal? I'm an old man! Honestly, these questions are ridiculous. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. Thank you for answering my questions. It helps me get a better understanding of what's going on. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just hurry up. My wife is expecting me. And that kimchi is probably getting cold. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. Your heart… I hear a slight murmur, and it does sound a bit fast. Your lungs sound clear. I’m also going to check your pulse in your feet. Pulse is a bit weak. Now, I’d like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I want to do an EKG to look at your heart's electrical activity, and some blood work to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and rule out other issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests. Of course. More waiting. More poking and prodding. Fine. Whatever you think is best. Just… don't take too long. And make sure they don't stick me too much. My wife is going to be furious if I’m late for dinner. And the kimchi. Don't forget the kimchi.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’ll write the orders for the EKG and blood work now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and get you set up for the EKG. It shouldn’t take too long. In the meantime, I want you to avoid strenuous activity, like lifting heavy objects or climbing stairs. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. While we wait for the results, I'm going to prescribe you a low-sodium diet and recommend you start taking a baby aspirin daily, if you’re not already. This can help prevent blood clots. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Aspirin, diet… fine. Whatever you say. Just… don't tell my wife about the diet. She makes good food. I don’t want her upset. And emergency room? Hopefully, it won’t come to that. Just get it done quickly, okay? I have a garden to tend to. Is the nurse coming now?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. I won’t mention the diet to your wife. The nurse should be here shortly. I understand you want to get back to your garden. But please, take this seriously. It’s important to address these issues now to prevent any serious problems. While we wait for the nurse, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just get it over with. I'm an old man. I've lived a long life. Just... fix it, okay? So I can go home. And eat kimchi. That’s all I want. Kimchi. Is the nurse here yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand. I’ll let the nurse know you're ready. I'll be back to discuss the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, try to relax. .
PATIENT: .
