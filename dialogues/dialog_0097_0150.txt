DOCTOR: Hi Angelle, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s about having a baby. And I don’t want any… problems. I’m 51, not decrepit. I just want to make sure everything works before I even bother. Is that clear enough? I don’t have time for drawn-out explanations or unnecessary tests, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear, Angelle. You want to assess your ability to carry a pregnancy to term, and you’d like to be as efficient as possible with testing. That’s very sensible. Okay. To start, have you been actively trying to conceive, or is this more of a preemptive check-up before starting to try?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not yet. I just… I’m divorced, you see. It's a new… situation. And frankly, I don't want to waste my time, or anyone else’s, if it’s going to be a disaster. I need to know now if there’s any reason to think it won’t happen easily. I read online that things decline with age, and I’d rather just… skip the disappointment if that’s the case. It's simple logistics, really.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Angelle. Planning is key, and it's very responsible of you to think through this so thoroughly. It's good you’re being proactive. And you're right to be aware that fertility does change with age. Let's gather some information to get a better picture. First, have you had any pregnancies previously?
PATIENT: Yes. One. A long time ago. It… ended normally. No complications, if that's what you're asking. Look, I don’t need a full medical history dredged up. Just the important bits. Is that understood? I was perfectly healthy then, and I’ve maintained a reasonable lifestyle since. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Yes, understood. One prior pregnancy that ended normally is good information to have. And I appreciate you letting me know you’ve been generally healthy. Just to be thorough, could you tell me about any major medical conditions you do have—like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid issues, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Honestly? Nothing. I’m… remarkably healthy for my age. I have a bit of trouble with my knees sometimes, but that's from years of… activity. Not some debilitating illness. I eat reasonably well, I exercise, and I don’t smoke. Is this going to be a long list of questions, or can we get to the tests? Because frankly, I've got a bicycle to repair this afternoon. A very expensive bicycle.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Angelle, and I want to be as efficient as possible. We will get to the tests. Just a few more quick questions, and then we can discuss what those tests will be. Do you take any medications regularly – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Occasionally, ibuprofen for my knees, but that’s it. Nothing ongoing, nothing serious. I’m not one for filling myself with pills, if you must know. Natural is best, generally. Look, are we nearly done with the interrogation? I have a schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Angelle. Just a couple more. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. I’ve never had an allergic reaction in my life. I’m… quite robust, actually. Really. Stop writing, and let's talk about what you're going to do. I'm not here to provide a complete medical profile for future research. Just tell me what tests, and how long they'll take. That's all I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, Angelle. I appreciate your directness. Based on what you’ve told me, here’s what I recommend. Given your age, we’ll want to assess your ovarian reserve—essentially, how many eggs remain. We’ll also check some basic hormone levels to get a picture of your overall reproductive health. And because it’s always good to have a baseline, we’ll do some routine blood work to check your general health. First, we'll need a blood draw, which will take about 15-20 minutes. Then, we'll do a transvaginal ultrasound to look at your ovaries and uterus – that takes about 20-30 minutes. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Transvaginal? Look, I’m not thrilled about that, frankly. Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn't you just… look at the results of the blood work? I’m a practical woman, Doctor. I don’t need a detailed exploration of my internal organs. Just tell me what the blood work will reveal, and if it looks promising, let’s proceed. If not… well, I’ll know where I stand. I haven’t got time for… invasive procedures.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Angelle. A transvaginal ultrasound provides the most accurate visualization of the ovaries and uterus, which is helpful in assessing their health and identifying any potential issues that might affect your ability to conceive. However, we can certainly start with the blood work. It will give us a good initial picture of your hormone levels and ovarian function. The blood work will assess your FSH , AMH , estradiol, and progesterone levels. These hormones give us a sense of your ovarian reserve and egg quality. If the blood work results are concerning, or if you decide you’d like more detailed information, we can discuss the possibility of proceeding with the ultrasound at that time. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work only. For now. And please, no lectures about the benefits of comprehensive assessments. I'm a sensible woman; I’ll decide what I need. Just tell me where to go for it, and how long it will take to get the results. I've got a bicycle waiting, you see. A very expensive bicycle. And frankly, my time is valuable. Let’s just get this done.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Angelle. I respect your decision. Our phlebotomy lab is just down the hall, room 3B. The nurse will draw the blood samples. It should take about 15-20 minutes. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. Here’s the requisition form. Please take this to the lab. Once the results are available, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. None. Just tell me where to find room 3B. And please, no surprises. I expect straightforward answers and efficient service. I've made my position clear. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Room 3B is right down that hall, on the left. You'll see the sign. And you can count on straightforward answers from me, Angelle. We'll go over the results thoroughly when they're available. Have a good afternoon, and enjoy working on your bicycle! .
