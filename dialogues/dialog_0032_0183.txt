DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, good morning to you too. It’s... fatigue. Just very tired. Been feeling it for a while now, maybe a month? Doctor told me… something about my liver. Not good, he said. I don't remember exactly what he said, to be honest. Old doctors, they use too many big words.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it is often the case that patients don't fully retain all the details. It's quite alright. A month of fatigue, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a month. More or less. It’s not like I’m… collapsing, you understand. Just… slow. Everything feels slow. Like walking through mud. And I don't have the energy to… fix things. The house, you know? Little things. They pile up. My wife, she keeps telling me to rest, but… someone has to do it.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this fatigue been constant, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: Fluctuate? What does that mean? Does it come and go? Yes, it comes and goes. Some days… a little better. Some days… very bad. Like today. But mostly… just there. A weight. Like carrying rocks. Not big rocks, but… enough to slow you down.
DOCTOR: “Fluctuate” simply means it varies in intensity. Right. So, it’s not a constant, debilitating exhaustion. And aside from the fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Debilitating? No, I am not… collapsing in a heap. I told you that already. And other… symptoms? Let me think. My stomach… feels funny sometimes. Not pain, exactly. More like… full. Even when I haven’t eaten much. And I… I don’t really feel like eating, if that makes sense. Everything tastes… bland. Like cardboard.
DOCTOR: A loss of appetite and a feeling of fullness, even with minimal intake. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? You want to know about… going to the bathroom? Is that what you are asking? Really, doctor, you should just say so. My wife, she always says I need to be more… polite. But sometimes you have to ask direct questions.
DOCTOR: Indeed, Mr. Grumman. I was inquiring about any changes in your bowel movements. Specifically, have you noticed anything different in terms of frequency, consistency, or color?
PATIENT: Color? What am I, a painter? I… look at it, I guess. It’s brown. Usually. Sometimes a little lighter, sometimes a little darker. That’s all I know. And frequency… I go when I need to go. What kind of questions are these? It’s… normal. Always been normal.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Do you experience any itching, any jaundice – that is, yellowing of the skin or the whites of your eyes?
PATIENT: Itching? No. And… jaundice? You want to know if I’m turning yellow? Look, I’m Ethiopian, doctor. My skin is… this color. Always has been. Are you suggesting I’m sick because of my skin tone? That’s… rather rude.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Mr. Grumman. I simply need to rule out various possibilities. It’s standard procedure. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Well… the liver thing. That’s recent. Before that? Not much. Old age, maybe. A few aches and pains, like everyone else. My wife… she handles the doctors mostly. She remembers these things. I mostly just… feel it. She said something about high blood pressure, a long time ago. They gave me a pill. I took it for a while.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just the pill for the pressure. Sometimes. When I remember. She keeps telling me to take it regularly. And… sometimes I take something for my stomach, when it bothers me. Something… white. Small pill. I buy it at the store. She doesn’t like when I do that. Says I should ask her.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, it's imperative that I have a complete and accurate list of all medications you are taking. “Something white” is not sufficient information. Do you recall the name of the medication you use for your stomach?
PATIENT: Look, I told you! I don't remember these things! I'm an old man, not a pharmacy. It's a little white pill, you buy it at the store. For the stomach. That's all I know! My wife… she would know. She keeps everything organized. Why are you making this so difficult?
DOCTOR: Alright. We will need to contact your wife to obtain that information, Mr. Grumman. It's crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment. Now, before we do that, let’s do a quick physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I will palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Palpate? What does that mean? You're going to poke me? Look, I don't like being poked. And I have to go. My wife is expecting me. She made a special stew. I really must get home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, a brief physical exam is necessary to assess your condition. It will take only a few minutes. If you are unwilling to cooperate, it will be difficult to determine the cause of your fatigue and provide appropriate care. It's standard procedure, and frankly, quite essential. Please, lie down. We can discuss the stew later.
PATIENT: Look, I’m a grown man! I don’t need to be… examined like a child. I feel tired, alright? That’s it. Just tired. And I don't like doctors poking and prodding. It's undignified. I think I’m done here. I’m leaving. Tell my wife I said hello.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, with all due respect, your refusal to allow a basic examination is concerning. I strongly advise you to reconsider. However, if you insist on leaving without being assessed, I cannot provide a diagnosis or treatment plan. I will document your refusal in your chart. Please be aware that this fatigue could be indicative of a serious underlying condition. Very well. Have a pleasant day, Mr. Grumman. Please do encourage your wife to contact the clinic at her earliest convenience. .
