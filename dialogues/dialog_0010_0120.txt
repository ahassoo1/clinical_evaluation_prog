DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really have time for this, honestly. But my sister insisted. She said I should…get checked out. I want to have a baby, obviously. And I want it to be…easy. No problems. Is that what you do here? Make sure there aren’t any problems? I just…want it to work, you know? I don’t want to be messing around for ages.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Villarreal. It’s perfectly reasonable to want things to go smoothly. Yes, that’s absolutely what we do here – pre-conception counseling and working to ensure a healthy pregnancy. We want to identify and address any potential issues before you start trying, if possible. So, you mentioned wanting to start trying to conceive. Have you been trying already, or are you just beginning to plan?
PATIENT: Planning. Definitely planning. I…haven’t started started, if that makes sense? It's just…well, my husband passed away last year. And I'm…older, I guess. I just want to make sure everything's…working okay before I even bother. You know? I don't want to get my hopes up and then…nothing. It’s a whole thing. Honestly, I barely even remember the last time…well, never mind. It's irrelevant.
DOCTOR: I see. I am very sorry for your loss, Ms. Villarreal. That must have been incredibly difficult. And you’re right to be proactive about making sure everything is in good working order, especially as you consider starting a family now. It’s very responsible of you. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history. Honestly, it's all a blur. I go to the doctor when I have to. You know, when something's obviously wrong. I don’t really…keep track. I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Chickenpox, measles…the usual. Nothing serious. And then…regular check-ups when I was married, but that was…ages ago. I had a really good insurance plan then. Now it’s…private. Honestly, I don’t remember anything specific. Do you need dates? Because I definitely don’t have those. I had surgery once, years ago…appendix, I think. But other than that…I’m pretty healthy. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can work with that. It's common to not remember everything perfectly. Knowing you had your appendix removed is helpful. To clarify, when you say "regular check-ups," do you recall if those involved any specific screenings or tests – like a Pap smear, or blood work?
PATIENT: Ugh, Pap smear…sounds…unpleasant. Honestly, I just let the doctor do what he said to do. My husband always said to just trust them. I wasn't really paying attention to the details, if I’m being honest. Blood work, probably. They always take blood. I just…sat there. I wasn’t really involved in it, you know? He handled all that. I just…got the results, if there were any, and then went home. I really don’t remember specifics. It was a long time ago. Do you need to know? It's just stressing me out trying to recall all this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Villarreal. It's perfectly okay that you don't recall specific details. We can focus on what we can determine now. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. That's…complicated. My mother…she had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother…something with her heart. But honestly, we weren’t very close. And I don’t really…talk to my relatives much. They live in Ghana. It’s…different there. People don’t really share medical information like they do here. It’s…superstitious, a little. And my father…he was healthy as a horse. Lived to be ninety, I think. But honestly, I don't even remember. It's just…a lot of people. A lot of history. I’m not really the one to ask. Is this…important? It feels like you’re asking a lot of questions I can’t answer.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Villarreal. It's completely understandable that you don't have all the details, and you're not expected to. Knowing about your mother's high blood pressure is helpful. Okay, let's move on to something a little different. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, medications. Let me think… No. Not really. I take a multivitamin, sometimes. Just when I remember. And I take something for…my allergies. Just during allergy season. It’s a…spray, I think. For my nose. Nothing serious. That’s it. Honestly, I try to avoid taking anything unless I absolutely have to. I don’t really trust those things. They always have side effects, don't they? Is that important? I mean, it's just a multivitamin and a nose spray. It can’t possibly matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Even those seemingly small things are good to document. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies. Hmm…I don’t think so. I mean, I’m not allergic to anything obvious. No peanuts, no shellfish…nothing like that. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the weather. Or the dust. I live in the city, you know? It’s dusty here. And sometimes I get a rash when I wear certain fabrics, but that’s just sensitive skin. Nothing…life-threatening. Honestly, I think I’m pretty allergy-free. I just…don’t really react to anything. Is that good? It feels like you're looking for problems where there aren't any.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Villarreal. It's helpful to know. Okay, I think we have a good starting point. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, a physical exam? Honestly, I really didn't want to do that. Do you have to? I mean, I’m perfectly healthy. I told you. But…fine. If you insist. Just…make it quick, okay? And…be gentle. I bruise easily. This whole thing is taking way too long. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Villarreal. I understand. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll start with your height and weight, then listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. We'll also do a quick abdominal exam. Alright, let’s start with your height and weight. Okay, your height is 164 centimeters, and your weight is 60 kilograms. Your blood pressure is 120/80, which is within the normal range. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles noted. Your ears are clear, your nose has some mild congestion, likely from allergies, and your throat looks clear. Your abdomen is soft, and there’s no tenderness to palpation. Everything seems within normal limits so far, Ms. Villarreal.
PATIENT: Ugh, good. That’s…reassuring, I guess. Honestly, I could have told you that. I feel fine. Do we have to do anything else? Because I really need to get going. This is taking up my whole day. Just tell me if there's a problem or not. I don't need a detailed report. Just…yes or no. Is there a problem?
DOCTOR: I understand. Based on the quick exam and what you’ve told me, there aren't any immediate red flags. However, to get a more comprehensive assessment before trying to conceive, I would recommend a few blood tests to check your hormone levels, thyroid function, and vitamin levels. It will also be helpful to do a Pap smear to screen for cervical cancer. These tests will help us identify any potential issues that could affect your fertility or pregnancy. It's a standard part of pre-conception counseling and can give you peace of mind. Would you be comfortable with those tests, Ms. Villarreal?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I just want to have a baby, not become a science experiment. But…fine. If it’s standard, I guess. I don’t want to be doing all this for nothing. But…how long will it take? And…will it be painful? I really hate needles. Just…get it over with quickly, okay? And…don’t tell me a lot of details. I don’t want to know everything that’s happening. Just…draw the blood and tell me the results. That's it.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Villarreal. We’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. The blood draw will only take a few minutes, and the Pap smear is generally quick and causes minimal discomfort – you may feel a slight pressure. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. Are you comfortable proceeding with the blood work and Pap smear today?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just…get it over with. I have things to do, you know. Don’t keep me waiting. And…be gentle. Honestly, I don’t understand why I have to do all this, but…just get it done. I’m trusting you to be quick and efficient, okay? No unnecessary chatting, just…blood and a…smear. That’s it. Let’s go.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Villarreal. We will be as quick and efficient as possible. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood and then perform the Pap smear. She’s very experienced and gentle. Nurse Rodriguez, could you please come in and assist Ms. Villarreal with the blood work and Pap smear?
