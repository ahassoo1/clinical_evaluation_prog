DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. Well, I am here for… the phone call, yes? The one they said to check how I am doing. My knees, mostly. They bother me.
DOCTOR: Yes, the follow-up call regarding your knees. Thank you for coming in. “Knees bother you…” Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. They… ache. Not all the time, but when I walk too much. Or if I try to… to get up from chair. It is hard. I used to garden, you know? But now… not so easy. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds very frustrating to have something you enjoy limited by pain. So, the aching is worse with walking and getting up from a chair. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… difficult to say exactly. Maybe… six months, seven months? It started slowly. I thought it was just… getting old. But it is not getting better, you see? It is… steady. Same amount of pain, always. Not worse, not better. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to seven months of steady pain in both knees, worse with activity. And you said it impacts your gardening. Is the pain in both knees the same, or is one worse than the other?
PATIENT: The left one is… a little worse. Not much, but… when I go down stairs, that one is… more trouble. The right one… it aches, yes, but I can usually manage. It is the left one that… worries me. It feels… unstable sometimes. Like it will… give way.
DOCTOR: Okay, left knee is a bit worse and you've noticed some instability, a feeling like it might give way. Have you had any specific injuries to either knee that you can recall?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing I remember. I… maybe a little twist when I was younger, playing volleyball. But that was… long ago. Many years. And I do not think it was serious. Just… a little pain for a few days. Nothing like this. This is… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant knee injuries that you recall. And this current pain is different from anything you’ve experienced before. Have you noticed any swelling in either knee?
PATIENT: Swelling… sometimes. Not much. After I walk a lot, maybe. But it goes away. It is not… always swollen. Just… sometimes, after I have been on my feet for a long time. I put my feet up, and it goes down.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent swelling after activity that resolves with rest. Do you experience any stiffness in your knees, particularly in the morning or after periods of inactivity?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I do. In the mornings, it is… hard to move them. Not terrible, but… they feel tight. I have to… walk around a little to get them going. And after I sit for a long time, same thing. They feel… stuck. A little bit. It goes away after a few minutes.
DOCTOR: Okay, morning stiffness and stiffness after periods of inactivity that improves with movement. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you experienced any pain in other joints, like your hips, ankles, or wrists?
PATIENT: No. Just the knees. Sometimes my back bothers me, but that is… old age, I think. It is not like the knees. The knees are… different. They ache, and they feel… weak. The back is just… a little sore. Not the same.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the knees, with some occasional back soreness. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have… high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take a pill for that. And… I had a little problem with my heart a few years ago, but they fixed it with a… a thing. A little wire, I think. They said it was okay now. Otherwise… no. Nothing else. I have Medicare, so they check me regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a cardiac procedure a few years ago. Do you recall the name of the procedure?
PATIENT: No, I do not remember the name. It was… a long time ago. They put a… a little tube inside, and then… a wire. They said it would help my heart. It did, I think. I do not have any problems with my heart now. Just the knees. They told me it was… a stent, maybe? Is that the name? I am not very good with remembering names.
DOCTOR: A stent placement sounds right. Okay, that’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the blood pressure pill. And… sometimes I take something for pain, when the knees are really bad. But not every day. Just when I need it. It is… ibuprofen, I think. The white one. It helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I have never had any problems with any pills. I can take anything, I think. I have taken many pills in my life! They checked me for allergies when they put the… the wire in my heart. They said I was okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. And finally, do you have any family history of arthritis or other joint problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had… something with her hands. They were… swollen and painful. She could not… make things with her hands anymore. I think it was arthritis. And my father… he had problems with his hips. He needed a new hip, I think. So… yes, some problems with the family. But not as bad as me. Yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis in your mother and hip problems in your father. Thank you for sharing all of that information, Ms. Benites. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam of your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what is wrong with my knees. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could please sit on the edge of the examination table with your feet dangling, that would be perfect. Okay, I’m feeling both knees now. There is some mild tenderness along the joint line of your left knee, and I do notice a small amount of fluid buildup in both, but more pronounced on the left. Your range of motion is a bit limited, particularly with bending, and I notice some crepitus – a grinding sensation – when you bend and straighten your knees. The Lachman test is negative, which is good – it suggests the ligaments are stable. However, the McMurray’s test is slightly positive on the left, which could indicate a meniscus tear, but it’s not definitive. Based on my examination, it sounds like you likely have osteoarthritis in both knees, with more significant involvement on the left. The slight positive McMurray's test suggests there might also be some minor damage to the meniscus, but we'll need to confirm that with imaging.
PATIENT: Osteo… what? Is that bad? And what is a meniscus? Is that what is making the knees… click? I just want to be able to garden again, Doctor. Is there anything you can do?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's break that down. "Osteoarthritis" – often just called "arthritis" – is a common condition where the cartilage in your joints – the cushioning between the bones – wears down over time. It's very common as we get older, and it causes pain, stiffness, and swelling. It’s not necessarily "bad," but it can be bothersome and limit your activity. The "meniscus" is a C-shaped piece of cartilage inside your knee that helps cushion and stabilize the joint. When you hear clicking or popping sounds, that can sometimes be related to the meniscus, but it doesn’t always mean there’s a problem. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order an X-ray of both knees to assess the extent of the arthritis and rule out any other issues. We may also consider an MRI if the X-ray isn't conclusive, to get a better look at the meniscus and other soft tissues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… that sounds scary. Will it hurt? And MRI… is that the one with the… the big machine? I do not like small spaces. But… if you think it is necessary, I will do it. I just want to know what is wrong. And… can you help me garden again? Is there a pill for that? Or maybe… something else?
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray isn’t scary at all. It’s a very quick and painless procedure. You’ll simply stand or sit while a machine takes a picture of your knees. There’s no radiation involved that would be harmful. And yes, the MRI does involve a large machine, and it can feel a little claustrophobic. If you're concerned about that, we can discuss options to help you feel more comfortable, like medication to help you relax, or an open MRI machine, if one is available nearby. As for helping you garden again, there are several things we can try. We don't necessarily need a "pill" for that. There are several treatment options for osteoarthritis. We can start with some conservative measures, like: Physical therapy: To strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve your range of motion. Weight management: If you are overweight, losing even a small amount of weight can take pressure off your knees. Pain relievers: Over-the-counter options like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage pain. We can also discuss prescription pain relievers if needed. Injections: Corticosteroid injections can help reduce inflammation and pain in the short term. Assistive devices: Using a cane or knee brace can provide support and stability. If these conservative measures don’t provide enough relief, we can discuss more advanced options, like surgery. But we’ll start with the least invasive options first. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… good. Not surgery right away, that is good. I do not want surgery. I will try the… the therapy and the pills. And maybe the… the brace. I am not very heavy, but I will try to move more. The garden is very important to me, Doctor. It is… everything. So, first the X-ray? When can I do that? And then… how long before I can start the therapy? Is it hard? I am not very strong.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Benites. We will absolutely start with the least invasive options. I understand how important gardening is to you. Yes, let's start with the X-ray. I’ll write you a referral to the imaging center down the street. They usually can get you in within a day or two. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a personalized treatment plan. As for physical therapy, I’ll give you a referral to a reputable clinic nearby. They will assess your strength and range of motion and develop a program tailored to your needs. It's not about being "strong" right now, it's about gradually improving your strength and flexibility. The therapists are very good at working with patients of all abilities. They will start you slowly and help you progress at your own pace. It may be a little challenging at first, but it will get easier with time. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Just… the X-ray, and then the therapy. You are very kind, Doctor. Thank you. I feel… a little better now. Not so scared.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help ease your worries. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Here are the referrals for the X-ray and physical therapy. And remember, take it one step at a time. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
