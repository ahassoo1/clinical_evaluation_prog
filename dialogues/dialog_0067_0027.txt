DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get on with it. It's this heartburn. Keeps happening, especially when I lie down. And sometimes...well, food just comes back up. It's unpleasant, to say the least. I've had it checked before, years ago, but they didn't find anything really wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re experiencing heartburn and some regurgitation, and you’ve had it investigated previously. It’s good you’ve had it checked before, that gives us a starting point. When you say “years ago,” roughly how many years are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... probably... fifteen years? Maybe twenty. It was back when my Janek was still working at the factory. Before he retired, anyway. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. It wasn't this bad then, though. It was just occasional. Now it’s… well, it’s bothersome. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, fifteen to twenty years ago. And it’s significantly worsened recently. Can you describe the heartburn for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It burns, Doctor. That’s what heartburn does. Right here, in my chest. It’s not like a sharp pain, it's more… a spreading warmth. An awful warmth. And it goes up my throat sometimes. It’s especially bad after I eat, and like I said, when I try to lie down. Makes it hard to sleep, you know? And then the… the other thing happens. It's just… not dignified.
DOCTOR: I understand. A burning sensation in your chest, sometimes traveling up the throat, worse after eating and when lying down, and occasionally causing regurgitation. That doesn’t sound comfortable at all. About how often would you say this happens now?
PATIENT: Oh, don't ask me to count! I’m not a bookkeeper. Let me think... most nights, really. At least three or four times a week. Sometimes more. It’s… disruptive, to put it mildly. Janek complains about it, too. Says he can’t sleep with me tossing and turning. Honestly, I don't understand why I even bother coming to doctors if it’s just going to be questions, questions, questions.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like a lot of questions, Mr. Altine. It’s important to gather as much information as possible to understand what’s going on and determine the best course of action. It helps us rule things out and focus on what might be causing your symptoms. So, three or four times a week, sometimes more. Do you notice anything specific that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers? Well, spicy food, obviously. And tomatoes. Everything with tomatoes. Janek loves his spaghetti sauce, but it just… doesn't agree with me. Coffee, too. I try to limit it, but sometimes I need a good strong cup to get going. And big meals. Definitely big meals. Honestly, though? It seems to happen no matter what I do sometimes. It’s just… unpredictable. I'm a fairly healthy man, aside from this. I eat sensible foods most of the time. It's just... aggravating.
DOCTOR: Okay, spicy foods, tomatoes, coffee, and large meals seem to be common triggers. But it can happen even when you eat a sensible diet. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the heartburn and regurgitation?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I cough a bit at night, a dry cough. Could be the heartburn, I suppose. Janek says I snore more when it's bad. And... sometimes my throat feels a bit scratchy, like something's irritated it. Other than that, no. I don't have any trouble swallowing, no weight loss, no pain when I eat… just this… this persistent burning. Honestly, Doctor, I just want it to stop. I’m a busy man. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough at night, increased snoring, and a scratchy throat. No trouble swallowing, no weight loss, and no pain with eating. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Look, I'm a fairly simple man. I had a bad bout of the flu twenty years ago, and my blood pressure goes up sometimes, but nothing major. Janek makes sure I take my pills for that, of course. Other than that, I've been remarkably healthy, all things considered. I don't go running to the doctor for every little ache and pain. I've lived a good, long life. I just want to be comfortable enough to enjoy the rest of it, without constantly feeling like there’s fire in my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure that's managed with medication, and a past bout of the flu. That’s good to know. And you’re currently taking medication for your blood pressure. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Ugh. Names. Honestly, Doctor, do you expect me to remember everything? Janek handles the pills. He sorts them out every week. It’s… a little white one. And a little blue one. That's all I know. He tells me when to take them, and I take them. I don’t question it. He’s good with these things. I'm more of a practical man, you see. I fix things, I build things, I don’t memorize medication names. Is this really necessary? It's just heartburn, after all.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It's perfectly alright if you don’t remember the names. Knowing they're white and blue is helpful, and that you take them regularly for your blood pressure is the most important thing right now. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No. Never. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but they just set it in a cast. That was it. No surgeries. No hospitals. I’ve always been a strong man. Very resilient. I don’t like doctors or hospitals. They smell funny, and they’re full of… germs. Honestly, I’m probably wasting my time here. It’s probably just something I have to live with. A man gets old, things stop working. That’s just the way it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations other than a broken arm as a child. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, goodness. Let me think. My mother lived to be eighty-five. My father… seventy-something, I think. Janek’s mother had… something with her heart, I believe. But it was a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, we weren’t a family that talked much about illnesses. We just… dealt with things. There wasn't a lot of fancy medical talk. Everyone just got on with their lives. Does it really matter? It’s not like I can change my genes. I’m just trying to get this heartburn under control before it drives me mad.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright if you don’t have a lot of details about your family history. Now, let's talk about your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Janek’s uncle used to smoke, but it didn’t end well for him, let me tell you. No, I don’t smoke. And I rarely drink. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. I’m a sensible man, remember? I take care of myself. I eat well, I exercise… well, I used to exercise more. Now I mostly just do things around the house. Gardening, fixing things… practical things.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don’t smoke and rarely drink. Finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and I’ve taken my share of pills when I’ve been sick. Nothing ever bothered me. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to think this is a waste of time. You’ve asked me a million questions, and I still feel just as awful as when I walked in here. I have things to do. Can we please get to the bottom of this heartburn and get me some relief?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. I apologize if the questions feel excessive, but gathering this information is important to make an accurate assessment. Okay, so no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Altine. Based on what you’ve told me, and the information in your chart, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. This is when stomach acid flows back up into your esophagus, causing heartburn and other symptoms. Your age, weight, and reported triggers - spicy foods, tomatoes, coffee, and large meals - are all consistent with this. The fact that it's worse when you lie down is also typical. The cough and scratchy throat can also be related to the acid irritating your esophagus. Now, I want to do a brief physical exam to listen to your lungs and heart, and feel your abdomen. Just to rule out anything else. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But make it quick. I don’t like being poked and prodded. And please, tell me what you're looking for. I don't want you finding something else wrong with me just because you're looking for it. I'm a perfectly healthy man, aside from this heartburn. I just want it to stop. Hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be as quick and thorough as possible. I'm primarily listening to your lungs to make sure there’s no fluid buildup from the acid irritation and checking your heart rhythm. Then I’ll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Okay, your lungs sound clear. Your heart rhythm is regular, although I’m detecting a slight extra sound, which is not uncommon at your age, and could be related to your blood pressure. I'll make a note of that. Your abdomen feels soft and there’s no tenderness or any masses that I can feel. Everything feels normal there. Okay, everything feels good physically. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, I am fairly confident that your symptoms are due to GERD. However, I’d like to start with some conservative treatment first. Do you have any questions before I discuss treatment options?
PATIENT: Conservative treatment? What does that even mean? Pills? Is that what you're going to give me? Because frankly, I've been through this before, and pills didn't solve anything. I don't want to be on medication for the rest of my life just to eat a tomato. Tell me what you suggest, and then tell me if it's going to involve a lifetime supply of those little white and blue things. And make it quick, please. I’m wasting my valuable time here.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. Conservative treatment means starting with lifestyle modifications before resorting to medication. We’ll see if those work first. I understand your concerns about long-term medication, and I agree, we should avoid that if possible. First, we'll focus on dietary changes. Avoid trigger foods like spicy foods, tomatoes, coffee, and large meals, as you've already identified. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Don't lie down immediately after eating – wait at least three hours. Elevate the head of your bed 6-8 inches. Losing even a little weight can help. If these changes don’t provide enough relief after a few weeks, then we can discuss medication options. We can start with a low dose of an H2 blocker or a proton pump inhibitor , which reduces stomach acid production. These are available in generic forms, and we can adjust the dose based on your response. I will not prescribe medication without first trying these lifestyle changes. And if we do start medication, we'll regularly re-evaluate whether you still need it. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Lifestyle changes. It sounds like a lot of work. But… I suppose I can try. I've always been a practical man, and if that's what it takes, I'll do it. But three hours? That's a long time to wait after dinner! And elevating the bed? My Janek will complain about that. But… alright. I’ll try. Just tell me, Doctor, if this doesn’t work, what then? Will I be stuck with those pills forever? Because frankly, I'm not a fan of being a medical experiment. Just be straight with me. No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question. And I understand your concerns. Let’s be very clear: if lifestyle changes aren’t enough after, say, six to eight weeks of consistent effort, then we can discuss medication. And even then, it doesn’t mean a lifetime commitment. We’ll start with the lowest effective dose, and regularly reassess. If your symptoms improve, we can try tapering off the medication to see if you can maintain control with lifestyle changes alone. We’ll monitor you closely for any side effects. And we can explore other options if necessary, such as an endoscopy to rule out any other underlying causes, or even a referral to a gastroenterologist. I’m not going to put you on medication unless it’s absolutely necessary, and I’ll work with you every step of the way. I want you to be comfortable, and I want you to have control over your health. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No. I think I’ve heard enough questions for one day, frankly. Lifestyle changes it is, then. But if it doesn’t work, don’t say I didn’t warn you. And don't bother sending me home with a pamphlet. I can read. Just… let me go. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I will write up a summary of our conversation, including the recommendations for lifestyle changes. I'll also include information on when to seek urgent care - if you experience difficulty swallowing, severe chest pain, or vomiting blood. Please follow up with me in six to eight weeks to let me know how you’re doing. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Altine. I hope you feel better soon.
