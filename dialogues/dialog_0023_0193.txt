DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Versace. It is very nice to meet you. Well, to be frank, it’s… the gas. Too much gas. It’s been… troublesome, lately. I apologize for bringing this up, but it is a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Troublesome, you say. Yes, well, digestive issues are common. Don't apologize – it’s my job to address these things. Can you tell me more about this gas?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is… reassuring. Hmm, where to begin? It happens… frequently. Several times a day, at least. And it’s… quite loud, sometimes. I worry it bothers people. And the smell… is not pleasant. It began maybe a month ago. I haven’t changed my diet, not really. Just… more gas.
DOCTOR: More gas, consistently, for about a month now, despite no changes to your diet. And you're concerned about the…social implications, understandably. Are there any particular times of day it's worse?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Social implications is a… good way to put it. And it is… after I eat, usually. Within an hour or so. Not immediately, but… soon after. And sometimes… at night, while I am trying to sleep. It is most… disruptive then. It doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Even something simple like… toast.
DOCTOR: After meals, within an hour, regardless of the food. Even toast. That’s… peculiar. Do you experience any abdominal pain or bloating with the gas, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. Not severe pain, but… discomfort. A sort of… fullness. And bloating, yes. My stomach feels… stretched, after I eat. It’s not a constant feeling, only when the gas… builds up, I suppose. And it's not always there, only when it is particularly… bad.
DOCTOR: Discomfort and bloating accompanying the gas, intermittent, related to severity. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – diarrhea, constipation, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. No, not really. Everything is… regular, I suppose. Normal. Not faster, not slower. Not… different in any way. I have not noticed a change in… consistency, either. It is just… the gas, mostly. It is… quite isolated, I think.
DOCTOR: So, normal bowel movements, consistently, despite the gas. Alright. Now, let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not believe so. I have never… reacted badly to anything. I can eat… most things. I have a slight sensitivity to… dust, sometimes. I sneeze. But no allergies to food, or medicine, that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not taking anything. No pills, no creams, nothing. I try to… avoid medicine, if possible. I prefer… natural remedies, if there are any. But I haven’t found one for… this problem, sadly.
DOCTOR: No medications currently. Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all – like irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never been diagnosed with anything. I had… the usual childhood illnesses. Chickenpox, measles, things like that. But nothing… serious. I have always been… relatively healthy, I think. Until… this recent problem. I do not believe I have any… ongoing conditions.
DOCTOR: Alright, no previous diagnoses. And have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been fortunate enough to avoid surgery. I have… broken a bone, once. My arm, when I was a child. But that is the only… medical intervention I have ever needed, really. No other… operations, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Alright. Now, family history. Are there any digestive issues – like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, or colon cancer – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. My mother… she had stomach trouble, sometimes. Indigestion, mostly. But nothing… serious, as far as I know. My father… he was very healthy. No digestive issues that I recall. And I have no… siblings. So, no family history of anything… significant, I think. Just my mother’s occasional… stomach upset.
DOCTOR: Alright, mother with occasional indigestion, no other significant family history. And finally, let's talk about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I do not smoke. I very rarely drink alcohol. Maybe… a glass of wine with dinner, once a month. And I do not use… any recreational drugs. I prefer… a quiet evening at home, reading a book. Very simple habits, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, very healthy lifestyle. Now, Mr. Goodstein, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and feel it to see if there's any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. I understand. Whatever you need to do to… figure out what is going on. I am happy to cooperate. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie down on the examination table. Alright, take a deep breath for me. I'm not detecting any significant tenderness, but there is some mild distention. Your bowel sounds are… active, but normal. No major abnormalities on initial exam. It sounds like we're dealing with excessive gas, likely related to something in your digestive system. However, to rule out any underlying issues, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We can also do a stool test to check for any bacterial imbalances or parasites. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very sensible. Blood work and a stool test. Whatever it takes to… understand the problem. I am happy to do whatever you recommend. Is there anything… I need to do to prepare? And where… will I give the stool sample?
DOCTOR: Excellent. No special preparation is needed for the blood work, just try to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. For the stool sample, the lab technician will provide you with a collection kit and instructions on how to properly collect the sample. It’s best to collect it first thing in the morning, and bring it to the lab as soon as possible. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. They'll explain everything when you get there. While we await the results, I recommend avoiding gas-producing foods like beans, broccoli, and carbonated beverages. We can also discuss over-the-counter options like simethicone or activated charcoal, but I prefer to wait until we have the blood work results to determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… very clear. Fast for 8-12 hours, stool sample first thing in the morning, avoid beans and broccoli. I can do that. And we will… wait for the results. I appreciate you… being so thorough. Thank you. So, should I… schedule a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Yes, please schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today, so we can review the results together and discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, or fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe… that is all. You have been very… helpful and informative. I appreciate your time and… patience. I will schedule the follow-up appointment, and I will… avoid the beans. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Goodstein. Please let the receptionist know you’ve spoken with me. Have a good day.
