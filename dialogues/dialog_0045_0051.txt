DOCTOR: Alright, Darl, good to see you. I'm Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, my niece, she said I should come. Something about… needing to know what kind of blood I have? It’s a bit silly, really. I don't even remember why she wanted that done. Old age, you know. Things slip your mind.
DOCTOR: Right. "What kind of blood"… okay. Your niece is probably referring to a blood type test. It’s not necessarily silly, actually. It can be useful information, especially if you ever need a transfusion. Though, honestly, at your age, unless you've had a major surgery planned, it's not usually a high priority. But, let's get to the bottom of it. Do you remember anything specific that prompted her to suggest this?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. She just said it was important to have it on file, “just in case.” She worries a lot, that one. Always has. Something about… a family thing? Maybe? Oh dear, I’m not being very helpful, am I? I wish I could recall more. It feels like… a distant dream, this whole thing.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright, Darl. Memory can be… fickle. A "family thing," you say?
PATIENT: Yes… something about a relative, perhaps? Maybe someone needed blood once? Or… a particular type was common in the family? It’s all very foggy. I used to work with ropes, you see. Rigging, mostly. Lots of climbing, lots of… well, not thinking too much about blood types, that’s for sure. It was a good life, though. A very physical life.
DOCTOR: Right. Rigging… interesting. Okay, let's try this. Have you ever been told you have a specific blood type before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. I don’t think so. Not that I recall, anyway. I had doctors, of course, over the years. But they were mostly for… aches and pains. Broken bones now and then, from the rigging. They didn't usually talk about blood types. Just… fixed things. I suppose. I really don’t remember them mentioning anything like that. It’s a bit frustrating, isn't it? Not knowing these things.
DOCTOR: Well, the record here isn't very detailed, unfortunately. It only shows routine check-ups and some treatment for a fractured wrist a few years back. No blood type on file. Alright, Darl. Given that your niece is concerned, and we don't have any information, I think it's best we just go ahead and do a quick blood draw. It’ll give us a baseline and put your mind – and hers – at ease. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, yes. If it will help, then I suppose I don’t mind a little prick. I’ve had worse, trust me. All those ropes… you get scrapes and bruises constantly. As long as it doesn't take too long, and I can sit down, that’s perfectly alright. I'm not as steady on my feet as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Sitting is no problem at all. It'll be a quick draw, just a standard lab test. And we’ll get the results back within a couple of days. I'll have the nurse come in and get you set up. While we're waiting, let's just run through a quick review of your medical history, just to make sure everything’s up-to-date. Any major illnesses or surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a lot to recall. Let me see… I broke that wrist, as I mentioned. And… I had my appendix out when I was quite young, I think. A long time ago, though. Nothing else major comes to mind. I was always very strong, very healthy. Kept active, you see. All that climbing… it builds you up. No… no serious illnesses, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. And… I think I had the flu a couple of times, but that hardly counts, does it?
DOCTOR: Right, appendix, wrist fracture, occasional flu. Nothing chronic. Any family history of serious illness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… Now that’s a difficult one. I don’t… I didn’t keep track of those things, you see. My parents… they both lived long lives, thankfully. But I don't remember them having any… specific illnesses. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. But it wasn’t anything dramatic. She just… slowed down as she got older. My father… he was a fisherman. A very strong man. He died peacefully in his sleep, thankfully. No… no major illnesses, as far as I recall. It’s all a bit fuzzy, you know. Old age. Things fade.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my arthritis, Doctor. It flares up now and then. Just a small pill, once a day. Nothing fancy. The name… … Oh dear, it’s right on the tip of my tongue… It’s… white, I think. Or maybe blue? No, white. Small, white pill. I get it from the pharmacy, of course. They know me well there. I suppose I should write it down, shouldn't I? But I'm hopeless with names these days.
DOCTOR: Right. We'll figure it out. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or bee stings?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of! I’ve always been able to eat anything. And I’ve never been stung by a bee, thankfully. I used to spend a lot of time outdoors, working with ropes, you see. Around the sea, mostly. And I never had any reactions to anything. No… no allergies at all. I’m very lucky, I think. Always have been. I’m a pretty tough old bird, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that seems to cover the basics. Just a quick blood draw, then. The nurse should be in shortly. We’ll get those results back to you and your niece as soon as possible. Hopefully, it'll put your mind at ease. Any other concerns while we’re here?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient with my… forgetfulness. It’s just… getting old, you know. Things slip away. I appreciate you taking the time. And tell the nurse not to worry, I’ve had worse than a little prick. Just let me sit down, and I’ll be fine.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse come in now. It was… good to meet you, Darl.
