DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think? Something about… checking for things. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Someone told me I needed to come in for a drug test, but I can't rightly recall who. Is that right?
DOCTOR: A drug test, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s what I remember… vaguely. It was something about needing one… for, uh… something official? Medicare, maybe? I get a lot of papers, you know? It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. Medicare can require certain screenings, though a standard drug test isn’t typically one of them unless there's a specific reason. Let's try to clarify. Do you recall anything else about who requested this test?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, not really. I wish I did. It might have been a phone call? Or a letter… a nice young lady, I think. She was very polite. Honestly, I've been a bit… preoccupied lately. Things just don’t stick in my head like they used to. Is it okay if we just… do the test? Maybe that will jog my memory.
DOCTOR: While I understand your frustration, Ms. Hughston, simply doing a test without knowing the purpose is… inefficient, and frankly, doesn’t serve your health interests. We need to understand why this test was requested. It could be related to a medication you're taking, a recent health concern, or, as you said, something entirely unrelated. Let me check your record here... You've had a fairly standard set of check-ups, nothing particularly alarming. No new prescriptions filled recently. Do you have any family members who could potentially shed light on this?
PATIENT: Family… well, my husband passed a few years back. Didn’t have any children. I have a niece, Sarah, but she lives clear across the country in California. She wouldn't know anything about this, I’m sure. I really wish I could remember! It’s just… frustrating. Maybe it was a mistake? Could someone have sent the wrong paper to me?
DOCTOR: It is possible, Ms. Hughston. Errors happen. However, we can't simply dismiss it without attempting to determine the source. Let me see if I can cross-reference any recent communications sent to you from this clinic. Nothing obvious here. Do you happen to recall anything about the reason why they might have asked for a test?
PATIENT: No, sir, nothing at all. I really don't. I work a lot, you know? Paving and all that. It keeps me busy, but it doesn't exactly leave a lot of room for remembering paperwork. Maybe it was something about a new safety regulation at the job site? We have to be careful with all the chemicals and stuff. But I doubt it… they usually just hand us a pamphlet. I’m just… drawing a blank.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, with all due respect, continuing to speculate without a clear understanding of the request is unproductive. It’s possible someone is attempting to take advantage of you, or it truly is a simple error. Before we proceed with any testing, I need you to think very carefully. Is there anyone – a friend, a neighbor, perhaps a pharmacist you trust – who might have information about this request?
PATIENT: Oh… a pharmacist… now that you mention it… Old Man Hemlock down at the corner drugstore… he's always asking about my health. He might have said something. He’s a bit of a talker, that one. He fills my blood pressure medicine. Maybe he mentioned it when I picked that up last week? I suppose I could give him a call. Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, that would be an excellent first step. Old Man Hemlock, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s him. Hemlock’s Pharmacy. He's been there forever. Let me see if I still have his number… Ah, here we are. I’ll give him a call right now, if you don’t mind. I have my phone right here.
DOCTOR: Please, go ahead. Take your time. I’ll be here if you need anything.
PATIENT: Ringing… ringing… Hello? Mr. Hemlock? It’s Lytisha Hughston. Yes, hi. I was just wondering… do you remember anything about a test you might have mentioned to me last week? A drug test, I think? … Oh. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Hemlock. Yes, alright. Goodbye. Well, that was… odd.
DOCTOR: Odd?
PATIENT: Yes. He said… he did mention a test, but it wasn't a drug test. He said my blood work came back with slightly elevated levels of something… something about iron, I think? And he suggested I talk to my doctor about it. He thought you would have contacted me. Apparently, that's why he mentioned it. He said it wasn't anything serious, just something to keep an eye on. So… it wasn’t a drug test at all?
DOCTOR: Iron levels, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. He said my iron was a bit high. And he thought you would be the one to discuss it with me. He was very apologetic, said he must have gotten confused. I told him I wasn’t very good at remembering things, and he said that explained it. So… all this fuss over my iron?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, it appears that was the source of the confusion. Elevated iron levels can be a cause for concern, though often it's not serious. Let's take a look at these results here… Yes, your ferritin level is indeed elevated. It’s slightly above the normal range. Now, there are several potential causes for this… It could be related to dietary intake, inflammation, or, less commonly, a condition called hemochromatosis. We need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Hemochro… what now? That sounds… scary. Is that bad? I just eat a normal diet, you know? I like a good steak now and then, but I don’t overdo it.
DOCTOR: Hemochromatosis is a genetic condition where your body absorbs too much iron from the food you eat. It’s not usually immediately life-threatening, but if left untreated, it can cause damage to your organs – your liver, heart, and pancreas. However, it’s important to remember that elevated iron levels don’t automatically mean you have hemochromatosis. It could be due to a number of other factors. We need to run a few more tests to determine the cause. I’m going to order an iron saturation test and a genetic test to check for the hemochromatosis gene.
PATIENT: Genetic test? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Will it hurt? And what if it is that… hemochromatosis thing? Will I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, please try to remain calm. The genetic test is a simple blood draw, no more painful than any other test we've done today. As for surgery, that is rarely necessary. If you do have hemochromatosis, the treatment is typically regular phlebotomy – that is, removing a unit of blood – to reduce your iron levels. It’s a relatively straightforward procedure. We’re not jumping to conclusions here. We’re simply gathering information to determine the cause of your elevated iron levels. I’m going to give you a referral to a hematologist – a blood specialist – who can interpret the results and discuss the best course of action with you.
PATIENT: A specialist… alright. That sounds… sensible. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Phleboto… what did you call it? Taking blood? I don't mind that. I give blood whenever they ask. Is it a lot of blood, though? I get a bit faint sometimes. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Phlebotomy, Ms. Hughston. It's similar to donating blood, but the amount removed will depend on your iron levels. We will monitor you closely during the procedure to ensure you don’t experience any discomfort or dizziness. I’m also going to recommend a liver function test to assess your liver health. Elevated iron can sometimes affect the liver, so it’s important to rule that out. Here's the referral to the hematologist, and this prescription is for the liver function test. Please schedule both appointments as soon as possible. And please, try not to worry. We’re going to get to the bottom of this. We'll re-evaluate everything after we get the results from these tests. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, even if it’s a bit… scary. I’ll call and schedule those appointments right away. I suppose it's good to know what's going on, even if it's not what I wanted to hear. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you experience any unusual symptoms – fatigue, abdominal pain, joint pain – before your appointments, please contact my office immediately. And try to get some rest, Ms. Hughston. Stress won’t help. .
PATIENT: .
