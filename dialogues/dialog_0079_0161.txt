DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you are 55 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, Helaina Trefren. Honestly? It’s… a bit embarrassing to talk about, but my daughter suggested I come in. She’s been reading about things, and she thinks this PrEP thing might be good for me. I don’t even really know what it is, to be perfectly honest. She just said it's… preventative.
DOCTOR: Preventative, yes. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a medication taken to prevent HIV infection. It’s generally prescribed for individuals at high risk. Now, Ms. Trefren, may I ask what led your daughter to suggest this?
PATIENT: Well… this is hard to say. I… I’ve been seeing someone. A new… friend. He’s a lovely man, truly. But he… hasn’t always been the most careful in the past, if you know what I mean. He mentioned some things, and my daughter… well, she just worries. She’s a very practical girl. I’m single, you see, and… it’s been a while. I just want to be safe, if that makes sense. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Trefren. It is always prudent to be proactive about one’s health, especially with new partners. To determine if PrEP is appropriate for you, I’ll need to gather some more information. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. A little arthritis in my knees, that’s about it. And good vision, thankfully! I get a check-up with my regular doctor every year, and she always says I’m… remarkably healthy for my age. She’d probably be surprised I’m even here talking about this. I have Medicare, if that’s helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Trefren. Medicare is certainly helpful for billing purposes. And your regular doctor sounds quite thorough. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. Yes, actually. When I was younger – maybe thirty years ago now – I had my tonsils taken out. And… oh! And I had a small cyst removed from my wrist once, but that was nothing major. Just a local anesthetic and a bandage. Other than that, no. No other surgeries. Definitely not recently. This is a lot of questions, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Ms. Trefren. Necessary to ensure your overall health and safety. Now, concerning your family history… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let’s see. My mother had high blood pressure, towards the end of her life. And my father… he had heart disease. Passed away when he was pretty young, actually. But other than that… not really. No cancer that I know of, no diabetes… it wasn’t a particularly… medical family, if that makes sense. We just… lived. Is this going to take much longer? I have an appointment to… well, it doesn’t matter. Just trying to gauge the time.
DOCTOR: We are almost through the preliminary questions, Ms. Trefren. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Tried it once when I was a teenager, absolutely awful. Couldn't even keep it down. And I barely drink, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but that's it. My mother always said alcohol was the devil, and I sort of… inherited that opinion. It's probably why I'm still standing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… just some ibuprofen for my knees when they act up. And occasionally a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because I don't get enough sun. That’s it, really. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. Honestly, I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible. It feels… unnecessary, unless it’s absolutely needed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Trefren. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll need to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps a quick check of your reflexes. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind? I really do have that appointment later. I’m not afraid of needles or anything, it’s just… I’m not very good at sitting still for long periods.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. Blood pressure is… 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply for me, please. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, a quick neurological exam… can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is everything okay? It feels like you’re rushing a bit. Are my blood pressure numbers bad? I always get nervous at the doctor, so it could be that.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, as I mentioned, likely due to anxiety. Perfectly normal in a clinical setting. Now, reflexes… And finally, a quick examination of your skin… any unusual moles or lesions?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I check myself regularly. I always wear sunscreen, even when it’s cloudy. My daughter is very insistent about that, too. Honestly, I think she’s training me to be the perfect patient. Is this… is this enough? Are we getting anywhere closer to figuring out if this PrEP thing is right for me? I’m not trying to be difficult, it’s just… I’d like to know if I need to worry about anything. Or if I’m wasting everyone’s time.
DOCTOR: We are gathering information, Ms. Trefren. And no, you are not wasting my time. Based on the preliminary examination, you appear to be in reasonably good health, though your blood pressure is somewhat elevated. To determine if PrEP is appropriate, we need to rule out any underlying conditions that could contraindicate its use. I’d like to order some blood work: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an HIV test to establish baseline status. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Blood work is fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. And if it turns out I don’t even need this PrEP thing, just tell me straight. I don’t want to spend weeks worrying about it if it’s not necessary. My daughter… she gets very invested in these things. I just want to be safe, and then move on with my life.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is the requisition form. Please take this to the lab; they are just down the hall. Once the results are back – approximately three to five business days – we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If the results are normal, we can then proceed with a more thorough discussion of PrEP, including potential risks and benefits. In the meantime, I advise you to continue practicing safe sex. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. Hopefully, it's nothing. And hopefully, I won’t have to come back too many times. Tell your staff thank you for me. It was… a lot.
