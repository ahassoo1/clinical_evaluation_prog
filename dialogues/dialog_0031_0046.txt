DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… well, a lot of pressure in my bladder, and it’s become quite bothersome. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. Bladder pressure can certainly be disruptive. Could you tell me a little more about this pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… a constant feeling, really. Not necessarily painful, but a very strong urge to go, even when I haven’t had much to drink. It’s particularly noticeable throughout the day, and sometimes keeps me up at night. I find myself going to the restroom quite frequently, just in case. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay. Frequent urination and a constant urge, even with minimal intake. And it's interfering with your sleep as well. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, roughly two months now. It was gradual at first – just noticing I was going a little more often. But in the last few weeks, it’s definitely become more pronounced and more frequent. I can recall the specific date, it was June 12th after a barbeque with my husband’s family.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Ms. Creagh. That's helpful. And you mentioned it began after a barbeque. Did you notice any change in your diet or fluid intake around that time?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Thinking back… yes, actually. We had a lot of… well, everything, really. Sugary drinks, a lot of fruit, and I did have a fair amount of beer that day – more than usual, I suppose. I didn’t really change my routine after that day, but I hadn’t had that much sugar or alcohol in a while before the barbeque.
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased sugar and alcohol intake prior to the onset of symptoms. Now, aside from the increased frequency and urgency, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me see… No pain when I urinate, thankfully. And the stream itself seems normal - no difficulty starting or stopping, and the flow is steady. I haven't noticed any blood in my urine either. I have felt a bit more tired lately, but I attributed that to just being busy at work. It’s hard to say if that’s related, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, normal stream, no blood. Increased fatigue, potentially unrelated. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any history of urinary tract infections, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard. I don’t recall ever having a UTI in my life. My mother was prone to them, but I seem to have avoided them so far, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And what about your past medical history in general?
PATIENT: Well, I had my appendix removed when I was 16, but other than that, I've been quite healthy. I do have mild asthma, but it's well-controlled with an inhaler, and I haven’t had any issues with it in years. I also wear glasses, but that’s it, really. No major illnesses or surgeries, thankfully. I have Medicare, and I see my primary care physician for annual check-ups.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy at 16, well-controlled asthma, and glasses. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the inhaler?
PATIENT: Just the inhaler, as I mentioned. It’s a Ventolin HFA inhaler, I use it as needed. And occasionally I'll take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s very infrequent - maybe once or twice a month, if that. No other prescription or over-the-counter medications currently.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ventolin HFA as needed, and occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, food, or anything else. My husband always double-checks when I try something new, just to be safe, but so far, so good. I don't have any skin sensitivities either, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I've never smoked. My husband used to, but he quit about five years ago. We both try to maintain a fairly healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. We enjoy walking and spending time outdoors.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about alcohol consumption, generally?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned before, I had a bit more than usual at the barbeque. But typically, I'd say I have a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. Nothing excessive, certainly. Perhaps three or four times a week, on average. My husband and I enjoy it with our meals.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, Ms. Creagh, can you tell me a little about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother, as I mentioned, was prone to UTIs. My father had high blood pressure, which he managed with medication. He passed away a few years ago from a heart attack. My husband's mother has type 2 diabetes, and his father had prostate issues as he got older. Nothing too concerning on either side, really. I do have an aunt on my mother’s side with arthritis, but that’s about it. I believe that covers most of it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Creagh. That's a very thorough history. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. I'll need to listen to your abdomen, and I would also like to do a quick neurological assessment. Then, I'd like to collect a urine sample for analysis. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I understand, and I’m happy to cooperate with whatever you think is best. Listening to my abdomen and a neurological assessment sounds fine, and I can certainly provide a urine sample. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll be listening for any unusual sounds. Okay. Sounds are normal. No bruits or tenderness to palpation. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological assessment – just checking your reflexes and sensation. Please keep your arms relaxed. Reflexes are normal bilaterally, and sensation is intact. Now, if you could please collect a urine sample for me, there’s a collection cup in the bathroom. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample. I'll meet you back in here when you're finished.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ll go and collect the sample now. A mid-stream sample, you said? I remember that from a previous check-up. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Please take your time, Ms. Creagh.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I tried to follow the instructions as best as I could. It was a mid-stream sample, as you requested. Let me know if you need anything else.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Creagh. I'm going to send this off to the lab for a urinalysis and urine culture. That will help us rule out any infection. It usually takes 24 to 48 hours to get the results back. In the meantime, based on your history and the preliminary examination, it's difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause for your symptoms. However, it could be a number of things, including a mild bladder irritation, a lower urinary tract irritation, or even a sign of early interstitial cystitis. The fatigue could be related to the frequent nighttime awakenings. I want to be thorough, so I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, just to get a broader picture of your overall health. Would you be comfortable starting with a trial of pyridium, a medication that can help alleviate the discomfort associated with bladder irritation, while we await the lab results?
PATIENT: That sounds very sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you being so thorough. I understand it’s important to rule out other possibilities. I'm certainly comfortable trying the pyridium, if you think it will help alleviate the discomfort. The frequent awakenings are quite tiring, so anything that might help would be welcome. I trust your judgment. Would there be any side effects I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: Pyridium, or phenazopyridine, is generally well-tolerated, but it does have a common side effect: it turns your urine orange-red. It's harmless, but it can be startling if you're not expecting it! It's also important to note that it only treats the symptoms of discomfort and doesn't address the underlying cause. It's also important to drink plenty of fluids while taking it. I'll write you a prescription for pyridium. Take it as directed on the label. If your symptoms don't improve within a few days, or if they worsen, please contact the office immediately. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the lab results and determine the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That’s good to know about the color change, Doctor – thank you for mentioning that! And I understand it’s just for symptom relief, so I won’t rely on it as a cure. A follow-up appointment in one week sounds perfect. I’ll make a note of that. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any specific foods or drinks I should avoid? Or any particular symptoms I should watch out for?
DOCTOR: Good question. For now, I recommend avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods, as these can irritate the bladder. Also, try to stay well-hydrated, but limit your fluid intake a few hours before bedtime to minimize nighttime awakenings. As for symptoms to watch out for, please contact the office immediately if you develop a fever, chills, flank pain, or blood in your urine. These could indicate a more serious infection. Also, if you experience significant difficulty urinating or a complete inability to urinate, go to the nearest emergency room. I’ll also send you a printed summary of our discussion and the instructions for taking the pyridium. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything very clearly. I feel much more reassured knowing what we’re looking at, and what to watch out for. Thank you for your time and your attention. I’ll follow your instructions carefully and look forward to our follow-up appointment next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Creagh. I’m glad I could help. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, don’t hesitate to call the office. Get some rest and I’ll see you next week.
