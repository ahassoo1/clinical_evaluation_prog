DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 21 years of age. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. It’s…Emileigh. Yeah, I just moved here. It’s a…social visit, I think? My husband said I needed to find a doctor when we got here. I don’t really…remember why, exactly. Just a check-up, maybe?
DOCTOR: A check-up, alright. And you said your husband suggested this visit… is there anything specific he mentioned you should discuss with me?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. He just said…health stuff. He worries a lot. I think he was talking about…making sure everything is okay, but I don’t…recall anything specific. Sorry! My memory isn’t the best. Is it okay if I just…let you ask questions? That might be easier.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly acceptable, Ms. Bonck. We can proceed that way. Let's start with your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I went to the doctor back home, but…it was a long time ago. I honestly can’t remember if they told me anything was…wrong. I’m sorry. I feel bad not knowing. Maybe my husband knows? He usually remembers things like that.
DOCTOR: We can certainly try to obtain that information from your husband later, Ms. Bonck. For now, let’s focus on what you recall. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I mean, nothing big. Maybe when I was little? Like, tonsils? But I don’t really remember. Everything feels…fuzzy. Sorry again. It’s really frustrating. I just…don’t have a good memory for that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mom and dad, and… my grandma, I think? They’re back home. I don’t…really know much about their health stuff either. I didn’t really talk to them about it. My husband knows them better. He’s got a good memory. Is that okay? I’m not trying to be difficult, I just…really can't remember.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, while I appreciate your husband’s involvement, it is important for you to provide me with your medical history to the best of your ability. It’s rather difficult to assess your health without knowing what conditions run in your family, or what illnesses you've previously experienced. Are you able to recall any major medical issues that your mother or father have had?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Okay, you're right. I should try harder. Hmm… My mom… I think she had…trouble with her heart? A long time ago. And my dad… he had something with his… lungs? Like, he coughed a lot. But it was years ago. I’m really sorry, it’s just…bits and pieces. Is that helpful? I just don’t want to get it wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, that is somewhat helpful. We'll document "Mother – possible cardiac history; Father – possible respiratory history, chronic cough." Now, Ms. Bonck, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don't think so. I haven't really had any bad reactions to anything. I mean, I'm a little sensitive to… strong smells, but that’s not an allergy, right? Just…makes me feel sick. I haven’t ever needed an EpiPen or anything. Is that what you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: That's what I'm asking about, Ms. Bonck. No known drug, food, or environmental allergies noted. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. I used to take a vitamin D supplement, but I stopped a while ago. My husband thought it wasn't doing anything. I don't take anything regularly. Just…sometimes pain relievers if my head hurts, but that’s it. Nothing special. Is that okay? I’m trying to be as helpful as I can. It's just…hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’d like to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and weight – and then listen to your heart and lungs. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s…fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just…let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. First, I'm going to take your weight and height. Your height is 150 centimeters and your weight is 82 kilograms. Now, please take a deep breath for me. Your lung sounds are… slightly diminished bilaterally, but no wheezing or crackles noted. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart rate is regular, but there's a very faint murmur…difficult to characterize at this time. Blood pressure is 130/80. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit.
PATIENT: Okay… That sounds… serious? The murmur and the diminished sounds? Is something wrong? I get a little… scared when you use words like that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, it is too early to make any definitive conclusions based on these initial findings. A faint murmur and slightly diminished lung sounds can be indicative of a number of things, most of which are not immediately life-threatening. However, given your limited recall of medical history and these findings, I want to order some further testing to get a clearer picture of your overall health. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an electrocardiogram, and a chest X-ray. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, okay. If you think it’s necessary. Whatever you need to do. A…complete blood count and an X-ray. That sounds… a lot. But if it will help… yes. Is it going to hurt? Or be expensive? My husband handles all the… money stuff.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will cause minimal discomfort – a brief pinch. The chest X-ray is completely painless. As for the cost, your insurance – Medicare, as I see here – should cover a significant portion of the expenses. We’ll submit the claims for you. However, I advise your husband to contact Medicare directly to verify coverage details and any potential out-of-pocket costs. While we await these results, I recommend a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, two weeks sounds good. I guess. Okay. So, I just need to… wait for the tests, and then come back? Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, avoiding anything? Or…eating differently? I don’t want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: At this time, there are no specific restrictions or changes you need to make. Continue with your normal diet and activity level. However, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations – please seek immediate medical attention. I'll have the lab requisition forms ready for you. They're just down the hall at the lab. The X-ray can be done in the radiology department, also down the hall. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Not right now. I guess I just need to… go get the tests done. And wait. Thank you, Doctor. I hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. And Ms. Bonck, I strongly encourage your husband to accompany you to your follow-up appointment. It would be helpful to have his input. .
