DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, yes... 85. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh? Oh. Yes, eighty-five. Time goes fast, you know? I want... a test. For my blood. To see where my family come from. Long, long time ago. My grandkids, they want to know. About the islands.
DOCTOR: A… genetic ancestry test?
PATIENT: Yes, that one. DNA, right? They tell you… where people before you come from? My wife, she always say our people from the Marshall Islands. But the grandkids, they want proof. Like a paper. Something strong. You understand?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, this isn't typically something we do here at the clinic. We focus on your current medical needs. I'm an Internal Medicine physician, not a genealogist. While interesting, knowing your ancestral origins doesn't really factor into treating any health conditions you may have. Are you experiencing any health problems at the moment?
PATIENT: Eh? No problem? No, not really. Old, you know? Things… ache. But nothing bad. Just old. But the grandkids… they keep asking. And I want to tell them something good. Something real. They show me these things on the computer... with maps and everything. Is it very expensive, this test? Maybe I can save some money for it.
DOCTOR: It can be. And frankly, I'm not familiar with the specific costs. I can't advise you on that. Look, are you here for a general check-up, or are you experiencing any specific symptoms that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No symptoms. Just… wanting the test. I make wood things. Little boats. Little fish. My hands still work good. But I want to know... before I can't tell the grandkids anymore. Is there someone… another doctor… who can do the test? Maybe you know? It's important to them. And… it's important to me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I understand you’d like this test, but this clinic isn't equipped for genealogical testing. You might try contacting a specialized laboratory—I believe there are several companies online that offer DNA ancestry services. I really can't recommend one specifically. However, since you are 85, I should at least do a basic physical assessment. Just to be thorough. Have you had a check-up recently?
PATIENT: Online? I… I don't know about the online. My granddaughter, she can do that, I think. But... I want to talk to a person. Someone who knows about the islands. Maybe? Is there anyone here who… knows about these things? The blood test is important, but… if someone could tell me stories too… that would be good. A check-up? Not for a long time. Just old aches. Like I say.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, no. We don't have anyone specializing in… island history here. We are a standard Internal Medicine practice. Look, I can check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a basic neurological exam. That's what I do. It’s responsible care for someone your age. Do you consent to a basic physical exam?
PATIENT: Exam? Okay. If you think it's good. But... you won't tell me about where my family come from? Not even a little? Just... a little story? About islands? My wife, she used to tell stories… about the sea turtles and the stars. But I forget. Everything… gets blurry. But the blood test… is that still not possible?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I'm going to say this one more time. We do not offer DNA ancestry testing here. I can not tell you stories about islands, and frankly, it's not relevant to your medical care. Let's proceed with the exam. It will take only a few minutes. Then, if everything appears normal – which I suspect it will – I can recommend some resources online for genealogical testing. Sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay. Exam first. Then… the computer. My granddaughter, she will help. But… promise me you try to remember. Just a little something. About islands. Before I forget everything. My wife… she wouldn’t want that. Lead the way. My hands are a little cold.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. And I make no promises about remembering island stories, Mr. Scobie. Let’s focus on your health first. First, we'll take your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Okay. Arm out. Careful now. Old bones. Not so strong anymore. Blood pressure… is that like… how fast my blood goes? My wife, she said strong blood is good. For fishing. And… for stories.
DOCTOR: It measures the force of your blood against your artery walls, Mr. Scobie, not necessarily speed. 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not concerning for your age. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Deep breath… like when I'm fishing? Yes. Like when I see the big one… …And then…… I used to be strong. My wife, she said I could hold my breath for a long time. The ocean… it's a good place. Quiet. Like forgetting everything. But… not yet.
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds a little… congested. A few crackles in the lower lobes. Have you had a cough lately?
PATIENT: Cough? A little. Mostly at night. Old man cough. Dust… from the wood. I make little boats, you see. Little fish. Need to sand the wood. Make it smooth. My wife, she used to say the ocean spirits like smooth things. But the dust… it gets in my lungs.
DOCTOR: I see. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Not that I know of. I don't feel hot. Just… tired. Old tired. Like the ocean after a big storm. Calm, but… empty. My wife, she used to say the spirits take your energy when you get old. Like the tide… going out.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Scobie, everything appears relatively normal for your age. The congestion is a little concerning, but likely just related to the wood dust. I recommend avoiding prolonged exposure to it, if possible. I'm going to prescribe a mild bronchodilator. It should help with the congestion. And I suggest you see a pulmonologist within the next three months for a more thorough evaluation. Here. And, as I mentioned, your granddaughter can help you find resources for the DNA testing online. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Bronco… what? And pulmo… what? So many big words. I just want to tell the grandkids about the islands. Is there… a picture? Of the islands? Maybe a map? Just a little one? I promise I won't ask for any more. Just a little something… to remember. My wife… she always had pictures.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I'm a physician, not a travel agent. I do not have pictures of islands. The bronchodilator will help you breathe easier. And the pulmonologist specializes in lung health. I’ve given you referrals for both. I believe that concludes our consultation. Is there anyone who can assist you in scheduling these appointments?
PATIENT: No… no one. Just me. My wife… she used to do everything. Now… just me. And the grandkids… they're busy. School… and… things. Maybe… maybe I'll just forget the test. Forget the islands. Forget everything. It's okay. Old man… forgets. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Scobie. .
