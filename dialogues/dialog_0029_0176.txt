DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s these hiccups, really. They just…won’t stop. It’s been almost three days now. It’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Three days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, started right after I had that spicy tagine at Khalil’s. Though, I’ve had spicy food before and never had this problem. It’s just…constant. She demonstrates a small hiccup See? It’s not even a big one, but it’s there.
DOCTOR: Okay. Constant hiccups for three days following a spicy meal. Have you noticed anything that makes them worse or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Drinking water doesn’t seem to help, and actually sometimes makes them worse, surprisingly. And… lying down doesn’t really change anything. I tried holding my breath a few times, like people say, but that just made me feel a bit dizzy. Nothing really stops them, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. No relief with water, no change with lying down, holding your breath didn’t help. Any other symptoms you've been experiencing along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m a little tired, maybe? But I always am, honestly. I work late nights. No heartburn, no stomach pain, nothing like that. Just…the hiccups. It’s mainly just annoying, but it’s starting to wear me down. I had a show to run last night, and it was hard to focus, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms. Tiredness, but that's usual for you. Let’s go through a bit more of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that’s about it. And I broke my wrist once, but that healed fine. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything serious, if that’s what you mean. I don't really go to the doctor unless I have to. She shrugs slightly. I'm generally pretty healthy, I think. Just… these hiccups!
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a teenager, broken wrist, otherwise generally healthy. Any family history of anything significant – heart problems, digestive issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather on my father’s side had diabetes, but that was a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. We weren’t really a family that talked about that sort of thing. I know it's probably important, but...I just don’t have much information for you, I'm afraid. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with hypertension, grandfather with diabetes. Not a lot of detail, but that's alright. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid them if I can, honestly. I try to manage everything with diet and exercise, when I have the time. It’s hard with my work schedule, but I try. She pauses briefly. I do take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, just a multivitamin occasionally. And are you allergic to anything – medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, travelled a lot, and never had a reaction. I'm pretty sure I'm not allergic to anything. I'm Egyptian, you know? We eat everything. She smiles faintly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Absolutely not. Never have, never will. I don’t care for any of those things. I need a clear head for work, you see? Running a show is stressful enough without… that. She gestures vaguely. I drink plenty of water, though, as I said. And tea, lots and lots of tea. She smiles again.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, alcohol, or drugs. Just tea. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I just want to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It’ll only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. Whatever you think will help. She sits up a little straighter in the chair. I just want these hiccups to stop, honestly. They’re driving me mad.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Okay, Ms. Redeye. Everything seems normal on the initial exam. Given the history and the physical, it sounds like we’re dealing with a case of persistent hiccups. They can be quite frustrating, and often resolve on their own, but three days is a bit long.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Is something seriously wrong? Should I be worried? I have a show opening next week, and I really can’t afford to be sick. She looks at Dr. Chora with a worried expression.
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. Persistent hiccups can be caused by a lot of things – sometimes it's just irritation of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm. Spicy food can sometimes trigger that. We can try a few things to see if we can get them to stop. There are a few medications we could use, but given your preference to avoid medication, we'll start with some simpler methods. Have you tried gargling with water?
PATIENT: Gargling? No, I haven't. That sounds…odd. But if it helps… I’ll try anything at this point, honestly. She looks skeptical, but determined. How often should I gargle? And with what? Cold water? Warm water? She pauses. I suppose it can’t hurt, right?
DOCTOR: Right. It can't hurt. Try gargling with room temperature water for about 30 seconds, several times a day. It can sometimes help stimulate the vagus nerve, which can calm the diaphragm. Also, I want you to try holding your breath for as long as you comfortably can, without straining yourself, about three times a day. And make sure you’re drinking plenty of water. We'll see if that helps over the next couple of days. If they persist beyond that, we can consider a medication called baclofen, but we’ll cross that bridge if we need to. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Gargling, holding my breath, and drinking water. I can definitely do that. She nods slowly. I’ll try my best. And if it doesn’t work… what happens then? Is baclofen a strong medication? I really don’t want anything that will make me drowsy. I need to be sharp for the show. She looks concerned again.
DOCTOR: Baclofen is generally well-tolerated, but drowsiness is a potential side effect. We’d start with a very low dose and see how you tolerate it. It’s not a medication we jump to immediately. If the hiccups continue despite trying these methods, I would recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist. They may want to do some further investigation – perhaps an upper endoscopy to rule out anything unusual. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Try the gargling and breath-holding for the next 48 hours and see if there's any improvement. If not, we'll re-evaluate. I’m going to write you a note explaining these instructions. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Gargle, hold my breath, see what happens. I’ll try my best and hopefully, they’ll just… go away. She sighs, a little relieved but still worried. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. And for not immediately prescribing me something strong. She smiles weakly. I’ll see you in a few days if they’re still bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Redeye. I understand your concern, and we'll take it one step at a time. I’m glad I could help. Here's that note with the instructions. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any new symptoms or if the hiccups worsen. And good luck with your show! I hope they resolve quickly. .
