DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… a check-up, I think? Something about needing clearance for… work. Performance work. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. My daughter set it up. She worries, you see. It’s for a theater thing, I believe. I mostly just show tickets and help people find their seats these days. Is that what this is for?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. A check-up for work clearance is a very common reason to come in. It sounds like your daughter is very thoughtful to arrange this for you. “Performance work” is fine – it just helps me understand what physical demands might be involved. To get started, could you tell me a little bit more about what a typical day looks like for you at the theater?
PATIENT: Oh, a typical day… Well, I arrive a bit before the doors open. Mostly I stand around, you know? Showing people where to go, helping older folks with their seats. Sometimes there's a bit of lifting, moving chairs around if they need rearranging… Not much, though. I’m a bit… thin these days, as you can see. I mostly just point. And smile. Is that enough information? I don't really do much, physically.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Krahn. It sounds like it’s mostly standing and light activity, with occasional light lifting. No heavy work at all. Before we move on, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That’s a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t remember much. I think I had the usual childhood things? Measles, mumps… Nothing serious, I don't believe. As an adult… I think I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Maybe twenty, thirty years ago? And… my blood pressure has been a little high, on and off. But I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in a long, long time. My daughter keeps telling me I should, but… well, you know. Is there a specific thing you're looking for?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Krahn, we'll take it slowly. Gallbladder removal and some history of high blood pressure – that’s good to know. And it’s very responsible of your daughter to encourage you to come in. Do you recall if you were ever officially diagnosed with hypertension, or if it was just occasional high readings?
PATIENT: Occasional readings, I think. The doctor—it was Dr. Chen, a long time ago—said to watch my salt intake, and try to relax. He never put me on any pills or anything. Just… advice. I think it went up when my wife… well, when she passed. Stress, you know? It’s been better since then, mostly. I try to take it easy. Is that enough detail? I really can't remember precise numbers.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. It's understandable that stress would affect your blood pressure, and it’s good that it's improved since then. We can check it today, of course, and see where things stand. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all – even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really believe in taking pills unless absolutely necessary. I try to get by on… well, on good food and a bit of rest. And smiling, of course. I take a calcium supplement sometimes, but that's mostly because my daughter nags me about my bones. She worries I'm too thin, you see. But I stopped taking it regularly a while back. It didn't seem to do anything, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, just occasional calcium. And it sounds like your daughter is very attentive to your health, which is wonderful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife used to make all sorts of wonderful dishes, and I never had a reaction to anything. I don’t recall ever having a bad reaction to any medicine either. I think I’m pretty lucky that way, honestly. I've never been one for… sensitivities.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Krahn. No known allergies. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s even harder to remember than my own medical history. My parents… they both lived to be quite old, I think. My mother had some sort of… joint trouble, maybe arthritis? She walked with a cane towards the end. And my father… he had a weak heart, I think. But he didn't go to the doctor much either. It was a different time, you see. People didn’t bother with things like check-ups. Is that helpful? I really wish my daughter was here. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. It's very common for family history to be a bit hazy. Knowing about your mother’s joint trouble and your father’s heart condition is helpful, even without precise details. We can always look into it further if needed. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general well-being. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Just get it over with, please. I have… things to do. And my daughter will be wondering where I am. I just want to get this clearance and be on my way. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. I understand. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. 150 over 85. A little elevated, as you suspected. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Pulses are weak, but present in all extremities. I also notice slight edema in his ankles. Alright, Mr. Krahn, everything seems generally okay, but there are a few things I'd like to discuss.
PATIENT: A few things? Oh dear. What things? Is it serious? I just need the clearance, Doctor. I don’t want any… complications. And my daughter… she'll be very worried if I have to come back for tests.
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Mr. Krahn. It's not necessarily serious, but it's good we’re taking a look. Your blood pressure is a bit high, as we discussed, and I did detect a slight heart murmur. The weak pulses and slight swelling in your ankles are also things we should investigate further. Given your history of occasional high blood pressure, the murmur, and the edema, I think it would be prudent to do a few simple tests. An EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a basic blood panel to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh dear. I really don’t like tests. But… if it gets me the clearance… and keeps my daughter happy… alright. But nothing too complicated, please. And can it be done quickly? I have… commitments. And I don't do well in hospitals. They smell funny. Can we do it here? In the office?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. We can do all of these tests right here in the office. It won’t be complicated at all - just a quick EKG and a blood draw. The blood draw will only take a few minutes, and the EKG is completely painless. It shouldn't take long at all. I'll write up the orders now. While we wait for the lab results, let’s discuss some lifestyle modifications that can help lower your blood pressure. Have you ever thought about reducing your salt intake, or perhaps incorporating some gentle exercise into your routine?
PATIENT: Salt… yes, Dr. Chen mentioned that, years ago. I try not to add much to my food. And exercise… well, I walk to the theater every day. It's a long walk, mind you. But I get out of breath easily. Gentle exercise… I suppose I could try. But I'm not very good at… exertion. It makes me tired. And I get dizzy. Perhaps just walking is enough? Is that enough? I'm seventy years old, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Walking is a wonderful start, Mr. Krahn. And at seventy years old, it’s perfectly reasonable to take things at your own pace. We're not aiming for marathon running here! Even a little bit of activity is beneficial. While we wait for the lab results, let's focus on the walking and try to maintain a consistent routine. Also, it's important to stay well-hydrated, especially if you're feeling dizzy. Do you drink plenty of water throughout the day?
PATIENT: Water… I drink tea, mostly. Green tea. It’s good for you, isn’t it? I don't really care for water. It tastes… bland. But I suppose I could try. For my daughter. She’s always telling me to drink more water. Is green tea okay? Or does it have to be… plain water?
DOCTOR: Green tea is perfectly fine, Mr. Krahn. It actually has many health benefits. We just want to make sure you're getting enough fluids overall. While it's good to drink water, tea can absolutely count towards your daily intake. The lab results are back. Your kidney function is normal, which is good. However, your cholesterol levels are slightly elevated, and the EKG shows some signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, which means the muscle of your heart has thickened. This can be caused by long-standing high blood pressure. It’s not an immediate emergency, but it's something we need to address.
PATIENT: Left ventricular… what now? And cholesterol? Oh dear. This is getting complicated. Is this going to require… pills? Because I really don’t like pills. And my daughter will be so worried. Can't we just… monitor it? I’ve been perfectly fine for seventy years. Surely it’s not that serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. Left ventricular hypertrophy simply means the muscle of your heart has thickened, which can happen over time with high blood pressure. It doesn’t mean anything immediately life-threatening, but it’s something we want to manage to prevent potential complications down the line. And yes, elevated cholesterol also needs to be addressed. While monitoring is important, in your case, I think medication would be beneficial. There are several safe and effective options available. We could start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. However, before we jump to medication, let’s revisit the lifestyle modifications. I’m willing to work with you to create a plan that you’re comfortable with. Perhaps we can focus on the walking, the tea, and incorporating some heart-healthy foods into your diet. If those don’t significantly improve your numbers, then we can discuss medication again. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. No pills… yet. Walking and tea. And… heart-healthy foods. What are heart-healthy foods? I mostly eat whatever my daughter makes for me. She’s a good cook, but… I don’t know. Fish? I suppose I like fish. And vegetables. Sometimes. But not too many. If I promise to walk a little more, and drink more tea, will you… promise not to give me pills? At least not right away? And could you… write down what I need to do? I forget things easily, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. I promise to hold off on medication for now, as long as you’re committed to the lifestyle changes. And of course, I'll write everything down for you. Walking: Aim for at least 30 minutes of brisk walking most days of the week. Start slowly and gradually increase your pace and distance. Hydration: Drink at least 8 glasses of fluids per day . Diet: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein , and healthy fats . Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and saturated fats. Follow-up: Schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to check your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and overall progress. I'm confident that we can work together to improve your health, Mr. Krahn. And remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Now, regarding work clearance, based on your current condition and commitment to these lifestyle changes, I believe you’re fit to return to your duties at the theater, with the understanding that you’ll keep me informed of any changes in your health. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Walking… tea… It’s a lot. But… acceptable. Work clearance… good. My daughter will be relieved. Three months… I suppose I can manage three months. Thank you, Doctor Georgiou. You've been… patient. And understanding. I appreciate it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go home and… rest. And tell my daughter I’m okay. And… try to remember all this. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I'm glad I could help. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and enjoy your time at the theater. .
