DOCTOR: Hi Bianca, welcome! I’m Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Rosanova. It nice to meet you too. Well, lately I been drinkin’ a lot more water than usual. And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just… don’t feel right, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Increased thirst and hunger even after eating can be a sign of a few different things. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. How long have you been noticing this increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It start maybe… two, three months now? It wasn’t sudden, it just kinda… creep up on me. At first, I thought it was just the heat, you know? It been real warm lately. But it keep happenin’, even when it cooler.
DOCTOR: Right, that’s good to know it wasn’t an abrupt change. And it’s smart to consider the weather first. Besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes – like needing to urinate more often, any unexplained weight loss, blurry vision, fatigue, or any skin changes, maybe slow healing cuts or infections?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now that you mention it, I have been goin’ to the bathroom more often. Especially at night, which is botherin’ my husband. And… I think I lose a little weight, but I ain't weigh myself lately so I can't be sure. Everything just feel… tired, all the time. I get winded easy too. Cuts take longer to heal, yes. I burn myself makin’ doubles sometimes, and it stay sore longer than it used to. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense. Okay, frequent urination, especially at night, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, getting winded easily, and slower wound healing… those are all important things to note. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any diagnosed medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I don't have anythin' officially diagnosed. The doctor always tellin' me my pressure a little high when I go for check-up, but he never put me on any medicine for it. Just tell me to watch my salt intake. Other than that, I feel alright. Old age comin’ on, you know? A few aches and pains here and there, but nothin’ serious. My husband, he had heart trouble a few years back, but he takin' his pills and doin' well now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, but nothing formally treated, and your husband's heart history. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, long time ago. And I had a baby, two of them, so I was in the hospital for that! Other than that, no, nothin' major. No surgeries or long stays in the hospital. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years, you know? I try to stay out of the doctor’s office as much as I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, and deliveries of your two children. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother, she had diabetes. She was always tired and had to watch what she eat. She passed away a few years back from it, I think. My father, he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life, but he had high blood pressure towards the end. My brother, he gettin’ on in age too, and he complainin' about his joints lately, but he ain’t seen a doctor yet. That's about it, really. Small family.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes in your mother and high blood pressure in your father. That's helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, thank goodness! I love my doubles, you know? And I take a little aspirin sometimes for my aches and pains, but that don’t bother me none. I never had no reaction to anythin’ so far.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just the aspirin when I need it, like I said. And sometimes a little vitamin C when I feel a cold comin’ on. But I don't take nothin’ every day, regularly. I try to get my vitamins from my food, you know? Fresh fruit and vegetables, when I can get them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just occasional aspirin and vitamin C. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I work as a pump operator, mostly outdoors. It a hard job, lot of physical work. I been doin’ it for many years. I try to eat healthy, but it hard when you workin’ long hours. I like to cook my own food, Trinidadian food, you know, doubles, roti, pelau… I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol, just a little wine sometimes with my husband on a special occasion. I don’t get a lot of exercise other than from my job, but I try to stay active. That about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a physically demanding job, Trinidadian cuisine, occasional wine, and no smoking. Alright, Bianca, based on what you’ve told me – the increased thirst and hunger, frequent urination, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, slower wound healing, family history of diabetes, and slightly elevated blood pressure – it’s important to rule out diabetes. I'd like to do a quick physical exam and then order some blood work to check your blood sugar levels and kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sound good. Whatever you think is best. I want to find out what’s goin’ on, you know? I just want to feel normal again. I trust your judgment. Let’s do the exam and the blood work. It better than just wonderin’, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam. It won’t take long. Just relax your arm for me…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’ll try to relax. It sometimes hard when I nervous. But I’ll do my best. Just tell me what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is that okay? It a little strong? I don't want to hurt you.
DOCTOR: No, that's fine, good strength. Okay, everything seems normal so far. Now, just to complete the exam, I'm going to check your feet. Do you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I feel that. A little cold, but I feel it. Sometimes my feet get cold easy, especially at night. They get a little numb sometimes too, but not all the time. Mostly just when it really cold.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m noting that you sometimes experience coldness and numbness in your feet. Alright, Bianca, based on the exam, it’s still important to investigate the possibility of diabetes. We’ll need to do some blood work. I'm going to order a fasting blood glucose test, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a complete blood count. We'll also check your HbA1c, which gives us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sound good. Whatever test you think will help. I just want to know what's goin' on. You explain it real good, so I understand. When will I get the results? And what do I need to do to prepare for the test?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The lab will let you know when the results are available, usually within 24-48 hours. They will likely call you directly with the results, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. For the fasting blood glucose test, you'll need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks – only water. We’ll provide you with a slip that has all the details on how to prepare for the tests. In the meantime, continue to drink plenty of water, and try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you explain everything very clear. I don’t think I have no more questions right now. I just hope it ain’t nothin’ too serious. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to me and explain things. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. I understand your concern. We'll get the results and go from there. Here's the order for the lab. They’re just down the hall. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Rosanova. You have a good day too. I’ll go get those tests done now.
