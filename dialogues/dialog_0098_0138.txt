DOCTOR: Good morning, Alayne. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Let me see… well, my daughter, bless her heart, she's been worried about me. I've been having… episodes, I suppose you could call them. Just a little weakness, mostly on one side. It doesn't last long, but it’s… unsettling. And, oh, my mother had terrible headaches, migraines, they called them. Very bad ones. So, she thought I should get checked out, just to be safe. I don’t always remember things clearly, so… that's probably all I can tell you right now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Episodes of weakness, mainly on one side… and a family history of migraines. It’s good your daughter is looking out for you, and it’s wise to get things checked out. You mentioned not remembering things clearly… is that a recent change, or has that been ongoing?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question, dear. It's… hard to say. I think it's been getting a little worse lately, maybe. But you know, at my age… things just sort of… fade, don’t they? I forget where I put my glasses all the time, and sometimes I struggle to recall names. It’s not a sudden thing, but my daughter says she’s noticed it more recently. She has a very good memory, that girl. Always did. I mostly just try not to worry about it too much.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a gradual change in memory, possibly becoming more noticeable recently. That’s helpful to know. And it’s good your daughter is observant. Now, let’s talk about these episodes of weakness. Can you describe what they feel like exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a complete paralysis, not at all. More like… a heaviness. Like my arm is filled with lead, or my leg just won’t move as quickly as it should. It usually happens on my right side, I think. Though sometimes it’s hard to tell. And it doesn’t last long, thankfully. Maybe just a few minutes. It’s more… frightening than painful, if that makes sense. I get a little scared when it happens. I don’t want to be a bother, but it's just a little unsettling, you know? Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Alayne. “Heaviness” on your right side, lasting a few minutes, more frightening than painful. And a gradual change in memory. We'll get to the bottom of this, don't worry. Now, do you notice anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, triggers… now that’s a good question. Let me think… No, not really. It doesn't seem to happen at any particular time or after anything specific. I could be just sitting and reading, or doing a little housework. It just… comes on. Sometimes I feel a little… dizzy before it happens, but not always. And sometimes there’s a headache, but then again, I get headaches sometimes anyway. It's all a bit muddled, I'm afraid. I wish I could be more helpful! I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Alayne. It's understandable that it’s difficult to pinpoint a trigger. So, dizziness occasionally before the episodes, and sometimes a headache... Okay. Now, I’d like to ask about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… let me think. Oh, dear. I wear glasses, you know. I’ve had them for… well, a long time! Sometimes things seem a little blurry, but I just adjust my glasses. I don't know if that's new, or if it's just my usual eyesight. My daughter says I should get a new prescription, but I haven’t gotten around to it. No, I don’t think I’ve had any… flashes or anything like that. Just the usual blurry vision. And, oh, sometimes my eyes feel a little tired, especially if I'm reading for a long time. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Blurry vision, especially needing a new prescription, and tired eyes. Alright. And have you noticed any difficulty with speech?
PATIENT: Difficulty with speech… no, I don’t think so. Sometimes I stumble over my words, but that’s just because I’m old, I suppose! Or if I'm trying to remember a name, I get all tongue-tied. But no, I haven’t had any trouble forming words, or understanding what people say. My daughter might say I repeat myself sometimes, but she says I do that anyway! I just… ramble on, probably. I don't think it's a real problem. But you know, it’s good you’re asking all these questions. Just to be sure.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Alayne. And it is good to ask all these questions. Just to be thorough. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a tricky one. Let me think… I think I had high blood pressure, a long time ago. But I was on medication for it, and I haven’t been to the doctor in a while, so I don’t know if I still do. And, oh, I had a gallbladder removed, years ago. That was a long time ago, and I recovered just fine. I don’t think I have any other… serious medical conditions. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, you know? My daughter keeps a list of my medications, she's very organized. I'm afraid I don’t remember everything off the top of my head. She probably knows more than I do!
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure in the past, gallbladder removed. And your daughter keeps a list of your medications – excellent. I'll take a look at that in just a moment. Now, any family history of stroke, heart disease, or neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother, bless her heart, she had terrible migraines, as I mentioned. And she did have a stroke, a long time ago. It left her a little… weaker on one side, but she lived for many years after that. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had something with his memory, towards the end of his life. My daughter said it might have been Alzheimer’s, but I don’t really remember the details. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about it much. My family… we try not to dwell on things like that, you know? It's best to just focus on the good things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Alayne. History of migraines and a stroke in your mother, and possible Alzheimer’s in your uncle. Thank you for sharing that. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your current medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. This is where I get completely lost, dear. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, I think. And another one for… something. Honestly, I just take what my daughter gives me, and I’m not very good at remembering what they’re for. She keeps the list, and she’s very careful about making sure I take the right ones at the right time. I really should pay more attention, but… well, at my age, things just slip my mind. She'll be here any minute, I think. She has the list with her. She's very organized, that girl. She’s probably wondering where I am!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Alayne. Your daughter sounds wonderful. Let's wait for her with the list. While we’re waiting, I’m just going to do a quick physical exam. Just a quick check of your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that would be lovely, dear. That sounds perfectly fine. My blood pressure is probably a little high, I'm not surprised. I do love my pasta, you know! I’m glad you’re going to listen to my heart and lungs. I always worry about my breathing sometimes, even though the doctor always says it’s fine. Just do whatever you need to do, dear. I'm happy to cooperate. And I’m sure my daughter will be here any minute now. She's probably wondering why I’m taking so long!
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. 148 over 86. A little elevated, as you suspected. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Your lungs are clear to auscultation, but you do have some mild, diminished breath sounds at the bases. Nothing alarming, but something to keep an eye on. Now, can you squeeze my hands for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I can do that. Though sometimes my grip isn’t as strong as it used to be. It's just getting old, I suppose. Everything gets a little weaker, doesn’t it? It's just the natural order of things. I try not to worry about it too much, but sometimes I do get a little… anxious. Especially when I have those little episodes of weakness. I just want to make sure everything is alright, you know? I don't want to be a bother to anyone. Do you think I'm squeezing hard enough? I don’t want to be a nuisance!
DOCTOR: You're squeezing perfectly fine, Alayne. Strength is a little diminished on the right side, as you suspected, but nothing drastic. And you're not a bother at all. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. And I'll just do a quick neurological exam… Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I can do that. Though sometimes my eyes get a little tired, especially if I look at something for too long. And sometimes everything gets a little blurry, as I mentioned. But I think I’m following your finger alright, aren’t I? It’s a little difficult to concentrate sometimes, you know? My mind wanders. I was just thinking about the pasta I had for lunch. It was delicious! My daughter makes it, she’s a wonderful cook. Are you sure I’m doing it right? I don’t want to mess anything up!
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Alayne. Your eye movements are a little slow, but otherwise normal. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a tricky one. Let me think… Is it… 2023? No, wait. Is it 2024? Oh, goodness, I'm terrible with dates. Is it August already? Time just seems to fly by these days. My daughter always knows what day it is, she has a wonderful memory. I think it’s… 2025? Yes, I think it’s 2025. But don't rely on me! I'm terrible with these things. Is that bad? I hope I'm not making a fool of myself!
DOCTOR: It's alright, Alayne. Orientation to time can be affected by a number of things, and it's not a definitive test on its own. Now, let's just finish up with a quick balance check. Could you stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I can stand up. Though sometimes I get a little… dizzy when I stand up too quickly. It's just getting old, I suppose. Everything gets a little wobbly, doesn’t it? I try to be careful, I don’t want to fall. My daughter is always telling me to be careful. She worries about me, bless her heart. Are you sure I'm standing alright? I don't want to be a bother!
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Alayne. A little unsteady, but not alarming. Okay, that completes the quick exam. Based on the exam and your history, you have some mild weakness on your right side, occasional episodes of dizziness, some memory issues, and a slightly elevated blood pressure. Your reflexes and heart sounds are normal, but your lungs have diminished breath sounds and you were a little unsteady with balance. Now, do you see your daughter here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, there she is! That’s my sweet Elena! She’s always on time, bless her heart. She’ll have the list of my medications, and she can probably tell you more than I can. She worries so much about me, you know. She’s a wonderful daughter. I'm glad she's here, I'm getting a little flustered, and I'm sure I've forgotten half of what I’ve told you already. Elena, dear, come over here! Dr. Bombara was just asking about my medications.
