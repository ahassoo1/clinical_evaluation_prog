DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, welcome in. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. And I have… a funny heartbeat, sometimes. The doctor back home told me it was somethin’ with my heart, but I didn’t quite catch all of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a swollen left leg and some… unusual heartbeats. I understand. It sounds a bit concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. Let's try and get a clearer picture of what's going on. First, about the swelling – when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… It started… maybe a week ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little puffiness. But it’s gotten worse each day, I’d say. It feels… tight, and it’s a bit painful if I press on it. I haven’t done anything to cause it, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright, a week ago, gradually worsening, tight and painful to the touch. And no injury that you recall?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I’ve been mostly at home, workin’ on my computer. I’m a teacher, you see. Computer science. So, not much runnin’ about, not much chance of a bump or a twist. It just… appeared. It's a bit worryin', to be honest.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand why it would be worrying, Nixon. Alright. And this funny heartbeat… can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well… It’s not a regular beat, like. Sometimes it feels very fast, like a flutterin’ in my chest. Other times it’s… just irregular. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s definitely noticeable. It comes and goes. I don’t know if that makes any sense. The doctor said somethin’ about… fibrillation? Was that it? I’m not very good at rememberin’ these things.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, and don’t worry about remembering medical terms, that’s what I’m here for. Fibrillation is a good thing to have mentioned. It's certainly something we want to look into. Okay, so irregular heartbeat, sometimes fast, sometimes just off-rhythm, and not associated with any pain. Does it happen when you're doing something specific, like exercising or getting stressed?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. It doesn’t seem to be linked to exercise. I don’t do much of that, as I said. And stress… well, teachin’ can be stressful, I suppose. But it happens when I’m relaxin’ too. When I’m just sittin’ and workin’ on my computer, sometimes it’ll start. It’s… random, I think is the best way to describe it. I haven't noticed a particular trigger.
DOCTOR: Alright, random occurrences, not specifically tied to activity or stress. That’s helpful. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you had any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not really. I’ve been a bit tired, maybe. But that could just be from workin’ long hours. No fever, no cough, no chest pain… nothin’ else that I can think of. I haven't been feelin' ill, per se. Just… off. And this leg is gettin' worse. It's mostly the leg, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly the leg swelling, with some fatigue, but no other significant symptoms. That’s good to know. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Well… The doctor back home did tell me I had somethin’ with my heart, like I said. He mentioned… atrial fibrillation, I think. But other than that… no, nothin’ really. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. I don't go to the doctor much, unless somethin’ is seriously wrong. I’m not one for botherin’ folks unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a previous diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with that, and if you were prescribed any medications for it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that was… oh, maybe six months ago? Or was it a year? It was before all this leg trouble started, definitely. And medication… yes, I think he gave me somethin’. A small white pill, I believe. But I stopped takin' it after a while. It didn’t seem to be makin' much difference, and… well, I was feelin' alright, so I just stopped. I probably shouldn’t have, but… I wasn’t feelin’ any worse, so I figured it wasn't doin' much good.
DOCTOR: Alright, diagnosed with atrial fibrillation about six months to a year ago, and you were prescribed medication but stopped taking it because you weren't feeling a noticeable difference. We will definitely discuss that further. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had any surgeries. And I’ve never been in the hospital, not even as a child. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Until now, that is. This leg is a bit of a worry. I’ve always just managed on my own, to be honest. But it’s gettin’ a bit harder now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That's good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. My mother… she had a bad heart, I think. She was always tired, and she had trouble breathin’ sometimes. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don't remember much detail. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. But other than that… no, not really. My grandparents were both quite healthy, as far as I know. It’s hard to say, really. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, a family history of heart problems in your mother and high blood pressure in your father. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not to my knowledge. I’ve never had any allergic reactions. I can eat anything, take any medication… never had a problem. I don’t have any sensitivities, or anything like that. I’ve always been quite fortunate, in that regard. Although, this leg… is makin’ me feel less fortunate these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. As I said, I stopped takin' the pill the doctor gave me months ago. I don't take any vitamins or supplements either. I try to eat a healthy diet, but I don’t bother with all that extra stuff. Just simple food, really. I don't believe in overcomplicating things, if I can help it. I believe a bit of common sense is more useful than a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a closer look at your leg. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds perfectly fine. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I just want to figure out what’s wrong with my leg, and get it sorted out. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your heart. Take a few deep breaths for me… in and out… I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, which is consistent with your previous diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. It's not overly concerning at the moment, but it is something we will need to monitor. Now, I’ll listen to your lungs… Your lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse… Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90, and your pulse is irregular and a bit fast, around 90 beats per minute. Now, let’s take a closer look at your leg… Your left leg is noticeably swollen, particularly around the calf and ankle. It’s tender to the touch, and I’m also noticing some redness. Do you feel any warmth in that leg compared to your other leg?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It is tender. And… yes, you're right. It feels warmer than my other leg. Not terribly warm, but definitely noticeable. It feels… tight, as well. Like somethin’ is constrictin’ it. Is that… bad? I’ve never had a leg feel like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. The warmth and redness, along with the swelling and tenderness, are concerning. It could be a few things, but one possibility we need to rule out is a blood clot, also known as deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. It’s important to get this checked out quickly. Given your irregular heartbeat and the swelling in your leg, it's worth investigating. I want to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg to check for blood clots. This is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to visualize the blood flow in your veins. I also want to order a blood test called a D-dimer to help rule out a blood clot. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A… blood clot? Oh dear. That doesn't sound good at all. A Doppler ultrasound… and a blood test… No, I don’t think so. I haven't had either of those tests before. What will happen if it is a blood clot? And… is it serious? Will I need… surgery? And what about my heart? Is that connected to all of this? It’s all a bit overwhelmning, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, Nixon. Let's take this one step at a time. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg, a DVT, can be serious, but it’s also treatable. If a clot forms, it can cause pain, swelling, and redness in the leg, as you’re experiencing. More importantly, there's a risk that a piece of the clot could break off and travel to your lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism, which is a very serious condition. The good news is that we can often prevent a pulmonary embolism with timely treatment, usually blood-thinning medication. The ultrasound will help us determine if a clot is present, and the D-dimer test will give us further information. As for your heart, atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of blood clot formation, which is why we need to investigate this thoroughly. They can be connected. We're going to rule out the DVT first. If it’s negative, then we will focus on management of your atrial fibrillation. Do you have any insurance?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… quite serious indeed. Pulmonary embolism… I hadn't even heard of that. No, sir. I… I don’t have any insurance. I haven’t been able to afford it, unfortunately. I’ve always just tried to stay healthy and avoid the doctor, as much as possible. But… it seems I can’t do that anymore. How much will these tests cost? And… is there any way to help with the cost? I don’t know if I can afford a lot of medical bills.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s unfortunate that you don’t have insurance, but we’ll do our best to figure something out. The cost of the ultrasound can vary, but it’s typically around $500-$800. The D-dimer test is usually less expensive, around $100-$200. I can speak with our billing department to see if they have any financial assistance programs or payment plans available. There are also some local resources we can explore to see if they can provide assistance with the cost of your care. We will work with you to figure out a manageable plan. In the meantime, I want to be cautious and start you on a blood thinner preventatively. While we wait for the results of the tests, this will help prevent any further clot formation. There are several options available, and we can discuss the risks and benefits of each one. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That… that sounds good, actually. Starting a blood thinner… preventatively… yes, that makes sense. If it can help prevent a clot, I’m willing to try it. What are the options, then? And… what are the risks and benefits of each one? I’m a bit worried about side effects, if I’m honest. I haven't taken many medications in my life, so I don’t know what to expect. And… thank you. Thank you for working with me on this. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. It’s my job to help you, and we’ll get through this together. There are a few different blood thinners we can consider. The older ones, like warfarin, require regular blood tests to monitor their effectiveness, and they can interact with a lot of foods and medications. The newer ones, called direct oral anticoagulants or DOACs – like rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran – are generally easier to use and don't require as much monitoring. However, they all carry a risk of bleeding. The risk is relatively low, but it's something we need to be aware of. Signs of bleeding can include easy bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your urine or stool, or unusually heavy menstrual periods. The DOACs are usually preferred because they have fewer interactions, but the best option for you will depend on your individual circumstances. Given your age and health status, I would recommend starting with apixaban. It's generally well-tolerated and has a lower risk of major bleeding compared to some of the other options. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Apixaban… yes, that sounds… alright, I suppose. If it has fewer risks, that’s good. And what about the monitoring? You said some require regular blood tests? Would I need those with the apixaban? And what about side effects? What are the most common ones? And what should I do if I do experience any side effects? I don't want to cause any trouble for you, if I start bleeding or something.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. The good news is that apixaban generally does not require routine blood tests for monitoring. That’s one of the reasons I recommend it. You will need to have a check-up with me regularly to assess how you’re doing, but we won’t need to draw blood every few weeks. As for side effects, the most common ones are mild bleeding, like nosebleeds or bruising. Other possible side effects include stomach upset, fatigue, or dizziness. Serious bleeding is rare, but it’s important to be aware of the signs. If you experience any unusual or heavy bleeding, or if you feel weak or dizzy, you should stop taking the apixaban and contact me immediately. Also, let me know if you have any falls or injuries, even minor ones. I'll give you a detailed information sheet about apixaban, and we’ll go over it together. It’s important to be aware of the potential risks and benefits before you start taking it. Would you like me to write you a prescription for apixaban now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A prescription would be good. And the information sheet, yes, definitely. I want to know everything I can about it. Thank you, Doctor Renzi. You’ve been very helpful. I was very worried, but I feel a bit better now. Hopefully, this medication will help. I’m ready to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Here’s your prescription for apixaban. I’ve also printed out a detailed information sheet for you. Please read it carefully, and don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to check your progress and make sure you’re tolerating the medication well. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds perfect. I’ll make a note of it. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your time and patience. I feel much more confident now that we have a plan. Is there anything else I should know before I go? Or anything I should do before starting the medication?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. Just a few things. Try to avoid activities that could increase your risk of injury, like contact sports or falls. Also, let any other doctors you see know that you’re taking apixaban. Before starting the medication, please check with your pharmacy to make sure it doesn't interact with any other medications you're taking. And remember to take it exactly as prescribed. I think that covers everything for now. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. I'm glad we were able to come up with a plan. Take care, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
