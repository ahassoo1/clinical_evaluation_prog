DOCTOR: Right. Marialena Creagh, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Nooruddin.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let's get straight to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly. I've been experiencing some…pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. It's not painful, exactly, but definitely uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Pressure, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It feels…full, even after I’ve just gone to the restroom. And sometimes, I feel like I need to go very urgently, even when there isn't much there. It’s a bit confusing, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Urgency,” right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…probably about a month ago, maybe a little longer. At first, it was just occasional, but it’s been happening more and more frequently in the last couple of weeks. I’d say almost daily now.
DOCTOR: And is there anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t noticed anything specific, truly. Drinking a lot of fluids definitely doesn’t help, but I need to stay hydrated. And sometimes, if I’m stressed, it seems a little more noticeable. But other than that…not really. It just kind of…happens.
DOCTOR: Stress. Right. Well, a lot of things can cause bladder irritation. Do you have any history of urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: To the best of my knowledge, no. I haven't had one that I recall. I've had a few colds and things, of course, but nothing specifically a urinary tract infection. My mother always made sure we drank cranberry juice when we felt a cold coming on, though, just in case!
DOCTOR: Cranberry juice…that’s…a common misconception. It doesn't really do much. Any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Oh! Well…yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I’ve been a little more constipated than usual. It’s not severe, but definitely not my normal regularity. I hadn’t really connected the two, but perhaps that’s related? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: It is possible. Constipation can certainly put pressure on the bladder. Now, let's move on. Any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. It’s a smooth stream, and I empty completely, as far as I can tell. It’s just the…constant feeling of pressure and the urgency that’s troubling me. It’s more of a discomfort than pain, definitely. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: I’m generally quite healthy, thankfully. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for checkups. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fully. Other than that…not much. My husband says I worry too much, but I always try to stay on top of things. I’m married, and thankfully, he’s been very supportive. Would you like me to list any medications I’m currently taking? I don’t take many.
DOCTOR: No, not unless they are relevant. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. No reactions to foods, medications, or anything like that. I can eat shellfish, take penicillin…everything seems to agree with me, thankfully. It's one less thing to worry about, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let's have a quick look. Just a basic abdominal exam. Lie back on the exam table, please.
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ll just… excuse me for a moment.
DOCTOR: Take your time.
PATIENT: I am ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that's alright. A little pressure, maybe, but no actual pain. Perhaps it’s just…normal abdominal sensitivity? I do worry sometimes, as my husband says.
DOCTOR: Hm. Sounds normal. No masses, no obvious distension. I'm not hearing anything concerning. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing a bit of bladder irritation, possibly due to the constipation you mentioned. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule a few things out.
PATIENT: That’s reassuring to hear. What sort of things need ruling out, if you don’t mind my asking? And what steps will that involve? I would like to be fully informed, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need a urine sample to check for an infection. A simple urinalysis. And I'm going to order a complete blood count, just to be on the safe side. It will give us a broader picture of your overall health. It’s standard procedure. If that comes back clear, and the constipation resolves, it's likely this will just resolve on its own. But it's always best to be thorough. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. A urine sample and a blood test… completely reasonable. I understand the need to be thorough. Where would you like me to provide the sample, and is there any specific preparation I need to do for the blood test? I would like to make sure I do everything correctly.
DOCTOR: There’s a cup in the bathroom. Just a clean catch, mid-stream. And for the blood test, you don’t need to do anything special. No need to fast. Just drink plenty of water beforehand. The nurse will draw it right here in the office once you're ready. We’ll get the results back within a few days. In the meantime, try increasing your fiber intake and drinking plenty of fluids. And if things don't improve, or if you develop any fever, pain, or blood in your urine, call the office immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, perfectly clear. Clean catch mid-stream, increased fiber, plenty of fluids, and contact you immediately if any new symptoms develop. I will head to the restroom now to provide the sample. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I feel much more at ease knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: Right. Let the nurse know when you're done. We’ll get the paperwork started.
PATIENT: Certainly. I will do that now. Thank you again, Doctor.
