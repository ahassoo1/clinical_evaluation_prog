DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um… hello. My husband… he make appointment. I… not really sure why. Just… education, he say. Something about… learning things? I work with metal… all day. Very busy.
DOCTOR: “Education,” is it?
PATIENT: Yes. He worry too much. Always. About… everything. Metal work is safe! I wear gloves. Mostly. He just… read something online, I think. He do that a lot.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, regardless of why you’re here, let’s make sure everything is alright. You say you work with metal all day. What kind of metal work do you do, specifically?
PATIENT: Sheet metal. For… buildings. Roofs, walls… you know. Big, flat pieces. Cut it, bend it, put it together. Heavy work. Sometimes I get… little cuts. Not bad. Mostly.
DOCTOR: And how long have you been doing this type of work?
PATIENT: Oh… long time. Maybe… ten years? Or… twelve? I not good with dates. Husband keep track of that. Since… before the baby, definitely.
DOCTOR: Approximately ten to twelve years. And aside from the occasional cuts you mentioned, have you noticed any other changes in your health since starting this work?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. My back… sometimes ache. A lot. Especially at end of day. And… I get tired. Very, very tired. But… everyone get tired, right? Work is hard.
DOCTOR: That's fair. Fatigue and back pain are common with physically demanding work. Let's explore this a bit further. When you say “ache,” can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It's… dull. Not sharp. Like… heavy weight on my back. And it… move. Sometimes in my hips too. Hard to explain. It just… is there. Especially after lifting the big sheets. I try to lift with my legs, but… it still hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness…? No. Not really. Sometimes… my feet feel cold. But it's cold in the shop sometimes! We work outside a lot. So… maybe that? I wear boots, good boots. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, while your husband may be concerned about something he read online, your description of back pain that radiates to your hips, coupled with fatigue, warrants a more thorough examination. I’d like to perform a physical assessment of your back and extremities, if that’s agreeable to you. We’ll start with your spine to assess range of motion and identify any areas of tenderness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Examine…? You think… something wrong? I just… work hard. Maybe I need… better gloves? Or a vacation. I don't like being poked and prodded. Especially my back. But… husband want me to be checked, so… okay. Fine. But make it quick.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat here on the table, facing forward. We'll start with a visual inspection, and then I'll gently palpate your spine to check for any areas of muscle spasm or tenderness. It shouldn’t be too uncomfortable, but please inform me immediately if you experience any sharp pain. I'm going to start by observing your posture. Could you please stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and relax your arms at your sides?
PATIENT: Fine. But be gentle. I told you. I have important things to do, you know. This is wasting time.
DOCTOR: I see. You have a slight forward head posture and your right shoulder appears to be elevated compared to your left. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, could you please bend forward at the waist and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ow. See? I told you. This is bad. Back hurts just doing this. What's wrong with my back?
DOCTOR: Alright. It appears you have limited flexibility in your lower back. Now, if you’ll allow me, I'm going to gently palpate your spine. I'll be feeling for areas of tenderness, muscle spasm, or bony abnormalities. Please let me know if anything is particularly uncomfortable. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ow! There! Yes! Right there. It's… sore. Very sore. And… a little to the left. It feels… tight. Like a knot. Leave it alone now. Don't push. I knew it. Something is wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. I appreciate you letting me know. That area does appear to be tender to the touch. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Please lie flat on your back. We’ll start with the patellar reflex. Do you have any history of knee problems?
PATIENT: Knee problems? No. Never. Just… work. Always work. And… I bumped my knee once, a long time ago. But it was nothing. Just hurry up now. This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m checking your knee reflex now. Your reflexes are… slightly diminished on the right side. Now I'll assess sensation in your legs. Can you feel me touching this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel it. But it's cold. Your hands are cold. Is the room cold? I need a blanket. This is ridiculous. What's wrong with my back, doctor? You've been poking around for ages now and haven’t said anything!
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I understand your frustration. I'm gathering information to form an accurate assessment. The diminished reflex on the right side, coupled with the tenderness in your lower back and your description of fatigue, is concerning. It is too early to give a definitive diagnosis but I suspect that you may have a lumbar strain, potentially with nerve compression. However, to rule out more serious causes, I’d like to order some imaging. I recommend an X-ray of your lumbar spine and possibly an MRI if the X-ray does not provide a clear picture. Would you be amenable to those?
PATIENT: Imaging…? X-ray…? MRI…? What’s wrong with me now?! Is it… serious? My husband will be furious if I need… expensive tests. He just wanted me to… learn things. Not get poked and prodded and have pictures taken! No. I don't want pictures taken. I just want my back to stop hurting. Is there… a pill you can give me? Something to make it better? I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I understand your concerns. While a pill may provide temporary relief, it won't address the underlying cause of your pain. Without knowing the extent of the problem, I cannot responsibly prescribe long-term medication. To get a definitive diagnosis, and to formulate the most effective treatment plan, the imaging is crucial. I can explore options for financial assistance with the imaging, and we can discuss the least expensive alternatives. However, I strongly advise against foregoing these tests, as ignoring a potential problem could lead to more serious complications in the future. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Financial assistance…? My husband will… not be happy. He thinks I waste money. But… if it’s not expensive… and it makes my back better… Fine. But quickly. And tell me if it will make me tired. I need to work. But no pictures of anything internal. Just… the bones. And… make sure the person taking the pictures is gentle. This is a waste of time. But… alright. Do what you have to do. But I’m still getting a pill for the pain. Right now.
