DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Brum, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Mitchell Brum. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor... Overgaard, you said?
DOCTOR: Overgaard. Ledarius Overgaard. Yes. Well, Mr. Brum, at ninety years young, you’ve certainly seen a few things. But pleasantries aside, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: My head… the back of my head hurts. It started a few days ago. Not so bad at first, just a little ache. But now… it's more. Like a heavy weight, you know? It makes it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A headache, starting a few days ago, now more of a…heavy weight feeling. And it’s interfering with sleep. Alright. Can you tell me a little more about this ache?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. Not a sharp pain, never like that. More like… a dull throb. It’s always there, at the back. Sometimes it feels like it goes up the back of my neck a little. And like I said, it’s worse when I try to sleep. Laying down seems to make it feel heavier. I used to work with the trains, you know? Lots of bending and looking up. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Trains, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. For… a long time. Rail yard work. Dinkey operators, hostlers… moving the cars around. Lots of heavy lifting and being outside in all kinds of weather. I retired maybe… twenty years ago now? It was good work, though. Hard, but good. I don’t think I ever told a doctor about this before. It’s just… I’ve always been a tough old man. But this headache… it won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "tough old man" or not, ignoring things doesn’t make them disappear. Twenty years retired… that's a long time, and a lot of wear and tear on the body. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Has anything specifically made it worse recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really… nothing I can think of. I’ve been mostly staying inside, it’s been very hot lately. Maybe… maybe getting a little dehydrated? I try to drink water, but sometimes I forget. Old age, you know? It happens. I haven't fallen or hit my head, if that’s what you’re thinking. Just… the headache. It’s just there. And getting worse, slow like.
DOCTOR: Alright. Dehydration is certainly a possibility, and forgetfulness… well, it happens to the best of us. Now, let’s talk about other things you might be experiencing. Any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… no, not really. Everything looks… blurry sometimes, but that's just my old eyes, I think. I’ve had glasses for years, and they don’t seem to be getting any better. No spots or flashing lights, nothing like that. Just… everything is a little fuzzy around the edges, you know? Like looking through a dirty window. Has been that way for a long time. I don't think it’s changed with the headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fuzzy vision, consistent with age. No new changes. Any nausea or vomiting with the headache?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No sickness at all. No throwing up, no feeling like I’m going to. Just… the headache. And a little tired. I sleep okay, when I can sleep, but I don’t feel rested when I wake up. Maybe that’s just being an old man, too. I used to eat everything, but my appetite isn’t as good these days. Not much taste to things anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. No nausea, no vomiting, decreased appetite. Let's move onto some other areas. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Sometimes my hands feel a little shaky, especially when I try to write. And my legs get tired when I walk too much. But I just figured that was from getting old, you know? I don’t fall, and I can still get around okay. It's just… slower now. I used to be able to lift heavy things, but now… not so much. Everything takes more effort. I haven’t noticed anything new with that though, just the usual old man stuff.
DOCTOR: “Usual old man stuff,” right. Well, let's rule some things out. Do you have any problems with your balance?
PATIENT: Balance… no, not really. I haven’t fallen, like I said. I still walk steady, mostly. Sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast, but that doesn’t happen very often. My wife… she passed away a few years ago, and she used to worry about me falling, but I’ve always been pretty good with my balance. I used to work on the trains, you know? Lots of walking on uneven ground. That keeps you steady. I don’t think my balance is any worse now than it used to be. But thank you for asking, Doctor. You are very thorough.
DOCTOR: Thoroughness is a virtue, Mr. Brum. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills. Never have. My wife… she used to take a few things for her blood pressure, but I never needed any. I tried some of those over-the-counter pain relievers for the headache, but they didn’t do much good. Just made my stomach feel bad. So I stopped taking them. I prefer to just tough it out, you know? Like I said, I’m an old man. I’ve been through worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. Now, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, touched everything, been stung by everything. Never had a reaction. I’m pretty tough, you know? My wife used to say I was like a goat. Ate anything and everything. Never had a problem. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing. Just a tough old man. Thank you for asking, though. You are very careful.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Brum, despite your…robustness, this headache warrants a closer look. I'm going to perform a quick neurological exam. It will involve me checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A neurological exam? Hmm. Sounds… serious. But if you think it's best, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I’ve never had one of those before. What exactly will you be doing? I don't want you poking around too much! Just an old man, remember? But yes, if you think it will help, go ahead. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible, Mr. Brum. It's just a series of simple tests. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms and legs. I'm going to tap on your tendons with this little hammer. It won't hurt, but let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds… okay. A little hammer, you say? Alright. Just try not to hit me too hard! I’m a bit creaky, you know. Go ahead. I’ll try to relax. But I’m a bit worried now. What are you looking for, exactly? Is this something serious? I hope it’s not my brain, you know? My wife… she always worried about things like that. But go ahead, I’ll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Just a routine check, Mr. Brum. Assessing your reflexes helps me understand how your nervous system is functioning. Now, let's check the other side. Both responses are… diminished, but equal. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can.
PATIENT: Okay, I squeezed your hands as tight as I can, Doctor. Not as strong as they used to be, I’ll admit. I used to have a very strong grip, working with the trains, you know? Lots of pulling and lifting. But it's not what it used to be. Everything gets weaker with age. This is a bit nerve-wracking though. What are you finding? Is it something bad? I hope it's not my brain, Doctor. Please tell me it's not my brain. My wife… she was always a worrier.
DOCTOR: Strength is… slightly reduced, but again, equal on both sides. Don’t worry, Mr. Brum. I’m not making any definitive conclusions yet. It's just part of the process. Now, I'm going to check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Okay, touching my nose. There. Not as accurate as I used to be, I’ll admit. My hands are a little shaky, you know? And my vision isn’t what it used to be. Is that bad, Doctor? Is my brain okay? I’m really starting to worry now. My wife… she always said I should get more check-ups. I never listened. But please tell me it’s nothing serious. Just old age, right? Just an old man getting old?
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's try the other hand. A little unsteady, but not alarming. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. Just to assess your memory. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date… hmm. Let me think. It’s… August… August… Oh dear. Is it the 2nd? August the 2nd? Yes, I think it’s August the 2nd. 2025, right? Yes, August the 2nd, 2025. I think. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know? Sometimes I forget things. It's just old age. I hope I got that right. Is that okay, Doctor? I don’t want to mess up the test. My wife… she always said I was good with dates. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Now, can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: The current President… oh dear. That’s a tricky one. Let me think… Hmm… Is it… Biden? Yes, I think it's Biden. Joe Biden. Is that right, Doctor? I try to keep up with things, but it’s hard, you know? So much going on in the world. I hope I got that right. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. My wife… she always read the newspaper. But I… I mostly watch the trains go by.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Based on the neurological exam and your reported symptoms, I’m concerned about possible cognitive impairment. The diminished reflexes, slight weakness, and some difficulty with recall warrant further investigation. It’s too early to say definitively what's going on, but we need to rule out some potential causes.
PATIENT: Cognitive… impairment? What does that mean, Doctor? Is that… bad? Is that… my brain? Oh dear. My wife… she always worried about my brain. She said I should get more check-ups. I never listened. Is it… serious? Will I… will I forget things? Will I… not know who anyone is? Oh dear. Please tell me it’s not too serious. Is there something you can do? Is there a pill I can take? Please, Doctor, tell me what’s going on. I'm really scared now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, let's not jump to conclusions. “Cognitive impairment” simply means there’s a change in your thinking and memory. It can be caused by many things – vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, even dehydration. It doesn’t automatically mean it’s something serious, or that you’ll lose your memory completely. However, it's important to investigate to determine the cause and rule out anything concerning. I'm going to order some blood tests to check for deficiencies and other potential issues. I also recommend a brain scan – a CT scan or MRI – to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It’s also important to consider a cognitive assessment with a specialist – a neurologist or neuropsychologist – to get a more thorough evaluation of your thinking skills. I’m going to refer you to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurologist in the city. She’s very good and will be able to help us determine the best course of action. I'll also provide you with a list of resources for support and information. And to answer your question, there are medications that can sometimes help with cognitive symptoms, but they aren't always necessary, and it depends on the cause. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done and finding out what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Oh dear. A brain scan… that sounds scary, Doctor. A neurologist… more doctors. I just want to go home, you know? I just want to be left alone. But… if you think it’s best, I suppose I’ll do it. For my wife… she would want me to. Dr. Eleanor Vance… is she nice? Will she be gentle? I don’t like strangers poking around. Resources… what kind of resources? Support… I don’t know if I need support, you know? I’m a tough old man. But… if you think it will help, I’ll look at the list. Yes… tests, a neurologist, resources… if you think it’s best, I’ll do it. But please, Doctor, hurry up. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Brum. It's never easy facing uncertainty, and I assure you, Dr. Vance is very compassionate and gentle. She’ll explain everything thoroughly and answer all your questions. We’ll schedule the tests and the appointment at your convenience. As for the resources, it’s simply a list of organizations that provide information and support for people experiencing cognitive changes, and their families. You're not obligated to use them, but they can be helpful if you ever need them. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and give you the paperwork for the blood tests and the referral to Dr. Vance. She'll also schedule the appointment for you. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest. Try to engage in activities that you enjoy – reading, listening to music, or spending time with loved ones. I’ll also prescribe a multivitamin to address any potential deficiencies. Now, let’s get this paperwork sorted. Sarah will be in shortly. And Mr. Brum, please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help you every step of the way. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Paperwork… multivitamin… Sarah… I’ll do it. But please… hurry up. I just want to go home. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for trying to help. But please… hurry up.
