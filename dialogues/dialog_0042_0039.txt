DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Seems like a nice place you got here. I got a letter from the lab… somethin’ about my cholesterol bein’ a little high. That’s what the nurse told me, anyway. I don’t really understand all that stuff, to be honest. Just know it weren't good.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bohnett. It’s good to hear you’re comfortable here. And you’re right to ask questions – medical things can be confusing! High cholesterol is something we want to take a look at. Just to be clear, the nurse mentioned a recent lab report. Do you recall when you had those blood tests done, and were they done here at the clinic, or somewhere else?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was… oh, about a month ago now, I reckon. Maybe a little more. And no, it weren’t here. I go to that big lab over by the hospital – the one with all the chairs and the magazines. They send the results to my primary care doc, and he’s the one that sent me this way. Don’t remember the exact date though, sorry. I’m gettin’ old, things slip my mind, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bohnett, that’s perfectly understandable. No need to apologize at all. A month ago, alright. We can certainly pull those records if needed. Now, has your previous doctor discussed what specifically was high with your cholesterol?
PATIENT: He mentioned somethin’ about the “bad” cholesterol bein’ too high, and the “good” cholesterol bein’ a little low. He used a lot of big words, and honestly, I just nodded and smiled. He said I should see someone who specializes in this kind of thing, and gave me your name. He didn’t really explain what it meant or what I needed to do about it. Just said it could cause trouble if I didn’t get it checked out. Troubles with my heart, I think he said. It worried me a bit, naturally.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Bohnett. It sounds like your primary care doctor was right to refer you – we do want to understand this better and make sure we’re taking appropriate steps. You're right to be concerned, but we’ll take things one step at a time. So, to get a clearer picture, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had a bit of trouble with high blood pressure a few years back, maybe ten years ago? They put me on some pills for it, and I took ‘em for a while. I don’t take ‘em anymore, though. Doctor said I was doin’ alright and we could stop. Other than that, no, nothin’ much. I’ve been pretty healthy for an old fella, if I do say so myself. I used to be a carpenter, so I was always movin’ around. Kept me strong, I think. Though my knees aren’t what they used to be…
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy, Mr. Bohnett, and staying active as a carpenter certainly helps! And that’s important information about the high blood pressure in the past. Do you recall the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… now that’s a tough one. My memory ain’t what it used to be, you know? It was a little white pill… I think it started with an “A”? Or maybe a “B”? I really can’t remember. I just know my primary care doc took me off of it after a few years. He said it was doing the trick, and I didn't need it anymore. Honestly, I try not to worry too much about the names of pills. I just take ‘em when the doctor tells me to.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bohnett. We can absolutely look that up in your records. Don’t worry about remembering the names. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine things?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Years ago, when I was a young man, I broke my arm fallin’ off a roof. Carpenterin’ accident. They set it in a cast and everything. That was… oh, must have been sixty years ago now. Other than that, no, I haven’t had any surgeries. And I haven't been in the hospital overnight except for when my wife… well, when my wife passed away. That was… a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Bohnett. That must have been a very difficult time. Now, thinking about your family, is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – who has had problems with heart disease, high cholesterol, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, my father… he had a bit of trouble with his heart later in life. He had some chest pains, and they said it was somethin’ to do with his arteries being clogged up. He didn’t take care of himself very well, always smokin’ and eatin’ rich foods. He passed away when I was still a young man, so I don't know all the details. My mother, she lived to be a good age and was always healthy as a horse. Never had any problems. And my sister… she’s still alive, but we don’t see each other much. I don’t know much about her health either.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I never smoked. Never had the taste for it. My wife, bless her heart, she tried it once when she was young, but didn't care for it either. Always thought it was a foolish habit. I always told my friends to quit, too, and a few of 'em actually listened.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Bohnett. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, I used to enjoy a beer with dinner now and then, but I haven't had much lately. My appetite ain't what it used to be, you know? Just don’t have the same desire for it. Maybe a glass of wine around the holidays, but that's about it. Never been a big drinker, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, I take a little vitamin D every day. Doctor said I wasn't gettin' enough sunshine, and it was good for my bones. That’s about it. No other medications or anything like that. Just the vitamin D.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. That gives me a good overall picture of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve always been a pretty open book when it comes to doctors. Figured the more they know, the better. Don't mind a bit of pokin' and proddin' if it helps.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, if you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. I can hear a regular rhythm, but I do notice a slight murmur. It’s quite faint, but it’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on. No abnormal sounds noted in your lungs. Now, your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. We'll want to monitor that over time. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or abnormalities felt. Your pulses are good and strong in all extremities. Alright, Mr. Bohnett, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems generally okay, but the murmur and elevated blood pressure are things we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Well, that don’t sound too bad, Doctor. A murmur, you say? Never had one of those before. And my blood pressure bein’ a little high… I reckon it could be from worryin’ about this cholesterol business. So, what’s the next step? More tests? What kinda tests are we talkin' about? I'm just tryin’ to get a feel for what we’re dealin’ with here.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Mr. Bohnett. It’s good you’re being proactive. The murmur is something we'll want to investigate with an echocardiogram – that’s an ultrasound of your heart. It will give us a clearer picture of its structure and function. And to get a better handle on the cholesterol, I’d like to order a comprehensive lipid panel. This will give us a detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels – the “good” cholesterol, the “bad” cholesterol, and other important fats in your blood. We should also run a basic metabolic panel, just to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels. That will give us a more complete picture of your overall health. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds like a lot of tests, Doctor, but I reckon it’s best to be thorough. If that’s what you recommend, then I’m all for it. I just want to get this sorted out and get back to livin’ my life, you know? So, yes, go ahead and order those tests. What do I need to do? Do I need to fast beforehand? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Bohnett. I understand wanting to get this sorted out. Yes, for the lipid panel, it is important to fast for 12 hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks other than water. We can schedule you for a blood draw here at the clinic tomorrow morning, before you eat breakfast. The echocardiogram can be scheduled at the hospital’s cardiology department. I’ll have my nurse give you a referral and the hospital’s contact information. They’ll schedule an appointment that works best for your schedule. I’ll also have my nurse provide you with written instructions for the fasting requirements and a list of any other preparations you might need to make. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly manageable, Doctor. Tomorrow morning for the blood work, and then I’ll call the hospital to schedule the echocardiogram. I can handle that. My daughter always tells me I’m good at managin’ things. One last thing, Doctor… will these tests cost me much? I’m on a fixed income, you know, and I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Mr. Bohnett, and I’m glad you asked. Unfortunately, these tests do have a cost associated with them. Let me check with our billing department and see what the estimated cost will be for you as a self-pay patient. I can also explore whether there are any financial assistance programs or discounts available to help offset the cost. And I'll be upfront about the costs before proceeding with any tests. My nurse will be happy to discuss payment options with you as well. We want to make sure you get the care you need without putting undue financial strain on you. Let me get that information for you now.
PATIENT: That would be mighty kind of you, Doctor. I appreciate you lookin’ into that for me. I don’t want to be caught off guard by a big bill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett, I’ve spoken with our billing department. The estimated cost for the lipid panel and basic metabolic panel is $150, and the echocardiogram is approximately $300. We do offer a 10% discount for self-pay patients, bringing the total to $400. I can also provide you with a payment plan option if needed. Additionally, I'm going to speak with our social worker to see if there are any local resources or assistance programs that might be able to help cover some of the costs. It’s worth exploring all options. Would you like me to have my nurse discuss the payment plan options with you, and also connect you with our social worker?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… that’s a bit more than I was hopin’ for, but I reckon it’s not unreasonable. A payment plan would probably be best, so I don’t have to come up with all that money at once. And yes, connectin’ me with the social worker sounds like a good idea too. Can’t hurt to check what help is available. Thank you for bein’ so thorough and explainin’ everything so clearly, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease knowin’ you’re lookin’ out for me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. That’s my job, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and discuss the payment plan options with you and provide you with contact information for our social worker. Just to recap, we've scheduled the blood work for tomorrow morning, fasting for 12 hours beforehand. We'll get you scheduled for the echocardiogram at the hospital. And Sarah will help you with the financial aspects of the tests. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll see you tomorrow morning for the blood work, then. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember to fast before your blood work tomorrow morning. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. We’ll see you tomorrow morning, and we’ll get this sorted out. Have a good rest of your day.
