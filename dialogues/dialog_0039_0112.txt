DOCTOR: Hello Keoni, welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very kind of you to see me. Um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve just been… going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, and it’s… disruptive. I’m not sure what’s causing it, and I was hoping you could help. I don’t… really remember when it started, exactly. Just… gradually, over time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is disruptive when something like that happens. And it’s good you came in to get it checked out – no need to be embarrassed at all, these things happen. “A lot” is… vague, and I apologize for asking, but can you give me a rough idea of how many times a day you’re going to the bathroom compared to, say, a few months ago?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. A few months ago… probably about, oh, four or five times a day? Perhaps six on a busier day. Now… it feels like every couple of hours. Sometimes more frequently, especially if I’m drinking water, which is… not ideal, I suppose. I honestly haven’t kept a precise count. It’s just… a lot more than it used to be. I apologize for not having a better answer. It all feels a bit… hazy, if I’m truthful.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Keoni. It's perfectly normal to not keep track of these things! Gradual changes like that can be harder to pinpoint. So, about every two hours… and does drinking water seem to make it worse, or just not help?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely makes it worse, I think. Or, rather, it makes me feel like I need to go more often. Even if I haven't had a large amount to drink, just having something… anything… seems to trigger it. It’s quite bothersome when I’m out, honestly. I find myself… constantly searching for restrooms. It’s a bit… unsettling. I don’t recall this ever happening before my divorce, but… memories are unreliable, aren't they? Perhaps it was always like this, and I simply didn't notice.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you’re right, memories can be tricky. It’s good you're paying attention to how it feels now. Okay, so increased frequency with fluid intake, and it’s impacting your daily activities. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… not exactly pain, Doctor. But there is… a bit of a stinging sensation, sometimes. Mostly just at the very end, when I'm finished. It doesn’t last long, and it's not severe, but it's… uncomfortable. It’s not present every time, though. Perhaps every other time, or less frequently. It’s difficult to say for certain. I don’t… enjoy describing this, if I’m honest. It feels… a bit invasive.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Keoni, and you're not alone in feeling that way. It's perfectly alright to feel uncomfortable talking about this. And I appreciate you sharing all this with me. Okay, so intermittent stinging at the end of urination. Now, is there any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh dear. I… I don’t think so. I haven't noticed anything. But… I haven't been paying close attention, perhaps. It’s… a frightening thought. I really try not to look. It’s difficult for me to… examine things like that. I apologize. It sounds foolish, I know. I just… I don’t have a very strong stomach. Would a test… reveal that? If there was any? I feel so very silly asking all these questions.
DOCTOR: No, you're not silly at all, Keoni. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious and prefer not to examine things like that. And yes, a simple urine test – a urinalysis – would definitely reveal if there was any blood present. We can do that right here in the clinic. It's a very quick and painless procedure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… tremendously helpful. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I just… I want to understand what’s happening. And perhaps… have it stop. The constant trips to the restroom are… exhausting. If a test can help, then yes, please. I would be very grateful. Do I need to… prepare in any way? Or is it simply a matter of providing a sample?
DOCTOR: Yes, a urine sample is all we need. I'll give you a cup, and there's a private restroom just down the hall. I’ll provide clear instructions, but essentially you just need to collect a mid-stream sample – meaning you start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup mid-stream. Don’t worry, it’s very straightforward. I’ll give you a few moments privacy, and then we’ll send it to the lab for analysis. It usually takes a few minutes to get the results. Let me just quickly check your height and weight, and then I'll get you set up for the sample collection.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. That sounds… manageable. I suppose I’m mostly apprehensive, but… I trust your judgment. And I am glad you are willing to investigate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, just step on the scale when you're ready, and I’ll jot down the number. I'm just collecting some basic information. And please, don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns at all.
PATIENT: Fifty-nine kilograms. Though… I suspect I’ve gained a little recently. Stress, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Fifty-nine kilograms noted. And it's very common to see fluctuations in weight with stress, so don't worry about that too much. Alright, let’s get you settled in to collect that sample. The restroom is just down the hall, first door on the right. I’ve left a collection cup and some instructions on the counter. Take your time, and let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I… I'll try to be quick.
