DOCTOR: Hi Arbie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good to meet you. Well, it's about my… well, my business. Been a pilot my whole life, you know. And a man’s gotta keep his business regular, wouldn’t you say? It ain’t regular now. There was… red in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be concerning. Especially for a man of my… experience.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You've noticed some red in your stool and you're understandably concerned, especially given your history as a pilot – keeping things “regular,” as you put it. That's good you brought it to my attention. When did you first notice this, Arbie?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you go making a fuss over the pilot thing. It just means a man pays attention to details. And I do. It was… let me think. Three days ago, maybe? Yes, three days. Tuesday. After my usual breakfast, you see. Toast and tea. Though I doubt that’s the culprit. A man can’t live on just water, can he?
DOCTOR: No, certainly not. And paying attention to details is excellent. Three days ago, Tuesday, after breakfast. Was the red bright red, dark red, or something else?
PATIENT: Bright, I’d say. Not like… well, not dark and old-looking. Fresh, if you catch my drift. Like… well, like a drop of raspberry jam, maybe? Though I haven’t had raspberry jam in years. Too sweet for my liking. Point is, it wasn't dried up, understand? That makes a difference, doesn’t it? A man knows his… output.
DOCTOR: It does make a difference, yes. Bright red blood suggests the bleeding is likely lower in the digestive tract – colon or rectum. We'll need to investigate to pinpoint the source. Have you experienced any pain, cramping, or changes in your bowel habits besides the blood?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not exactly pain. A bit of discomfort, maybe. Old age, you know. Things don’t work like they used to. And no, the… schedule hasn’t changed much. Just the… colour. Everything else is as it should be. Solid. Regular, mostly. Though I did feel a bit winded on the stairs this morning. But that’s probably just… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant change in bowel habits, just some discomfort and a little shortness of breath this morning. The shortness of breath is new, right?
PATIENT: Newish. It happens sometimes. After a bit of exertion, usually. Climbing the stairs, carrying groceries… things a man used to do without a second thought. Doesn’t last long. Just… a bit of wheezing, that’s all. Probably just… getting old. It’s not related to the… other thing, is it? I doubt a bit of windedness has anything to do with… well, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mention the shortness of breath, even if you don't think it’s related. It's important to consider everything. While it may be related to age, it’s also possible it could be connected, or something entirely separate. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmph. A few aches and pains, of course. Old war wound, years ago. Nothing serious. Doctor poked and prodded, patched me up, sent me on my way. Divorced my wife, if that counts as a condition. Never been much for doctors, to be honest. Waste of time, half the time. Never had anything serious wrong with me. Good constitution, you see. Haida blood. Strong stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and I appreciate you sharing that. A good constitution is certainly a benefit. The war wound… do you recall what it was, and when it happened?
PATIENT: Oh, it was… ages ago. Korea. Shrapnel in the leg. Nothing they couldn’t dig out. ’52, I think. ’53, maybe. Doesn’t bother me none anymore. A bit of stiffness sometimes, especially in cold weather. But it’s not the reason I’m here, doctor. This… business… is what’s concerning me. Not a bit of old shrapnel.
DOCTOR: Okay, shrapnel wound to the leg in Korea in '52 or '53. And it doesn't cause you any current trouble. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the leg, when they took the shrapnel out. Nothing fancy. Local anesthetic, a bit of poking around, a bandage. In and out in an hour. Doctor said I was lucky. Lucky to be alive, he said. I’ve always been a practical man, you see. Don't need a lot of fuss made over things.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other surgeries. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or have you taken any recently?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. Never been much for pills and potions. A bit of aspirin now and then for a headache, maybe. But that’s it. A man should be able to get by on his own two feet, you know? And a bit of common sense. No fancy drugs for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, just aspirin occasionally. And no allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. I’ve spent my life breathing airplane fumes and eating questionable airline food. If I was allergic to something, I’d know about it by now. No, no allergies. A hardy constitution, remember? Haida blood. Strong stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. No allergies. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have had any medical conditions, particularly anything related to the digestive system, like colon cancer, or bleeding problems?
PATIENT: Family history? Now there’s a story. My mother… she died young. Consumption, they said. A wasting sickness. My father… a fisherman. Died at sea. A storm, they said. Brother… well, he went off to Vancouver, never heard from him again. As for illnesses… can’t say I remember any fancy diseases. A bit of a cough here and there. But nothing like… this. They weren’t ones for doctors, either. Practical folk.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of consumption in your mother, your father died at sea, and your brother went missing. No known history of digestive issues or bleeding problems. Now, I’d like to do a quick exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll need to do a rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. A rectal exam, you say? Well, I suppose. Though I can’t say I’m thrilled about it. A man’s privacy, you know? But if it’s necessary… Alright. Just get it over with quickly, will you? And no poking around unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie on your side with your knees bent. This will help me get a good look and feel for any potential issues. I’ll explain everything as I go. Alright, I’m just going to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This may feel slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. …I'm noting some… decreased tone in the anal sphincter. And… there's a small amount of heme-positive stool present. No obvious masses felt at this time, but there is some tenderness on the left side. I’m also noting some internal hemorrhoids, which could be contributing to the bleeding. Your prostate feels normal in size and consistency. Okay, that's all done. I’ll remove the glove now.
PATIENT: Hmph. Tender, you say? Well, I told you. Old age, probably. Internal… what-now? Hemorrhoids? Sounds unpleasant. So, what does it mean, doctor? Is it serious? Don't go beating around the bush. A man’s got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbie. The tenderness could be from the hemorrhoids or something else. Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the rectum and anus, and they're a common cause of bleeding. However, the tenderness and the heme-positive stool mean we need to investigate further to rule out other possibilities, such as diverticulitis, or even, though less likely given your age and the bright red blood, colon cancer. Given your history, I recommend a colonoscopy. It’s the best way to visualize the entire colon and identify the source of the bleeding. I'm also going to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of anemia. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy, you say? Sounds… invasive. And a complete what-now? Look, doctor, I’m not keen on poking and prodding. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t we just… take something for the hemorrhoids? A cream or a pill? I’d rather avoid all this fuss if possible. A man of my age doesn’t bounce back like he used to.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Arbie. A colonoscopy does involve preparation, and it's not the most pleasant procedure. However, given the bleeding and the tenderness, it's the safest way to get a definitive answer. We need to rule out anything serious. Ignoring it could lead to complications down the road. While a cream or pill might alleviate some of the hemorrhoid symptoms, it won’t address the underlying cause of the bleeding. It's important to find out why you're bleeding. I would like to schedule the colonoscopy as soon as possible. It's typically done with sedation, so you won’t feel anything during the procedure. The CBC will give us a baseline to compare against if further testing is needed. Would you be open to scheduling a consultation with a gastroenterologist?
PATIENT: Hmph. A gastroenterologist, now? More doctors poking around… I swear, it’s a conspiracy. Alright, alright. Fine. Schedule the… colonoscopy. But I want it done quickly, and I want as little fuss as possible. And I want to know exactly what I’m getting into. No surprises. And what about this sedation? Will I be out of it for long? A man has appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbie. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to make the process as smooth as possible. I'll schedule the colonoscopy with Dr. Lee, a highly recommended gastroenterologist. They’ll explain the procedure in detail, and answer any questions you have. The sedation is typically mild – you'll feel relaxed and sleepy, but you won't be fully unconscious. You'll need someone to drive you home afterward, as you won't be able to drive yourself. It typically takes a few hours to fully recover from the sedation, and you may feel a little groggy for the rest of the day. I’ll also give you written instructions on the bowel preparation you'll need to do before the procedure. It’s not pleasant, but it’s essential for a clear view of the colon. I’ll also write you a referral to Dr. Lee and order the CBC. Before you leave, do you have any allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, as I said. And no, no other conditions. Just an old man with a bit of… business. Look, doctor, I appreciate you not dismissing it entirely. But don’t go expecting anything too serious. Probably just the hemorrhoids. Still… I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. When will I hear from this… Lee? And how long will this whole process take? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re right to want to be proactive, and I agree it's likely related to the hemorrhoids, but we need to rule out anything more serious. Dr. Lee’s office will contact you within the next few business days to schedule the colonoscopy. Typically, it takes about a week to get an appointment, and the preparation will take 24 hours before the procedure. The procedure itself only takes about 30-60 minutes. I’ll also give you a printout with information on hemorrhoid care while you wait for your appointment. This may help alleviate some of your discomfort. Do you have any questions about the referral, the CBC, or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just get the paperwork sorted quickly, and let me get on with my life. And tell this… Lee… to be gentle. An old man’s dignity, you know. Thank you, doctor. I suppose. .
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll make a note of your concerns regarding the procedure. I hope everything goes smoothly for you, Arbie. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and please take care. .
