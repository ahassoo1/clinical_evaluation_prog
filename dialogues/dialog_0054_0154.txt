DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Dashevsky, you say? Yes… well, it’s this… this trouble I’ve been having. Down there. It keeps… coming back. The waterworks, you know? It’s very bothersome. I don’t recall exactly when it started, just that it has been… a while. A while, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing some bothersome issues with your urinary system – trouble with your waterworks, as you put it, and it's been ongoing for some time. When you say it keeps coming back, could you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Describe… yes. It’s a… a burning. A stinging, really. When I… go to the bathroom. And then… the urge. The need to go again very soon after. It’s not a comfortable feeling, I can tell you that. It’s just… unpleasant. I don't know… is that helpful? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Wease. Burning and stinging with urination, and a frequent urge to go – that certainly gives me a better idea of what’s going on. And is there any pain in your lower abdomen, or in your back?
PATIENT: Hmm… lower abdomen… back… let me think. Sometimes, yes. A dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, you understand. More like… a tiredness in the muscles. But it comes and goes. It’s not constant. Honestly, Doctor, I have trouble remembering these things. It all feels… muddled, if you don't mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Wease. It’s perfectly understandable to have trouble remembering details, especially when you’re dealing with a long-term issue. A dull ache in your lower abdomen and back, coming and going, is good to know. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any unusual discharge?
PATIENT: Blood… discharge… Oh my. Well, I think… maybe once or twice I saw a little… pinkish tinge. It wasn’t much. I just… thought it was something I ate. Or maybe I was mistaken. It was a long time ago, I believe. And no, no discharge. Certainly not. Just… the burning. Mostly the burning.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible pinkish tinge in your urine a while back, but no discharge, and the primary symptom is still the burning. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… Let me see… I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. And… I think I had high blood pressure, for a bit. But it went down with… diet, I think. And I had a bad fall once, broke my wrist. But that was a long time ago, too. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good at remembering all these things. It's a bit of a blur, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Ms. Wease. No need to worry about remembering everything precisely. So, gallbladder removal, a history of high blood pressure that was managed with diet, and a broken wrist in the past. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not any medications. I try to avoid them if I can. I take a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up, but that’s it. Just a cream, you know? Rub it on. Nothing you swallow. I don't like taking pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a cream for arthritis, as needed, and nothing else you take regularly. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get a little itchy when I ate strawberries, when I was a girl, but I haven’t had strawberries in… well, decades, I suppose. Nothing serious, though. No trouble breathing, or anything like that. Just a little itch. And it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild reaction to strawberries in the past, but nothing current or serious. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if you're comfortable with that. Has anyone in your family had any kidney problems, bladder cancer, or similar medical issues?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That's a hard one. My mother… she had a lot of aches and pains, but I don't recall anything specific about kidneys or bladders. My father… he passed away when I was young. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents, to be honest. We didn't talk about these things much. I’m sorry I can’t be of more help.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Wease. It's common not to have a complete family medical history. Alright, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he used to smoke, but I always made him go outside. It’s a nasty habit. I don't care for it at all.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing much. A small glass, you understand. Mostly red wine. For the… the antioxidants, they say. I don't drink very often, though. Perhaps once or twice a week.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of red wine once or twice a week. Now, one last question about your lifestyle. Could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A typical day… Well, I wake up, have a little coffee, read the newspaper. I live alone, you see. I do a bit of gardening, when the weather is nice. I try to keep busy. I watch television in the evening. Mostly… news and cooking shows. And then I go to bed. It's not very exciting, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wease. That gives me a good understanding of your daily life. Okay, I see here you've had a few visits for similar complaints in the past, a couple of years ago, and were told to increase your fluid intake. No significant findings on previous exams were documented. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a gentle external exam. This will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Another exam… Yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but… I want to feel better, you see. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a… a hair appointment later.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I understand. It won’t take long, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’ll just listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then a quick external exam. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t hear any unusual sounds. No tenderness to the touch here. There's some mild discomfort when I press here, on your lower abdomen, but no obvious masses or abnormalities. Okay, Ms. Wease. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing symptoms of a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, to be certain, we need to do a urine test to check for bacteria. I’m also going to order a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A urine test… and a blood test? Yes, I suppose so. If that’s what you think is best. But… will it hurt? I don't like needles very much, you see. And I really mustn't be late for my appointment.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Wease. The urine test is painless – you’ll just need to provide a sample in a cup. The blood test will involve a small prick of the finger, just a tiny amount of blood. It shouldn’t hurt much at all, just a quick pinch. And we'll be as quick as possible, I promise. We can do the urine test right here in the clinic. For the blood test, we can get that done quickly and I'll get the results sent to me as soon as they are available. If you're ready, I'll give you a cup and instructions for the urine sample. Then we'll get the blood test done quickly. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A finger prick… well. Alright. As long as it’s quick. Yes, let’s get it over with, shall we? The sooner I have these tests done, the sooner I can get back to my life. A cup, you say? Show me. And please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. Here’s the cup, and these instructions explain how to collect the sample. Just try to get a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, and then collect the sample about halfway through. Then we'll perform the finger prick. Please take your time, and let me know when you’re finished. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Alright. A mid-stream… I think I understand. It’s just… a little embarrassing, isn’t it? Still… I suppose it has to be done. I’ll be as quick as I can.
