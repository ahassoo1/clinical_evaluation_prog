DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been… forgetting things. Not like, where I put my keys every day, but… important stuff. That’s why I made an appointment. It’s been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. It’s always best to address these concerns. "Important stuff" – can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A few weeks ago, I completely forgot a friend's birthday. I usually never forget those. And then last week, I was telling a story and… the middle part just vanished. Like it never happened. It’s little things, but they’re adding up. It’s not constant, but… it’s scary.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, these are relatively new occurrences, a few weeks to a month, and it's not happening every day?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. It hasn’t been every day, thank goodness. And it feels… different than just being distracted. Like the memory isn’t even there to recall. Does that make sense? I don’t know if I’m explaining it well.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Heidenthal. You're explaining it perfectly well. It sounds like you're noticing gaps, rather than simply being unable to focus. Okay. Let's try to get a bit more of a picture here. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, sleep, or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I haven’t been sleeping great, if that makes sense. Not tossing and turning all night, but maybe waking up a couple of times. Appetite is normal, I think. And my mood… I’ve been a little more anxious, probably because of the forgetting. I wouldn’t say depressed, just… on edge. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Okay, and have you noticed any difficulties with anything else?
PATIENT: Like… what do you mean? Anything else… Let me think. Not really. I can still do my job, drive, cook… basic things. It’s mostly just the remembering. I feel… normal, except for the memory stuff. It's not like I'm getting lost or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, and any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Oh, right, medications. Just a multivitamin, really. Nothing else. And allergies… I’m allergic to penicillin. Gives me a really bad rash. That's about it, thankfully. I’m generally pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And, just to get a complete picture, do you have a family history of anything like memory loss, dementia, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had Alzheimer’s, I think. It was a long time ago, but I remember my mom saying she got very confused towards the end. And… my uncle, he had some sort of nerve problem, I think? I don’t know much about it. He lived really far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to check your general health and neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Those are good and equal. Now, I want to do a simple cognitive test. I’m going to ask you to repeat three words, and then I’ll ask you to remember them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Hopefully I can remember those. They seem… straightforward enough.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you a few other questions. First, can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: Today is August 2nd, 2025.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: We’re at… Dr. Roseburrough’s office. In the suburbs, I think? I saw the signs on the way over. It's a nice office.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you spell the word "world" backwards for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. D-L-R-O-W. Is that right? That felt… harder than it should have.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's see if you remember those three words I asked you earlier. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… that’s not good. I think one of them was apple… and… um… I'm drawing a blank. I can’t remember the others. I’m so sorry. I thought I had them…
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Heidenthal. That’s alright. Don't worry. These tests aren't meant to be a definitive diagnosis, just to give me some initial information. Based on what you’ve told me and the results of this brief exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some early cognitive changes. It's possible this could be related to stress, sleep deprivation, or other factors. However, given your family history and the nature of your symptoms, I recommend further evaluation. I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I'd also like you to see a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests and a neurologist. Okay, I’m willing to do whatever it takes to figure this out. I just… I’m a little scared, to be honest. But yes, please. Let's do the tests.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll get the lab order for the blood tests sent to the lab right away. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. As for the neurologist, I have a few recommendations that I can give you. Dr. Chen and Dr. Ramirez are both excellent. I’ll have my assistant print out their contact information and a referral note for you. It's important to get this checked out, but try not to panic. We’re going to take this one step at a time. In the meantime, focus on getting good sleep, managing any stress you’re experiencing, and staying mentally active. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. For being so thorough and… and not making me feel like I’m crazy. I appreciate the recommendations for the neurologists. I’ll schedule an appointment as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we're here for you, and we'll work through this together. My assistant will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule any follow-up appointments. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then.
