DOCTOR: Right, yes. Mr. Verbose, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Westly Verbose. Though, to be honest, people often… misremember it. It’s alright, really. A long name, I suppose. And a rather… forgettable one, perhaps? I apologize for the slight delay; I was just organizing my thoughts.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, names. Doesn't matter much to me. Look, I have quite a few patients today, so let's just get down to business, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As… as I understand it, I’m here regarding… a bit of a frequent need to… visit the restroom. It’s been… noticeable lately. More than usual, at any rate. I do apologize for not being more concise; my thoughts aren’t always… linear, you see.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination… Alright. How frequent is frequent?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a… good question. Let me think. It’s… difficult to say precisely. It’s not a consistent number, Doctor. Some days it feels quite normal, perhaps… six or seven times. But then other days… well, it could be… more. A good deal more. I’m afraid I haven’t kept a precise tally, if that is what you require. I simply noticed it was… disruptive, and a bit concerning.
DOCTOR: Disruptive. Right. And is there… pain associated with this?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all, Doctor. Not precisely. It’s not… uncomfortable, exactly. Just… the frequency is the issue. And perhaps… a little bit of… anxiety, naturally. Worrying about being… far from a facility, you understand. It’s more of a mental discomfort than a physical one, if that makes sense. I do hope that clarifies things somewhat.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your… fluid intake recently?
PATIENT: That’s… a reasonable question. Let me consider. I believe I’ve maintained my usual habits, yes. I enjoy a cup of tea in the mornings, and perhaps a glass of water throughout the day. No significant increase in consumption, as far as I can recall. Though, my daughter does sometimes bring me herbal infusions… perhaps I’ve been having those a bit more often lately. She insists they are… beneficial. I’m not certain, though. It’s all rather… hazy, you see.
DOCTOR: Herbal infusions. Hmm. And are you experiencing any… difficulty completing your urination?
PATIENT: Difficulty… completing? That is… a rather personal question, Doctor. I suppose… sometimes there is a feeling of… not quite being finished, yes. A slight lingering sensation. It’s not severe, and it usually resolves itself quickly enough, but it has occurred on a few occasions. Is that… concerning? I do apologize for my lack of precision; I am not accustomed to discussing such… details.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any change in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That… that is a rather… specific inquiry, Doctor. I honestly haven’t paid close attention, if I am to be frank. I usually… don't examine it, you see. It appears… normal, I suppose. A pale yellow, generally. And no… unusual odors that I’ve noticed. But I haven’t made a conscious effort to analyze it, if that makes sense. My apologies for being… unhelpful. It’s simply not something I typically… observe.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of… bladder issues?
PATIENT: Bladder issues… That’s a… difficult question, Doctor. My family… wasn’t particularly forthcoming with such information, you see. My mother… passed away when I was quite young, and my father… well, he wasn’t one for sharing. I believe my aunt, on my mother’s side, had some… health problems, but I wasn’t privy to the specifics. Nothing related to the bladder, as far as I recall. It’s all rather… fragmented, you understand. I apologize for my lack of a more definitive answer.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. That's a good question. Let me think. I take… a small dose of Lisinopril, for my blood pressure, Doctor. And occasionally, I use ibuprofen for… aches and pains. Nothing else, as far as I am aware. Though, my daughter sometimes brings me… supplements, vitamins, various… herbal remedies. I'm not always certain what they are, to be perfectly honest. She insists they are… good for me. But the Lisinopril is the only prescription medication I take regularly. I hope that clarifies things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it could be a variety of things. Could be as simple as an overactive bladder. Or… something else. Let’s just do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: An exam? Yes, that sounds… prudent, Doctor. Though, if you don't mind my asking, what specifically are we looking for? I understand you are the expert, naturally, but perhaps a little… explanation would ease my… apprehension. I do apologize for being… inquisitive, but I’ve always preferred to be… informed, you see. What sort of “something else” might we be considering?
DOCTOR: Alright, look. I’m going to quickly check your prostate. It can sometimes be enlarged, causing these types of issues. It’s a common issue for men your age. It's a quick digital rectal exam. Not pleasant, but necessary. It will help rule out anything serious. If it's just an overactive bladder, we can try some medication. Is that… satisfactory?
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Oh. I see. Well, Doctor, while I appreciate your… thoroughness, I must confess… I hadn’t anticipated that. It’s… a rather personal procedure, isn’t it? Is it absolutely necessary? Could we not… explore other avenues first? Perhaps some… blood work? Or a… a more… indirect method of assessment? I understand you are the medical professional, of course, but the thought of it… well, it’s rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Verbose, I’ve got a waiting room full of patients. This is standard procedure to rule out anything serious. I can't diagnose you properly without it. We could do blood work, but it won’t tell me everything. It's quick, I'll be as gentle as possible. If you absolutely refuse, I can refer you to a urologist. But they'll want to do the same thing. So, are we proceeding, or are we going to waste more time?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If it is truly necessary for a proper diagnosis… then I suppose I have no choice. But please… be as gentle as possible. And perhaps… a brief explanation during the procedure? Just to… alleviate my anxiety? I do apologize for being… difficult. It’s just… a rather… sensitive matter, you see. I trust your expertise, of course. Let us… proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie down on your left side with your knees bent. I'll use lubrication and be as quick as possible. Just try to relax.
PATIENT: Relax… yes. Trying to relax… This is… unsettling. Very unsettling. Just a quick exam… be as quick as possible… Just a quick exam…
