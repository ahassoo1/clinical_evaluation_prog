DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. I am Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 29 years old. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, that’s right, 29. Well, I’ve just been feeling really cold lately. Like, chills, you know? Not a fever, just…shivers. It's been going on for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Chills, you say. And not accompanied by a fever?
PATIENT: No, no fever. At least, I haven’t taken my temperature, but I just feel cold, even when other people are comfortable. It’s weird. It's not like a cold coming on, just…the chills. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. And how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it started maybe four days ago? It was just a little bit at first, then it got worse yesterday. It’s pretty constant now, honestly. It's not keeping me up at night or anything, but it's definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the chills?
PATIENT: Let me see… Not really. I’m a little tired, but I always am, to be honest. I work a lot. No cough, no sore throat, no aches… Just the cold feeling. Oh! And maybe a little bit of a headache, but it's not bad. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My appetite is fine, I’ve been eating normally. And no, no sickness or anything. Everything else feels pretty normal, really. It's just this… persistent coldness. It's frustrating!
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s go over some basic medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I’m pretty healthy, usually. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that's about it. Nothing major, no asthma, diabetes, nothing like that. And I don't take any regular medication.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad…he had heart problems when he was older. But that’s about it, as far as I know. I don't really keep up with a lot of family medical stuff, to be honest. We’re not super close.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. And I haven’t had any trouble with pollen or anything like that, either. I think I'd know if I had an allergy, right?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, briefly, what is your occupation, and do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, right! I'm a Health Education Specialist, so it's a bit ironic I'm here feeling unwell, huh? And no, I don't smoke. I have a glass of wine maybe once a week, and definitely no drugs. I try to stay healthy, as you can imagine. It's part of the job.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and perhaps feel your lymph nodes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go ahead, whatever you need to do. I'm ready. I'm hoping you can figure out what's going on. It's just... annoying, being cold all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds are regular, though perhaps a little distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Lymph nodes are not noticeably enlarged. And your temperature is 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, which is within normal limits. Your skin feels cool to the touch, but there are no visible rashes or abnormalities.
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. So... everything sounds normal? That's… frustrating. I thought for sure something would show up. What could it be then? Is it maybe stress? I have been working a lot lately... But I just feel cold. Not like a fever cold, just… genuinely cold.
DOCTOR: While your physical exam findings are unremarkable, and we’ve ruled out a fever, that doesn’t necessarily mean there isn’t a cause for your symptoms. Given your description, and your normal temperature, several possibilities come to mind. It could be related to stress, as you mentioned, which can sometimes manifest as changes in body temperature regulation. However, other factors, such as thyroid issues or even a vitamin deficiency, could also be contributing. I think it would be prudent to order some blood work to get a clearer picture. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. Blood work sounds good. I just want to figure out what's going on. I'm tired of feeling like I'm constantly shivering, even when it's warm out. Thyroid issues… that sounds scary. Is that common? But yeah, please, let's do the blood work. Whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels, as deficiency can sometimes cause similar symptoms. I will give you a requisition form for the lab. Please fast for 12 hours beforehand, and drink plenty of water. Once the results are back, we can discuss them further and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Twelve hours fasting, got it. And drink lots of water. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure this out. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, particularly if you develop a fever, chills, or any other new symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today's consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I'll get the blood work done as soon as possible. I really appreciate your help. Hopefully we'll have some answers soon. .
