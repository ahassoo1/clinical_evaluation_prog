DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Bahta, yes… 54, French. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My name is Lonell Bahta, as you said. I am here… because I need to see if I can get some help at home. My… situation is becoming difficult, and I understand you can arrange for someone to come and… check on things, perhaps? To see if I qualify for this home help. I was told this office handles that.
DOCTOR: Home help, right. Look, I'm an Internal Medicine doctor. I treat illnesses. Not… social services. Though, I suppose anything can become a medical issue if it goes on long enough. What exactly is "difficult" about your situation?
PATIENT: Ah, I see. My apologies, Doctor. I was… directed here by my insurance company. They said a doctor needed to certify I needed this help. Well, I recently had… a rather serious operation. On my hip. It’s healing, slowly, but… I live alone, you see. And it is… challenging to manage everything. Cooking, cleaning… even getting to the bathroom can be difficult some days. It’s not an illness, per se, but it is… a struggle. A very inconvenient struggle, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: A hip replacement. Right. Insurance companies. Always sending people to me for… convenience. So, you had a hip replacement and now you need someone to… hold your hand a bit?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, it was not a replacement. It was a… repair. A very extensive repair, they said. And no, it is not simply to “hold my hand.” I am perfectly capable of… independent thought, thank you very much. It is simply… a matter of safety. I do not wish to fall and… re-injure myself. Or… something worse. It’s about making sure I can continue to heal properly, without undue risk. And, truthfully, it is rather exhausting. Do you require the exact date of the surgery? I recall it was July 14th.
DOCTOR: July 14th. Good. A “repair.” Semantics. Look, Mr. Bahta, I need to understand what your functional limitations are. Can you walk?
PATIENT: Yes, I can walk. Though not… gracefully, perhaps. And not for very long. Without assistance, I can manage… perhaps ten or fifteen feet. Before I need to sit down. It is… painful, you see. A sharp pain in the hip, and a rather dull ache in my leg. I use a cane, but… it does not always prevent me from… stumbling. Especially on uneven surfaces. I was rather unsteady this morning, getting out of the shower, for example.
DOCTOR: Right. Pain. Everyone has pain. On a scale of one to ten, one being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say it is, typically?
PATIENT: Typically… it fluctuates. When I am resting, it is perhaps a three or four. A manageable ache. But when I attempt… exertion – walking, standing for any length of time, even climbing stairs – it rises to a seven, sometimes an eight. It is a rather unpleasant sensation, Doctor. And it does not respond particularly well to the medication they prescribed. Just… a dulling of the sharpness, mostly.
DOCTOR: Medication?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am prescribed… oxycodone. Ten milligrams. I take it as directed, three times a day. But… it doesn't fully alleviate the discomfort. And it makes me… rather drowsy, you see. So I try to limit my use of it, unless absolutely necessary. It's… a trade-off, really. Pain versus… diminished alertness. It’s not a particularly satisfying arrangement. Do you need to know the name of the pharmacy? It’s… Dubois Pharmacy, on Elm Street.
DOCTOR: Oxycodone. Of course. Look, Mr. Bahta, I need to actually see what’s going on. Let’s have a look at that hip. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. Please… be gentle. It is… rather sensitive. And do excuse me if I am unsteady. It is… a work in progress, you see. I shall attempt to cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Range of motion is… limited. Significant tenderness with palpation of the greater trochanter. Some guarding. Gait is… antalgic. No obvious signs of infection. Reflexes intact. You're lucky you're not in a wheelchair.
PATIENT: That is… reassuring, I suppose. Though I would prefer to avoid a wheelchair, if at all possible. I am rather proud of my independence, you see. And I do not wish to… burden anyone with unnecessary care. Is this examination… sufficient? Are you able to… certify my need for assistance, Doctor? I understand there are forms that need to be completed. Perhaps a referral to a physical therapist? Or an occupational therapist?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Bahta, I’m not going to fill out a bunch of paperwork so you can get someone to cook your meals and hold your hand. This is a medical office, not a social work agency. You had a hip repair. You’re in pain. You’re unsteady. That’s… something. I'll write a note saying you have "functional limitations" secondary to hip surgery, but don't expect miracles. And a physical therapist?
PATIENT: I… understand, Doctor. I appreciate you writing something, at least. A note stating “functional limitations” is… better than nothing, certainly. And yes, a referral to a physical therapist would be… most welcome. Perhaps they could suggest exercises to improve my… stability. And reduce the pain. Do you have a list of recommended therapists in the area? Or do I need to contact my insurance company for that? I suspect they may have a preferred network.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm sending a referral to Apex Physical Therapy. They're… decent. And I'll note the functional limitations in your chart. Honestly, Mr. Bahta, I think you need to manage your expectations. This isn't going to solve all your problems. Here's the referral information. Next! Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Apex Physical Therapy… very good. I shall contact them immediately. No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Thank you for your time, and for the… note. Despite our… differing perspectives, I appreciate your assistance. I shall… trouble you no further. Good day, Doctor Ruocco. .
