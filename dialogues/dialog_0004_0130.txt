DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, things been okay, mostly. But my sister, she… she got sick. Real sick. And my mom, she had problems too. Heart, I think. So, I just… want to make sure I’m okay. You know? Just peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I understand wanting to be proactive, Mr. Schwer. Though, to be clear, your visit today is for your health concerns. Family history is important, we’ll get to that. But let's start with you. Can you tell me about any symptoms you’re experiencing currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not really. I mean, I get tired sometimes. But everyone gets tired, right? Old age, maybe? I don’t… I don't have any pains, no cough, nothing like that. Just… worried. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Worry isn’t a medical symptom, Mr. Schwer, but it's certainly understandable given your family’s situation. Still, we need to rule things out. When you say "tired sometimes," can you describe that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like falling asleep tired. It’s more… like everything is harder. Getting up in the morning. Walking up the stairs. Even… remembering things. Not all the time, but… more than it used to be, I guess. And I work, you know? Sales. Gotta remember prices, what people want… it’s a little harder now.
DOCTOR: So, increased fatigue, a sense of exertion with normal activities like climbing stairs, and some difficulty with recall… and this has been happening for how long, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh… geez. Hard to say. Maybe… six months? A little more, maybe a little less. It started slow, just thinking I was getting old. Then it felt… more. It’s hard to pinpoint, Doctor. Things just… faded in, you know? Not all at once.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this impacted your ability to perform your work duties, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: Well… not stopped me. I still go to work. But I have to… write things down more. Used to just remember prices, all that. Now… now I need a notepad. And sometimes… sometimes I forget what a customer wanted. Gotta ask them again. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. No… not really. I eat okay, I guess. Maybe not as much as I used to, but that's just because… well, my appetite ain't what it was. Sleep's okay. I get up to pee once or twice a night, but who doesn't, right? Oh! My feet sometimes feel… tingly. Not all the time, just when I sit for too long.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tingling in your feet, nocturia, and decreased appetite… Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the flu a couple times, but that's it. The doctor always said I was healthy. Strong. Always working. Never much sick. I used to go for checkups, but then… well, my wife… after she left, I just kinda stopped. Didn't seem to matter so much then.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. Nothing like that. Always been lucky, I guess. Just… little things. Colds, flu. Never needed a hospital. Never needed… anything much. Is this all important, Doctor? It seems like a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Schwer. Establishing a baseline is crucial, and these details do matter. Now, let’s discuss family history. You mentioned your sister and mother having health problems. Can you elaborate on those?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. My sister… she got sick last year. Real sick. Something with her heart, I think. They said… I don’t know, Doctor, I don't understand medical talk. She had to go to a special hospital, far away. She's… she's getting better now, but she’s not the same. And my mom… she had problems with her heart too, years ago. She was always tired, just like me. Eventually… well, eventually she just… stopped. That’s why I’m here. I don't want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: Alright. And did either your sister or mother have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom, I think she had… something with her sugar? The doctor said she had to watch what she ate. Sweets, mostly. And my sister… I don’t know. I didn’t ask. I wasn’t thinking about that stuff then. I just wanted her to get better. It's all a blur, Doctor. So much worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never. Tried it once when I was young, didn't like it. Always been a healthy guy, mostly. Worked hard, ate okay. Didn’t need no bad habits. Though, I do like a beer sometimes. With dinner. A couple. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: And how often would you say you drink a couple of beers?
PATIENT: Most nights. With dinner. Sometimes more if… if I’m worried. It helps me relax. My wife… she didn't like it much. Said I drank too much. But she's gone now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. I think we have enough information for now. I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam to assess your overall health. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. That's… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… just tell me if anything is wrong, okay? I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table, and we’ll begin. First, I'll take your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. Blood pressure is 158/92. Elevated. Heart rate is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Nothing concerning at this moment, but warrants further investigation. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Balance is slightly diminished. Coordination is within normal limits. Overall, your physical exam reveals some concerning findings – elevated blood pressure, a heart murmur, and slightly diminished balance. I’d like to order some blood work and an EKG to further evaluate your condition. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any. But… what does all that mean, Doctor? Elevated blood pressure… heart murmur… Is that bad? Like my sister and mom? I’m scared.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, it’s too early to make any definitive conclusions. Elevated blood pressure and a heart murmur are common findings, and don’t necessarily mean you have the same condition as your sister or mother. However, they do require further investigation. The blood work will help us assess your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and blood sugar. The EKG will evaluate your heart rhythm. We need these results before we can determine the cause of your symptoms. I’m ordering these tests now, and the results should be available within a few days. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your salt intake and limiting your alcohol consumption. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No. Never taken any pills. Always been too proud, I guess. Didn’t want to rely on anything. But… reducing alcohol… that’s gonna be hard. I get so worried… it calms me down. Is there something… something wrong with me, Doctor? Really wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, I understand your anxiety. But dwelling on possibilities before we have all the information isn’t productive. We’ve identified some areas of concern that require further investigation, and that’s precisely what we’re doing. Until the test results are back, it’s impossible to say definitively what’s going on. I'll have the nurse go over the necessary dietary changes with you and schedule that follow-up appointment. She can also provide information about stress-reduction techniques. In the meantime, if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. I understand. Chest pain… emergency room. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I just… I don't want to end up like them.
