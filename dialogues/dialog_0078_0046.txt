DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been experiencing some… pressure in my bladder, and it’s become quite bothersome lately. It’s the main reason for my visit today.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bladder pressure can certainly be bothersome. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it’s not exactly painful, more… a constant feeling of fullness, even after I’ve just gone to the bathroom. And it feels like I need to go very frequently. It’s… disruptive, to be frank. I find myself planning my day around finding a restroom.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s a constant feeling of fullness and the need to urinate frequently, even after emptying your bladder. And it’s impacting your daily life. That is disruptive. When did you first start noticing this pressure, Marialena?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began gradually, perhaps about three months ago? At first, it was just occasional, and I didn’t think much of it. But over the last month or so, it’s become much more consistent and… noticeable. It's definitely worsened recently. I remember it being barely there around the beginning of May.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting gradually around the beginning of May, becoming more consistent over the last month. And you'd say it's definitely worsened recently. Can you describe the frequency?
PATIENT: Well, normally, I would go to the bathroom maybe three or four times a day. Now? It feels like every two hours, sometimes even less. And at night, I've been waking up once, sometimes twice, to use the restroom. It’s interfering with my sleep, which isn’t ideal. It’s… quite a bit more than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, so significantly increased frequency, now every two hours or less during the day, and waking up one or two times at night. That does sound quite bothersome. Do you experience any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain or burning at all. It’s not that kind of discomfort. It’s purely the pressure and the feeling of needing to go constantly. There’s no stinging or anything like that. Just… fullness. It’s rather strange, actually. It doesn’t feel like a typical urinary tract infection, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. No pain or burning is good. And you’re right to differentiate it from a typical UTI. Are you noticing any changes in your urine – color, odor, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing that I’ve noticed. The color seems normal, and the odor hasn’t changed. I make a point of staying well-hydrated, so it’s usually fairly clear. I haven’t seen any blood or anything unusual, thankfully. I do try to be observant of my body.
DOCTOR: That’s good. No changes in color or odor. And you’re being proactive, which is excellent. Now, I’d like to ask a little about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any previous urinary problems or kidney issues?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. No urinary problems, no kidney issues, no surgeries of any kind relating to that area. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing significant. My general practitioner has always said my kidneys are functioning well during routine checkups. I do have Medicare, so I get regular screenings.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No prior urinary problems or kidney issues. Routine checkups have been normal. And you have Medicare, so we have a good baseline of care. Do you have any family history of bladder problems, kidney disease, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had some bladder infections when she was younger, but nothing serious. She recovered fully. My father had high blood pressure, but that was managed with medication. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, had diabetes, but again, it was controlled. I don't recall any other significant kidney or bladder issues in the family, honestly. We aren't a particularly sickly bunch, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of bladder infections in your mother, high blood pressure in your father, and diabetes in your grandmother. No significant kidney or bladder issues beyond that. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And my husband doesn’t either. We both try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I find it very important.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how much caffeine and alcohol do you typically consume?
PATIENT: I drink perhaps one cup of coffee in the morning, and that's it. I'm not a big coffee drinker. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month. Nothing excessive at all. I’m rather mindful of what I put into my body, and the potential effects.
DOCTOR: Okay, minimal caffeine and alcohol. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask about your medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not currently taking any medications. Just a daily multivitamin, really. Nothing prescribed, nothing over-the-counter regularly. I believe in a good diet and exercise, so I don’t rely on much in the way of medication. And I have no known allergies. I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm quite fortunate that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or allergies. That simplifies things. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’ll also perform a gentle abdominal palpation. I may also do a quick neurological check. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand. Please proceed. I trust your judgement completely. I’ll lie down on the table now. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position at any point. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marialena. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, I’m not hearing anything concerning. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. No tenderness to palpation. Bladder feels… full, but not distended. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems normal physically, though your bladder does feel quite full, as you mentioned. Given your history and the physical exam, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture to rule out any infection, even though you're not experiencing pain or burning. I’d also like to check your post-void residual volume to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m happy to proceed with those tests. I trust your judgement, and I’d like to rule out anything serious. A urinalysis, a urine culture, and checking the residual volume – all sounds good to me. Please let me know the logistics of those tests – where to go, how to prepare, and when I can expect the results. I’m ready to follow your recommendations.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the nurse draw a urine sample now and send it to the lab for analysis and culture. For the post-void residual volume, we will use a portable ultrasound device right here in the examination room. You will urinate as you normally would, and then I will use the ultrasound to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It’s a painless and quick procedure. The lab results should be available in about 24-48 hours. The nurse will let you know when they are ready. In the meantime, to help gather more information, I'd like to ask you to keep a bladder diary for the next three days. Please note the time and amount of each urination, as well as any fluids you consume. This will give us a better understanding of your bladder habits. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds very clear. A bladder diary, lab tests, and the ultrasound – I understand completely. I'm happy to keep a diary; it seems like a sensible step. And I’ll be sure to follow up when the results are available. I think that covers everything for now. Thank you for your thorough examination and clear explanations. I appreciate your attentiveness to my concerns. I’ll see the nurse now to get started on the urine sample, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. I’m glad I could help. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be right with you. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Solero. You as well.
