DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s August 2nd. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good morning to you too. Hartness, Delron Hartness. I’m here for... the army thing. The exam. Gotta get it done, you know? They told me to come here first. Seems like a lot of bother, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your name here, Mr. Hartness, and the pre-employment physical for the Army. It is a fairly comprehensive exam, and it’s important to make sure everything is in good working order before starting. It's not bother, it’s being thorough. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you're joining the Army?
PATIENT: Why? Honestly? It’s… a job. A good job. Benefits. My boy, he keeps saying I should do something with myself. Been assembling engines for… too long. It's steady, but... it’s not going anywhere, you know? Plus, they pay well. A lot better than what I'm getting now. Is that a good enough reason? I don’t really do feelings, if that’s what you're getting at.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly valid, Mr. Hartness. A stable job with benefits is a very good reason. And no, I'm not looking for a life story, just trying to get a complete picture. Okay. Let's go through some medical questions, then. To start, have you been feeling generally healthy?
PATIENT: Generally? Yeah, I guess so. No big problems. I get a bit of a backache sometimes, from bending over the engines all day. And my knees… they creak a little in the cold. But who doesn’t? I'm not exactly a young man anymore, you know. Fifty-one years takes its toll. I don’t go running marathons or anything. Mostly just… work, and then home.
DOCTOR: Right, and we'll definitely take a closer look at those. Just to clarify, is that backache constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I’ve been on my feet all day, or if I lift something heavy. It’s not like… crippling pain, you know? Just a dull ache. I take some… what are they called… ibuprofen, I think? The white pills. They usually help. Not every time, but most times. I don’t bother the doctor with it, normally. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen. And how often would you say you’re taking that – the ibuprofen – per week?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not every day, that’s for sure. Maybe… three or four times a week, if I'm really busy at the shop. Sometimes less. Depends on the workload, you know? If it's a slow week, maybe only once. I don’t really keep track. It's just when my back gets bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the backache and knee creaking, have you noticed any other aches, pains, or changes in your body recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Not really. I'm getting a bit… rounder, maybe. My wife keeps telling me I should watch what I eat. But that’s just… age, you know? Happens to everyone. Nothing serious. I haven't broken any bones or anything. No sudden lumps or bumps. I’m pretty sure I'd know if something was really wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Not a thing. I've been pretty lucky, actually. Always been strong as an ox. My dad lived to be eighty-five, and he was working right up until the end. Good genes, I guess. I had the flu a couple of times, that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Never needed ‘em. Always been careful. A few scrapes and bruises working on the engines, but nothing that needed a trip to the hospital. I don’t like hospitals. Full of germs, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about medications. You mentioned ibuprofen, are you taking any other prescription or over-the-counter medications regularly?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen, like I said. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take… what are those little blue pills? My wife gets them. For sleeping. I don't use them often, maybe once a month if I’m really stressed. She says I snore too loud, so she takes 'em too.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I eat pretty much anything. My wife always makes me try new things. I might not like everything, but I don’t get sick from it. No bee stings, no rashes, no nothing. Always been good that way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental illness?
PATIENT: Hmm. My dad… he had a bit of a cough near the end. I think it was… something with his lungs. But he smoked, you know? A lot. My mom was pretty healthy, actually. Lived a long life. My brother… he’s got high blood pressure, I think. My wife told me. Other than that… not really. We don't really talk about health stuff much. It’s… depressing, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Hartness. It’s common not to have all the details. Knowing about your brother’s high blood pressure is helpful. Now, just a few lifestyle questions. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched ‘em. My dad tried to get me to when I was a kid, but I didn't like the smell. My wife hates it too. Always complaining about other people smoking. I think it's disgusting, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a beer sometimes. With dinner. Or when I watch the football game. Nothing crazy. Maybe a couple on a Saturday. My wife has a glass of wine. We don’t drink to get drunk or anything. Just… relax. It's not a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any regular physical activity or hobbies?
PATIENT: Not really. I work on the engines all day. That's enough exercise, if you ask me. It’s hard work. I used to go fishing with my brother, but we haven't done that in a while. Mostly just… sit in front of the TV when I’m not working. My wife likes gardening. She’s always busy with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hartness, that’s a lot of helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Get it over with, then. I don't like being poked and prodded, but… I guess it's gotta be done. Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: I will be as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to check your height and weight. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll also feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. If you could step onto the scale for me, please. Okay, your height is 187 centimeters, and your weight is 53 kilograms. That puts your BMI at… …15.1. That’s a bit low. We’ll need to discuss that. But let’s finish the exam first. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out. Breathing sounds are clear bilaterally, but heart rate is a little fast, around 90 beats per minute.
PATIENT: Fast? I just walked in here! And it's a bit warm in here, isn't it? It's probably just that. I don't have any heart problems, like I said. My dad was fine, and I've always been strong.
DOCTOR: You're right, a little exertion and the room temperature could certainly contribute to that. I’m just noting it for now. Blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Ears are clear, throat is clear as well. No signs of infection. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Now I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Overall, you appear to be in generally good health, but your weight is quite low, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated. It's good that your reflexes are normal and that there are no immediate concerns with your heart or lungs.
PATIENT: Low weight? I'm a tall guy! I'm naturally thin. Always have been. My wife keeps trying to get me to eat more, but I don't have much of an appetite. And blood pressure... well, I get a bit stressed at work sometimes. Dealing with broken engines all day, you know? It's not a relaxing job. Is this going to be a problem with the army thing?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point about your height and stress levels. However, a BMI of 15.1 is considered underweight, and it could potentially cause issues with your ability to withstand the physical demands of Army training. We need to ensure you are adequately nourished before starting. Also, while slightly elevated, the blood pressure reading warrants further investigation to rule out any underlying causes. I’d like to order some blood work to check your overall health, including your nutrient levels and kidney function. I also recommend a urine analysis. We may want to consider an EKG to evaluate your heart health, given the slightly elevated blood pressure and your concern. Finally, I would like to get a more accurate assessment of your body fat percentage. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials that I should be aware of before ordering these tests?
PATIENT: Latex? No, I don’t think so. My wife uses gloves for gardening, but I haven’t touched ‘em. Body fat percentage? What for? I’m naturally thin, like I said. I don’t need some machine telling me I don’t have enough… whatever. I just want to get this army thing done. Is this going to take a long time?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. The body fat percentage assessment will help us get a more complete picture of your overall health and fitness level. It's not about judging you, but about ensuring you're physically prepared for the demands of Army training. It helps us differentiate between lean muscle mass and a lack of essential body fat, which can impact your performance and health. Alright. I'll order the blood work and urine analysis. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. We can also discuss the possibility of scheduling the EKG at that time. The lab is located just across the street, and they take most insurance plans. Since you're uninsured, we can explore options for financial assistance, if needed. For now, I recommend focusing on increasing your caloric intake with nutrient-rich foods. We can provide you with a referral to a registered dietitian to help you develop a meal plan tailored to your needs. Here’s the lab order. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Dietitian? Seriously? I just need to eat more, is that it? I can handle that myself. I'm not a child, you know. And financial assistance... look, I can afford a few tests. It's not the money, it's the time. I need to get this done. Is this going to take weeks?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Hartness. I’m not suggesting you can’t handle it yourself, but a dietitian can provide valuable guidance and ensure you’re meeting your nutritional needs effectively. It’s an option to consider, if you find it helpful. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have those, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. The EKG would add another week if you choose to pursue it. I want to emphasize that these tests are not intended to disqualify you from joining the Army, but rather to ensure your overall health and readiness. Addressing any potential concerns now will ultimately increase your chances of success. Do you have any questions about the lab order, or would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: No, I think I got it. Just… get the tests done. And call me if anything is… seriously wrong. I don’t want a lot of fuss. I need to know if this is going to be a problem for the army. That’s all. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I understand. We'll prioritize getting these tests done quickly, and I’ll contact you immediately if any concerning results come back. We'll focus on determining if this impacts your ability to join the Army. Here’s the lab order, and the receptionist will schedule a follow-up appointment for you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day.
