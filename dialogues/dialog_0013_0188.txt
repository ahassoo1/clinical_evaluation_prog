DOCTOR: Hi Criston, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. I... my pee is orange. It started a few days ago, maybe three? I don't know why. It worries my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine, starting about three days ago. I understand why that would be concerning, especially for your wife. No fever, pain, or anything else accompanying it?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No pain. Nothing feels… different, really. Just the color. I drink a lot of water, normally. Maybe that's something? I don't know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear there's no pain or fever. Drinking a lot of water is good, but it doesn’t always explain a color change like that. Let’s dig a little deeper. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – darker stools, maybe?
PATIENT: Um... no. Not really. Everything seems normal there. I eat… normal food. Not much changes, usually. My wife makes good tagine. Does that matter? I don’t think so. Sorry, I’m not good at this.
DOCTOR: Tagine sounds wonderful! No, don't apologize at all. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little unsure when talking about medical stuff. And the tagine probably doesn’t matter. Just trying to get a full picture. Okay, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter pills, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. My wife gives me some vitamins sometimes, but that’s it. Just a multivitamin, the regular kind. She thinks I don’t eat enough vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a regular multivitamin. And how much of that are you taking daily?
PATIENT: Just one. Every morning with breakfast. It's... a small one. Yellow pill. I think it’s from the grocery store, not a special one. My wife buys it. I don't pay much attention.
DOCTOR: Alright, one standard multivitamin daily. Let's check your recent diet a bit more closely. Have you eaten anything unusual lately—anything different than your usual tagine and other foods?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Maybe a few more carrots than normal? My wife bought a big bag. She makes good carrot salad. Besides that, no. I work with machines all day, so I usually bring a sandwich for lunch. Same kind every day. Ham and cheese.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit more carrots recently and your usual ham and cheese sandwich. Let me ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, like kidney problems, liver issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I’ve always been healthy. I work hard, but I don’t get sick often. I had a bad cold last winter, but that’s it. My wife worries a lot, so she makes me take extra vitamins when I feel a little off. She's very careful.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. And it sounds like you have a very caring wife! Okay, last quick question about your family history. Do any of your close family members—parents, siblings—have any medical conditions, particularly kidney or liver problems?
PATIENT: My father… he had problems with his stomach, I think. Old age, mostly. He lived a long life. My mother, she was healthy too, until the end. No kidney problems that I know of. My brother is okay, works in a shop. No problems either. I don't think so. We don't talk about that stuff much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known kidney or liver problems in the family. Alright, Criston. Thanks for all that information, it’s helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll palpate your abdomen. Then I’ll do a quick urine test to get a better idea of what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's wrong, if anything. I don't like being worried.
DOCTOR: Great. Let’s start with your abdomen. Just lie back, and I’ll gently press on your stomach. Tell me if anything feels tender or painful. Okay… anything here feel uncomfortable?
PATIENT: No. That’s… okay. A little pressure, but not pain. Like when my wife checks if I've eaten too much. Just a normal push. It feels… normal. You're pushing a little hard on the right side, maybe? But still not pain. Just… aware of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. That's helpful. And how about here?
PATIENT: No, still okay. A little… tight, maybe, on the left side, but nothing bad. I worked long hours yesterday fixing a machine. Maybe it's just my muscles? I lift heavy things all day. It's my job.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the lifting. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. Everything sounds normal there. Now, I'll need a urine sample. I'll give you a cup, and I'll show you how to collect it. Please try to catch it midstream. Let me know when you're ready, and we'll take a look at the sample.
PATIENT: Okay. I understand. Midstream. I can do that. I’ll be right back. It might take a moment.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I'm going to run a quick dipstick test now. Okay, the dipstick shows a slightly elevated level of bilirubin. Also, a moderate amount of urobilinogen. It's not extremely high, but enough to explain the orange color of your urine. And it could indicate a few different things.
PATIENT: Bilirubin? Urobilinogen? What does that mean? Is it bad? Should I be worried? My wife is going to worry so much. Please, Doctor, tell me something I can understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, Criston, let’s break it down. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that's normally processed by your liver. When it builds up in your body, it can cause a yellowing of the skin and eyes – jaundice – but sometimes it just shows up in your urine. Urobilinogen is a chemical formed when bilirubin is processed. The elevated levels we see can point to a few possibilities. It could be something as simple as mild dehydration or increased breakdown of red blood cells. It could also, less commonly, indicate a mild issue with your liver or gallbladder. The good news is, your levels aren't extremely high. It's not an emergency situation. But to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests to check your liver function and rule out any other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Okay. If that’s what you think is best. I… I don’t like tests, but I trust you, Doctor. My wife will be relieved to hear it's not an emergency. What kind of blood tests? Will they hurt? How long will it take to get the results? I need to go to work tomorrow…
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The blood tests are pretty standard. We'll check your liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and a complete blood count to see if there’s any sign of infection or anemia. The needle prick is quick – a little pinch, that’s all. It usually takes only a few minutes. The results typically come back within 24-48 hours. We can call you with the results, or you can schedule a quick follow-up appointment to discuss them in person. We'll try to get them back quickly so you know what’s going on before your next shift. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated. And if you notice any new symptoms – like yellowing of your skin or eyes, dark urine, or abdominal pain – please call us immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay. Hydrated. No yellow. No dark urine. No pain. I can remember that. 24-48 hours. I can call if something is wrong. A phone call is good. I don't want to come back to the clinic if I don't need to. Okay. Let's do the blood tests. When can we do them? I need to get back home to my wife. She's probably worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Criston. Great. We can do them right away. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the samples now. It will just take a few minutes. She's very good and will make you comfortable. Nurse Anya, could you please come to examination room 3 to draw some blood samples for Mr. Secondi?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I hope it doesn’t take too long. My wife makes a very good tagine. I don’t want to miss dinner.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We'll get you through as quickly as possible. Hopefully, you'll be back home in time for a delicious tagine. And we'll have some answers for you soon. Here’s Nurse Anya now. She'll explain everything. Thank you for your patience, Criston.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
