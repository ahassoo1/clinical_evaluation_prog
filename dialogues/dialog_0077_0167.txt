DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot… it’s been bothering me. A sore, you see. A bad sore that won’t go away. It’s on my foot, and… well, it’s painful.
DOCTOR: A sore on your foot, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s… it’s on the side, I think. Hard to tell exactly. And it hurts when I walk, you know? Especially if I try to go too far. It's been getting worse over the last few weeks. I don’t know what to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you mentioned it’s been worsening over the last few weeks. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s not a sharp pain, not like when you stub your toe. It’s more… a dull ache, most of the time. But sometimes, when I put weight on it… it feels like a fire, almost. And it keeps me awake at night sometimes, that’s when it gets really bad. I try not to look at it too much, it doesn't look nice.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, with periods of sharp, burning pain when you put weight on it, and it’s worse at night. I see. Now, have you noticed any redness, swelling, or pus coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Redness… yes, I think so. It’s a little red around the edges. And… maybe a little swollen. It’s hard to tell, because my foot always swells a bit when I stand for too long. Pus… I don’t think so. I haven’t seen anything that looks like pus, but I don’t look at it very closely, like I said. It’s just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that might have irritated your foot?
PATIENT: Irritated it… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve been trying to wear comfortable shoes, mostly slippers around the house. I haven't gone on any long walks. Oh! I did get a new pair of slippers a few weeks ago. Maybe those are too tight? They feel okay, but… maybe. I don’t know. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: New slippers a few weeks ago… possibly too tight. Okay. Now, Mr. Stoegbauer, I’d like to take a look at your foot, if that's alright with you. It will just be a quick examination to get a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Please do. I’m just glad someone is looking at it. It worries me, you know. I’ve always been careful with my feet.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see a sore on the side of your foot. There is some redness and mild swelling around it, as you mentioned. It appears to be an ulcer, and it does look a bit deep. The skin around it is also quite dry. Your pulse feels good, which is reassuring. I don’t feel any significant warmth or tenderness in the surrounding tissues, but it is definitely an area of concern. Now, I’m going to check your medical records to see if you have any history of diabetes or poor circulation, which can contribute to these types of ulcers. Just one moment.
PATIENT: Diabetes… Oh, yes. I do. The doctor told me years ago. I try to take my medicine, but sometimes I forget. It’s a long time ago, you know. I don’t always remember everything. Does that have something to do with my foot?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Stoegbauer, diabetes can certainly contribute to foot ulcers. High blood sugar levels can damage the nerves and blood vessels in your feet, making them more susceptible to injury and slower to heal. It's good you're taking medication, even if you sometimes forget. We can work on that together, if you'd like. Your records also show some peripheral neuropathy. That means there's some nerve damage in your feet, which can make it harder to feel pain or discomfort. This can also lead to ulcers, as you may not notice small injuries right away. Given your history of diabetes and neuropathy, this ulcer needs to be treated carefully to prevent infection and further complications. I recommend we get some blood work done to check your blood sugar levels and assess the overall health of your circulation. We’ll also need to keep the wound clean and protected. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. The doctor gave me some medicine for my blood sugar, and I took it, and it was okay. But… it was a long time ago. I can’t really remember. I've had so many doctors over the years, you know. But I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Is this going to hurt? The wound, you mean. Will cleaning it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, it’s completely understandable to have trouble remembering details over the years. And no, cleaning the wound shouldn’t be painful. We’ll be very gentle, and we can use a mild antiseptic solution. We might need to apply a special dressing to keep it protected, and that might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t hurt. To be on the safe side, and given your history, I’d also like to order an X-ray of your foot. This will help us determine if there’s any underlying bone infection. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I just want to get this fixed, you know? It's been bothering me for so long. And I don’t want it to get worse. But… will it take long? I have to get home for dinner. My daughter is coming over.
DOCTOR: I understand. An X-ray won’t take long at all, just a few minutes. And we’ll do everything we can to get you home in time for dinner. I'll put in the order for the X-ray now. A technician will come in to take it shortly. While we wait, I’m going to write down some instructions for wound care, and we can discuss them together. It’s very important to keep the wound clean and dry, and to avoid putting too much weight on your foot. We'll also talk about monitoring your blood sugar levels. Before we proceed, do you currently take any other medications besides the one for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Other medicine… Let me see… Oh! Yes. For my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a few years ago. A little white pill. I take it every morning, usually. Sometimes I forget, like with the other one. But mostly I remember. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s important. It’s good you’re taking medication for your blood pressure. We need to keep track of all the medications you’re on to avoid any potential interactions. What is the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: The name… Oh dear. I can’t remember the name. The bottle is at home, with my daughter. It’s a little white pill… that’s all I remember. I’ve been taking it for a long time. I’m sorry. I don’t have a very good memory, you know. But I can ask my daughter when I get home. She knows all my medicines.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s completely understandable. Don’t worry about it. We can document that you’re on a medication for high blood pressure and ask your daughter for the name when you see her. Alright. I think we have enough information for now. I’ll have the technician come in to take the X-ray, and then we can discuss the wound care instructions in more detail. Are you ready for the X-ray?
PATIENT: Yes, I suppose so. I hope it doesn't take too long. And I hope it doesn't hurt. I've never had one before, I don't think. It's just… all this is a bit much. But I trust you, Doctor. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: It will be quick, Mr. Stoegbauer, and it shouldn’t hurt at all. The technician will just position your foot in the X-ray machine and take a few pictures. I’ll be right here when you’re done. Could we please have a technician to take an X-ray of Mr. Stoegbauer’s foot?
