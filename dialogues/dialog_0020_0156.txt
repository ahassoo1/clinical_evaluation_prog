DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Beinborn, nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not great. Like, a lot of… well, you know. Diarrhea. It's been going on for a bit now, and it's just… annoying, mostly. I can't really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like a while, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not great” and a lot of diarrhea… and it's been going on for a while. It's frustrating when things just don’t feel right. You said you're having trouble remembering exactly when it started, that’s alright. We can try to narrow it down. To start, could you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it? Okay. It’s… watery, mostly. And… frequent. Like, I have to go a lot. Sometimes it’s just a few times a day, sometimes it feels like all day. And… it's not always just after I eat, which is…weird? I don't know. It’s just… loose. Sorry, I’m not very good at explaining this. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Jase, don’t worry at all. It's perfectly normal to feel awkward talking about this. Watery and frequent… not always after eating… okay. And is there anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. I think… dairy maybe? Like, milk and cheese sometimes really set it off. And… really spicy food, definitely. But even if I avoid those, it still happens sometimes. It’s just… unpredictable. I don't know. I try to eat bland things, but it doesn't always help.
DOCTOR: Okay, dairy and spicy foods seem to be triggers, but it happens even when you're being careful with your diet. Unpredictable, even with bland foods… I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes I feel really tired. Just… exhausted. And… my stomach cramps a bit, usually before I need to go. Not always, but often. Oh! And I’ve lost a little bit of weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser than they used to. I haven’t really been keeping track, though. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely counts, Jase. Tiredness, stomach cramps, and unintentional weight loss… all important things to know. Now, have you had a fever, any nausea or vomiting, or noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood… um, no, not that I've noticed. Maybe once or twice, just a tiny bit, but I wasn't sure if it was just… something I ate? I haven’t seen a lot, if any. No vomiting, no fever, and not really nauseous. Mostly just… uncomfortable. And tired, like I said. It's just… draining. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. No significant blood, no fever or vomiting, mostly just discomfort and fatigue. Okay. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… I think… the doctor said something about my stomach when I was younger. Something about… IBD? Or… celiac? One of those. I don't really remember the details. It was a long time ago, and I’ve been okay-ish until recently. My husband handles most of the doctor stuff, usually. I just… take pills when he tells me to. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible diagnosis of IBD or celiac disease in the past, but you haven't been actively followed for it. And your husband usually manages your medical appointments and medications. That’s good to know. Do you know what medications you're currently taking, even if your husband manages them?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. There’s a little white pill… I think it's for the stomach? And… a vitamin D pill. I take those every day. And sometimes, when my stomach is really bad, he gives me something else. A pink one. But I don’t know the names of anything, sorry. I just take what he gives me. He keeps everything organized. It’s really embarrassing, I know.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Jase. It's very common for patients to not remember medication names. We can figure it out. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My husband always asks when I try something new, just in case, but I've never had a problem. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. He’s really careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you said your husband is careful about new foods. That’s good. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I don't smoke, I barely drink any alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not often. And definitely no drugs. I’m married, remember? My husband wouldn't allow it. I just…work. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. You work. And no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your abdomen and feel your stomach. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. I mean, it can't hurt, right? My stomach always feels a bit weird, so I don't think it'll be much different. Just… let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm just going to press gently here. Let me know if you feel any pain. Okay… your abdomen is a little tender to the touch, especially in the lower left quadrant. I don’t hear any unusual sounds. No guarding or rebound tenderness. It's not acutely inflamed, but there is definitely some discomfort. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a flare-up of a chronic gastrointestinal issue, potentially related to the IBD or celiac disease that was mentioned in the past. The tenderness and frequent diarrhea are consistent with that. But to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Okay. If you think it'll help, yes, definitely. I just want it to stop, you know? It's really tiring. What kind of tests? Will they be… painful? I’m a little nervous, to be honest. I don't like hospitals or doctors much, even though I know I need them.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Jase. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The tests will help us figure out exactly what’s going on and how to best manage this. I want to order a stool sample to check for infection and inflammation, a blood test to check for celiac disease and to rule out other potential causes, and potentially a colonoscopy to get a closer look at your colon. The stool sample is just collecting a small amount of stool in a container, so it’s not painful at all. The blood test is just a regular blood draw. The colonoscopy… that does involve inserting a thin, flexible tube into your colon, so it’s a bit more involved, but you'll be sedated so you won’t feel any pain during the procedure. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… that sounds… scary. Sedated, you said? Like, asleep? That’s… good, I guess. The stool sample and blood test sound okay, easy enough. But the colonoscopy… is it absolutely necessary? Can’t we just… try medication first? I really don't like the sound of that. I’m a little overwhelmed, to be honest. My husband is always the one who deals with this stuff, and I just… tag along. I don’t know what to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jase. A colonoscopy isn't the most pleasant procedure, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about it. We can try medication first to see if it helps control your symptoms. However, because of the history of potential IBD or celiac, and the weight loss, it's important to get a definitive diagnosis to make sure we're treating the right problem. The colonoscopy helps us rule out more serious conditions, and to see what's going on directly in your colon. If we don’t get a clear diagnosis, we might end up trying different medications without knowing what we're actually treating, which can delay getting you better. But let’s start with the stool sample and blood tests. We’ll get those results back first, and then we can discuss the colonoscopy again, if necessary. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… better. Start with the stool sample and blood tests. See what those say first. That feels… less scary. Okay. What do I need to do for those? Do I need to… prepare anything? Like, special food or anything? I really appreciate you explaining everything, Dr. Beinborn. It makes me feel a little better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help ease some of your anxiety. For the stool sample, the lab will give you a collection kit and instructions. There are usually some dietary restrictions for 24-48 hours before the collection, like avoiding certain medications or foods. The instructions will be very clear. For the blood test, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours before the appointment. That means no food or drinks, except for water. I’ll have the lab call you with appointment times for both tests. And if you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to call my office. We’re here to help. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and eat bland foods as much as possible. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Beinborn. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll wait for the lab to call. Hopefully, the tests don't take too long. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. And I hope the tests go smoothly. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
