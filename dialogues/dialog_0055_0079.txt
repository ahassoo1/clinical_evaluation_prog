DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you are 47 years of age. May I ask what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, that's right, 47. Honestly? I’ve been bruising like crazy lately, and it’s… worrying me. I’m on blood thinners, so I figured I should get it checked out. It just seems like everything leaves a mark now.
DOCTOR: Blood thinners, you say. Yes, that certainly warrants investigation. And you've noticed an increase in bruising despite being on medication?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. Like, I bumped my arm on the doorframe last week – a little one, barely felt it – and ended up with a bruise the size of my hand. Usually, it's just a little color, you know? Not… this. It’s happening all over. I don’t even remember how I got half of them.
DOCTOR: Hmm. An unexplained increase in bruising, even with anticoagulation…and you don’t recall specific injuries for many of them. Could you describe the bruises themselves?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… purpley, obviously. At first, it's just a little dark spot, then it gets bigger and darker. Some are kinda raised, others are flat. And they take forever to go away. Longer than they used to, definitely. I haven’t noticed any that are particularly painful, just… there. Do you need me to be more specific? I’m not good at describing things.
DOCTOR: No, that's helpful, Ms. Hainley. The longevity is… noteworthy. And the variation in presentation. Have you noticed any bruising in unusual locations?
PATIENT: Unusual locations… hmm. Let me think. Not really everywhere, but I had one on my back a couple weeks ago, and I definitely didn’t hit my back on anything. And I think I saw a tiny one on my calf yesterday, which is weird because I wear long pants most of the time. Just little things, though. Nothing major, but it’s just… adding up. I'm not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Hainley. Unexplained bruising, especially in atypical locations, requires further investigation. Now, let's delve into your medical history. Are you currently under the care of another physician for this anticoagulation?
PATIENT: Yes, Dr. Sharma. He's the one who put me on the blood thinners about six months ago. He checks my levels regularly, but I haven't seen him since my last appointment, which was… I think in April. He's good, but his office is always so busy it's hard to get in touch. I had a blood test a couple weeks ago, and everything seemed okay on the results he sent me, but that was before all this bruising got worse.
DOCTOR: Very good. And what was the reason Dr. Sharma initially prescribed the anticoagulation?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it was for… atrial fibrillation. That’s what he called it. Something about my heart beating irregularly. He said the blood thinners would help prevent strokes. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. I don't really remember all the details, just that he was worried about clots.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation. Yes, that explains the anticoagulation. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But honestly, I’m always a little tired. Nothing major. No bleeding gums, no nosebleeds, no weird aches or pains. Just the bruising and the tiredness. I don’t know if the tiredness is even related, though. I've been stressed at work lately, so it could just be that.
DOCTOR: I see. Stress can certainly contribute to fatigue. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that’s it. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. I'm pretty healthy, honestly, aside from the heart thing. I try to eat well and I walk when I can, but work keeps me pretty busy. I’m not one for taking a lot of medication, which is why I'm worried about this bruising. It just feels… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other significant medical history. And have you had any surgeries other than the appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the appendix when I was little. And I haven’t broken any bones or had any serious injuries, if that matters. I'm not very clumsy, thankfully! I just… want to figure out what's going on. This bruising is really starting to scare me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley. Now, regarding your family history, are there any bleeding disorders or unexplained bruising in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not that I know of, honestly. My parents are both gone now, and they didn’t really talk much about medical stuff. My dad was pretty stoic, and my mom… well, she mostly worried about other people. I don’t remember anyone having a lot of trouble with bleeding or bruising, but I wasn’t really paying attention to those things when I was a kid. Sorry I can’t be more helpful. It's not something we ever discussed.
DOCTOR: That is alright, Ms. Hainley. It’s not always possible to know detailed family history. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don't smoke, I barely drink – maybe a glass of wine once or twice a year – and I definitely don't do drugs. I try to stay healthy, like I said. I work a lot, and honestly, I'm usually too tired for anything like that. I prefer a good book and a cup of tea. Nothing exciting, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That is good to know, Ms. Hainley. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I can take pretty much anything without a problem. Penicillin, shellfish, pollen… nothing bothers me. I’m pretty lucky that way, actually. I always worry when people ask about allergies because so many people have them these days. But I’m clear.
DOCTOR: Very well. No known allergies. Thank you for providing me with this information, Ms. Hainley. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining the areas where you’ve experienced bruising. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get to the bottom of this. Let’s get it over with. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat. I’ll begin by checking your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Bruising noted on bilateral forearms and lower legs. Areas are varying in size, ranging from 2 to 8 centimeters in diameter. Color is predominantly purple, with some areas showing early signs of resolution. Palpation reveals some tenderness, but no significant warmth or swelling. No palpable masses. Based on this initial examination, the bruising appears consistent with spontaneous ecchymoses. However, to rule out any underlying causes, I would like to order some laboratory tests. This will include a complete blood count, a coagulation panel, and a peripheral blood smear. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. And yes, absolutely. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to know what's going on, and if these tests will help figure that out, then please do them. I'm not sure what any of those things are, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. Let's get them done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will order those tests now. The results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I would like to advise you to avoid any activities that could cause trauma or injury, and to monitor yourself for any signs of excessive bleeding, such as prolonged nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your stool. If you experience any of these symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. While we await the results, given your atrial fibrillation and current anticoagulation, and unexplained bruising, I think it's prudent to also consult with a hematologist. They specialize in blood disorders and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you be amenable to a referral?
PATIENT: A hematologist… yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think that's a good idea, then definitely. I'm happy to see a specialist if it means getting a better understanding of what's going on. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please go ahead with the referral. It's just… I’m a little worried, if I'm honest. But I appreciate you taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley. It's always best to be thorough. I will initiate the referral to a hematologist today. I’ll have my assistant schedule an appointment for you as soon as possible. To summarize, we have ordered laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, coagulation panel, and peripheral blood smear. We are also initiating a referral to a hematologist for a comprehensive evaluation. I will contact you as soon as the results are available and we have an appointment scheduled with the specialist. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Honestly, I just feel… relieved that you’re taking this seriously. I was worried it was just something I was imagining, or just getting old. Thank you for listening. I’ll wait for the results and the appointment. Is there anything I need to do before then, besides avoid bumping into things? Anything I should be specifically looking out for?
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Hainley. It is important to address your concerns. Besides avoiding trauma, and as I mentioned, monitoring for any signs of excessive bleeding – prolonged nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your stool, unusual bruising – it would be prudent to refrain from taking any new medications, including over-the-counter pain relievers, without consulting with me or the hematologist first. Also, keep a detailed record of any new bruises that appear, noting their location, size, and any associated symptoms. This information will be helpful when you see the specialist. With that, I believe we have covered everything for today. My assistant will provide you with instructions on how to schedule the appointment and obtain the necessary laboratory tests. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Thank you again, Doctor Eaddy. I really appreciate your time and your help. I’ll keep track of the bruises and wait for my assistant. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Get well, Ms. Hainley. .
