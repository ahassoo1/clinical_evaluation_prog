DOCTOR: Hello Sasha, welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, well, it's my leg. It's been… swelling up. After the cancer treatment, you see. It's a bit bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your leg after cancer treatment. I see. Can you tell me a little more about when it started swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Let me think… It was… maybe a month ago? Or a little more? It didn’t hurt at first, just… bigger. It’s gotten a little worse since then, though. It’s hard to remember exactly, you know? Things aren't so clear these days.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Sasha. It’s perfectly normal for things to be a little fuzzy. A month ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe five weeks? It's the leg that they… did the most to, I think. The one with all the… the stuff. Sorry, I don’t really know the names for everything. It’s on my right leg, just above the knee. .
DOCTOR: Right leg, above the knee. Okay. And has the swelling come and gone at all, or has it been pretty constant since it started?
PATIENT: Pretty constant, I think. Maybe a little better some days, but mostly it's just… there. It feels heavy, you know? Like I'm dragging it around. It doesn’t hurt all the time, but it's uncomfortable. .
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy and uncomfortable. Has anything specific made it worse – like standing for long periods, or being in the heat?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Standing is bad. Really bad. And… the heat, definitely. If it’s very warm, it puffs up even more. I was gardening last week, a little bit, and by the end of the day, it was quite big. I shouldn’t have done that, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Gardening makes it worse, standing and heat. Alright. Do you notice any changes in the skin on your right leg – any redness, warmth, or sores?
PATIENT: Let me see… Redness… not really. It’s maybe a little bit darker than my other leg, but I don’t think it’s red. Warmth… sometimes, yes. It feels a bit warmer to the touch. And no, no sores or anything like that. Just… puffy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. I'd like to take a look at your leg, if you don't mind. I'll just need to examine it and feel for any changes. Then we can talk about what might be going on and what we can do. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want it to stop swelling, if that’s possible. .
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm feeling your leg now. I do notice some swelling, as you said, and it feels a little warmer than your other leg. There is definite pitting edema – that means when I press on the skin, it leaves an indentation for a little while. Your pulses feel strong, which is good. I don't see any redness or open sores. It's possible this is lymphedema, a buildup of fluid in the leg after cancer treatment. It's fairly common, especially after surgery or radiation. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, like a blood clot.
PATIENT: Lymphedema… Oh dear. Is that… serious? A blood clot sounds scary. . What do we do about it? Will I need more… treatment?
DOCTOR: Lymphedema can be managed, Sasha. It’s not usually serious if we catch it early and treat it properly. And we will rule out a blood clot – that's why I want to order a simple ultrasound of your leg. It's a painless test, and it will give us a clear picture of what's going on. . To be sure, I’d also like to review your cancer treatment history. Do you have any records with you today, or can you tell me what kind of treatment you received and when?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Records… I don't think so. It was… a long time ago. I had… surgery, I think, and then radiation. They did a lot of… poking and prodding. It was at the hospital in Marseille. I had chemotherapy too, but that was years and years ago. It was… a blue liquid. Does that help? . I’m sorry, I’m not very good with details. It’s all a bit of a blur now.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sasha. It’s perfectly understandable. Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy – that gives me a good starting point. I can access some records from the hospital in Marseille, but it may take a little time. For now, let’s focus on getting that ultrasound scheduled. I'm going to write you a referral for the ultrasound, and I’ll have the receptionist schedule it for you before you leave. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg whenever possible, wearing compression stockings, and avoiding prolonged standing or heat exposure. Do you have compression stockings already?
PATIENT: Compression stockings? No, I don’t. I’ve never worn those before. What are they like? Will they help a lot? . And elevating my leg… I can do that. That doesn’t sound too difficult.
DOCTOR: Compression stockings are like tight socks that help improve blood flow and reduce swelling. They come in different strengths, and we'll want to make sure you get the right ones. The receptionist can give you information on where to purchase them. They can be very helpful, especially when combined with elevation. I’ll also write a note for the ultrasound technician to let them know about your cancer history, so they're aware. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. Does that sound good, Sasha?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little bit better knowing what’s going on, even if it is a bit scary. . I think… I think that’s everything for now, isn’t it? Just the ultrasound and the stockings?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. Just the ultrasound and the stockings for now. And remember to elevate your leg as much as possible. The receptionist will take care of scheduling the ultrasound and can provide you with information about the stockings. I’ll also have them print out a summary of our conversation for you to take home. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your ultrasound appointment. It was nice meeting you, Sasha. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. .
