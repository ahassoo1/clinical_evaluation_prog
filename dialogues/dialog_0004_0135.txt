DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My name is Gerhard Radillo. I… have something coming from my ear. A liquid. It is… discharging, you could say. It started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Discharging, you say. Alright. And is it a clear liquid, or is there any color to it?
PATIENT: It is… yellowish. A pale yellow. Not very much, but… enough that I notice. And sometimes… a little bit of smell. Not a strong smell, but… present.
DOCTOR: Yellowish discharge with a slight odor. Hmm. Have you experienced any pain with this, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A little. Not a bad pain, but… a dull ache. Mostly when I press on the ear. And… sometimes when I lie down on that side. It feels… full. Like something is inside.
DOCTOR: Fullness and pain with pressure… Okay. Have you noticed any hearing loss, ringing in your ears, or any dizziness associated with this?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit of hearing loss. Not much, but… things are quiet. I have to ask people to repeat sometimes. No ringing, no. And no dizziness, Doctor. I feel… steady. But the hearing is not as good as before. It is… frustrating. I am a teacher, you see. I must hear the students.
DOCTOR: A teacher, alright. And how long have you been noticing this hearing loss?
PATIENT: About the same time as the liquid, Doctor. Maybe three days now? It came slowly. First, just a little quiet. Now… more noticeable. It is hard to understand when many students speak at once. I… worry. I need to hear.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you had any ear infections in the past, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. When I was a boy, in Somalia. Many, many years ago. I was very young. The doctor… gave me drops. It went away. But… I have not had any problems since, until now. I do not remember much else about it. It was a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have taken some medicine for blood pressure, but… no problems. No rashes, no swelling. Just… the medicine helped the pressure. I do not remember any allergies ever. Perhaps… a little sniffle with some dust, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications, or have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure medicine, Doctor. A small pill, every morning. And… I had my appendix removed, many years ago. When I was in my thirties. It was… an emergency. Very painful. But it is finished now. I have not had any other surgeries. I do not like hospitals, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to take a look at your ear now. Please sit forward. I will use an otoscope to examine your ear canal. It may be a little uncomfortable if it's sensitive. I'll let you know what I see.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will sit forward. Please be gentle. My ear… is a little sensitive now. I hope it is not too bad. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some cerumen – that's earwax – obstructing the ear canal. There’s also evidence of inflammation and some yellowish discharge, consistent with what you described. The tympanic membrane – that’s your eardrum – appears slightly clouded. It’s difficult to assess it fully with the obstruction, but there doesn’t appear to be any perforation at this time. I suspect you have otitis externa – an outer ear infection – possibly with some cerumen impaction exacerbating the symptoms.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? And what about the… cloudiness? Will my hearing come back? I need to hear for my students. Please explain, Doctor. I… do not understand all these words.
DOCTOR: Otitis externa simply means an infection of the outer ear canal – the part you can see. The cloudiness refers to the appearance of your eardrum; it suggests there's some inflammation present. It's not immediately dangerous, but it needs to be treated. As for your hearing, it should improve with treatment, but it’s difficult to say definitively until the inflammation subsides. We will start with ear drops – an antibiotic and a steroid to reduce inflammation – and I recommend keeping your ear dry. We can also consider a cerumen removal if it’s contributing significantly to the problem. I'll write you a prescription, and I want you to follow up with me in one week to re-evaluate. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Ear drops… and keep it dry. Yes, Doctor, I understand that. But… what if it does not get better? What if the hearing… stays quiet? And what about the cerumen? Will you… take it out? I am a little worried, Doctor. I depend on my hearing. A week feels… long.
DOCTOR: Mr. Radillo, it is reasonable to be concerned. However, otitis externa is typically very treatable. The ear drops should resolve the infection. If it doesn't improve within a week, we can re-evaluate and discuss further options, which might include a more thorough cleaning of the ear canal. We will proceed with the cerumen removal if it seems necessary after the initial treatment. I’m not going to speculate on worst-case scenarios at this point. Follow the instructions carefully, and we'll address any concerns at your follow-up appointment. Here is your prescription. And please, avoid getting water in your ear. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. Just… the ear drops. And keep it dry. Thank you, Doctor. I will follow your instructions. I hope it works.
DOCTOR: Very well. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist before you leave. And if you experience any worsening pain, fever, or drainage, contact the office immediately. Good day, Mr. Radillo.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Good day to you as well.
