DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? This has been going on way too long. I just… I keep getting the runs. And nothing seems to stop it. I’ve tried everything the drugstore sells, and it’s still happening. It's embarrassing, really. I don't usually complain, but I’m at my wit’s end.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It’s good you’re coming in to get this checked out. “The runs” – so diarrhea, frequent loose stools?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Loose stools. Frequent is an understatement. And it's not just a little upset, you know? It’s… disruptive. I don’t even want to leave the house half the time. It’s been going on for… well, I lost track, truthfully. A couple of weeks, maybe? Longer? I really don't know. I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Right, a couple of weeks or longer. That’s definitely long enough to warrant investigation. And it sounds like it's significantly impacting your life, which is important. To help me understand things better, can you describe what these stools look like?
PATIENT: Oh, great. Now we have to talk about… that. Look, it's watery. Really watery. Sometimes there's… things in it. I don’t want to be graphic, but it’s not normal. And it smells… awful. Worse than usual, anyway. Honestly, I try not to look. I just want it to stop, not analyze it. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand it’s unpleasant to talk about, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for that. But the description is helpful. Watery stools with… changes in appearance, and a strong odor – all of that points us in the right direction. It's necessary to ask these questions to figure out what's going on and how to best help you. Let me pull up your chart…okay, I see you’ve had a checkup last year, and nothing significant noted. Any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain with this?
PATIENT: No fever. No vomiting, thankfully. My stomach aches sometimes, yeah. A cramping kind of ache, more than a sharp pain. Comes and goes. And I've just been so tired. I figured it was just… stress, I guess. Being on my own and all. It’s not like I’ve been eating anything weird. Just… regular food. Honestly, I haven't got the energy to be fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, and fatigue. You mentioned not eating anything unusual, but let's just quickly run through your typical diet, just to be sure. What would you say you eat on a regular day?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? We’re doing this? Fine. Coffee, usually, for breakfast. Maybe a piece of toast if I’m feeling ambitious. Lunch is usually a sandwich… turkey or ham. Nothing exciting. Dinner varies. Sometimes I cook something, sometimes I just grab something quick. Canned soup, frozen meals… look, I'm not a gourmet chef, alright? I eat pretty normal stuff. And I drink plenty of water. This feels like a waste of time, honestly. It just feels like a bug, and it should be over by now.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. It should have resolved by now. We're just trying to rule things out. Okay, and any recent travel?
PATIENT: No travel. I haven't left this town in… well, years. Why would that matter? I’m a painter, I work around here. Mostly houses, some businesses. I haven’t been on a plane, or even a long car trip, in ages. This is ridiculous. Are you suspecting I picked something up on a vacation I didn’t take?
DOCTOR: No, of course not. Just standard questions, Ms. Woodring. It’s important to consider all possibilities. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, occasionally. And I took some… Imodium, a few times, when this started. Didn't do a thing, really. Honestly, I’m not a big pill person. I prefer to let things… sort themselves out. I don’t like loading up on chemicals if I can avoid it. I did try some herbal tea my neighbor gave me, but that just made it worse, actually. It tasted awful, and did nothing. I’m starting to think this doctor visit was a complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, Imodium without effect, and an herbal tea that worsened things. And no known allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. Look, I’m a pretty straightforward person. I eat normal food, I take a vitamin sometimes, and I don’t go traipsing around the globe picking up bugs. I just have the runs, and it won’t stop. Is there anything you can do about it, or are we just going to keep talking about what I had for dinner last Tuesday?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration. You’re right, we've spent a lot of time on history. Let’s move to a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll gently press on it to check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have things to do, you know? Houses aren’t going to paint themselves. But if you’re going to poke and prod, you better be quick about it. I really don’t have the patience for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. Okay, I'm listening now. Take some deep breaths for me. And I’m going to gently press here… any pain when I press here, on your left side?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, that kinda hurts. Not terrible, but… definitely not comfortable. It’s like a… dull ache, right there. And a little bit higher up, too. Everything feels a bit… tender, if I’m honest. Like I’ve been punched in the stomach. But it’s not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Can you tell me what you’re looking for? Because honestly, this is making me anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Mild tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant and upper abdomen. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Alright, Ms. Woodring, everything seems relatively stable. Hyperactive bowel sounds and tenderness are noted. Based on what you've told me and the initial examination, it sounds like we're dealing with acute gastroenteritis, likely viral in origin. However, given the duration and your symptoms, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a stool sample for testing - to check for bacteria, parasites, and inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A stool sample? You’re kidding me, right? More analysis of… that? Honestly. Look, I’m a painter, not a scientist. I don’t have time for this. But fine. If you insist. Just tell me exactly what I need to do, and let’s get it over with. And can you please just give me something to stop this? Anything? I’m losing days here, and I have work to do. I don't care what it is, just make it stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration completely, Ms. Woodring. I wish I could just wave a magic wand. The stool sample is important to rule out other causes, like a bacterial infection, which would require antibiotics. As for stopping the diarrhea, I can prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication. However, given the length of your symptoms, I'm a little hesitant, as it could mask a more serious underlying problem if it is something other than a simple virus. We can start with a low dose and see if it helps. If it doesn't improve within 48 hours, or if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, you need to contact me immediately. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Fine. A low dose. 48 hours. And a laundry list of things to watch out for. Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? I’ll try the medication, but if I’m still miserable in two days, I’m not coming back. Honestly, I’m starting to think I should have just suffered in silence. Just… write down the instructions clearly, and let me get out of here. I have a deadline to meet. And can you at least tell me if I should avoid anything to eat? Or drink? This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here’s a printout with the instructions for the medication - Lomotil, take two tablets after each loose stool, but don’t exceed eight tablets in 24 hours. And here are some dietary recommendations. Stick to bland foods - toast, rice, bananas, applesauce. Avoid dairy, greasy foods, and caffeine. Drink plenty of fluids - water, broth, electrolyte solutions. Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. But please, do follow these instructions carefully. And if anything changes, or you develop any new symptoms, contact me immediately. We’re here to help. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. I’ve wasted enough of my day. Honestly, I’ll probably just ignore everything and hope it goes away on its own. I have work to do. .
