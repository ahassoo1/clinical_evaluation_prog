DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Courtnye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Pfennig, nice to meet you too. Um, it’s about my bruising. It’s just… been getting worse, even though I’m already on a blood thinner. It's kinda worrying me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that’s getting worse despite being on a blood thinner is definitely something we need to look into. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It started, I guess, a couple of weeks ago. Just little ones, like normal. But now… I bumped my arm yesterday, just a tiny bump against the doorframe, and it turned purple almost immediately. And I have some on my legs that I don’t even remember hitting! It's not painful, just… a lot of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it sounds like the bruising is increasing in frequency and severity, even with minimal trauma, and you're noticing some you can't even recall injuring. When you say a couple of weeks ago, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Around July 18th, maybe? I had a little one on my hand then, after I was carrying some groceries. It wasn't big, but that’s when I first really noticed things might be… off. And like I said, it's been steadily getting worse since then. I don’t really keep track of dates perfectly, sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, that’s perfectly alright. July 18th gives us a good starting point. And it’s been progressively worse since then, meaning the bruises are larger, more frequent, or appearing with less injury?
PATIENT: All of the above, really. They're definitely bigger now, I get them way more easily, and like I said, some just appear. Yesterday I noticed one on my thigh and I honestly have no idea how that happened. It's kinda scary.
DOCTOR: I understand why you're concerned. Bruising that easily and without a clear cause is something we need to investigate. Let's go through some other questions, if that’s okay. First, can you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Um… not really. I've been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I always chalk that up to just… life. No fever, no bleeding gums, no weird headaches. Just the bruising and the tiredness. Nothing else stands out, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and bruising. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu pretty bad a couple years ago, but that’s it. Oh, and my doctor told me my cholesterol was a little high last year, but he just said to watch my diet. That’s about it. No major illnesses or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major illnesses, high cholesterol being monitored. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. I’m not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. It's just... not my thing. I try to stay away if I can.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Um... my mom had some heart trouble when she was older, but she lived to be 85, so it wasn't too bad. My dad was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in his life. No one else really had any major health problems, as far as I know. It’s a pretty healthy family, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And do you currently take any medications, besides the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Just the blood thinner. It's called… Warfarin, I think? And a multivitamin, but that's it. I try to keep things simple. I don't like taking a lot of pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. I can eat anything, take pretty much any medicine. Lucky me, I guess. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as an Information Security Analyst, so I'm mostly at a computer all day. Not a lot of physical activity, I admit. I try to walk a little when I can, but… it’s hard to find the time. I live alone and don’t have any really bad habits, if that makes sense. I don’t smoke or drink much. Pretty boring life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good sense of things. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll just take a look at the bruising, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will be pretty quick and shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds fine. Quick is good. I'm not a fan of spending too long in doctors' offices, if you haven't noticed. Let’s just get it over with. Where do you want me to start?
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. Let’s start by looking at the bruising. Could you point out the areas where you've noticed the most bruising?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, there’s this one on my arm, right here. It’s pretty new, from yesterday. And I have some on my thighs, see? This one’s a little older. And… oh, there’s a small one on my shin. It’s hard to see, but it's there. They’re all over, really, just smaller ones scattered around. It’s kinda depressing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting several areas of ecchymosis – that’s the medical term for bruising – varying in size and age. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I'm not feeling any masses or abnormalities. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your blood pressure is 128/80. The bruising does appear more extensive than I would expect given your medication and lack of trauma. I'm going to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It will include a complete blood count, a coagulation panel to see how well your blood is clotting, and a peripheral smear to look at your blood cells under a microscope. We’ll also check your liver function. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… thorough. I guess that’s good. Blood work is fine. As long as it doesn't take too long, I'm good. What are you looking for, exactly? Is it something serious? I'm getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you're asking questions. It’s always okay to be worried when something feels off. We're checking to rule out a number of possibilities. The complete blood count will check for things like low platelets – those are the cells that help your blood clot – or any signs of infection. The coagulation panel will tell us if your Warfarin is within the therapeutic range, and if there are any other clotting factors that might be off. The peripheral smear will let us look at the shape and size of your blood cells. And checking your liver function is important because your liver plays a role in clotting. We're ruling out things like a low platelet count , a clotting disorder, a medication interaction, or even a more serious underlying condition. It could be something simple, like an adjustment needed to your Warfarin dosage, but we want to be thorough to make sure we don’t miss anything. I want to get a clear picture before we make any changes to your treatment plan. The lab work shouldn’t take long – usually a few hours to get the results back. I'll have the results sent to me, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them to discuss what we find. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that… makes sense. As long as it's not something really bad, I guess. I appreciate you explaining it all. A few hours is good. I can manage that. Please just call me as soon as you know something. My number is… 555-1212. Thanks, Dr. Pfennig. I’m kinda anxious, but I feel a little better knowing you’re checking everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. I understand your anxiety, and I promise I'll call you as soon as I have the results, no matter what time of day it is. We're going to figure this out together. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. Avoid any activities that could cause trauma, and if you notice any new bleeding – like nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your stool – please call me immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… please call as soon as you can. And thank you again, Dr. Pfennig. I really appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I will. Take care, Courtnye, and I’ll be in touch soon.
