DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Dr… Petrimoulx, was it? Yes, well. It's a bit silly, really. I just… I wanted a card. A “Get Well” card, or maybe one that just says “You’re doing great!” or something. My daughter thinks I'm being ridiculous, but a little encouragement goes a long way, you know? Especially when you’re… well, never mind. It's just a card, really. From a doctor. It would mean something.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Janeth. It’s not silly at all. A little encouragement can make a big difference. And I'm happy to help if I can. Before we get to the card, though, perhaps you wouldn’t mind if I ask a few questions?
PATIENT: Questions? About a card? Honestly. Well, alright. But don’t expect me to know all sorts of medical things. I assemble things, not… bodies. What do you need to know? Just keep it simple, please. My daughter already thinks I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll keep it simple. I just like to get a general understanding of everything going on with your health. It helps me provide the best possible care, even for something as simple as writing a card. First, could you tell me a little about any health concerns you do have?
PATIENT: Oh, health concerns. Well, at my age, there’s always something. My knees ache, of course. Every step is a reminder, you know? And my back… don’t even get me started on my back. I spend all day bending over little pieces, assembling things. It's a terrible job for an old woman, really. But my husband needs his medicine. And the daughter… well, she's got her own life. Nothing serious, mind you. Just old age creeping in. Is that what you want to know? About creaky bones and a tired spine?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Janeth, thank you. The knee and back pain are good to know. How long have you been experiencing pain in your knees and back?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Decades, probably. It comes and goes, you know? A bad day here, a slightly better one there. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started. I suppose it got noticeably worse in the last few years, though. When I started doing more hours at the factory. The manager kept asking for overtime. And I needed the money… It’s just… it's always something. A little ache, a little pain, a little tiredness. It's part of getting old. Do you need me to describe the pain? It's… achy, mostly. And stiff. And sometimes, when I move wrong, it’s a sharp, stabbing thing. But it passes. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, “achy, stiff, sometimes sharp, stabbing pain” – that’s very descriptive, thank you. And you mentioned it’s gotten worse with increased hours at the factory. Do you experience any pain in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… my hands get awful sore. From the tiny pieces, you see. All that fiddling and assembling. My fingers get stiff and cramped, and sometimes they go numb. Especially at night. I try to ignore it, but it’s… uncomfortable. And my eyes get tired, staring at those little things all day. Everything blurs together after a while. So, yes, my hands and my eyes bother me too. Is that what you want to know? Every little ache and pain? I’m starting to feel like an old, broken machine. Which, I suppose, is fitting, considering what I do.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not a broken machine, Janeth. And thank you for being so open with me. It's helpful to get a complete picture. Let's take a quick step back for a moment. Besides the pain in your knees, back, hands, and eye strain, are there any other health issues you've been diagnosed with, or any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, diagnosed with… Well, the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back, but he just told me to watch my salt intake. I try, but my husband loves his pickles. And I take a multivitamin, does that count? And a little something for my sleep, sometimes. Just when I can’t get to sleep, you understand. It’s nothing major. Just a little pill to help me relax. My daughter bought it for me. She worries, you see. She thinks I push myself too hard. Which, I suppose, I do. It’s just… what else am I going to do? Sit around and wait to… well, never mind. It’s just a card you want to write, isn’t it? Don't need to know my life story for a "Get Well" card.
DOCTOR: You're right, a card doesn't require your life story. But knowing a bit more helps me understand how everything fits together and make sure I’m offering the best support. So, you mentioned high blood pressure and a sleep aid. Do you remember the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names? No, not really. I just take the little pills when I need them. My husband handles all that, mostly. He gets them filled at the pharmacy down the street. He just tells me to take one before bed, or after I eat. I’m terrible with names, you see. I can remember exactly how to assemble a complicated widget, but ask me the name of a pill and… blank. It all just looks the same to me. Little white things. My daughter keeps telling me I should write it all down, but I just… forget. It's a bit embarrassing, really. I should be more organized. But what's the point? I just need a card, don’t I? A little encouragement. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Janeth. And it’s perfectly alright not to remember medication names. We can figure that out later if needed. Let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband always says I have a cast iron stomach. Pickles, spicy food, everything. Never had a problem. I mean, I get a little heartburn sometimes after a big meal, but that’s just… indigestion. And I haven't been stung by a bee in years. So, no, I don’t think I have any allergies. My daughter is the one with the allergies. She can’t eat gluten or dairy or… well, a whole list of things. I just eat whatever’s put in front of me. Simple. Is that what you need to know? No allergies. Just a hearty appetite. And a need for a “Get Well” card. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting there, Janeth. And thank you for being so patient with my questions. Just a few more. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh, dear. What does that mean? I work. A lot. At the factory. Assembling things. Then I come home, cook dinner for my husband, do a little cleaning. Sometimes we watch television. It's not very exciting, to be honest. I don't… go to the gym or anything. I don't have time for that. And I certainly don't go on vacations. Too expensive. It's a simple life. A quiet life. A tiring life. I suppose that's my lifestyle. And I'm still waiting for that card. Is that good enough? A simple, quiet, tiring life. And a need for a little encouragement.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Janeth. It sounds like you’re a very busy woman, and very dedicated to your husband. And it’s perfectly normal to need a little encouragement. Now, one last question, and it might be a little sensitive, but I like to get a complete picture. Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Oh, changes. Well, yes. My weight… it's creeping up, I think. It's hard to say for sure. I don't weigh myself very often. And my appetite… it's not what it used to be. I get tired more easily, too. Especially after a long shift at the factory. I used to be able to work all day without feeling completely exhausted. But now… now I need a nap as soon as I get home. And sometimes, I just don't feel like eating. Everything tastes… bland. Like cardboard, almost. And I'm always tired. A bone-deep tiredness. I just thought it was old age. Is that what you want to know? That I'm getting old and tired and… less energetic? It's not a very interesting story, is it? And I still haven't gotten my card. Is it really necessary to ask so many questions for a "Get Well" card?
DOCTOR: It’s not about the card anymore, Janeth. It started with a card, but I’m listening to you, and I’m hearing that you're experiencing more than just tiredness. Weight gain, loss of appetite, and increased fatigue can be signs of several things, and it's important to investigate them. I want to make sure you’re healthy and feeling your best. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, dear. A physical exam? Now you’re talking. I haven’t had one of those in… well, I can’t even remember. My husband always said I was fine, just a little tired. But… you think it’s more than that? You think there’s something wrong? I… I don’t know. I don't like doctors. Always poking and prodding. But… if you think it’s important… alright. Alright, I suppose. But be gentle, please. And hurry. I have things to do. And I still want my card. A little encouragement wouldn't hurt, would it? Even before the poking and prodding?
DOCTOR: I promise to be as gentle as possible, Janeth. And we’ll get to the card, I promise. Just let me listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and extremities. It won’t take long. First, let's take your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Alright. Blood pressure first, then. You always start with the blood pressure, don’t you? My husband always said my blood pressure was a little high when I was excited. So, try not to make me nervous. It's hard to relax when you're being poked and prodded. Just… try not to ask too many questions, alright? It makes me anxious. And then, the card. Don’t forget the card. A little encouragement. That’s all I want. Just a little something to brighten my day. Alright, here. My arm. Be gentle.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible, Janeth. Just breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/92. It is a little elevated. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs, particularly on the lower lobes. That could be due to a number of things. Now, I'm just going to take a look at your throat. Open wide and say "Ah."
PATIENT: Ah… Is it something bad? The crackling, you mean? My husband always said my lungs were fine. He was a very practical man, my husband. Always knew what was best. He would have told me not to bother you with silly worries. But you're the doctor, I suppose. You're supposed to know these things. What does crackling mean? Is it serious? And will it take much longer? I have things to do, you know. And I really want that card. A little encouragement. It shouldn't be this difficult, should it?
DOCTOR: The crackling in your lungs, along with the mild fatigue and weight gain you’ve mentioned, suggests that there might be some fluid buildup in your lungs. It's not necessarily serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Your throat looks clear. Now, I’d like to check your extremities—your hands and feet—for any swelling or changes in circulation. Could you please extend your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Swelling? I do get tired feet sometimes, after a long shift. And my hands get sore. But that’s just from the little pieces, you know? All that fiddling and assembling. It's a terrible job for old hands. I don't think there's any swelling. Just… tired. And sore. And aching. And… …getting older. Is that what you want to know? That I'm getting old and falling apart? You're the doctor, you can see it, can't you? It's written all over me. And I still haven’t gotten my card. Are you sure you can't just write me a card? A little encouragement. It would mean so much. Just a few words. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: I do see a little swelling in your ankles and some redness in your fingertips, Janeth. This, along with the other symptoms you've described, leads me to believe there could be a few things going on. It's possible you're experiencing early signs of heart failure, or fluid retention related to kidney issues. We need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I know this is a lot to take in, and I apologize for the delay in getting to the card. It’s important to address these concerns first, and then I promise we’ll get to that. I’d like to order some blood work, a chest X-ray, and an EKG. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Heart failure? Kidney issues? Oh, dear. That sounds… serious. My husband… he would have known what to do. He was always so practical. But I… I don't understand. I just feel tired. And sore. And achy. Blood work? X-rays? An EKG? What does all that mean? And how long will it take? I have things to do, you know. And… …fine. Alright. Do what you have to do. But please, hurry. And… …promise me you won't forget about the card? Just a little something to brighten my day. A little encouragement. Is that too much to ask? Even after all these tests? Just a few words. That's all I want. Just a few words.
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Janeth. I promise I won’t forget about the card. I’ll write it as soon as we have some results from the tests. And I’ll explain everything as we go, so you understand what’s happening. Okay, I’m going to order the blood work, chest X-ray, and EKG. The lab and radiology departments are just down the hall. I'll have a nurse come in and give you the paperwork and instructions. It should take about an hour to complete everything. In the meantime, I want you to rest and try not to worry. And I will be back as soon as the results are available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Rest. An hour. Blood work. X-rays. Fine. Do what you have to do. But… …could you… could you at least tell me… is it going to hurt? The tests, I mean? My husband always said I was a bit of a worrywart. But… it's just… I don't like doctors. Always poking and prodding. And… …promise me you won't forget about the card? Just a few words. That's all I ask. A little encouragement. It would mean so much. Even if the news isn't good. Just a few words. That's all.
DOCTOR: The blood work is just a simple needle prick – it might sting for a moment, but it’s very quick. The chest X-ray doesn’t hurt at all – you’ll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. And the EKG involves placing some small stickers on your chest, which you won’t even feel. Nothing should be painful, I promise. And I absolutely won’t forget about the card, Janeth. I’ll have it ready for you as soon as possible. I’m going to write a quick note to the nurse to explain everything and make sure you’re comfortable. Then, let’s get those tests ordered. Just breathe deeply, and we'll take things one step at a time. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… hurry. And please… …make the card nice. Something cheerful. Something… encouraging. I just want to feel a little better. It’s been a long day. And… …it’s probably going to be a longer one. Alright. Let’s get it over with. But… …please don’t forget about the card. It would mean so much.
DOCTOR: I won’t forget, Janeth. I promise. I’ll write you a beautiful card, something cheerful and encouraging. And I’ll be right here when you’re finished with the tests to discuss the results. Here she is now. She’ll explain everything and take you to the lab and radiology departments. Just relax, and take things one step at a time. .
