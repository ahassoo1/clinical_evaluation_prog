DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. I see here you’re 52 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Andraca, was it? Yes, 52, though I feel much younger, naturally. I’m here about my…vision. It’s been declining, shall we say. Not rapidly, mind you, but noticeable enough that it’s become… inconvenient. I suppose that’s the best way to put it. It’s not as sharp as it once was.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Andraca. Thank you for clarifying. And it’s good to hear you’re feeling well otherwise. Okay, declining vision… and you say it's not rapid, but noticeable. Can you tell me a little more about how it’s declined?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's difficult to explain to someone who presumably has good vision. Things just aren’t…crisp. Distant objects are the first to go, naturally. Reading the fine print on… well, anything, really, has become rather taxing. And it's not simply a matter of needing stronger glasses, though that’s what my ex-wife suggested, of course. She always had a simple solution to everything. It’s… different. More pervasive, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Alcorta. It’s helpful to know it’s not just a simple blurring that improves with correction, and that it feels more widespread. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, you understand. More of a…gradual fading. Perhaps six months ago? No, longer. Maybe closer to a year. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I don’t spend a great deal of time actively observing my vision, Doctor. I have rather more important things to occupy my mind. It just…became apparent. When I realized I was holding things further and further away to read them, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s easy for these things to creep up on you. So, about a year ago you started noticing you needed to hold things further away to read. Have you noticed any changes in your peripheral vision – do you have any difficulty seeing things out of the sides of your eyes?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision… Now there’s a technical term. No, I don’t believe so. Everything seems… contained, if that makes sense. I haven’t bumped into anything recently, and I haven’t missed any obvious movements. Though, I must admit, I don’t spend a great deal of time actively testing my peripheral vision either. I rely on… awareness, shall we say. A certain level of inherent competence. It’s probably perfectly fine. I just can’t see the small print anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes in peripheral vision that you've noticed. And it sounds like the main issue is difficulty with close-up and distant reading. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this vision change?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No flashes of light, no floaters, no pain. No double vision, thankfully. I haven’t noticed any… discoloration, or anything of that nature. No, I can’t say I have. Just the… diminishing clarity. It’s a frustrating thing, really. I always prided myself on my sharp intellect, and good vision, I always assumed, went hand-in-hand with that. It’s unsettling to feel… compromised.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. It’s definitely unsettling when a sense you rely on starts to change. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, nothing major, thankfully. I had a bout of… indigestion a few years back, but that cleared up with a change in diet. And my ex-wife insisted I see a therapist for a while, which was… unproductive, to say the least. But no serious ailments. I don’t take any regular medication, either. I believe in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, you see. Though, admittedly, that’s been more difficult since the divorce. Still, I’m generally quite robust, all things considered. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing of that nature.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No diabetes or heart trouble is particularly relevant. And it's helpful to know you haven't been on any long-term medications. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. Nothing major, no. I had my tonsils removed as a child, naturally. And I had a rather unfortunate incident involving a splinter when I was younger, which required a… minor procedure. But nothing significant. No eye surgeries, certainly. I’ve always taken good care of my eyes. Though, it seems that hasn’t been enough. Perhaps it’s simply…age. A regrettable but inevitable decline.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils as a child, and a minor splinter removal. No eye surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… is there a family history of any eye conditions, like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a rather difficult question. My mother’s side of the family wasn’t particularly forthcoming with medical information. And my father… well, he wasn’t around much. I know my grandmother had “trouble with her eyes” as she got older, but beyond that, I’m afraid I have no information. I believe she wore glasses, naturally. Most people do, eventually. But beyond that, I couldn’t say. It’s not something we discussed, frankly. More pressing matters were usually at hand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited family history. It's not uncommon. And finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. I find the habit utterly repulsive. And detrimental to one’s health, naturally. I’ve always been a proponent of clean living. Though, as I mentioned, the divorce has made maintaining that lifestyle somewhat…challenging. But I assure you, I don't smoke. Never have, never will. A deplorable habit, in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Socially, occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Or a single malt scotch on a particularly… trying evening. But nothing excessive. I don’t “drink to cope,” as they say. I maintain a certain level of… decorum, you understand. I don't believe in excess of any kind. It's simply… civilized. Though, admittedly, civilization has been in short supply lately. But no, I don’t have a… drinking problem, if that’s what you’re implying.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional social drinking. That's good to know. Alright, Mr. Alcorta, thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick eye exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly acceptable. Though, I must warn you, I’m rather particular about things being…precise. I have a certain level of expectation when it comes to professional services, you understand. But proceed, by all means. I trust you know what you’re doing. Just…be gentle, if you would. My eyes are rather sensitive, you know. And I’d appreciate a clear explanation of your findings, naturally. No technical jargon, if you please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. I understand. I’ll be as gentle as possible and explain everything in plain language. First, I’m going to check your visual acuity – that’s just how well you can see at different distances. Then, I'll check your peripheral vision, and look at the health of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. It doesn’t hurt at all, and I’ll explain each step as I go. Okay, let’s start with the visual acuity. Could you please read the letters on this chart for me, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Very well. Charts, of course. I suppose it’s unavoidable. Let’s see… E… P… T… O… Yes, quite legible, actually. Though, I must admit, the font is rather small. It's almost… a challenge. D… C… B… F… Hmm. This is becoming…less clear. I can discern the shapes, certainly, but the precise definition…is lacking. Is it permissible to move closer?
DOCTOR: Of course, please move as close as you need to. Okay, thank you. With correction, your vision is 20/40 in both eyes. Without correction, it’s 20/200. That means you have some difficulty seeing things at a distance. Now, I’m going to check your peripheral vision. I’m going to ask you to focus on this point, and I’ll move my finger in from the sides. Just tell me when you can see it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: 20/40 with correction… and 20/200 without. Not entirely unexpected, I suppose. Though, hardly ideal. Peripheral vision… Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust you have calibrated the device appropriately? One doesn't want inaccurate readings, naturally. Proceed, Doctor. I'll do my best to cooperate. Though, I must warn you, my focus is not what it once was. It tends to… wander. But I'll endeavor to maintain concentration.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Alcorta. Your peripheral vision is full to confrontation in both eyes – meaning you can see a full range of vision on the sides. It appears normal. Now, I'm going to use an ophthalmoscope to look inside your eyes. It’s a light and a magnifying instrument. I'll just get close to your eyes, and you may see a bright light. It doesn't hurt, but it can be a little startling. Just relax and look straight ahead. Okay?
PATIENT: An ophthalmoscope… Yes, I’ve heard of those. A light, you say? Very well. Relax, you say. Easier said than done, Doctor. But I’ll attempt it. Though, I must caution you, I have a rather pronounced blink reflex. Proceed with caution, Doctor. And do try to minimize the brightness. A sudden flash could be… disconcerting. Though, I suppose it's unavoidable. Let us begin. But be gentle, if you would. My eyes are rather sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. All done. Alright, based on my examination, your optic discs look healthy, and there are no signs of glaucoma or macular degeneration. I do see some early signs of cataracts in both eyes, which is common for people your age. They're not severe enough to require treatment at this time, but they are contributing to your blurry vision. Your retinas look normal. Overall, it seems your primary issue is cataracts and refractive error – meaning you need glasses. Your vision is definitely impaired, but it doesn’t appear to be caused by any serious underlying condition. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Cataracts… and refractive error. Cataracts, you say? Not entirely unexpected, I suppose. The ex-wife did mention something about “aging eyes” on occasion. Though, I dismissed it as…domestic chatter. Refractive error… that implies a need for corrective lenses, naturally. Not ideal, but hardly catastrophic. So, no underlying condition? No glaucoma, no macular degeneration? That is… reassuring. Though, I must admit, the prospect of wearing glasses is… distasteful. Is there no alternative? No exercises, no dietary changes? Nothing to…restore my natural vision?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to wear glasses, Mr. Alcorta. It’s not a desirable solution for everyone. Unfortunately, there aren’t any exercises or dietary changes that can reverse cataracts or correct refractive error. There are some surgical options for cataracts, but given their early stage, it's not something we need to consider at this time. Surgery is usually reserved for when cataracts significantly interfere with your daily activities. For now, the best course of action is to get a pair of glasses. This will significantly improve your vision and quality of life. I can write you a prescription, and you can take it to any optician to get glasses fitted. Would you like me to write you a prescription?
PATIENT: Surgery… not at this time. Naturally. A rather drastic measure for a… minor inconvenience. Glasses, then. The least objectionable option, I suppose. Though, hardly elegant. Very well, Doctor. A prescription, then. Though, I must insist on a… high-quality lens. No cheap plastic, if you please. And a discreet frame. Something… understated. I don't wish to advertise my… diminishing faculties. Proceed, Doctor. Let us get this… ordeal over with. But do ensure the prescription is accurate. I have a certain level of expectation when it comes to precision, you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. I understand. I'll make sure the prescription is accurate and tailored to your needs. And I'll note your preferences for high-quality lenses and a discreet frame. Here you go. This prescription is good for one year. I recommend visiting an optician who can help you choose the right lenses and frames for your lifestyle and preferences. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Very well. And an optician, you say? I suppose that’s inevitable. No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You’ve answered my questions adequately, despite the… discouraging diagnosis. I thank you for your time and…professional services. Though, I must admit, I find the entire experience rather… unsettling. Perhaps a change in diet is in order. Though, I doubt it will make a significant difference. Good day, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your disappointment, and I’m glad I could provide some clarity. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns. And while diet won’t reverse the cataracts, a healthy lifestyle is always beneficial. Have a good day, and take care. .
