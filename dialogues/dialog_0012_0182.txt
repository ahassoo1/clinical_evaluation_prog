DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Orwin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Dr. Yoshino. Yes. Well, I suppose I'm here for this…clearance. For the, you know, the face work. Honestly, I haven't got all day, so let’s just get on with it, shall we? It’s not like it's a complicated procedure. A little tightening here, a little lift there. It’s not as if I’m asking for a full reconstruction.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're here for a pre-operative evaluation for a facial cosmetic procedure. Absolutely, we'll try to be efficient. Just to be thorough – and to make sure everything goes smoothly for you – I'll need to ask a few questions about your medical history and overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. History. Well, I’ve lived a long life, so there’s some history. Mostly just the usual aches and pains for a man my age. I’ve always been fairly robust, though. Worked with terrazzo for…well, a very long time. Strong back, strong hands. But, truthfully, I don’t see how my past job affects my face. Are you sure you need to know all this?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It’s not that I don’t trust the surgeon’s assessment, it’s just that all parts of your health picture can influence how you heal and recover, even from a relatively minor procedure. Knowing about things like your work history helps me understand your overall physical condition. So, terrazzo work…that sounds physically demanding. Did it involve a lot of lifting, bending, or repetitive motions?
PATIENT: Repetitive motions? Good heavens, yes! Polishing, grinding, setting the chips… it’s not like sitting behind a desk, you know. And lifting…bags of cement, the slabs themselves…a man builds up muscle doing that work. Though, that was a long time ago. I’m retired now, thank goodness. Don’t need to be hauling anything heavy these days. I mostly just…well, I try to keep busy. Gardening, mostly. Though my back isn’t what it used to be. Are we getting anywhere with this? It feels like a lot of questions for something simple.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting there, Mr. Orwin. Knowing about the physical demands of your past work, and your current activity level is helpful. The gardening is good, staying active is important. And yes, back pain is common with those types of activities. Let's talk about medical issues. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something about that a few years back, but I don’t recall the specifics. I took a pill for a while, but it made me feel sluggish, so I stopped taking it. Felt better without it, to be honest. Diabetes? No, never. Heart problems? No, my heart's always been strong. Always been able to handle a good hike, even now. I eat reasonably well, I think. Not much sweets. Though my wife, bless her soul, she was a baker. So there was always pie around. But that was years ago, of course. She's gone now. Are you writing all this down? It sounds terribly depressing.
DOCTOR: I am, Mr. Orwin. It's important to have a complete picture. And it’s okay if it feels a little…heavy. It’s good you mentioned the high blood pressure, even if you stopped taking medication for it. We might want to check that again just to be sure. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Just a few more questions, then we can move on. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. When I was a boy, I had appendicitis. That required a stay. Other than that…nothing major. I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder while cleaning the gutters, but that was just an overnight thing. No surgeries, other than the appendix, of course. And I certainly haven’t been in the hospital in… oh, goodness, decades. Really, I’ve been a remarkably healthy man, all things considered. I just want to get this face thing over with, so I can get back to my garden. It’s the roses that need tending, you know. They’re quite particular.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, and a wrist fracture. That’s good to know. And you’ve been generally healthy since then, that’s excellent. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I take a little something for my arthritis, just when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I believe. Nothing regularly, though. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a melatonin tablet. Just one, mind you. Don’t want to become dependent on it. Other than that…no. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. They never seem to do much good anyway, in my experience. Honestly, I think a good night’s sleep and a bit of fresh air are more effective. Are we nearly finished? My knees are starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Mr. Orwin. Just a few more quick questions and then we can do a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. Maybe a little bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s hardly an allergy. And I certainly haven’t had any trouble with food. I eat most things. Although, I don’t particularly care for beets. But that's a matter of taste, not an allergy. Are you sure you need to know about my dislike of beets? It seems rather…trivial.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Orwin, your preference for beets is definitely not something I need to know! I just want to be thorough. Okay, last question. And this is important. Have you had any problems with bleeding or bruising easily?
PATIENT: Bleeding? No, not particularly. I’ve cut myself a few times while gardening, of course, but nothing serious. It always stopped eventually. Bruising…well, I bruise a little easier now than I used to, I suppose. Getting old, you know. But nothing that requires a doctor. I don’t take blood thinners or anything like that. I’m a fairly robust man, all things considered. Really, I don’t see what all these questions are for. It's just a little tightening of the skin, not a major operation! Can we get on with it now? I have roses to tend to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Thank you for your patience with all the questions. It is good you told me about the easier bruising. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at the areas where you’ll be having the procedure. It’ll only take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Honestly, I’ve been examined by doctors more times than I can count. A few minutes, you say? See to it it is a few minutes. And be gentle, please. My skin is rather sensitive these days. And try not to poke me too much. I really would like to get back to my roses. They're quite demanding, you know. Stop talking and just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, as we discussed, but nothing alarming. I'll just take a look at the areas where you’ll be having the procedure. Everything looks good here, Mr. Orwin. Just some expected age-related changes. No concerns that would prevent you from having the procedure.
PATIENT: Good. That’s what I thought. No concerns. See? I told you it was nothing serious. So, what happens now? Do I just go and see this surgeon? And can I get a note saying everything’s alright? I don't want to have to explain all this again. Just a simple note will do. And quickly, please. I'm losing daylight.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Here’s a note for the surgeon summarizing my findings and stating that you are medically cleared for the procedure. It includes the slightly elevated blood pressure and the easier bruising you mentioned, just as a precaution. I recommend you discuss the slightly elevated blood pressure with the surgeon, and they may want to monitor it closely during and after the procedure. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No, I don’t think so. Just…thank you. I suppose. Honestly, it was a bit of a fuss over nothing, but I appreciate you being thorough. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must get back to my roses. They won’t tend themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help. And I hope you enjoy tending to your roses – they sound beautiful. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the future. Have a wonderful day, and be careful out there. .
