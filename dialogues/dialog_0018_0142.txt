DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning to you too, Doctor. It's... headaches, mostly. Bad ones. They come and go, and when they do come... well, I get really sweaty, and my heart feels like it's racing. I don’t… I don’t really remember when they started, to be honest. It’s been a while, though. Definitely not recent.
DOCTOR: I understand. Headaches, accompanied by sweating and a racing heart. It's good you're seeking medical attention for this. It’s often helpful to gather a bit more detail to understand what might be going on. When you say they "come and go," could you describe the pattern?
PATIENT: Pattern… hmm. That’s a tough one. It’s not like, every Tuesday or anything. It feels… random? Sometimes it’ll be weeks between them, other times a few days. And the length of them… varies too. Some are just a few hours, others… a whole day, maybe? I really can’t pin it down, sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… fuzzy, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Lawther. It's common for these things to be difficult to pinpoint. We’ll work through it together. “Fuzzy” is a helpful description, actually. Now, can you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Right, the headaches. They're… throbbing, mostly. Like a really bad pressure, all over my head, but kinda focused on my temples, I guess. And… sometimes they feel like they’re behind my eyes? It’s hard to explain. Definitely not a dull ache, it's… intense. And bright lights make it way worse. I usually just have to lie down in a dark room.
DOCTOR: Throbbing, focused on the temples and sometimes behind the eyes, and worsened by bright lights. That gives us a clearer picture. Do you experience any other symptoms with the headaches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, but I haven't actually been sick. And… occasionally, everything gets a bit blurry before it starts, like… spots in my vision? Not always, though. It’s not a consistent thing. And… I get really tired afterward. Like, wiped out for the rest of the day. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Nausea, visual disturbances – spots in your vision – and significant fatigue afterward. These details are important. Now, I'd like to ask a few broader questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers… Honestly, not really. I’ve tried to think about it, but I haven’t found anything consistent. Stress maybe? But I’m pretty much always stressed, so that doesn’t narrow it down much. I haven’t noticed it being linked to anything I eat or drink, or any particular activity. It just… happens. Which is frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lawther. It’s certainly challenging when there isn’t an obvious trigger. Let’s move on to your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Uh, not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, and I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I’ve never been told I have anything… wrong with me, not officially. I was divorced a few years back, if that counts. Does that even matter? I guess not.
DOCTOR: No, divorce doesn’t relate to your medical history, Mr. Lawther, but thank you for sharing. It's good to know you haven’t had any previous medical diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife. Just the broken arm, and that didn't need surgery, just a cast. I'm not exactly a frequent visitor to the doctor's office, if that's any indication. I don't have any insurance, either, if that’s something you need to know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Lawther. It’s helpful to have a complete picture. And no, it doesn’t change anything regarding our assessment. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mum had migraines, I think. Bad ones, but she never really went to the doctor much either. My dad was… pretty healthy, as far as I know. He passed away a few years back, but he didn't really have any major illnesses. I don’t really know much beyond that, to be honest. We weren't a very… medical family. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Lawther. A history of migraines in your mother is relevant. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I don’t really drink much either, maybe a beer now and then with friends, but nothing regular. I work, you know? Production work, mostly. It keeps me pretty tired. I try to eat okay, but it’s hard when you're working long hours. Mostly just whatever's quick and easy.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven’t really taken much medication over the years, so I haven’t had the chance to be allergic to anything, I guess. I might have had a reaction to something as a kid, but I honestly can't remember what it was. Sorry. I’m not much help with this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Lawther. We'll continue to gather information as we proceed. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it's gonna be… uncomfortable. I'm not a big fan of doctors, if I'm honest. But I appreciate you trying to figure things out.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at this time. Your pulse is 82, regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Cranial nerves are intact. No focal neurological deficits detected. Everything appears normal so far, Mr. Lawther. Based on your symptoms and this initial exam, the presentation is consistent with possible tension headaches or migraines. However, given the episodic nature and the associated symptoms of sweating and a racing heart, it’s important to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: Okay. That… sounds good, I guess? I mean, I’m glad nothing’s seriously wrong, but it’s still annoying having these headaches. So, what happens now? Are you gonna give me some pills? Or… what? I’m just not sure what to expect. And honestly, I'm a bit worried about… everything. I just want them to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lawther, and it’s perfectly valid to be worried. We’ll work through this step by step. Given your symptoms, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your headaches. We’ll also check your thyroid function, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause similar symptoms. I'm also considering the possibility of cluster headaches, though the pattern doesn't quite fit perfectly. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask you to keep a headache diary for the next two weeks, noting the date, time, duration, intensity, and any associated symptoms or potential triggers. I have some information here about headache diaries and keeping track of your symptoms. Regarding medication, I’m hesitant to prescribe anything strong immediately without having a clearer diagnosis. I can recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for occasional relief, but long-term use isn’t ideal. We need to find the root cause of these headaches first. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… sounds okay. Blood work is fine, I guess. And a diary… I can try, though I’m not very good at remembering things, as you know. But I'll do my best. Ibuprofen is fine, I’ve taken that before. It doesn’t always help, but it’s worth a shot. How long will the blood work take? And… what if it is something serious? I don't want to spend all my time worrying about it. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Lawther, and it’s perfectly natural to worry. The blood work should take about 3-5 business days to come back. The lab is located just down the street, and I have a requisition form here for you. You don’t need an appointment. Regarding the possibility of something serious, it’s important to remember that most headaches are not caused by a life-threatening condition. However, it’s crucial to rule out any potential underlying causes. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly when they come back, and I’ll explain everything in detail. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any known triggers if you can identify them. Ensure you’re getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, and managing your stress levels. If your headaches worsen significantly, or you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, stiff neck, vision changes, or weakness – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Lawther?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers it, for now. The blood work, the diary… and try not to worry too much. It’s just a lot to take in. But thank you, Doctor. For listening, and for trying to figure things out. I appreciate it. How much will the blood work cost, roughly? I don't have much money, as you know. I just need to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Lawther. I understand it’s a lot to take in, and I want to assure you that we’ll proceed at your pace. Regarding the cost of the blood work, it will roughly be between $80 to $150, depending on the specific tests ordered. However, since you don’t have insurance, I can connect you with a local program that offers financial assistance for medical expenses. They may be able to cover a portion of the cost, or even the entire bill. Would you be interested in learning more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… incredibly helpful. I really appreciate that. I don't know what I'd do without some help. I'm just glad you're trying to figure things out with me. It’s nice to have someone listen. I think that's all I can think of for now. I’ll try to keep the diary, and I'll get the blood work done as soon as I can. Thank you again, Doctor Stilaire.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Lawther. I’m glad I could help. I’ll print out some information about the financial assistance program for you. Here’s the contact information and the application process. I’ll also give you a copy of your lab requisition form and a headache diary template. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, if your symptoms worsen, or you experience any new symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. I’ll follow up with you in about a week to discuss your headache diary and the results of your blood work. Wishing you all the best, Mr. Lawther. Take care.
