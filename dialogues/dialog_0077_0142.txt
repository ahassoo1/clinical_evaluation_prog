DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Lawther. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Yeah, it's nice to meet you too. Right… what brings me in. Hmm. It’s these headaches, see? They come on pretty strong, and I get all sweaty when they do, and my heart… it feels like it’s racing. It’s happened a few times now. I don't really... know what's causing them, to be honest. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Headaches with sweating and a racing heart… alright. And these headaches, Mr. Lawther, could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Um… describing it… It's not like a normal headache, you know? It’s not like a dull ache. It’s… more like a really bad pressure, all over my head, kinda. And it feels… tight? Like someone’s squeezing my brain. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A tight, pressure-like sensation… And how long do these episodes typically last?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. They don’t last long, exactly. Maybe… twenty minutes? Sometimes a bit longer, but not usually. It’s hard to tell, to be honest. I usually just try to lie down until it passes. I don’t really time them or anything. It's just… unpleasant. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Twenty minutes, give or take. And do you notice anything that seems to trigger these headaches, Mr. Lawther?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. Not really, not that I've noticed. It seems to happen… randomly? I mean, I’ve had them when I was stressed, yeah, but I get stressed pretty often, and they don’t happen every time. I haven’t noticed anything specific that sets them off. Sometimes it’s after I’ve been… moving around a lot, but not always. Honestly, I’m pretty confused by it all.
DOCTOR: I understand your confusion. Random occurrences are often difficult to pinpoint. Now, let's try to get a broader picture. Have you experienced any changes in your vision recently – blurry vision, spots, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Vision… no, not really. I mean, I wear glasses, as you can see, and I think my prescription might be a little off, but that's just… normal. Nothing different different. No blurry spots, or anything like that. Just… the usual blurry-ness. Does that make sense? I haven't noticed anything new with my vision, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things. And have you noticed any nausea or vomiting accompanying these headaches, Mr. Lawther?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, sometimes. Not every time, but sometimes I feel really sick to my stomach when one comes on. I haven’t actually… thrown up, if that makes a difference. Just… really nauseous. It usually passes when the headache does, though. It's not… pleasant, either, but I can usually manage it. It all just feels… awful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nausea, but no vomiting. Now, let’s move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any fever, neck stiffness, or sensitivity to light or sound with these headaches?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. Definitely not. Neck stiffness… hmm. Sometimes my neck feels a little tight, but I just figured that was from… sitting at a desk all day. And sensitivity to light… maybe a little? Like, bright lights bother me sometimes, but I always assumed that was just… normal. I don't know. I haven’t really paid attention to it. I'm really not good at remembering details, sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Lawther. It's difficult to recall everything. Now, do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions… uh… not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed. And… I had the usual childhood illnesses, I guess. Nothing serious. I’ve never been… hospitalized or anything. My divorce was… stressful, but that wasn't a medical thing. I'm pretty healthy, usually. That’s why this is so confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant past medical history. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I'll just try to tough things out, usually. I might take some ibuprofen for a sore back sometimes, but that's it. Nothing regular. Just… when I really need it. I don't really like the way they make me feel.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I mean, I get hay fever sometimes, but it’s not serious. Just a bit of sneezing and a runny nose. And… I think I might be a little sensitive to shellfish, but I haven’t eaten it in years, so I’m not really sure. I haven't had any… bad reactions to anything, really. Just the usual sniffles. I don’t think I'm seriously allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known serious allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… uh… that’s a tough one. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mum… she had arthritis, I think. And my grandmother on my mum’s side… she had something with her heart, but I don’t really remember what. It’s all a bit… vague, to be honest. I don’t really keep track of things like that. It's just… family, you know? It’s been a while since I’ve talked to anyone about their health.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of hypertension and arthritis in the family. Now, lastly, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… uh… I work, mostly. Production work, so it's pretty physical. I live alone now, after the divorce. I don’t really have many hobbies, to be honest. I watch TV sometimes, and I go out with friends occasionally. I don’t really drink much, and I don't smoke. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard when you're busy. I wouldn't say I'm very active, but I'm not a couch potato either. Just… normal, I guess. It’s not very exciting, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information, Mr. Lawther. Now, if you’ll excuse me for a moment, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to be… unpleasant. I’m not really good with… medical stuff, to be honest. But yeah, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142/92. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function... Could you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can see it. No problem. Is everything alright? You seem… serious. I'm not very good with… medical things, to be honest. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal and strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your neck to check for any tenderness or stiffness. There’s some mild tenderness in the posterior neck muscles, but no significant stiffness. Overall, the neurological examination is normal. Now, I will briefly examine your ears, nose, and throat. Ears are clear. Throat is mildly erythematous, but no exudates. Based on the physical examination and your reported symptoms, I believe your headaches could be tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by stress and muscle tension in your neck. However, given the accompanying symptoms of sweating and a racing heart, and the fact that your blood pressure is slightly elevated, I want to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Other possibilities? What other possibilities? Is it something serious? You said it could be tension headaches, but… sweating and a racing heart don’t sound like tension headaches. And my blood pressure being high… that doesn’t sound good, does it? What are you thinking? I’m starting to get worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you're voicing your concerns, Mr. Lawther. It’s important to be thorough. While tension headaches are the most likely cause, we need to rule out things like migraine headaches, sinus infections, and, less likely but important to consider, other underlying conditions. The sweating and racing heart, along with the elevated blood pressure, warrant further investigation. To be safe, I would like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out thyroid issues. We’ll also want to monitor your blood pressure over the next few days. I also recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A complete blood count… a basic metabolic panel… a thyroid test… an EKG… That sounds like a lot. Is it… is it something serious? You said it was probably tension headaches, but… all these tests… It sounds like you’re thinking it could be something else. What are you most worried about? Just… tell me straight. I’d rather know the worst than just… wait around and worry.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, it's true that the tests are comprehensive, and that's because I want to be absolutely certain we identify the cause of your symptoms. While tension headaches are common, the accompanying symptoms you described – sweating, racing heart, and slightly elevated blood pressure – require us to rule out other, less common, possibilities. I'm most concerned about the possibility of an underlying cardiovascular issue, such as an arrhythmia, or potentially a thyroid disorder, which can sometimes present with similar symptoms. It’s also important to rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. However, I want to reiterate that this doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. These tests are simply a precautionary measure to ensure we provide you with the most accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. We'll know more once the results come back. I’m going to order the tests now, and the lab technician will explain the process to you. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah… alright. Cardiovascular issue… thyroid… It sounds… scary. Okay, order the tests. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again. And… thank you. For being straight with me, even if it’s… worrying. What happens after the tests? How long will it take to get the results? And… will you explain everything to me? I’m not good with medical stuff, to be honest. I’ll probably need someone to explain it all to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lawther. It's understandable to feel anxious, and I’m here to help you through this. The lab technician will draw a small sample of blood, and the results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once the results are available, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment, and I will absolutely explain everything to you in detail. Don’t hesitate to bring a family member or friend with you for support, if you’d like. I’ll take the time to go through everything step-by-step, and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here is a lab requisition. The technician is ready for you.
