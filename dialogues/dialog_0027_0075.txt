DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this tiredness, really. Daytime tiredness. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – for the sleep apnea, you see – and it helps with the snoring, definitely. My wife used to complain, but… well, never mind about that now. But even with the machine, I’m still dragging myself through the day. It's just… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness even with the CPAP machine. That’s good information. And how long has this tiredness been going on, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… probably close to six months now, maybe a little longer. It started gradually, you know? I thought it was just getting older, honestly. But it hasn’t gotten better, and if anything, it's a little worse. It makes it hard to concentrate, even to read the newspaper. And I enjoy my reading!
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, getting worse, and affecting your concentration. And besides the tiredness and trouble concentrating, have you noticed any other changes, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, my memory hasn’t been quite as sharp, I suppose. Not major, you understand. I still remember things perfectly from years ago! But… little things. Like where I put my glasses, or… what I went into the kitchen for. It’s frustrating, but again, could just be age. I do find myself napping more during the day, though. Short naps, usually after lunch. Not restful naps, mind you. Just… falling asleep in my chair.
DOCTOR: Okay, some memory problems and those naps. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or your weight recently, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My appetite… well, it's been a little off, I think. Not much of an appetite really. And my weight… I have lost a few pounds, I believe. Not intentionally, though. I haven't been trying to lose weight. Just not as hungry as I used to be. My daughter keeps telling me I need to eat more. She worries, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… now. Oh! Sometimes I get these headaches. Not terrible headaches, just… dull aches. Mostly in the mornings, after I wake up. And… oh dear, this is probably nothing… but I’ve been feeling a little… irritable lately. Snappish, my daughter says. And she’s usually right.
DOCTOR: <stage>I type quickly: “Reports morning headaches, increased irritability. Possible connection to fatigue?
PATIENT: Okay, headaches and irritability. Now, you mentioned using a machine for your sleep apnea. Do you know what setting it’s on? And how often do you use it each night?
DOCTOR: Do you happen to know the pressure setting on the machine, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I… honestly, I haven’t the slightest idea. The doctor who prescribed it… he adjusted it a few times, and then told me to just use it every night. I just turn it on and go to sleep! I’m not very good with all the technical stuff, you see. It has a number on it… let me think… I think it said 12… or maybe 14? It’s one of those numbers, anyway. I use it every night, though. Except for the rare time the power goes out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical conditions, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder removed years ago. That was a long time ago, though, no problems since. And my blood pressure runs a little high, the doctor told me. I take a pill for that every day. A small white pill. And… oh, yes! My arthritis bothers me sometimes, mostly in my hands. It’s not too bad, but it can be stiff in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just the blood pressure pill, as far as I know. And sometimes I take something for the arthritis, when it’s really bothering me. It’s… ibuprofen, I think. The over-the-counter kind. Nothing else regularly, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife used to be allergic to bee stings, poor thing, but I’ve always been fine.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she used to smoke, but she quit years ago. Thank goodness.
DOCTOR: And how about alcohol, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Oh, I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive, you understand. Just one glass. Occasionally two, if it’s a special occasion. But I don’t drink every day. Maybe three or four times a week, at most.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, can you tell me a little bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein… My daughter is always reminding me to eat more fish. She's very good about that. I like a good sandwich, too. And I have a sweet tooth, I must admit. A little piece of chocolate after dinner is a treat I enjoy. Nothing too extravagant, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Paske. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological exam. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart and lungs sound good. Your neurological exam is largely normal, though your reflexes are a bit slow. That can be normal for someone your age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, I’m thinking we should do some blood work to rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue. We’ll check your thyroid, your vitamin levels, and a complete blood count to look for anemia or other abnormalities.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work, yes, that makes sense. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m also going to order a sleep study to reassess your CPAP settings and ensure it's optimized. Sometimes the pressure needs adjusting. In the meantime, I want you to try and maintain a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. Also, make sure you’re staying hydrated throughout the day, and try to incorporate some gentle exercise into your routine, if you're able. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the blood work and sleep study. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. A sleep study and blood work… and try to keep a regular schedule. I can do that, I think. It’s just… sometimes it’s hard to get motivated. But I’ll try. And thank you for listening to me. It helps to just talk about it, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. That’s what I’m here for. I understand it can be difficult, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Let's get the lab orders and sleep study referral sent over, and the receptionist will schedule your follow-up. Do you have any questions for me before I finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and I feel much better already just knowing we're looking into it. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, and we’ll see you at your follow-up.
