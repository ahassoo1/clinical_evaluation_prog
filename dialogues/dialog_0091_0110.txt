DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I feel like I need a bit of a… jumpstart, you might say. I’m not sick sick, but I’m just not feeling as… vibrant as I used to. Getting older, I suppose, but I’d like to do something about it if I can.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to maintain your vitality as you age, Ms. McNabb. We can certainly explore that. When you say “not as vibrant,” could you describe that feeling a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… it’s hard to put into words. I just don’t have the energy I used to. Things feel… heavier, if that makes sense? Even getting up from a chair takes a little more effort. And I used to enjoy gardening, but I find myself putting it off more and more. It’s not pain, exactly, just… a lack of pep. Does that help at all? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No, that’s quite helpful, Ms. McNabb. It sounds like you’re experiencing some fatigue and a decrease in your usual activity level. It's not vague at all; these are important details. And it's good you're proactive about it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me when you first started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It’s been… gradual. Probably started about six months ago, maybe a little longer. I thought it was just the winter, honestly. I always feel a bit more sluggish when it’s cold and gray. But it hasn’t really lifted with the warmer weather, so I thought I should probably get it checked out. It's just… not like me to feel this way.
DOCTOR: I see. So, approximately six months of gradually increasing fatigue and decreased energy, not significantly improved with the change in seasons. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this fatigue?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been sleeping a bit more. Not necessarily better, just… longer. And I used to have a very good appetite, but it’s lessened a bit too. Nothing dramatic, but I don't enjoy my food as much. My daughter, bless her heart, keeps saying I’ve lost a little weight, but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. I really should, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, tracking your weight would be helpful, Ms. McNabb. It’s good you’re noticing these changes. So, to summarize, we have increasing fatigue, decreased energy, increased sleep duration, and a reduced appetite with possible weight loss over the last six months. Are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no pain, Doctor. Not really. My joints ache a little sometimes, like when it’s going to rain, but that’s just old age, I think! It's not a constant thing, and nothing debilitating. Just a little… creakiness. I'm more concerned with this tiredness, to be honest. It’s just… draining. It makes it hard to enjoy things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to know there’s no significant pain. We’ll focus on this fatigue. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps, chickenpox. Nothing serious. When I was in my fifties, I had my gallbladder removed, but that was many years ago and I recovered fully. And I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. My doctor back home – I just moved here last year, you see – kept a very close eye on it. Oh, and I had a bout of shingles a few years back, but that cleared up completely as well. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. McNabb. Gallbladder removal, well-controlled hypertension, and a history of shingles. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it written down somewhere… Ah, here we are. It's Lisinopril, I believe. 20 milligrams, once a day. My daughter helps me keep track of it, bless her heart. She’s very organized. I sometimes forget if I’ve taken it or not, but she always reminds me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 20mg daily. And aside from Lisinopril, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I used to take a calcium supplement for my bones, but I stopped a few months ago. I didn’t seem to be absorbing it very well, to be honest. Just a lot of… unpleasantness. So, no, nothing else at the moment. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fish and vegetables. My daughter makes sure I get enough fruit, too. She worries about me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McNabb. No other medications or supplements. And you have no known allergies?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, thankfully! My daughter always asks when we go to restaurants, but I haven’t had a reaction to anything in my life. Not even poison ivy as a child. I always thought I was a bit of a miracle.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… Well, my mother lived to be 92, so that’s good. She was very active all her life, always gardening and walking. My father passed away when he was in his seventies from a heart condition, I believe. He smoked a lot when he was younger, which I always told him was a bad idea. My sister has high blood pressure, like me, and she’s also had some problems with her cholesterol. And my brother… well, he had diabetes, but he passed away several years ago. Is that helpful? It’s hard to remember everything, you see.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. McNabb. History of longevity in your mother, heart condition in your father, and hypertension and diabetes in your siblings. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life, and I haven't touched a drop of alcohol in… well, decades. Not since my wedding, and even then it was just a small glass of champagne. And drugs? Heavens no! I’m a very good Catholic girl, you see. I try to live a clean and healthy life. I always have.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social situation?
PATIENT: Oh, well. I moved here last year to be closer to my daughter and her family. I was living on my own back home, and it was getting a little lonely. I have a lovely daughter and two grandchildren - a boy and a girl. They keep me very busy! I do miss my friends, though. I haven't made many new ones yet, to be honest. It's hard to get out and socialize when you're feeling tired all the time. But I do enjoy spending time with my family. That’s what keeps me going, really.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. McNabb. It sounds like you have a strong support system, which is very important. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and perform a neurological assessment. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I just want to feel like myself again, you see. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Ms. McNabb, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. That’s not drastically high, but it’s worth noting. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s a soft murmur, and likely benign, but we should keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength and coordination are good. Overall, your neurological exam is unremarkable. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. No swelling or abnormalities noted. Overall, the physical exam is largely unremarkable, but the elevated blood pressure and the heart murmur warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… a bit worrying, doesn’t it? A murmur? I hadn’t realized. I just thought I was getting older and a bit more tired. Is it something serious, Doctor? Should I be concerned? I do hope it’s nothing too drastic. I’m not a young woman anymore, you see, but I still like to be active when I can.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. McNabb. While a heart murmur can sometimes indicate a problem, it’s important to remember that many murmurs are harmless, known as “innocent murmurs.” Often, they're simply the sound of blood flowing normally through a healthy heart. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur, I would like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out thyroid problems, and an electrocardiogram to evaluate your heart’s electrical activity. We may also consider a chest X-ray, depending on the results of the other tests. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That’s… a lot of tests. But if it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s causing this tiredness. And the elevated blood pressure… I hadn’t even realized that was a problem. My doctor back home always kept it under control, but perhaps things have changed since I moved. Will these tests be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a luncheon with my daughter next week, and I wouldn’t want to be feeling poorly then.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. McNabb. The tests are not painful at all. The CBC and CMP require a simple blood draw, which may cause a brief pinch. The ECG is completely non-invasive; small stickers are placed on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. Typically, the results take about 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. I'll also want to review your Lisinopril dosage, given your blood pressure reading. It might be necessary to adjust it. In the meantime, continue taking it as prescribed. I'll have my nurse draw the blood for you right away, and then we'll schedule the ECG for later this week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and kindness. It’s good to know it won’t be painful, and I’m relieved it’s just a blood draw and stickers. I trust you to take good care of me. And yes, please do review the Lisinopril dosage. I wouldn’t want my blood pressure to get too high. Shall I go with the nurse now, then? I hope they’re gentle with the needle!
DOCTOR: Yes, please. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. She’s very skilled and gentle. I'll also have her print out some information about healthy lifestyle habits – diet and exercise – to help support your energy levels while we wait for the results. I’ll check in with you shortly after the tests to see how you’re doing. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. McNabb.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. And I will be sure to let you know if anything changes. I feel a bit better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. I’ll see you soon.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Ms. McNabb. Please take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
