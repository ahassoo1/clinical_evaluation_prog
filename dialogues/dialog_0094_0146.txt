DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… weakness, I guess. In my muscles. It's been getting worse lately, and it’s making things… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle weakness. And you say it’s been worsening recently. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, it started… maybe a month or so ago? Just felt a little tired after work, you know? But now… lifting things is hard. Even climbing the stairs. It’s in my arms and legs mostly, but sometimes my back feels it too. It's not painful, exactly, just… doesn’t work right.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it began gradually about a month ago, initially as fatigue after work, and has progressed to difficulty with lifting and climbing stairs. You’re experiencing this in your arms, legs, and occasionally your back. And you'd describe it as weakness rather than pain. To help me understand a bit better, can you rate your weakness on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being hardly noticeable and 10 being completely unable to move the affected muscles?
PATIENT: Hmm… on a good day, maybe a 3 or 4? But after I’ve been doing stuff, it definitely gets worse. Like, by the end of the day, it's probably a 7, easy. Especially my arms. I work with cars all day, so… you can imagine. It’s getting harder to even hold tools sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 3 or 4 on a good day, progressing to a 7 by the end of the day, particularly in your arms due to your work. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been feeling more tired than usual, definitely. And… I’ve had a few headaches, but I get those anyway. Nothing major. Oh, and I've been a little more thirsty lately, I guess. That could just be the weather though, it’s been hot. No fever or anything like that. I haven’t lost any weight, that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue, some headaches which you normally experience, increased thirst, but no fever or weight loss. That’s good to note. Now, thinking about your past health, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid problems, or heart issues?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been pretty healthy, honestly. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious. I haven't been to the doctor in… well, years, I guess. Just for check-ups, nothing major. My family… my dad had high blood pressure, but that was it. Nothing like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior medical diagnoses, and a family history of high blood pressure in your father. And you haven’t had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries either. Never needed any. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. Nothing recent, though.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a thing. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just… nothing. I might take an aspirin for a headache now and then, but that’s it. Honestly, I haven't needed any medication, until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications, just occasional aspirin for headaches. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. No hay fever or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: That's good. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to drink… a beer or two with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a while back. And no… definitely no recreational drugs. Never been my thing. I work long hours, that's enough excitement for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no smoking, no recreational drugs, and you used to drink alcohol occasionally but have stopped. That’s good to know. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Yeah, I'm an insurance appraiser. Auto damage. So I look at wrecked cars, figure out how much they’re worth, and write reports for the insurance companies. It's mostly going to different shops and looking at cars all day. It’s physical, you know? Getting in and out of cars, bending over, looking under hoods… Lots of repetitive motions. It’s not glamorous, but it pays the bills. And it's getting harder to do with this weakness.
DOCTOR: Okay, auto insurance appraiser, which involves a good deal of physical activity and repetitive motions. That helps me understand the context of your symptoms. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, one last question. Are you experiencing any other unusual symptoms such as changes in your bowel habits, bladder control, or vision?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Everything's… normal down there, if you don't mind me saying. And my vision's fine, maybe a little blurry when I'm tired, but that’s just from staring at a computer screen all day. Bladder control is good too. Nothing different there. I just want to figure out what's making me so weak, honestly. It's worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. McKinnon. We will definitely try to figure out what’s going on. Alright, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be happening. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and then do a neurological exam to assess your muscle strength, reflexes, and coordination. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. As long as we can figure this out. Blood pressure, pulse… whatever. Just let me know if anything feels… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me, please. <stage>I begin by checking Mr. McKinnon’s blood pressure. "Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not significantly concerning." I then listen to his heart and lungs with a stethoscope. "Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear." I proceed to check his pulse in both wrists and ankles. "Pulse is regular and strong." Finally, I start the neurological exam, beginning with muscle strength. “Can you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Here you go. I think… I think that's pretty tight. It feels a little weaker than it used to, though. Especially my right hand. I noticed that at work yesterday.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, can you please push against my hands with both feet?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? It's… it's not as strong as it used to be, I'll be honest. My left leg feels a little weaker too.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This is perfectly normal. I'll gently tap on your knees with this small hammer. Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Everything seems generally normal, but the slight weakness you are experiencing in your arms and legs is something we need to investigate further. Based on your symptoms and the initial physical exam, I'd like to order some blood tests to check for several things, including your electrolyte levels, kidney function, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. I also want to rule out any signs of inflammation or infection. Finally, I'll order a complete blood count to check for anemia. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests, sure. I just want to know what’s wrong. I guess… it’s probably nothing serious, right? Just something I’m lacking, maybe? But it’s scary feeling so weak. Just… let me know as soon as you have the results.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. McKinnon. While it's good to consider all possibilities, it's too early to say definitively whether it's something minor or more serious. That's why the blood tests are important - they’ll give us a clearer picture of what's going on. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours. I will call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the results and next steps at that time. In the meantime, please try to avoid any strenuous activity that might exacerbate your weakness. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I guess. Just… call me when you have the results. And thank you, Doctor. For listening. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I'm glad I could listen. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and take care. .
