DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day, so let's get on with it. I woke up this morning and… well, I can't hear out of one ear. And my face… it feels droopy on that same side. It's quite alarming, really. I haven't felt this helpless since… never mind. Just fix it, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I assure you we’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are definitely concerning symptoms, and we need to assess them promptly. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me when exactly you first noticed these symptoms this morning?
PATIENT: This morning. When I woke up. I already told you that. Before 7am, definitely. I always wake up early. It wasn’t gradual or anything, just… poof. No hearing, funny feeling on my face. I don't know what more you need to know. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, I apologize, Ms. Nissenbaum. I simply wanted to confirm the timing. It’s important to establish a clear timeline. And I understand your time is valuable; we’ll work as efficiently as possible. To clarify, when you say “funny feeling” on your face, can you describe that sensation?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. It’s… hard to explain. Like everything is pulling down on one side. My mouth feels… weak, I guess. And when I try to smile, it doesn’t quite work right. It’s just… off. Look, is it something serious? Because I don’t have time for a long illness. I don’t even have insurance, you know. This is going to be expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the potential seriousness and the financial implications, Ms. Nissenbaum. Those are valid worries. Facial weakness is something we need to investigate thoroughly, and quickly. To get a better understanding, let me ask a few more questions, then I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Has this ever happened to you before?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. Never. And don’t tell me it could be stress. I’ve handled worse than this, believe me. I’m a radiologist, I see terrible things every day. This is… new. And unsettling. Just get to the examining, please. The sooner you tell me what it is, the better. I don't have patience for guessing games.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. We’ll proceed with the exam right away. Please have a seat here. I’m going to check your facial movements, assess your hearing, and do a quick neurological assessment. First, could you close your eyes tightly for me, then open them?
PATIENT: There. Happy? What are you looking for, exactly? I always thought doctors told patients what they were doing, not the other way around. It’s my face you’re poking at, after all.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Nissenbaum. You are absolutely right; I should explain what I’m doing as I go. I am assessing your facial strength by looking for any weakness or asymmetry in your movements. Now, could you try to smile as broadly as you can?
PATIENT: There. You see? It’s drooping. I already told you. Are you going to need to poke at the other side now? Honestly, this is rather undignified. I deal with sophisticated imaging equipment all day. This feels… primitive.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see the asymmetry, Ms. Nissenbaum. And I understand your frustration. Now, if you'll allow me, I'd like to check your ability to raise your eyebrows, close your eyes tightly, and puff out your cheeks. This will help me further evaluate the facial nerve function. Could you try raising both eyebrows as high as you can?
PATIENT: It’s… harder on this side. Obviously. Are you going to diagnose me already? It feels like you're just… observing the obvious. I'm a radiologist, I notice things. This isn't exactly a subtle problem. Just tell me what it is, and how much it's going to cost. And if it requires a lot of appointments, forget it. I don't have the time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I appreciate your patience. It’s true, some of these findings are quite clear. However, it’s important for me to perform a thorough assessment to rule out other potential causes and determine the most appropriate course of action. Now, if you could stick out your tongue.
PATIENT: There. Happy? It goes a little to the left, I suppose. Is this a stroke? My mother… she had a stroke. Is that what this is? Don’t tell me it’s going to be a long recovery. I have a practice to run, people relying on me. I can’t just… lie in a hospital bed. This is dreadful. Tell me it’s not a stroke.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about a stroke, Ms. Nissenbaum, and it’s right to consider that possibility given your symptoms and your mother’s history. However, there are other potential causes for your facial weakness and hearing loss that we need to investigate. Based on what I’ve observed so far – the sudden onset of symptoms, the facial weakness affecting several muscle groups, and the hearing loss – a stroke is possible, but we need to rule out other causes, such as Bell’s Palsy. To do that, I would like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to check your reflexes and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Do whatever you have to do. Just… hurry up. My time is valuable. But I’m telling you, if it’s going to be months of physical therapy and endless appointments, I'm not interested. I have patients waiting for reports. People’s lives depend on me, you understand? Not on endless tests and poking and prodding. Just… get on with it. And try not to take too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Nissenbaum. I assure you, we’ll work efficiently to get to the bottom of this. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then proceed with the neurological exam. If you could please lie back on the examination table, that would be very helpful. I'm going to listen to your heart now.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Honestly, the things I put up with. I see incredibly complex imaging all day, analyze minute details, make life-or-death decisions… and now I'm lying here having someone listen to my heartbeat. It's…degrading. Is everything normal? You can just tell, can't you? You're the doctor.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and I'm not hearing anything unusual at this point. Your lungs are clear as well. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Could you please bend your knees and let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you have to. Honestly, I have more important things to worry about. This whole thing is just… inconvenient. Are you going to hit my knees with that little hammer thing? I always hated that part of the checkup. It’s so… undignified. Just get it over with. And please be quick. I have reports to sign. People are waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am checking your reflexes now. I'm not seeing a full response on the left side. And I'd like to check your coordination. Could you please touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: There. See? I'm not completely useless. It's just… a little off. Honestly, I'm a radiologist. Precision is my life. I catch things other people miss. This is probably just a minor nerve issue. Something easily fixable. You’re not going to send me for a brain scan, are you? Because I absolutely do not have time for that. It's a waste of my time, and expensive. Just tell me what it is, and what I need to do. A pill, perhaps? Something simple?
DOCTOR: Based on my examination, your symptoms – the sudden onset of facial weakness, the hearing loss, the asymmetry of your facial movements, and the slightly diminished reflex and coordination on your left side – are concerning. While it could be a minor nerve issue, these findings are also suggestive of a more serious condition, such as a stroke or Bell’s Palsy. To determine the exact cause, and to rule out a stroke, I recommend a brain scan – an MRI would be ideal, but a CT scan is also an option. It’s the most appropriate next step. I understand your concerns about time and expense, but it’s crucial to get an accurate diagnosis so we can start the appropriate treatment as soon as possible. Delaying diagnosis could potentially lead to more significant complications. Would you like me to go ahead and order the scan?
PATIENT: A brain scan?! Absolutely not! Are you serious? I’m a radiologist, I interpret brain scans every day. I know what they look for! I can tell you right now it’s nothing serious. It’s probably just a pinched nerve. All this fuss, all this time… it’s ridiculous. I’m not paying for a brain scan. And I’m certainly not spending hours lying in a machine. Forget it. I’m leaving. I’ll see another doctor. A doctor who understands I have a practice to run, and people relying on me. This is a complete waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your frustration, and I respect your decision. However, I strongly advise against dismissing these symptoms without further investigation. As your physician, my primary concern is your well-being. While you are an expert in interpreting scans, a diagnosis requires a clinical assessment and appropriate imaging to rule out potentially serious conditions. I’m concerned that delaying diagnosis could have negative consequences. I’m happy to provide you with a list of other physicians in the area. And if you do change your mind about the scan, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic.
