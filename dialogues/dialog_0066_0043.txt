DOCTOR: Hi Percell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, kinda feels like a tight band. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, let me think… about a week now, maybe a little longer. Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about a week, coming and going, and it feels like a tight band around the back of your head. That gives me a starting point. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts in the afternoon, after I’ve been workin’ with numbers all day. I’m a financial advisor, you see. Lots of spreadsheets and such. Doesn’t really hurt bad, just… uncomfortable. Like somethin’s pullin’ tight. Sometimes it goes all the way around to my forehead, but mostly back. And I don’t think light bothers it, or loud noises, not really. I haven’t taken anything for it yet, just tryin’ to push through.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's related to your work, seems to start in the afternoon after a lot of focused work with numbers. Not a severe pain, more of a tight, uncomfortable feeling, and it doesn't seem to be made worse by light or noise. You haven’t taken anything for it yet. Have you noticed anything else happening with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. No nausea, no dizziness. My vision's been fine, I think. Oh! Now that you mention it, sometimes my neck feels a little stiff when it's happenin’. Not always, but often enough to notice. I usually just rub it, and it feels a little better for a bit. I didn’t think much of it, though, just figured I was hunchin’ over my computer too long. You know, gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: Right, getting old! I understand that feeling. So, no nausea or dizziness, vision is good, and you've noticed some neck stiffness sometimes when the headache is present. That's helpful. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Well… not that I’ve noticed. I sleep alright, eat okay. I've been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But honestly, I’m 84 years old, so… It’s hard to say what’s just old age and what’s somethin’ else. My appetite hasn’t changed, and no fever or chills, nothin’ like that. I just figured it was a little stress, you know? This market’s been kinda wild lately, makes a man worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little more tired than usual, but otherwise sleep and appetite are normal, no fever or chills. You suspect it might be stress related to the market. That's good information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but they got it under control with medicine years ago. Stopped takin’ it after a while, doctor said it was okay, blood pressure’s been good ever since. And I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… not much, really. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years. Just the usual check-ups, nothin’ serious. Oh! And I broke my wrist a few years back, fallin' in the garden. But that healed up fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, so history of controlled high blood pressure, gallbladder removal years ago, and a wrist fracture that healed well. That’s helpful. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not currently. Like I said, I stopped takin’ the blood pressure medicine a long time ago. I don’t take any vitamins or nothin’ either. Just try to eat right, get a little exercise when I can. Though lately, this headache’s been makin’ it harder to get motivated.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, and I haven't had any problems with medicines in the past. My wife used to be allergic to bee stings, but… well, that was a long time ago. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little about your family. Is there a history of headaches or migraines in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother used to get headaches sometimes, but I don't think they were ever bad. More like tension headaches, you know? My sister, she had migraines when she was younger, real bad ones. Kept her in bed for days. But other than that… not really. I don't remember any other family members sufferin' from them. It was a big family, hard to keep track of everything. But I don't recall anyone havin' headaches like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother had tension headaches, sister had migraines, but no one else with similar headaches that you recall. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink in… oh, must be fifty years. Used to have a beer with dinner sometimes when I was younger, but I didn't care for it much. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested in any of that. Just a simple man, Doctor. Simple pleasures. Mostly just enjoyin' my garden and keepin' up with the grandkids.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. That's good to know. Alright, Percell, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to feel your neck and check your range of motion. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. I haven’t had a physical in a while, so I’m probably a little rusty.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me... 130 over 80. That's a little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take nice, deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Now, let's feel your neck. There’s some tenderness on the back of your neck, and I can feel some muscle tension. Can you turn your head from side to side for me?
PATIENT: Okay. There we go… a little stiff, you know? It doesn’t hurt bad, but I can feel it. It’s tighter on this side. That’s where I usually feel it the most, when the headache’s comin’ on.
DOCTOR: Okay, I can feel the stiffness and limited range of motion on the right side of your neck. It seems like there's some muscle guarding there. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength and sensation are good. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you're likely experiencing tension headaches, potentially related to muscle strain in your neck and shoulders, exacerbated by your work and stress. The elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to keep an eye on, but it doesn’t necessarily explain the headaches. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that makes a lot of sense. Tension headaches… muscle strain… that sounds about right. I do spend a lot of time hunched over my computer, and the market’s been stressin’ me out somethin’ fierce. So, what do you recommend, Doctor? What can I do to get rid of this headache? And maybe keep it from comin’ back?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Here’s what I recommend. First, let's try to address the muscle tension. I'm going to suggest over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen, following the package instructions. Those can help reduce inflammation and pain. You can also try applying a warm compress or ice pack to your neck and shoulders for 15-20 minutes at a time. Beyond that, let’s focus on preventative measures. Try to take frequent breaks from your computer – get up and walk around, stretch your neck and shoulders every 30-60 minutes. Make sure your workstation is ergonomically set up – your chair, monitor height, and keyboard position should all be comfortable. And most importantly, try to manage your stress levels. Things like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or spending time on hobbies you enjoy can be very helpful. We should also keep an eye on your blood pressure. I recommend checking it at home once or twice a week. I can give you a list of resources for accurate home blood pressure monitoring. Would you like me to write down these instructions for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor, that would be wonderful. Writin’ it down would be a big help, my memory ain’t what it used to be. Especially when I’m feelin’ stressed! Ibuprofen… stretchin’… workstation… stress management… checkin’ blood pressure… And thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind a little more at ease already. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen and explain things so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. Here you are. This includes everything we discussed: medication, stretching, workstation setup, stress management techniques, and home blood pressure monitoring. I also want you to keep a headache diary for the next two weeks. Note when the headaches occur, how severe they are , what you were doing when they started, and if anything relieves them. This will help us track your progress and see if the treatment is working. If the headaches don’t improve after two weeks, or if they get worse, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness – please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: That’s wonderful, thank you again, Doctor. A headache diary… good idea, I’ll do that. Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything pretty thoroughly. I appreciate you explainin’ things so well, and for writin’ it down. It’s nice to have somethin’ to refer to. Well, I guess that’s all. Thank you very much for your time and help, Doctor Condray. I really do appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
