DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, for the past few days, I’ve been… coughing up some blood. It scared me a little, so I thought it was best to come get it checked. It’s not much blood, but it’s… there.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood, you say. Hmm. And how much blood would you estimate, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: It's hard to say, Doctor. Maybe… a teaspoon? Sometimes less. It’s usually with the mucus when I cough, not… a lot just by itself. It's bright red, if that helps. I don’t know if that is helpful. I am sorry. I don't know much about these things.
DOCTOR: Bright red, you say. That does offer some information, though I find patients often misjudge these things. And when did this begin?
PATIENT: It started… about three days ago, Doctor. I thought it was just a bad cough at first. I had a little cold, you know? But then I noticed the blood with it. I tried to ignore it, hoping it would go away, but it hasn't. It is still happening.
DOCTOR: And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this cough, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have been a little tired, maybe? But I am always a little tired. I do not think that is new. And… perhaps a little short of breath, but only when I climb the stairs. My apartment is on the third floor… so that happens sometimes. No fever, no chills, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any pain associated with the cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. It doesn’t hurt to cough. It’s just… uncomfortable, you know? Like a regular cough, but with the blood. A little bit worrying, that’s all. My chest doesn’t ache or anything. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Weichers, that is… adequate. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – asthma, bronchitis, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, I think. My husband… he was the one with problems. I took care of him for many years. I don't have any long-term sicknesses, no. Just… the usual colds from time to time. I had the flu once, a long time ago. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, I don’t think so. Not that I remember. I had my appendix out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. That’s… all. Nothing else. I'm quite sure.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a little difficult, Doctor. My parents passed away a long time ago. My mother… she died of something with her heart, I think. And my father… he had some kind of sickness with his lungs, but I was very young. I don't really remember the details. My husband’s family… I didn’t know them very well. I don't have a lot of information, I'm sorry. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you smoke, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My husband smoked, for many years, but I always told him it was a bad habit. I never started myself. I always thought it was very unhealthy. He stopped, eventually. After he got sick.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. I don’t really take anything. Just… vitamins sometimes, but nothing regular. I try to eat healthy, you know? That's why I'm surprised this is happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. Please, lie back on the examination table. I'll listen to your lungs and check your vital signs.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… alright. Let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Weichers… and exhale. Again… deeper this time. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. And finally, I'll just feel your lymph nodes. Your lungs sound… relatively clear, though I do detect some mild wheezing in the lower lobes. Your heart rate is normal. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Blood pressure is 128/82, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. I'll need to order a chest x-ray to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues.
PATIENT: A chest x-ray? Is that… serious, Doctor? What are you looking for? I’m a little frightened, I must admit. Is it something bad? The wheezing… is that why I’m coughing up blood?
DOCTOR: Ms. Weichers, it is far too early to be alarmed. A chest x-ray is a standard diagnostic procedure. It will allow us to visualize your lungs and identify any potential abnormalities – pneumonia, bronchitis, or other issues that may be causing your symptoms. The mild wheezing could be contributing to the hemoptysis – that is, the coughing up of blood – but we need to investigate further to determine the exact cause. It is important to remember that hemoptysis can be caused by a variety of factors, some more serious than others. We are simply being thorough. Do not jump to conclusions.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. You are right, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. When… when will I have the x-ray? And… will it hurt? I don't like being around machines… it reminds me of the hospital with my husband.
DOCTOR: The x-ray can be performed immediately at the imaging center across the hall. It is a very quick procedure – you will simply stand or lie down while the technician takes a few images. It is completely painless, Ms. Weichers. There is no discomfort involved. As for your… associations, I assure you, this is a routine diagnostic test, vastly different from the experiences you had with your husband in the hospital. It is merely a precaution. We will have the results within the hour, and then we can discuss the next steps.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. If you say it’s quick and painless… I suppose I can manage. Will I need someone to take me? Or can I go by myself? I don’t want to bother anyone if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: You may go alone, Ms. Weichers. It is a straightforward procedure, and you will not require assistance. The technician will guide you through the process. However, if you prefer to have someone accompany you, that is, of course, your prerogative. But it is hardly necessary. Now, I will write you a requisition for the x-ray. Please proceed to the imaging center immediately after you leave here. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you for explaining everything. I appreciate your patience. I will go to the imaging center right away. I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Weichers. Please, do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. We will review the results as soon as they are available. .
