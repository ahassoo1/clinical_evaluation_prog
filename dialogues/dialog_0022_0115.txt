DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about my coloring, I suppose. My skin… and eyes… they’ve gotten rather yellow. A friend mentioned something about… the liver? I do have some trouble with that organ, or so I’ve been told. It’s all rather fuzzy, you see. I apologize if I’m not being very clear.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. It’s perfectly alright to be unsure, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Yellowing of the skin and eyes – that's called jaundice – can definitely be related to liver issues, but there are other possibilities as well. Let’s start by getting a little more information. You mentioned some trouble with your liver in the past. Do you happen to know what specifically was diagnosed, or when that was?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a difficult question. It was… some years ago now. I believe it was… hepatitis? Something like that. Or perhaps it was just general inflammation. I really can't recall the details, Doctor. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in… well, a very long time. I simply don't have the funds for such things, you understand. I was told it wasn’t anything too serious at the time, but… well, here we are. Is it important what kind of hepatitis?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Annelle, and it's perfectly fine that you don't remember all the details. It is important to try and figure out what kind of hepatitis it was, if possible, as that can affect things. There are several different types – A, B, C, and others – and they’re treated differently. Let me see if I can find anything in your past records here… Hmm, it seems there’s limited information. It does mention a diagnosis of “acute hepatitis” from about fifteen years ago, but there’s no specific type noted, unfortunately. Aside from the jaundice, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… disappointing. Limited information is rather typical, I’m afraid. As for other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been feeling… rather tired lately. More so than usual, I suppose. And my appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I eat very little. And… …my stomach… it feels a bit uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just… bloated and heavy. Oh, and I've noticed my urine is… a darker color than normal, like tea. Is that important? I apologize for being such a bother.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Annelle. These details are all very helpful. Fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort, and dark urine – those are all things that can be associated with liver problems, and they're important to note. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement of your liver or spleen. It won’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. I understand you need to check things. Please, do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. It’s… it’s a relief to finally be discussing this with someone. Just… be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Annelle. I will be as gentle as possible. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay, I’m just going to press gently here… and here… Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. A little, there. Not sharp pain, exactly… more of a… dull ache. And… …it feels… a bit swollen, perhaps? I’m not entirely sure. It’s difficult to tell. I haven't been paying very close attention to my body lately, I’m afraid. Everything feels… rather sluggish. Is that concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I do feel some tenderness in your right upper quadrant, Annelle, and it does seem a bit firm. That area is where your liver is located. I also note some mild discomfort in the left upper quadrant. I’m listening to your abdomen now. The bowel sounds are present, but a bit diminished. Okay, Annelle. Based on the physical exam, we have tenderness and mild enlargement in your right upper quadrant, diminished bowel sounds, and you’ve mentioned jaundice, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark urine, and abdominal bloating. Given your history and the findings on the exam, it’s important to investigate this further. We need to get some blood work done to assess your liver function and rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work… of course. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I just… I want to know what’s going on. I don't want this to be… serious. Can you tell me… is it possible this is something… curable? Or is this… something I have to learn to live with? I apologize for asking such blunt questions. It's just… I'm a bit frightened.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be frightened, Annelle, and you're not at all blunt for asking those questions. It’s important to be honest about your concerns. Whether something is “curable” or something you “learn to live with” depends entirely on the cause. Many liver conditions are treatable, and even curable, especially if caught early. Hepatitis A, for example, usually resolves on its own. Hepatitis C is often curable with medication. But other conditions may require ongoing management. The blood work will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. We'll be looking at liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and checking for any signs of infection. We'll also do a complete blood count. Here’s the requisition. You can get these tests done at the lab down the hall. They should be able to take care of you right away. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any questions about getting the blood work done?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… a couple of vials of blood, I presume? I haven't had blood work in… decades, I suppose. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Should I fast beforehand? Or avoid any… medications? I don’t take much, thankfully, but I do have a small pain reliever I use occasionally for my arthritis. And… how long will it be before I hear back? Two days, you said? I’m… I’m rather anxious about waiting, Doctor. I’m afraid of what it might show.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a couple of vials of blood. And you’re right to ask about preparation. For the most accurate results, it's best to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks other than water. As for your pain reliever, it's best to avoid taking it for 24 hours before the test, if possible. It can sometimes affect the results. I'll make a note of that on here. And don’t worry about the wait. Two days is typical, but the lab will prioritize it, knowing your concerns. The results should be available in our system by then, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. I understand your anxiety, Annelle. It’s perfectly natural to be worried. But remember, we're taking the right steps to find out what's going on and get you the best possible care. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very… patient with me, Doctor. I apologize for being such a… a mess. Thank you. Truly. I suppose… I’ll go and get this done. Will you… be the one to tell me the results? Or will it be… someone else? I prefer to hear it from you, if possible. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. I will be the one to discuss the results with you personally. I want to be there to answer all your questions and explain everything thoroughly. Please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. And try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together. Have a good day, Annelle. And I’ll see you soon.
