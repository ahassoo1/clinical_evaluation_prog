DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I received a letter... about needing certain shots before a family member can come visit from overseas. My granddaughter, she's trying to get a visa, and they said I need to come talk to a doctor about what's required. I'm not quite sure what all that involves, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, vaccinations for visa purposes. Yes, I see. It can be a bit confusing. Let's clarify what's needed. To start, do you know which vaccinations the letter specifically mentioned?
PATIENT: I… I believe it just said “required vaccinations.” It was a fairly official-looking paper, lots of legal words, and I mostly just skimmed it for the part about needing to see a doctor. I apologize for not being more helpful. I’m not very good with paperwork, and even worse at remembering what it said after I put it down.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mr. Skarbek. That's perfectly alright. Official paperwork can be…dense. And memory isn't always reliable. We'll figure it out. To determine the necessary vaccinations, we need to consider your medical history and where your granddaughter will be traveling from. Do you happen to know the country she's coming from?
PATIENT: She’s coming from… Ukraine. Yes, that’s right. It’s a bit complicated, her mother and she have been there visiting family since before… well, you probably know. A lot has happened. She's trying to come back now, finally. I just want to make sure everything is done correctly, so there aren’t any problems.
DOCTOR: Ukraine… right. Yes, given the current situation, there are certain vaccinations we should definitely consider. Let’s start with some basics. Have you had a tetanus shot within the last ten years?
PATIENT: A tetanus shot… Hmm. Let me think. I get a lot of boosters, you see, being my age. I go to the clinic regularly. I… I honestly can’t recall the exact dates. I think so, but I couldn’t swear to it. I’ve always kept up with what the doctor recommended, but remembering when is… difficult. Is there a record somewhere, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Let me take a look… Ah, yes. It looks like you received a Tdap booster – that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – in March of 2023. That’s good; you're up to date on that one. Now, have you ever received a measles, mumps, and rubella – MMR – vaccine?
PATIENT: MMR… Now that one… I think so. When I was a boy, we had all sorts of shots at school. But it was a long time ago, Doctor. I really don’t recall. My mother kept a little book, I think, but that was lost a long time ago when she… well, never mind. I suppose it’s possible I didn’t get it. Is that something that’s easily checked?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Skarbek. We can check your antibody levels with a blood test to see if you have immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella. It’s not a perfect test, but it will give us a good indication. Before we order that, let’s talk about other vaccinations. Have you ever received the hepatitis B vaccine?
PATIENT: Hepatitis B… Now that name sounds familiar. I believe the doctor mentioned it once, a long time ago, when I was traveling for a library conference. But I don’t think I ever actually got it. I was very busy then, and… well, I probably just forgot to schedule it. It's a habit of mine, I'm afraid. A lot of things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's helpful to know. We should definitely get you vaccinated against hepatitis B then. Given your age and travel history, it's a good precaution. Now, have you ever received a varicella vaccine, which is for chickenpox?
PATIENT: Chickenpox… Oh, yes! I definitely had chickenpox as a boy. A terrible rash, it was! I remember being very sick and having to stay in bed for weeks. It was before they had a vaccine, of course. I wouldn’t have gotten it if they did. Does that mean I don’t need a shot for that one?
DOCTOR: That's right, Mr. Skarbek. If you had chickenpox, you don’t need the vaccine. That’s one less thing to worry about. Now, let’s move on to influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Do you get an annual flu shot?
PATIENT: I do! Every year, without fail. Old habits, you see. The clinic sends out a reminder, and I go right away. It's important to stay healthy, especially at my age. And I’ve had the pneumonia shot, too. I think I got it a few years ago, maybe two or three years back. They recommended it at the clinic. I can’t remember the exact date, though. Is there a way to look that up, too? I hate bothering you with all my forgetfulness.
DOCTOR: No bother at all, Mr. Skarbek. That’s what I’m here for. Let me see… Ah, yes. You received a pneumococcal vaccine – Pneumovax 23 – in October of 2022. So you are up to date on that as well. That’s excellent. Just one more routine vaccine to check. Have you ever received the shingles vaccine?
PATIENT: Shingles… Oh dear. That one scares me. I've heard terrible stories about shingles. I think the doctor mentioned it a while back, but I don't believe I ever got it. Honestly, I've been putting it off. It sounded… unpleasant. Is it necessary? Is it required for the visa? I'm not sure I want to deal with that if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: It’s not required for the visa, Mr. Skarbek. However, the shingles vaccine is highly recommended, especially as we get older. The risk of shingles increases with age, and it can cause significant pain and complications. It's a two-dose series, and it’s a very effective vaccine. We can certainly discuss the risks and benefits further. Before we decide on the shingles vaccine, let’s summarize everything we’ve discussed so far. You are up to date on tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. You've never had the shingles vaccine. Does that sound correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. Shingles... that's the one I haven't gotten. And honestly, Doctor, I’m a little hesitant. I've heard it can have… side effects. And I don't want to be laid up if I'm expecting my granddaughter to visit. I suppose I could think about it, but I'm not sure I want to get it right now. Is it absolutely necessary for her visa? Perhaps if it was, I'd feel differently. Otherwise, I’m not sure I’m comfortable with it at this time. What do you recommend? I value your opinion.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Skarbek. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about potential side effects. And as I mentioned, it's not strictly required for the visa. The letter simply asks for proof of recommended vaccinations, and your vaccination history is already quite comprehensive. Given your concerns and the fact that it isn’t a mandatory requirement, I think it’s perfectly acceptable to postpone the shingles vaccine for now. We can always revisit it at a later date if you change your mind. So, to move forward with the visa process, I recommend we document your existing vaccinations and provide you with a letter stating you are up to date on tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, and influenza. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. That is exactly what I was hoping for. A letter stating I'm up to date on everything I have had. That should be enough for the visa, I believe. Thank you for being so understanding and patient with my forgetfulness. You've put my mind at ease. Is there anything else I need to do? Any forms I need to fill out? I want to make sure I do everything correctly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have my nurse prepare a summary of your vaccination history and a letter for the visa application. It should be ready within a few minutes. She will also give you a copy for your records. There are no additional forms you need to fill out at this time. Before you leave, do you have any other medical concerns you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's all. I just wanted to get this visa matter sorted out. My granddaughter is very important to me, and I want everything to go smoothly for her visit. Thank you again for your time and kindness. You've been a great help. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’m glad we could get this taken care of. My nurse will be with you shortly. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a wonderful day, and I hope you have a lovely visit with your granddaughter!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a wonderful day as well. Goodbye.
