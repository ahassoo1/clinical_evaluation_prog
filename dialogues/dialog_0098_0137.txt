DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. AbdoLLAHI. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay, I am Lindra. My husband, he say I need… check for the old people place? He want me to live there, soon. He think it is good for me. I not so sure.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lindra. Your husband is concerned and wants to make sure you have the support you need. He's suggesting a move to a… assisted living facility, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That is right. Assisted… like help with things. He say I forget some things now, and he worry. But I am okay! I just… sometimes things not come so fast in my head, you know? Like names. And where I put my glasses. But I remember important things. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Lindra. It’s very common for memory to change as we get older. And it sounds like you're still very aware of things, which is excellent. We can certainly explore this a little further. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about when you started noticing these little memory slips?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? Is hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months, maybe? Before that, I think I was okay. But then… things started to… hide. Not hide on purpose, you know? Just… not where I left them. My husband, he is very patient, but he worry a lot. He say I leave the stove on sometimes. I do not think I do, but… maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago is helpful. And it sounds like your husband has noticed some things as well, like potentially leaving the stove on. That's good he's paying attention. We want to rule out anything serious, of course. Besides the memory issues and what your husband has mentioned, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… I get tired more easy now. Before, I could work all night at the bar, no problem. Now, after few hours, I need sit down. And my feet… they hurt. Always hurt now. But everyone says old people feet hurt, yes? Is normal?
DOCTOR: It is common for feet to hurt as we get older, Lindra, but it’s good you mention it. Fatigue can be caused by many things, and it's important to figure out what's going on. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical? I have… the pressure. The doctor, many years ago, he say is pressure. High pressure. I take the pills for that, every day. Small white pills. And my knee. I fall down, long time ago, and my knee always bother me. But not so bad now. Mostly just when is cold. I not see doctor for knee in many years.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension, high blood pressure, and some old knee pain. And you’re currently taking medication for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Every morning. Small white pill. I think is one pill. Maybe two. My husband, he give me the pills. I not always remember what is for, but he say is important. He is very good man.
DOCTOR: It sounds like your husband is very helpful. We’ll get a list of all your medications later just to be sure. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been in the hospital for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. When I was young, I have… tonsils out. Very long time ago. And… when I have baby, I have surgery then. C-section, they call it. That is two surgeries, I think. I not been in hospital for many years. Maybe when I break my wrist, long time ago? But that is small thing. Just a cast.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy, C-section, and a wrist fracture. Thank you. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mama, she have… the sugar. Diabetes, they call it. She sick long time with that. And my papa, he have… the heart. Is sick heart. He not live very long. My sister, she is healthy. Mostly. She have bad back, but that is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes and heart disease in the family. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'm going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Oh! I used to drink, yes. At the bar, I drink a little. But now, I not drink so much. Maybe one glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. And no… no smoking. Never smoke. Bad for you, you know? And no… other things. Just the wine, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, just occasional wine. Now, before we do a physical exam, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies? I not think so. Maybe… bees? I not like bees. I get little bumps if bee near me. But not so bad. I not need the shot, or nothing. Just not like them. And no… food allergies. I eat everything. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible bee sting sensitivity. Now, Lindra, would you mind if I listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a brief neurological exam?
PATIENT: No, no. Is okay. You do what you need. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please? My old bones, they not so strong.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lindra. I’ll be very gentle. Just relax and breathe normally. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 85. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit faint. Lungs are clear. Now I'm going to check your pulse… Pulse is 78, a little weak. Reflexes are a little diminished, and balance is slightly unsteady, but within normal limits for her age. Now, could you tell me the current year, just to check your memory?
PATIENT: Current year…? Oh dear. Let me think… Is… 2024? No, no. Is… 2025! Yes, 2025. I think. My husband, he always tell me the year. Is hard to remember.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lindra. It’s perfectly normal to have a little trouble remembering things sometimes. Knowing the current year can be tricky. Now, I would like to order some blood tests just to get a better understanding of what's going on. We'll check your blood sugar, kidney function, thyroid levels, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests…? Is okay. If you think is good. My husband, he always say is good to know what is inside. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust you. Just… do they hurt? I do not like needles.
DOCTOR: They do involve a small needle, Lindra, but it’s usually a quick pinch, and then it’s over. The phlebotomist is very good at making it as comfortable as possible. And while we're waiting for the results, I think it would be a good idea to schedule an appointment with a specialist, a neurologist, to evaluate your memory and balance more thoroughly. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A… neurologist? Is that… a brain doctor? My brain is okay, I think. Is just… forgetful sometimes. Is the age, yes? I not want see a brain doctor. Is that bad? Is something wrong with my brain?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Lindra. A neurologist is a specialist who helps diagnose and treat conditions that affect the brain and nervous system. Seeing one doesn’t mean there's something seriously wrong with your brain. It's just a precaution to rule out any underlying causes for your memory and balance concerns, and to get a more detailed assessment. We're just trying to be thorough. It’s better to know what’s going on so we can provide you with the best possible care. We can discuss this with your husband as well. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you, or would you prefer to think about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… think about it. Yes. I want talk to my husband first. He always know what to do. He worry so much about me. Maybe… he want me see the brain doctor. If he say is good, then I will go. But not now. I need little rest after all this. And maybe a cup of tea?
DOCTOR: Of course, Lindra. That sounds like a very good plan. We’ll hold off on scheduling anything for now. And I’ll ask the nurse to bring you a cup of tea. We'll get the results of your blood tests back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think is all. Thank you for being so patient with me. And… thank you for the tea. I feel… better now. Just a little tired. I think I will go home and rest.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindra. I'm glad I could help. Please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Let me have the nurse assist you with getting settled, and make sure you have a comfortable ride home. Have a good day, and please get some rest.
