DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. IUZZOLINO. It's… nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It's alright, I suppose. Honestly, it's a bit silly, really. I just… well, my daughter said I should come get a little note from the doctor. A “get well” card, she called it. For… encouragement. I haven't actually got anything, you see. Just feeling a bit low, I guess. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Right, a note for encouragement. That's perfectly alright. It’s good of your daughter to be so attentive. Feeling “low” can mean a lot of things, though. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just… everything, really. My grandson started school, and it’s all new for him. And my husband, bless his heart, he’s… well, he's not as helpful around the house as he used to be. And the garden isn’t doing so well this year. It's just a lot. It’s not like I’m sick sick, you understand. Just… worn out. Honestly, I don't know why I'm bothering you with this. It’s a waste of your time, probably.
DOCTOR: It’s not a waste of my time at all, Janeth. It’s important to address how you’re feeling, even if it’s not a specific illness. It sounds like you’re juggling quite a bit – changes with your grandson, things at home with your husband, and even the garden. That can definitely take a toll. Could you tell me a little more about how long you’ve been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, probably… a few months now, at least. It comes and goes, you know? Some days I feel alright, I can manage. Other days… I just want to sit. And everything feels… heavy. Like I’m wading through mud. My daughter keeps saying it’s stress, but what isn’t stressful these days? And I don't go around complaining to everyone, you know. It's just… this year seems harder than most. And the garden… well, I’ve always been proud of my garden. It feels silly to worry about tomatoes when there’s so much else going on, but… it's important to me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you find a lot of meaning in your garden, and it’s perfectly valid to feel upset about that. And it's good you're able to identify when you're feeling better and worse, that's helpful. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… well, I haven’t been sleeping as well. Not really bad sleep, just… restless. I wake up a lot during the night, thinking. And… I suppose I haven't been eating as much either. Not on purpose, you understand. I just don’t really feel hungry. My husband tries to get me to eat, bless him, but… it just doesn’t appeal. And I used to enjoy my tea, but even that doesn’t taste the same. It’s probably just a phase. Honestly, I'm making a fuss about nothing.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound like you’re making a fuss about nothing at all, Janeth. Changes in sleep and appetite, along with feeling restless and a loss of enjoyment in things you usually like… those can be signs of something going on. It's good you're sharing this with me. Now, have you experienced any physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Like… being sick? No, not really. No aches, no pains. Just… tired. Very, very tired. Sometimes I get a little… fluttery feeling in my chest, but only when I think about everything I have to do. My daughter says it's anxiety. She always has a name for everything. Honestly, I think I just need a good rest. And maybe for my grandson to adjust to school. It’s probably all just that. I don’t want to bother you with all this, really. You have other patients, important patients, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: You are a very important patient, Janeth. And it's good you’re able to describe that fluttery feeling in your chest – that’s helpful information. It's good your daughter is attentive too. Now, to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Actually, I have. I think… I think I’ve lost a little weight. Not much, you understand. Just a few pounds. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. I don’t really like weighing myself, honestly. It just upsets me. My daughter says I should watch it, but… she worries too much, as always. Honestly, I'm just a bit… out of sorts. It's probably nothing serious. Just old age creeping up on me, I suppose. It happens to everyone.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “old age,” Janeth. Losing weight along with the other symptoms you’ve described does warrant further investigation. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing a number of changes over the past few months, and it's important to rule out any underlying medical causes. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… well, years ago, when I was still living in Nepal, I had a bit of a problem with my gallbladder. They removed it, eventually. And I used to get terrible headaches, but those went away after I moved here. And… honestly, that's about it. I've always been quite healthy, you see. Very strong constitution. My mother always said so. I don't take any regular medications, and I haven't been hospitalized for anything in… well, decades, really. Honestly, I don’t understand why you're asking all these questions. It's probably just a phase. I keep telling you.
DOCTOR: It's good to know you have a strong constitution, Janeth. And it's important for me to know your medical history, even if you’ve been generally healthy. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and previous headaches is helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Never had an allergic reaction to anything in my life. Not even mosquito bites. My daughter tried to get me to take an allergy pill once, just to be safe, but I refused. I don’t like taking pills, you see. They make me feel… sluggish. And honestly, I don’t believe in all that fuss. A little bit of discomfort never hurt anyone. Honestly, I think I just need to rest. And for my grandson to settle into school. It’s probably all that. You’re making such a big deal about nothing. I keep telling you. Perhaps I should just go home.
DOCTOR: Janeth, I understand your reluctance, and I apologize if I'm making a big deal about things. It's not about making a big deal; it's about being thorough and making sure we rule out anything serious. The symptoms you've described, while they might seem minor, can sometimes indicate an underlying condition that needs to be addressed. Now, to be as thorough as possible, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It’ll just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam? Well… I suppose. If it will get you to stop asking questions. Honestly, I don't see what good it will do, but… alright. Just… be quick about it, please. And don’t poke too much. I don’t like being poked. Honestly, I keep telling you, it's probably just a phase. But alright. Go ahead, I suppose. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as gentle as possible. It won't take long at all. Alright, your blood pressure is 110 over 70. Your heart sounds regular, although a bit quiet. And your lungs sound clear. Now, let me just take a look at your throat… Your throat looks good, no signs of any issues there. Now, I would like to order some basic blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. It will check your thyroid levels, vitamin levels, and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. More tests? Honestly, it's just too much. Blood work? I hate needles. I always faint. My daughter says I’m being dramatic, but… it’s true! I get dizzy just thinking about it. Honestly, I think I just need a good rest. And a nice cup of tea. And for my grandson to adjust to school. It’s probably all that. You’re making such a big deal about nothing. Perhaps… perhaps I should just go home. I’m feeling a bit faint already. Honestly. This is just… too much.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Janeth. We can absolutely stop. It’s clear you’re feeling quite overwhelmed, and I don’t want to cause you any further distress. Given your reluctance and your history of feeling faint, I’m not going to push for the blood work right now. However, I am concerned about the weight loss, fatigue, and changes in your appetite. I’d like to suggest a referral to a specialist, perhaps a geriatrician, who can do a more comprehensive assessment and explore potential causes for your symptoms at your own pace. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Oh. A specialist? Well… I suppose. If they won’t poke too much. And if they listen to what I say. My daughter always says I should see a specialist, but… honestly, I don’t like going to doctors. It’s just… unpleasant. But alright. If it will get everyone to stop worrying, I suppose. Just… make sure they’re gentle. And that they listen to me. Honestly, this is just too much fuss about nothing. But alright. A specialist. If you think it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your concerns, and I will make sure to recommend a specialist who is known for being gentle and listening to their patients. I'll write a referral for Dr. Eleanor Vance – she's a wonderful geriatrician and takes a very holistic approach to care. I’ll also write a note to Dr. Vance outlining your symptoms and your concerns about feeling faint and your preference for a gentle approach. I'll include your weight loss, fatigue, changes in appetite, and the fact that you've been experiencing a general feeling of being "low." Here's the referral slip. The office number and address are listed here. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Janeth?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Thank you, I suppose. But honestly, I still think it's just a phase. But alright. A specialist. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you. And please… tell Dr. Vance to be gentle. Honestly, this whole thing has been… upsetting. And I still think I just need a good rest. And for my grandson to adjust to school. But alright. Thank you. I suppose that’s all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janeth. I hope you feel better soon. And I will definitely make a note to Dr. Vance about your preferences. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was nice to meet you. Take care, and please try to get some rest.
