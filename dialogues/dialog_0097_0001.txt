DOCTOR: Hi Johney, welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. I'm Katya Georgiou, and I’m one of the family medicine doctors here. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Georgiou. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it plainly, I’ve been smoking for… a very long time. And I’ve decided it’s time to try and stop. It’s not been easy, naturally. I’m hoping you can offer some assistance.
DOCTOR: Alright, Johney. That’s a very sensible decision, and it’s wonderful you’re taking this step. It is rarely easy, you're right. We can definitely explore some options to help. To start, could you tell me a little more about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I began smoking when I was… sixteen, perhaps seventeen. Back in Lithuania, it was… common, you see? Everyone smoked. It started with just a cigarette here and there, but quickly became a habit. I’ve smoked… well, for fifty-seven years now. Mostly unfiltered cigarettes, I’m afraid. And, if I’m being honest, usually around a pack a day. Sometimes a bit more when things were… stressful. It’s a regrettable habit, truly. I’ve tried to quit a few times before, with… limited success.
DOCTOR: Fifty-seven years is a long time, Johney, and that’s a significant smoking history. It’s very common for people to struggle with quitting, especially after so many years. It sounds like it became deeply ingrained in your routine, and stress definitely plays a role for many smokers. You're not alone in that. When was the last time you actively tried to quit?
PATIENT: Let me see… the last proper attempt was… oh, about two years ago, I believe. I used those… patches, I think they were called? Nicotine patches. They helped a bit with the cravings, but I found myself… irritable, and the habit was still there, lingering. I didn’t last more than a month, I’m afraid. Before that, it was just… cold turkey, a few times. Which, as you can imagine, was even less successful. I didn’t really have a plan, just… stopped. A foolish endeavour, in retrospect.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've tried a few different approaches already, which is good – it shows you’re motivated to quit. The patches can be helpful for some, but they don’t work for everyone, and the irritability is a common side effect. "Cold turkey" is tough, especially with a long history like yours. It's definitely not a foolish endeavor to try – it takes courage! Okay, Johney. To get a better idea of how we can best help you now, let's talk a little bit more about your current smoking habits. On a typical day, how soon after you wake up do you have your first cigarette?
PATIENT: Ah, well, that’s… rather immediate, I’m afraid. Within five minutes of waking, usually. It’s become… part of the morning ritual, you see? Coffee and a cigarette. It’s a terrible habit, I know. And then, perhaps every hour or two after that, depending on what I’m doing. If I’m working in the garden, I’ll smoke less. If I’m… thinking, or reading, then considerably more. It's rather… pervasive.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. So, a first cigarette within five minutes of waking and then throughout the day, varying with activity. That suggests a pretty strong nicotine dependence, which isn't surprising given the history. Now, apart from the patches, have you ever considered any other methods to help you quit?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve heard tell of… those electronic cigarettes, the vaping devices. But frankly, they seem… rather complicated, and I’m not a man who’s particularly comfortable with such modern contraptions. I prefer things… simpler, if you understand. I also recall reading about… hypnotism, but that sounded… rather dubious. And some sort of… medication, perhaps? Pills, I believe. But I’ve always been hesitant to take medication, if it can be avoided. I’ve mainly relied on willpower in the past, which, as you can see, has not been entirely effective.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Johney. It sounds like you’ve considered a few options, and it’s sensible to be cautious about new things, especially if you prefer a simpler approach. And you're right to be wary of anything that feels too complicated. There are several medications available now that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. They aren't right for everyone, but they can be very effective when combined with support and counseling. We could discuss those in more detail, and I can explain how they work and what the potential side effects are. Before we get to that though, let’s just quickly go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any health conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. Discussing the medication might be helpful. As for my health… I have, unfortunately, been diagnosed with… mild hypertension, some years ago. High blood pressure, as you say. It’s been managed with… a small dose of medication, thankfully. Otherwise… no, nothing significant. I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up with antibiotics. I’ve always been… reasonably robust, all things considered. Though, undoubtedly, the smoking has taken its toll. I cough a bit, especially in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension managed with medication, and a recent bout of bronchitis. It’s good that your blood pressure is controlled, but smoking definitely complicates things with that, as it raises blood pressure and increases your risk of heart problems. And the morning cough is also common with smokers. Before we talk about specific medications, I’d like to ask about any other medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements. And also, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Certainly. I take a small dose of… Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. Just one tablet a day. And… occasionally, I take paracetamol for a headache, but that's infrequent. No supplements, no. As for allergies… I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’ve always been… careful about what I take. Though, my late wife, God rest her soul, was allergic to penicillin, if that’s of any relevance. I, thankfully, do not share that affliction.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for hypertension, no other medications or supplements. And no known allergies for you, but a penicillin allergy for your wife – good to know, thank you. Alright, Johney. So, given your history of hypertension, the fact that you’ve tried patches before with limited success, and your preference for a simpler approach, I think we have a few options to consider. We could try a different type of medication that’s specifically designed to help with nicotine cravings, combined with behavioral support. Or, if you’re not keen on medication, we could focus on behavioral strategies and counseling. Before we decide on a plan, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your lung function and overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam sounds… sensible. A baseline assessment, as you say, is a prudent approach. I have no objections whatsoever. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I suppose it’s best to know exactly where we stand before embarking on this endeavour. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you could just follow me over to the examination table, please. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out… and again… Your heart rate is a little elevated, which isn’t unusual given your history and smoking habit. And I can hear some slight wheezing in your lungs, which is likely related to the smoking as well. Now, I’ll just check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little higher than it should be, but not alarmingly so. It’s still within a manageable range. Your eyes look clear and your throat is normal. Finally, I’ll just feel your pulse and check your reflexes. Everything seems normal there as well. Overall, your physical exam findings are consistent with someone who has a long smoking history and managed hypertension. It’s nothing alarming, but it reinforces the importance of quitting.
PATIENT: That… doesn’t entirely surprise me, Doctor. I’ve always suspected the smoking wasn't doing me any favours. It’s reassuring to know that it's not… catastrophic, as yet. I suppose it’s best to address the issue now, before it becomes more… problematic. So, what would you recommend, given these findings? I’m prepared to… listen to your advice, and do my best to follow it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Johney. Given your findings, and what you've told me, I think the best approach would be a combination of medication and behavioral support. There are a few medications available that can help reduce nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. One of the most effective is Varenicline, also known as Chantix. It works by blocking the effects of nicotine on the brain, which can make it easier to quit. It does have some potential side effects, such as nausea and sleep disturbances, but these are usually mild and manageable. We can discuss those in more detail. However, medication alone isn't enough. It’s important to have a plan for dealing with cravings, triggers, and setbacks. I recommend that you participate in a smoking cessation program, or work with a counselor who specializes in helping people quit. They can teach you coping skills, provide support, and help you stay motivated. We also need to address your blood pressure. Quitting smoking will likely help lower it, but we may need to adjust your Lisinopril dosage to keep it under control. What are your thoughts on that approach?
PATIENT: Varenicline, you say? I’ve heard of it, I believe. The potential side effects… nausea and sleep disturbances… aren’t particularly appealing, naturally. But if it’s effective, perhaps they can be tolerated. I’m willing to consider it. A smoking cessation program… or a counselor… that sounds… sensible as well. I suppose I’ve always been rather… independent, and relied on my own willpower. But perhaps I need a bit of assistance this time around. Adjusting the Lisinopril dosage… that seems prudent. Yes, Doctor. I think… I think that approach sounds… reasonable. Let’s proceed with the Varenicline, then. And I’ll inquire about a suitable smoking cessation program. Perhaps you can provide me with some recommendations? I'm willing to give it my best effort. It’s time to… finally put an end to this habit.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Johney. I’m very glad to hear that. It takes courage to make this decision, and I have confidence that you can succeed. Okay, let’s start with the Varenicline. I’m going to write you a prescription for a 12-week course. It’s important to take it exactly as directed, and to be aware of the potential side effects. We'll start with a low dose and gradually increase it over a few days to minimize any discomfort. I’ll also provide you with some information about the side effects and what to do if you experience them. As for the smoking cessation program, there's a very good one offered at the community hospital. They have group sessions and individual counseling available. Here’s a brochure with the contact information and schedule. We’ll also need to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing with the medication and to discuss your progress. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfectly acceptable, Doctor. A follow-up appointment in two weeks is a prudent precaution. The community hospital… good. It’s relatively close by. Yes, I understand the importance of taking the medication as directed. And I’ll be mindful of the potential side effects. Thank you for providing me with this information, Doctor. I feel… more optimistic now, than I did before. It's good to have a plan, and someone to guide me through this process. I appreciate your assistance. Perhaps this time, I'll finally succeed.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Johney. That’s what I’m here for. And I truly believe you can succeed this time. Having a plan and support is half the battle. Before you go, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. I’m prepared to begin the treatment, and follow your instructions. Thank you again for your time and assistance. I appreciate your patience and guidance. I’ll… see you in two weeks, then. .
DOCTOR: Excellent. It was a pleasure meeting you, Johney. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Good luck, and I’ll see you in two weeks. Take care. .
