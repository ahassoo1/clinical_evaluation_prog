DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. My head... back of my head... it hurts. Been hurting for maybe three days now. Not real bad, but… constant. Like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache at the back of your head for about three days. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it doesn’t feel like a regular headache, you know? Not like when I used to get them from working too hard in the rail yard. Those were… all over. This is just… there. Right here. And it doesn’t… go away completely when I lie down. Usually lying down helped.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it's localized to the back of your head, different from headaches you’ve experienced before, and doesn’t improve with lying down. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger…? Hmm. Not that I know of. I been… mostly quiet, you know? Since my wife… passed. Not much rail yard work anymore, either. Just… puttering around the house. Maybe… reading a little too long? I like my books. But I don't think so. It just… started. It’s not… a bad pain, but it’s always there. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: I see. And you mentioned it started about three days ago. Has anything else changed around the same time?
PATIENT: No… not really. I… I been eating my usual food. Sleeping… okay, I guess. Old man sleeps, you know? Not like when I was younger. No new medicines. No falls or bumps to the head. Just… this headache. It's… strange. Everything feels a little… fuzzy sometimes, but maybe that's just my age.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say "fuzzy," could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… It's not like I can't see okay. My eyes are still good, I think. But… sometimes things don't feel… sharp. Like looking through a dirty window, maybe? Or… like I'm forgetting what I was going to say. Small things, you know? Not big things. I still remember my wife's birthday, and all my work stories… but… little things slip my mind. It's probably nothing. Just old age catching up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a sense of mild fogginess – not vision changes, but a feeling of things not being quite as sharp, and some minor forgetfulness. We'll definitely want to explore that further. Now, let's go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Doctor said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back, but he just told me to watch my salt. I don't take anything for it. Just try to eat less salty food. And… my knees bother me sometimes, from all the work. But no… no big illnesses. I always been a strong man, you know? Worked hard all my life. No diabetes, no heart trouble… nothing like that. Still ticking, pretty good for ninety years!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes, one. Long time ago. When I was maybe… forty? Broke my arm working on the rail yard. They had to put pins in it. Healed up fine, though. Never bothered me much after that. Nothing else. No other surgeries. Just the arm. Still strong enough to hold a book, at least!
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That’s a good question. My mother… she lived to be eighty-five. She had… some trouble with her heart at the end. My father… he passed when I was young, from a fever. I don't really know much about his health. He worked on the coffee plantations, a long time ago. And my wife… she had… arthritis, I think. In her hands. That’s about all I remember. We didn't talk much about sickness, you know? Just tried to stay strong and keep working.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. Just… a little coffee in the morning. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I rub some liniment on them. That's all. No prescriptions, no vitamins, nothing like that. Old man tries to stay natural, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam, just to assess your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, okay? Old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brum. I will be very gentle. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit here on the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright. There we go. A little creaky, but I'm here. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Not alarmingly high, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs. Could be a sign of some fluid build-up, but it’s subtle. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and coordination. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’m following your finger… like this? Yes… there we go. Just tell me if I need to move faster or slower. My eyes aren’t as sharp as they used to be, you know? But I'm trying my best.
DOCTOR: Good, you're tracking well. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright. Is that good enough, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Good. A little weaker on both sides, but that's not uncommon at your age. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Just… be careful, okay? Old man doesn't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Yes, just take your time. Okay, Mr. Brum. That's good. I'm noticing a bit of unsteadiness and some mild weakness, but nothing too concerning at this point. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a combination of things related to your age – some mild cognitive changes, some muscle weakness, and possibly some fluid build-up in your lungs. However, the headache is the most concerning symptom, and we need to investigate that further. I'd like to order a CT scan of your head, just to rule out any serious underlying causes. It's a quick, painless test, and will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Are you able to lie flat for a short period of time?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? Hmm. I don't like the sound of that, Doctor. Is it… dangerous? I don't want any radiation, if I can help it. And lying flat… my back isn't what it used to be. But… if you think it’s important… I suppose I can try. Just… tell me what it involves, okay? And how long I’ll have to lie there. I don't want to be stuck for too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brum. The CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but it's a very low dose and the benefits of ruling out serious causes of your headache outweigh the risks in this case. The test itself is quick, usually only takes a few minutes. You'll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It’s important to lie still during the scan so the images are clear. We'll do our best to make you comfortable, and a technician will be with you the entire time. It's also possible we could look into an MRI, which doesn’t use radiation, but it’s a longer test and may not be as helpful in this situation. Would you like me to explain the potential risks and benefits of both scans in more detail, or would you prefer I schedule the CT scan for now?
PATIENT: Hmm… a longer test… I don’t know. Maybe the quicker one is better. I don’t want to be stuck in a machine for a long time. But… radiation… I don’t like that. Is there… anything else we can do? Maybe some medicine to help the headache? I don’t think it’s anything serious. Just an old man’s headache, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Brum. We could try some medication for the headache first, but if it doesn't improve, or if it gets worse, it's important to know what's causing it. I'm also concerned about the mild fogginess you’ve described, and the CT scan can help rule out any underlying neurological issues. If you're still hesitant about the scan, we can try a course of anti-inflammatory medication for a week, and see if that helps. If your headache doesn't improve, or if you notice any new symptoms like vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking, it's very important to come back in immediately. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Medicine first… yes, that sounds better. If that doesn't work… then maybe I'll think about the scan. But not right now. Just… something for the headache, Doctor. Something to make it stop. And… maybe something to help me think a little clearer, if that’s possible. I'm forgetting things these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. We can certainly try that. I'm going to prescribe you a low dose of naproxen, which is an anti-inflammatory medication that can help with headaches. I'll also give you a prescription for donepezil, a medication that can sometimes help with mild cognitive impairment and memory problems. It doesn't work for everyone, but it's worth trying. I want you to take the medications as prescribed, and keep a journal of your symptoms. Note how often you’re experiencing the headache, how severe it is, and if you notice any improvements or changes in your memory or thinking. If your headache doesn't improve within a week, or if it gets worse, or if you experience any new symptoms, please come back in immediately. And if you notice any side effects from the medications, like stomach upset or dizziness, stop taking them and let me know. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Side effects… hmm. What kind of side effects? I don't want to feel worse, you know? And… how long will it take for these medicines to work? I don’t want to wait too long.
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Mr. Brum. The most common side effects of naproxen are stomach upset, heartburn, and mild nausea. It's important to take it with food to minimize these side effects. The most common side effects of donepezil are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These side effects are usually mild and temporary, and often improve after a few days. In rare cases, donepezil can cause more serious side effects, like muscle weakness or heart problems, but these are very uncommon. As for how long it will take for the medicines to work, it usually takes a few days to a few weeks to see noticeable improvement. It's important to be patient and take the medications as prescribed, even if you don't feel better right away. I'll also give you a handout with more information about the medications, including a list of potential side effects. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I think that’s all. Just… try to make me feel better, Doctor. That’s all I ask. Thank you for listening to an old man’s worries.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brum. That's what I'm here for. I'll write out the prescriptions for you now. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll keep a close eye on you. I’m optimistic we can get this headache under control and help you feel more like yourself again. Here are your prescriptions. And this handout has more information about both medications. Please read it carefully. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, just to check on your progress. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks is fine. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. .
