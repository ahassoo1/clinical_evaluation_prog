DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My back… it’s been very painful. I want to get this sorted quickly, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Right. “Back pain.” A very common complaint, unfortunately. Let’s try to get to the bottom of it. Can you tell me a little more about this pain?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. But it flares up sharp when I bend, or lift anything. I work with fences, you see. A lot of heavy posts. It started about three weeks ago, just a little twinge, and now… well, now it’s hard to even stand straight some days.
DOCTOR: Fences, you say. Heavy lifting… that explains a good deal, potentially. And where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: Lower back. Right across here. <gestures to the small of her back with a hand> And sometimes it shoots down my left leg. Not always, but when it does, it’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Right. Radiating pain down the leg… that’s important to know. Does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Not much, truthfully. Sitting still helps a bit, but I can’t stop working. And lying down… well, it takes the pressure off, but I can’t lie in bed all day. A warm bath sometimes takes the edge off for a little while, but it doesn't last.
DOCTOR: Hm. Alright. And have you noticed any numbness or weakness in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My left foot… sometimes it feels… tingly. And a little clumsy. Like I don't have full control of it. Not all the time, but it happens when the pain is bad.
DOCTOR: Right. Tingling and clumsiness… that’s concerning. Have you had any fever, weight loss, or bowel or bladder control problems at all?
PATIENT: No, none of that. No fever. Weight is… about the same. And no problems with… with those things you mentioned. Just the pain and the tingling in my foot. It’s… frustrating, Doctor. I need to be able to work.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let’s do a quick examination, then we can discuss possibilities and a plan. Could you lie down on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. <starts to carefully shift off the chair, wincing slightly> This way?
DOCTOR: Yes, if you please. Just lie flat on your back for now. I’ll start with some basic reflexes and strength tests. And I'll palpate your spine to see where the pain is most pronounced.
PATIENT: <Carefully lies down on the examination table, trying to minimize movement> Alright. Just let me know if anything hurts too much.
DOCTOR: Right. I'm going to start by checking your reflexes. Just relax, and let your leg drop when I tap it. This is just a quick assessment. <Taps Ms. Reihner’s left knee with a reflex hammer, then repeats on the right. Notes the response.> Alright. And now, can you lift your left leg straight up, keeping it as straight as possible?
PATIENT: <Grimaces slightly as the leg is lifted. It's a slow, deliberate movement> It’s… harder than it used to be. It’s not a strong lift. <Keeps the leg raised for a few seconds before slowly lowering it.> There. Does that help you see something?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. And now, can you point your toes and flex your foot?
PATIENT: <Flexes and points her left foot slowly. Winces slightly as she points it.> That… that feels a little tight. And when I point it… a little pain shoots down my leg. It’s not severe, but it’s there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you try to stand up slowly for me now?
PATIENT: <Slowly and carefully pushes herself up from the examination table, bracing herself with her hands. Her face is tight with effort.> Like this? It's… difficult. Feels unsteady. <Remains standing, but hunched over slightly.>
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… what I expected, unfortunately. I want to check one more thing. Can you try walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: <Takes a few slow, hesitant steps, favouring her left side. Her movements are stiff and awkward.> It's… not easy. Feels like it's putting weight on something it shouldn’t. <Stops walking, breathing a little heavily.> There. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. That's sufficient for now. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it seems highly likely you have a compressed nerve in your lower back, probably related to some muscle strain or possible disc issue. We’ll need imaging to confirm that, of course. <Looks Ms. Reihner directly in the eye, with a somewhat stern expression.> We'll order an MRI. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a muscle relaxant and a short course of anti-inflammatory medication to manage the pain. It’s vital you avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity while we wait for the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, I understand. No heavy lifting… that will be difficult, but I will try. Muscle relaxant and… anti-inflammatory. Alright. Will that… will that fix it, Doctor? And how long will the MRI take? I need to get back to work as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: “Fix it” is a strong word, Ms. Reihner. These things aren’t always simple. The MRI will give us a clearer picture of what we’re dealing with and guide our treatment plan. As for how long it will take, the scan itself is about 30-40 minutes, but there's usually a wait to get the appointment scheduled and then for the radiologist to interpret the results. Typically, a week or two. <Pauses, looking Ms. Reihner in the eye.> As for getting back to work… honestly, it’s too early to say. It depends entirely on what the MRI shows. Pushing yourself too soon could make things worse. I’m going to refer you to a physiotherapist as well. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your back and core and help you manage your pain. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. No, nothing. I just… I have bills to pay, Doctor. I need to be able to work. <She looks down at her hands, then back up, her expression worried.> Is there anything… anything I can do right now to make it a little better? While I’m waiting for this MRI? I can't just sit and do nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Reihner. Sitting and doing nothing is rarely helpful, you’re right. But "helping" and "fixing" are two different things. Until we know what we’re dealing with, we need to be careful. For now, I recommend gentle stretching – nothing strenuous. Avoid any movements that cause pain. A warm compress can help with muscle spasms. And I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever, something over-the-counter strength, to take as needed. Do not exceed the recommended dosage. <Looks directly at Ms. Reihner.> And, I cannot stress this enough, avoid heavy lifting. I'll also provide you with a list of exercises from a reputable source, but please, start slowly and stop if you feel any pain. And, if your pain worsens, or you experience any numbness or weakness, contact my office immediately. I’ll send the MRI order to the imaging center, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Stretching… warm compress… no lifting. I will try. Thank you, Doctor. <She pauses, looking uncertain.> I suppose… I suppose I will wait for the call about the MRI. <Starts to slowly get off the examination table.> Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: Just the usual paperwork from reception. They will schedule a follow-up appointment for us once the MRI results are in. And I’ll send over a note outlining everything we discussed today to your primary care physician. Try to rest, Ms. Reihner. And please, be mindful of your limitations. <Looks up briefly, with a somewhat dismissive tone.> Don’t push yourself. <Returns to typing on the computer, effectively ending the conversation.>
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. <She hesitates for a moment, then slowly walks towards the door, looking dejected.> .
