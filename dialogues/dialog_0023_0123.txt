DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started a few weeks ago, I think, and it just won’t go away.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And where exactly is this itch located?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, pretty much! My arms, my legs, my back… even my stomach a little. It’s not all over, but it jumps around. Some days it’s worse on my arms, other days it’s my back. It’s hard to pinpoint, you know? It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: "Jumping around," hm. And is there anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question... I haven't really noticed anything specific, to be honest. I thought maybe it was the laundry detergent, so I switched brands, but that didn't help. I've been using the same soap for years, though. And I haven't tried any new lotions or anything like that. It just... started. It’s been a real puzzle.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any rash accompanying the itch?
PATIENT: No, no rash. That's the strange thing! Just the itching. My skin looks normal, which is why I kept putting it off for so long, thinking it would just go away. But it hasn’t. It’s just… invisible torture, really. It sounds silly, I know.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Ms. Cassimatis. It’s frustrating when something is causing discomfort without a visible cause. Let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any other skin conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had eczema when I was a little girl, but that cleared up ages ago. I haven't had any problems with my skin since then, honestly. I’m generally pretty healthy, you know? I eat okay, I try to walk when I can… nothing major. Are you looking for something specific?
DOCTOR: And any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, that was it. And I broke my wrist once, but that was a long time ago too. Nothing serious lately, thankfully. No hospital stays, nothing like that. Is this a sign of something bad, Doctor? I get worried easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Unlikely, Ms. Cassimatis. But we need to rule things out. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let’s see… just a little bit of ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains. And sometimes a stool softener, if I’m being honest. Old age, you know? But that’s it, really. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. Just the basics.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to worry about bee stings, but I haven’t been stung in years. I think I’m pretty lucky, actually. Usually. This itchy skin is just… odd.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cassimatis. Let's have a look at your skin. Please, have a seat on the examination table, and I'll take a closer look. We’ll start with your arms, if you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to move anything or anything like that. I'm not as nimble as I used to be!
DOCTOR: Hmm. Skin appears normal in terms of color and texture. No visible rash, welts, or lesions. Capillary refill is within normal limits. Legs are similar – no acute findings. Now, let's check your back. Please lie forward for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if it’s uncomfortable. This old back doesn’t bend like it used to! I’m a little worried about what you’ll find, though. It's been so persistent.
DOCTOR: No obvious signs of inflammation or rash on the back either. Skin feels unremarkable. Alright, Ms. Cassimatis, you can sit back up now. So, clinically, there isn’t much to explain the itch. It’s frustrating when the examination doesn't yield any obvious cause. We need to consider some possible, though less likely, underlying issues. Have you noticed any fatigue, weight loss, or changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, not really. I’ve been a little tired, maybe, but that’s just old age again, I think. And my appetite is the same as always, maybe even a little too good! I haven't lost any weight, thankfully. I like my food too much for that! Is this something serious, Doctor? I’m getting a little nervous.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be anything serious at this point, Ms. Cassimatis. But given the persistence of the itch and the lack of obvious external causes, we should rule out some systemic possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. That will help us check your organ function and look for any hidden abnormalities. And given your age, we should also check a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to rule out thyroid issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests. But if you think it’s necessary, then yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. I just… I don't like going to the lab. All that poking and prodding! But if it will help figure out what’s going on with this itch, then I guess I have to. When do I need to go? And will my insurance cover it? I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Ms. Cassimatis. And I understand your concerns about the cost. Unfortunately, as you mentioned, you are not insured. The lab work will be approximately $200. You can pay out of pocket. I’ll give you a lab requisition. You can go to the lab at St. Jude's Hospital; they usually have the quickest turnaround time. Try to go tomorrow morning, preferably fasting. I will call you with the results in approximately five business days. In the meantime, I recommend an over-the-counter antihistamine, like loratadine, to help alleviate the itching. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Oh. Two hundred dollars. That’s… a lot. I wasn’t expecting that much. But… alright. I guess I’ll have to find a way. I’ll go to St. Jude’s tomorrow morning, fasting. And I’ll try the antihistamine. Loratadine, you said? Five business days… that seems like a long time to wait when it’s driving me crazy! Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you looking into it, even if it means more expense and waiting. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Cassimatis. Just try to remain calm, take the antihistamine as directed, and we will discuss the results when they become available. I’ll print out the lab requisition and some information about loratadine for you. It’s important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. And try not to scratch excessively, as that can worsen the irritation. Here you go. If the itching becomes unbearable or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever or rash, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time, even if it's… expensive and a long wait. I'll try not to scratch, and I'll take the medicine. Hopefully, it will help. Thank you again. And… have a good day.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Cassimatis. I hope you feel better soon. .
