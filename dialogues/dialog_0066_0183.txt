DOCTOR: Hi Chirag, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, doctor, I feel… tired. Very tired. Not like just a little sleepy, but… always tired. And the other doctor, he said something about my liver. That's why I am here, I think. He talk a lot, I don't remember all of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness is definitely something we want to figure out. And it’s good you followed up on what the other doctor said about your liver. It’s common to feel overwhelmed with medical information, so don't worry about not remembering everything. Let me take a look at the notes from your previous visit, if you don’t mind. Just to get a clearer picture. While I’m doing that, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Okay, doctor. That's fine. It's… hard to explain. It’s not like I did too much work. I sit a lot, you know? My job… I make things with cloth. Not heavy lifting. It just… is always there. Even when I sleep, I still feel it. It’s like something is… pulling me down. Does that make sense? And my wife, she says I look… pale. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Chirag. That sounds really frustrating – feeling tired even after sleep and having that constant feeling of being pulled down. And your wife noticing you look pale is definitely something we should look into. To get a better idea of what might be going on, can you tell me a little bit about when this tiredness started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started… maybe six months ago? Around the time the rains started. It was not so bad at first. Just a little more sleepy than usual. But then… it got worse. Slowly, slowly. Now it's… like this all the time. Even in the morning, before I start work. It doesn't go away. My appetite, it’s also… not good. I don’t eat much anymore. Everything tastes… flat.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, coinciding with the start of the rainy season, and a gradual worsening… and now a decreased appetite and things tasting “flat.” That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and loss of appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My stomach, sometimes it feels… swollen. Not always, but often. And… I go to the bathroom… different. Not the regular way. Sometimes it’s… loose. And sometimes… dark. The stool, I mean. It worries me, that one. I drink water, but… it doesn’t seem to help. Maybe more, maybe less. I forget. My wife is the one who watches these things now.
DOCTOR: Okay, abdominal swelling, changes in your bowel movements – loose stools and dark stools – and you’ve noticed some difficulty remembering your water intake. Those are all important things to note. Dark stools can be a sign of bleeding in the digestive tract, so it’s good you mentioned that. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, doctor. Never. I have always been healthy. I work hard, I eat good food when I can, I sleep. Nothing bad. This… this is new. My father, he had problems with his… bones. When he was very old. But not me. Never sick like this. Just tired. Very tired. My wife worries I am getting too skinny. She makes me eat, but… it doesn't stay down sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no previous medical diagnoses, and your father had bone problems later in life. That's good to know. And you're experiencing some difficulty keeping food down. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, doctor. Not ever. I cut myself sometimes at work, small cuts with the cloth. But nothing serious. My wife cleans them, puts a bandage. That's all. I don't like hospitals. They smell bad and… make you feel worse. I prefer to stay home and rest. But I can’t rest if I am so tired all the time. It’s a strange thing, this tiredness. It just… is there. Always.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, doctor. I don’t take anything. I tried some… pills for the stomach, from the shop. But they didn’t help. My wife says they are bad for me, so I stopped. I drink water, that’s all. Sometimes tea, but not much. I like natural things. I don’t trust those… chemicals. They say too many things on the box. I don't understand. My wife watches my health, she knows what is good for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications, vitamins, or supplements. You tried some over-the-counter stomach pills but stopped because they didn’t help and your wife advised against them. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, doctor. Not that I know of. I eat all kinds of food. My wife makes me try new things. Sometimes spicy, sometimes sweet. I never had a problem. I touch many things at work, different cloths, different dyes. Never itchy, never red. I am strong. This tiredness… it is not from allergies. It’s something else. It is deep inside. Like something is… broken. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, doctor. Never. I don’t like those things. They smell bad and make people act strange. My wife doesn’t like them either. We live a quiet life. I work, I eat, I sleep. I go to church on Sundays. I don’t need those… things. They are bad for the body. They make you weak. And I am already weak, from this tiredness. No, no, I don’t touch those things. My wife would be very angry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you don’t smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. That's good to know. Alright, Chirag, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a much better picture of what’s going on. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. It will help me to assess your overall health and see if there are any obvious physical signs that could be causing your tiredness. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. That’s fine. I trust you. I want to know what is wrong. I am tired of being tired. It’s… hard to live like this. I want to feel strong again. Do what you need to do. I will try to be still. I hope you can find something. Maybe it's not too bad. Maybe I just need some… rest. But I can't rest if I am so tired. It's a strange thing, this tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chirag, I understand. We'll do our best to figure this out. Okay, your blood pressure is 118/72, pulse is 78, temperature is normal at 98.6, and your respiratory rate is 16. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. I notice some paleness to your skin and the conjunctiva of your eyes are also quite pale. Now, I’m going to listen to your belly a bit more closely. It might be a little uncomfortable, but just let me know if it’s too much.
PATIENT: Okay, doctor. Do what you need to do. I will tell you if it hurts too much. My wife says I am a strong man. I can handle a little pain. But I am worried. This tiredness… it’s not just pain. It’s… empty. Like something is missing. And the paleness… my wife keeps telling me I look sick. I hope you can find what is wrong. Just… do what you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, your bowel sounds are a little quiet. Not alarmingly so, but something we'll keep in mind. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen in a few different spots to check for any enlargement of the liver or spleen. Again, let me know if you feel any pain. Okay, I’m feeling some mild enlargement of your liver, and it feels a little tender. This, along with the paleness and your fatigue, makes me think we should investigate your liver function a bit further. To help us figure out what’s going on, I'm going to order some blood tests. These tests will check how well your liver is functioning, look for any signs of inflammation or infection, and check your blood count to see if you're anemic. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. Blood tests… that sounds good. If it can help me find out what is wrong, I will do it. I am tired of feeling like this. Tired of being weak. Tired of worrying my wife. Do what you need to do. I trust you. Will it be painful? I don't like needles very much. But I will do it. If it can help me, I will do it. Just… tell me when you are going to do it. I need to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chirag. It's understandable to be nervous about needles. The blood draw itself will be a quick pinch, and it's usually over very quickly. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will do their best to make it as comfortable as possible. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw the blood. It will involve a few different tubes, so it might take a few minutes. After the blood is drawn, we’ll send it to the lab and the results should be back in a couple of days. In the meantime, I’m also going to order a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel and a CBC. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. That sounds alright. A few days… I can wait a few days. I have waited many months already. A few more days won't make much difference. I trust you to find out what is wrong. Just… let me know when the nurse is coming. I want to be prepared. And… thank you, doctor. Thank you for listening to me. My wife will be happy to know you are trying to help. I hope… I hope it's not too bad. But I trust you. Just… thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chirag. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, we'll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. I'll let the nurse know to come in shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with or any questions you have before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, doctor. I think… I think that's all. I have told you everything I know. I am just… tired. Very tired. I will wait for the nurse. Thank you again, doctor. You are very kind. I hope… I hope it's something we can fix. I want to feel strong again. I miss feeling strong. But I trust you. Just… thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chirag. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you sharing everything with me. We'll take it one step at a time. I’ll let you rest now, and I’ll be back to review the results as soon as they're available. Just let the nurse know when you're ready. .
