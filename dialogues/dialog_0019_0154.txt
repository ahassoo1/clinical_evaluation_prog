DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Claudene. Welcome. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, I think. They bother me. A lot. It keeps… happening. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, just that it’s been a while. A nuisance, really. I just want it fixed, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, your waterworks bothering you, happening a lot, been going on for a while… Okay. When you say “happening,” can you tell me a bit more specifically how they’re bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specifics… That’s… difficult. It’s a pain, down… there. And I have to go to the… ladies room. A lot. More than usual, certainly. It burns a little, sometimes. But mostly just… frequent. I’m not sure if that makes sense. It’s hard to explain. I’ve had this happen before, years ago, but… I don’t recall the details.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Claudene. Don’t worry about the specifics; we’ll get there. Pain down there, frequent trips to the restroom, and sometimes a burning sensation… Okay. When you say “pain,” is it a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Not all the time. Worse when… after I go to the restroom, I suppose. A little ache, then it fades. It’s not… crippling, if that makes sense. Just… irritating. Really irritating. Is this taking long? I have an appointment to… well, never mind. I just want to know what's wrong, and then be done with it.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all. We’re taking our time, and I appreciate you being patient with me. It’s helpful to get the details, even the seemingly small ones. Pain that comes and goes, worse after using the restroom… Okay. Now, has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… Let me think. Not really. I've been mostly the same. Still driving my RV, still visiting my sister… Oh! I did start drinking more cranberry juice. Someone told me it was good for… this problem. But it didn’t seem to help, really. And I think… I think I maybe haven’t been drinking as much regular water. Is that important? I just can’t keep track of everything these days. It’s all a blur.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Claudene. Thank you. Cranberry juice and potentially less water… Yes, that is important. Cranberry juice can sometimes help with urinary tract infections, but it’s also quite acidic and can irritate the bladder. And being well-hydrated is always important. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical problems, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical problems… Let me see. I had something… years ago, with my heart, I think. But they fixed it. A little… procedure. And my blood pressure, the doctor did mention it was a little high once, but I take a pill for that. A small white one. I think. Oh, and I had my hip replaced. Ages ago. Does that count? I really don’t remember much about any of it, truthfully. It’s all a bit… fuzzy. I’m sorry. I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Claudene. Don't apologize at all. It's perfectly normal to not remember every detail, especially with things from the past. Okay, heart procedure, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a hip replacement… Good. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have a little orange pill for my… bones, I suppose. Something about keeping them strong. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take something for the pain. A little white one again, I think. I have a big pill organizer, but I never know which one is which! My daughter tries to help, but… well, she's busy. I mostly just take what looks right. Is that… bad? Oh, and I take a vitamin, every morning. A gummy one.
DOCTOR: Okay… Orange pill for your bones, something for arthritis when it flares up, and a daily vitamin… It's not ideal to not be sure of what you’re taking, Claudene, but we'll sort it out. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I used to sneeze a lot in the spring, but that was just… the flowers, I think. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Not that I remember. I'm really not good with this sort of thing. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know what’s wrong with my waterworks. Can’t we just… do a test or something? This is taking a very long time, and I have an appointment… never mind. It's probably nothing important.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, and we absolutely will do some tests. I just want to make sure I have a complete picture before we proceed. No allergies… Okay. Now, before we do any tests, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a brief external examination. Just to check things out. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Well… I suppose so. But please be gentle, Doctor. I’m not as… sturdy as I used to be. And… try to be quick, if possible? I really am on a tight schedule, even if it’s not important. I just… don’t like being poked and prodded. Is that silly? It just makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Claudene. Perfectly understandable. I will be as gentle and quick as possible, I promise. We’ll just listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and a quick look. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be wonderful. I'll explain everything as I go along. Alright, just breathing normally for me, please. Everything sounds normal here. Now, I'm just going to take a quick look at your abdomen and pelvic area… Just looking for any tenderness or unusual findings. A little tenderness when I press here on the lower abdomen, but nothing alarming. Your overall condition seems stable, but the tenderness suggests we investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh. Tenderness? What does that mean? Is it something bad? I knew I shouldn’t have come. I just wanted it fixed, and now it sounds complicated. Can’t you just give me something for it? Some pills? Please? I really don’t want any… tests. This is all very stressful. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Now, Claudene, let's not get stressed. Tenderness just means there's some sensitivity in that area. It doesn't automatically mean anything bad. It could be a simple urinary tract infection, which is easily treated with antibiotics, but to be sure, and to rule out anything else, I would like to order a urine test. It will help us determine the cause of the pain and frequent urination. I understand you're not keen on tests, but this is a simple, painless test that will give us the information we need to get you feeling better. It’s important to be thorough, and I want to make sure we are addressing the right issue. We can also discuss pain management options after we get the results. Would you be willing to consider a urine test?
