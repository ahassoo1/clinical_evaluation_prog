DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, I need some papers signed, mostly. Some health forms… for, uh… well, they just need verifying. It's a bit of a hassle, honestly. I wish everything could just be electronic these days.
DOCTOR: Papers, alright. Yes, the paperwork never ends. Though frankly, I find people tend to misremember things when they’re filling those out… makes my job harder. So, besides the forms needing signing, is there anything you specifically are worried about?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not worried, exactly. Just… I don’t really have a regular doctor, you see. I’ve been alright on my own for years. These forms are for a… a program, and they need a doctor’s signature to say I’m… capable, I guess. I just want to get it done and over with, if that makes sense. I haven't been feeling poorly or anything.
DOCTOR: "Capable," you say. Right. Well, even if you haven't been feeling poorly, a quick check-up is standard procedure, Melvenia. Just to make sure everything is as you believe it is. It's… responsible, you know?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I was hoping to avoid that, truthfully. I don't really do well with doctors poking and prodding. Is it really necessary? I can tell you right now my blood pressure is probably fine – I walk every morning! And my eyesight’s still pretty good for my age… I can still thread a needle, you know.
DOCTOR: Walking and threading a needle aren’t exactly a comprehensive medical assessment, Melvenia. With all due respect, those aren't reliable indicators of overall health. I need to at least listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes… basic things. We’re not trying to reinvent the wheel here. It'll be quick, I promise. Just a formality, really. Although, frankly, I find people often downplay things.
PATIENT: Well, alright. If you insist. But please be gentle, dear. And quickly, as you promised. I have a… a bridge club meeting later this afternoon and I cannot be late. Old ladies can be very unforgiving about punctuality, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, bridge club. Very important, I’m sure. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. And please, try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This cuff is awfully tight, isn’t it? Is that normal? It’s making my arm feel a bit… numb. I haven’t had my blood pressure checked in… well, I honestly can’t remember the last time. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Melvenia. A little constriction is… expected. Though, I suppose some people are more sensitive than others. 140 over 90. Not ideal, but not alarming. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe deeply for me.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Is that bad? 140 over 90… that does sound rather high, doesn’t it? I do get a bit anxious at the doctor’s office, you know. That probably raises it. It's always higher here than at home. Honestly, I think I'm perfectly healthy. Are you sure that machine is working properly?
DOCTOR: Anxiety can raise it, yes. But 140/90 is consistently elevated, regardless. It warrants… attention. And the machine is perfectly calibrated, thank you very much. Now, have you experienced any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Not at all! I walk a good mile every morning, rain or shine. And I climb the stairs in my building all the time – three flights! Honestly, I’m more active than most women my age. I just… I don’t like feeling fussed over. Is this going to take much longer? My bridge partners will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: A mile walk doesn't negate potential underlying issues, Melvenia. We're looking at the whole picture here. And yes, I'm aware of your bridge club. Let’s move on to your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not really. I used to take something for my arthritis, years ago, but it didn't seem to do much good, so I stopped taking it. And I take a multivitamin every now and then, when I remember. Mostly, I just try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables. My mother always said a good diet is the best medicine. Is this all going to be on those forms? Because I really need to get those signed.
DOCTOR: Yes, it will be documented. It's necessary for a complete picture, Melvenia. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, when I was ice skating. That was… oh, goodness, almost seventy years ago! Nothing serious, really. Just a cast for a few weeks. I’ve been very lucky, actually. Never had any major illnesses or anything like that. I'm a pretty sturdy woman, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s a bit of a long story. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some sort of heart trouble when he got older. But honestly, I wasn't very close to either of them, and I didn't pay much attention to their medical problems. My siblings… well, my brother passed away a few years ago, and my sister lives in California and I haven't spoken to her in years. It wasn't a very… medical family, if that makes sense. We mostly just kept to ourselves.
DOCTOR: Right. So, essentially, limited information. Given your age, blood pressure reading, and family history, I recommend we start with some basic blood work to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and a complete blood count. And an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. It's a precaution, Melvenia. Just to be safe. I'll write up the orders now.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests. Is it really necessary? I mean, I feel perfectly fine. And I do have that bridge game… it's very important. Couldn’t we just sign those forms and be done with it? I can promise to walk an extra mile every day.
DOCTOR: Walking an extra mile doesn't provide a comprehensive evaluation of your cardiovascular health. We need to rule out any underlying issues before I can confidently sign those forms. It's my professional responsibility. The lab is downstairs. I’ll have the front desk schedule you. It shouldn’t take long. And frankly, Melvenia, delaying this won't make things better. It only postpones potential problems.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. But you’re making me very anxious, you know. And I really do need those forms signed. Just… please tell me how long it will take. And which lab downstairs? The one near the gift shop or the one by the elevators? I always get confused. And… and will they be able to tell me if I can still play bridge? .
DOCTOR: The one by the elevators. It should take about an hour for the results. They won’t be able to tell you if you can play bridge, Melvenia. I will. After I review the results. Go downstairs and tell them Dr. Osterholm ordered blood work and an EKG. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
