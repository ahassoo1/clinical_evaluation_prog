DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, frankly, I haven’t the time for this. But my daughter insisted. It’s… my vision, and my hearing. They’ve just… gone. Not completely, you understand, but…diminished. It's terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Julie. It is inconvenient when things don't work quite right. Diminished vision and hearing… alright. Let's start with the vision. When did you first notice it getting worse?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven’t the faintest idea. Some time ago, I suppose. It’s not as though I spend my days cataloging the precise moments of my decline, Doctor. It just… happened. A gradual fading. Though, now that I think about it... perhaps around the spring? Or was it summer? Really, it's all a blur. I have a very busy schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, a busy schedule certainly makes it hard to keep track. Spring or summer… that gives us a rough idea. And would you say it's both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Both. Is this really necessary? I’m a surgeon, you know. Pediatric surgery, no less. I notice things. It’s both eyes. And it's… blurry. Everything is a bit… washed out. It’s dreadfully annoying when trying to read important documents. Though, my staff handles most of that these days, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, blurry vision in both eyes, noticeable since around spring or summer. And it's interfering with reading. Good to know you've noticed it yourself, and that your staff is helping. Now, about your hearing… is that also a gradual change, or did it come on more suddenly?
PATIENT: Suddenly. Definitely suddenly. Though, I suppose it wasn't instantaneous. It's just... one day I realized I wasn't quite hearing everything. People were mumbling, you see. Or perhaps they are mumbling. It's difficult to tell these days. My ex-husband was always rather quiet, so perhaps it’s a habit. Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the patience for a detailed auditory examination.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. Sudden hearing changes can be concerning. And it is difficult to tell if people are mumbling, or if our hearing is just a little off. Okay. Let's do a quick check of both your vision and hearing, just to get a baseline. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: If you must. But do be quick, Doctor. I have a luncheon. And frankly, I’m not particularly fond of being poked and prodded. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. I'll be as quick as possible. If you could just sit here for me, we'll start with your vision. I'll have you read some letters on this chart, starting with the top row.
PATIENT: Very well. But I warn you, Doctor, if these letters are too small, I simply won’t be able to decipher them. My eyesight, while diminished, is still quite respectable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. We'll start with the larger letters. Can you read the first letter for me, please?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. It’s… it’s an ‘E’. A very poorly drawn ‘E’, I might add. Is this the best you have?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And the next one?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor. It’s a ‘P’. An absolutely dreadful ‘P’. I can see perfectly well it’s a ‘P’, but this is a waste of my time. Are we quite finished with this charade?
DOCTOR: Alright. And this one, Ms. Julie?
PATIENT: I… I can’t make it out. It’s just a blur. See? I told you my vision was diminished. It's utterly useless trying to decipher these minuscule scribbles. Honestly, Doctor, this is proving quite stressful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. That’s enough for now. We can document that you’re having difficulty reading the smaller letters on the chart. Now, let’s take a quick look in your ears. This will help me get an idea of what might be going on with your hearing. Just relax, and I’ll gently place this instrument in your ear.
PATIENT: Oh, lovely. Another instrument. Are you certain this is hygienic, Doctor? I simply cannot abide germs. Proceed with caution, and do be quick about it. I have a very important luncheon, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Julie. Everything is thoroughly sterilized, I assure you. Hmm… There appears to be a bit of cerumen buildup in your ear canal. It’s not excessive, but it could be contributing to your difficulty hearing. And the same on this side. A bit of wax buildup in both ears. It's a common issue, Ms. Julie. Often, it resolves on its own, but sometimes it needs to be removed.
PATIENT: Wax buildup? Is that all? Honestly, Doctor, I expected something far more… dramatic. I'm a surgeon, you know. I deal with far more complex issues on a daily basis. So, wax. How utterly… pedestrian. And what are you proposing we do about this “wax,” Doctor? I certainly don’t intend to spend my afternoon having my ears cleaned. I have a luncheon, you know. A very important luncheon.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. It is a simple issue, but it can certainly affect your hearing. We have a few options. We could try a simple over-the-counter earwax removal kit. Or, if you prefer, I can gently remove it for you here in the office. It only takes a few minutes. I wouldn’t recommend leaving it untreated, as it could worsen your hearing. But ultimately, the decision is yours.
PATIENT: An over-the-counter kit? Absolutely not. I refuse to poke around in my own ears with… whatever those things contain. And you expect me to sit here while you poke around in my ears? Doctor, honestly! Just… tell me what I need to do to make this luncheon bearable. If removing the wax is the quickest option, then I suppose I’ll allow it. But be quick about it, and please, be gentle. And don't tell me about the fascinating intricacies of earwax removal. I haven't the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. We’ll go ahead and remove the wax. It will only take a few minutes, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’ll use a small, curved instrument and gentle suction to remove the wax. You might feel a slight pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. We’ll start with your right ear.
PATIENT: Just… hurry, Doctor. This is most unpleasant. And please, try not to make a mess. I’m wearing a very expensive silk blouse. Is this… is this normal? It feels rather… invasive. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about with medicine these days.
DOCTOR: It is normal to feel a slight sensation of pressure, Ms. Julie. And yes, it can feel a bit invasive, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’m being very careful to avoid any discomfort. There we go. A little more… And I’m certainly taking care to avoid making a mess. Almost finished with this ear… Just a few more seconds.
PATIENT: Oh! That’s… better. A little disconcerting, but… better. Is it… is it really finished? It felt rather… thorough. Honestly, I’m surprised you haven’t punctured my eardrum. Now, get on with the other one, Doctor. I haven't all day, you know. And please, be even more careful this time. My luncheon awaits.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. We’ll proceed with the left ear now. And I assure you, I’m being extremely careful to avoid any discomfort. The eardrum is quite protected. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any pressure. There we go. A little more… Almost finished with this ear now. Just a few more seconds. And we’re finished. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Hmm… decidedly better. Not perfect, mind you, but… clearer. I can actually hear you without straining. A small miracle, really. Honestly, I don't understand why my hearing deteriorated in the first place. I haven't spent my life listening to loud music, you know. So, what now, Doctor? Am I cured? Can I finally enjoy my luncheon without having to ask everyone to repeat themselves?
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear your hearing is improved, Ms. Julie. Removing the wax often makes a significant difference. You're not cured, per se, but your hearing should be much better now. Wax buildup can happen again over time, so it's something to keep an eye on. I recommend avoiding using cotton swabs in your ears, as they can actually push the wax further in. I also recommend following up with an audiologist for a formal hearing test. They can assess your hearing levels and provide further recommendations. And finally, if you notice any sudden changes in your hearing, or experience any pain, please let me know immediately. Otherwise, you should be able to enjoy your luncheon without any trouble. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: An audiologist? Really, Doctor. Another appointment? I haven’t the time for endless tests and procedures. My schedule is quite full, you know. And as for the cotton swabs… honestly. I’ve been using them for years without any ill effects. I suppose I can try to avoid them, but I make no promises. No, Doctor, I believe that is quite enough for now. You’ve poked around in my ears, removed some wax, and subjected me to a rather lengthy explanation. I think I’ve endured enough for one afternoon. I suppose I’ll see what happens with my luncheon. And if my hearing deteriorates again, I’ll… consider scheduling another appointment. Perhaps. Thank you for your… assistance, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Julie. I understand your busy schedule. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And enjoy your luncheon! Have a good day.
