DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, my niece… she’s trying to get her paperwork done to come live here from over in… well, I think it was Honduras, maybe? And I understand there are certain shots she needs to get before the government will approve everything. I'm hoping you can tell me what those are and if she’ll need any special ones. It’s a bit confusing, all this immigration stuff.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. It is often confusing, and you’re right to be proactive about ensuring she has the appropriate vaccinations. It's very responsible of you. To best advise you, could you tell me her age, if you know it?
PATIENT: Let me think… she’s… well, I believe she just turned twenty-one in June. Yes, that’s right. Twenty-one. She’s a lovely girl, very eager to start a new life here. It's been hard for her, living where she does.
DOCTOR: Okay, twenty-one years old. That’s helpful. Generally, for adults immigrating to the United States, the CDC recommends verification of immunity or vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella, varicella , pertussis , tetanus, diphtheria, and polio. Hepatitis A and influenza are also often recommended, and depending on her history, we may consider hepatitis B. Do you happen to know if she’s had any vaccinations previously, perhaps in Honduras?
PATIENT: I… honestly, Doctor, I don't know. She hasn’t talked much about it. Things are… different there, you understand. Access to doctors and things isn’t always easy. I think she might have gotten some when she was little, but I truly couldn't say for certain which ones. Is there a way to… find out? Or do we just have to assume she needs them all? I wouldn't want to put her through unnecessary shots if she’s already protected.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Skarbek. It’s very common to have incomplete records in these situations. We can certainly proceed cautiously. The most accurate way would be to perform a blood test, called a titer test, to check her immunity levels for each of these diseases. This will tell us definitively which vaccinations she still needs. Alternatively, we could proceed with a series of vaccinations, but that’s not ideal if she’s already immune. Given her age and potential gaps in records, I recommend the titer test first. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A blood test sounds… sensible. Yes, that sounds much better than just giving her shots she might not need. It’s just… will that take a long time? She’s hoping to get this all sorted out as quickly as possible so she can come live with my daughter and her family. We've already waited so long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the timeline, Mr. Skarbek. The blood test itself is relatively quick – about 15-20 minutes for the draw. However, the lab typically takes 3-5 business days to return the results. We can expedite the request if possible, though that’s not always guaranteed. While we're waiting for the results, we can also discuss her medical history in more detail. Have you or she experienced any significant illnesses or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: That… three to five days isn’t terrible. Alright, let’s do the blood test. Expediting it would be wonderful, if you can. As for illnesses… hmm. She had a bad bout of the flu a few years ago, I remember that. She was quite sick for a while. Nothing else comes to mind immediately. She’s generally a healthy girl, very strong. She worked on her family's farm, so she was always busy, always active.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. A history of the flu is good information. And it’s reassuring to hear she’s generally healthy and active. We’ll also want to ask about any allergies she may have, to medications or anything else. Does she know of any allergies?
PATIENT: That’s a good point. Allergies… you know, she did mention once that she got a terrible rash when she wore a certain kind of jewelry. A gold necklace, I think it was. But other than that, I don't believe she's ever had any reactions to food or medications. She's not one for taking many pills, if she can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a reaction to a gold necklace – that suggests a possible contact dermatitis allergy. We’ll make a note of that. It’s good to know she doesn’t take many medications, as that simplifies things. Now, to proceed with the blood test, I'll need to get a little more information. First, what is her date of birth, if you happen to know it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me think… She was born on… April 12th, 2004. Yes, that’s right. April 12th, 2004. She's a spring baby, always full of energy. She’s a good girl, Doctor. Really good. I’m just so worried about getting everything right for her. This whole process is… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: April 12th, 2004. Thank you, Mr. Skarbek. And you’re doing great. It's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed, and I appreciate you taking the time to provide this information. Okay, I've entered her information into the system. Now, I'll have my nurse, Maria, come in and draw the blood samples. She'll explain the process to you and answer any questions you may have. It usually takes about ten minutes, and she'll send the results to the lab right away. While we wait, do you have any other concerns or questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Maria, you say? Yes, that's fine. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being so patient and understanding. This has been… a weight off my mind, honestly. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. It's my pleasure. I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. Maria will be in shortly. I’ll review the results as soon as they come back and we’ll discuss the next steps. Please don’t hesitate to ask if anything comes to mind before you leave.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. You have a good day now.
