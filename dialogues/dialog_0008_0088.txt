DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been… annoying me for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. That’s… tinnitus, medically speaking. And when you say "a bit now," could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Right, tinnitus. Sorry, I don’t really know all the fancy names. Um… maybe like, three weeks? It started after a wedding, there was pretty loud music. It hasn’t gone away since.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, starting after a wedding with loud music… that gives me some ideas. Is the ringing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly constant, yeah. Sometimes it’s quieter, like I barely notice it if there’s other noise going on. But when it's quiet… that’s when it really gets to me. It's like a high-pitched whine, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a high-pitched whine, constant with lessening during louder background noise. Have you noticed it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly my right ear, I think. It's hard to say for sure, sometimes it feels like it's both, but definitely more noticeable on that side.
DOCTOR: Alright, more noticeable in the right ear. Any other symptoms along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’ve been working a lot. No dizziness or anything like that. Just the ringing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, just the ringing and a bit of fatigue related to work. Have you been exposed to any other loud noises recently, besides the wedding?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Just the usual restaurant noise at work, you know? It's a bit loud, but nothing compared to the wedding. I wear earplugs sometimes when cleaning up, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good that you're using earplugs when cleaning. Let's do a quick examination of your ears, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright… I'm looking at your ear canals now. Everything looks clear, no wax buildup or signs of infection. The eardrum looks normal as well. I'm going to do a quick hearing test, just a simple one, to see if we can identify any hearing loss. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, test completed. The results show a slight high-frequency hearing loss in your right ear, which is consistent with noise-induced hearing loss. Given your history with the wedding and the tinnitus, that’s what I suspect is going on here. It’s common after exposure to loud noises. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking anything. Just a multivitamin, if that counts.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I’m pretty good with everything, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. Okay, so the plan is this: noise-induced hearing loss is likely, and often improves over time. I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible. Continue using earplugs when you're in a noisy environment. I'm going to recommend an over-the-counter supplement called Gingko Biloba, some people find that helpful for tinnitus, although the evidence is mixed. If it doesn't improve after a month, or if the ringing gets worse, or you experience any dizziness or hearing loss, come back and see me, and we can consider a referral to an audiologist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. I can try the Gingko Biloba. Avoiding loud noises is probably smart anyway. A month, and then come back if it’s worse. Got it. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'll write up a note with those instructions, and the recommendation for the Gingko Biloba. We'll also document the hearing test results. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I appreciate it. I should probably get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, you're very welcome, Jaylyne. Here’s the note. Get in touch if anything changes. Have a good day, and take care of your ears! .
PATIENT: Thanks again, Doctor. You too. Bye!
