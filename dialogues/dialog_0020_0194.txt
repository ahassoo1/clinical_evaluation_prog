DOCTOR: Good morning, Terasa. My name is Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, was it? Yes… well, it’s this ear trouble, really. Comes and goes, you see. And the spinning… awful spinning. It feels like the room is just… tilting. My daughter, Lani, she’s the one who made the appointment, actually. She worries so. And, um… my husband, he had something similar, years ago. That's why Lani pushed for me to come in. It's all a bit fuzzy, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, "Beinborn" is correct. Ear trouble and dizziness… I understand. It sounds concerning, especially with the spinning sensation. It's good Lani encouraged you to come in, and helpful to know about your husband's history. Just to clarify, when did this start?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That’s… hard to say exactly. It's been coming and going for… months, I think? Maybe six months? Longer? It’s not constant, thankfully. There’ll be a few days where I feel alright, and then it hits me again. A fullness in my ear, then the room starts to… well, you know. It’s all a bit mixed up in my head, I’m afraid. I wish I could be more precise. It’s just… time gets away from you, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It absolutely does. Don’t worry about being precise; we’ll piece it together. So, several months, with periods of feeling okay in between. You mentioned fullness in your ear – is that on one side or both?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It feels… mostly in my right ear. Yes, definitely more noticeable in the right one. Sometimes it feels blocked, like there’s cotton in it. And then the spinning starts. Not always, but often. It makes walking… difficult. I have to hold onto things, you see. Don't want to fall. It's scary when it happens quickly. I just hope it’s not… serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, right ear fullness and the spinning sensation… that’s helpful. And it happens in episodes, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, episodes. That’s a good word for it. It doesn’t last all day, thank goodness. It comes in waves, you see? Maybe an hour or two, sometimes a bit longer. Then it fades away. And then, a few days or a week later… it’ll come back again. It's unpredictable, which is the worst part. Makes it hard to plan things, you know? I used to love gardening, but I'm afraid to be too far from the house now, just in case.
DOCTOR: I understand. Episodic, unpredictable vertigo… and understandably, it’s impacting your daily life. We'll try to figure out what's causing this so we can manage it better. Let's talk about other things you may be experiencing. Have you noticed any hearing loss in either ear?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… hmm. That's a tricky one. I suppose… maybe a little bit? People don't shout at me, not usually. But I do sometimes have trouble hearing when there's a lot of background noise. Like at church, for example. Or when the television is low. But I just thought… well, I'm getting older, aren’t I? It's probably just my age. I haven't noticed anything sudden, if that makes sense. Just… gradual. It's hard to tell, really. My ears ring sometimes too, a high-pitched whine. Is that related?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful information. The gradual hearing loss and the ringing in your ears – that’s called tinnitus – could definitely be related. It's good you mentioned that. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with these episodes of dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes, sometimes. Not every time, mind you. But when the spinning gets really bad, I get terribly sick. A queasy feeling first, then… well, you know. I have to lie down, close my eyes, and just try to ride it out. It usually passes after a bit, but it’s very unpleasant. It makes me quite weak afterwards too. My daughter, Lani, she always brings me a cool cloth and a glass of water when it happens. She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: It's good you have Lani to help you. Nausea and vomiting with the dizziness is important to note. Now, let's quickly go through some other things. Any headaches associated with this?
PATIENT: Headaches… not usually, no. I get the occasional one, like anyone, but not with the ear trouble. They're more… tension headaches, I suppose. From worrying, maybe? Or sitting at the computer too long. But no, the dizziness doesn't bring on headaches, and the headaches don’t seem to trigger the dizziness. They’re separate things, as far as I can tell. Though, everything feels connected when I'm not feeling well, doesn't it? It all just blurs together.
DOCTOR: You're right, it often does. Okay, last few quick questions. Have you noticed any stiffness in your neck, or any visual disturbances – like blurry vision or double vision – during these episodes?
PATIENT: Stiffness… hmm. I might have a little ache in my neck sometimes, but I don't think it’s related. I get aches and pains all over, to be honest. Old age, you know. And visual disturbances… no, not that I've noticed. Everything looks… normal. Maybe a little wobbly when I'm spinning, but that’s just the room moving, isn't it? No blurry vision, no double vision. I can still read my gardening magazines, perfectly fine. I think that's everything, isn't it? I'm getting a bit tired now, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: No, that’s very thorough, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to answer all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears, eyes, and do some balance tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Balance tests… well, I suppose that makes sense. I’m not very steady on my feet these days, but maybe you can figure out what’s wrong. Just… be gentle, please? And don’t take too long. I have a bit of an appointment later this afternoon. Not important, but still…
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s take a look at your ears with this instrument. It’s called an otoscope. Hmm… the ear canal looks clear. The eardrum itself… appears slightly retracted and a little bit cloudy. Now, let’s check your left ear. This ear looks normal. Good. Now, I'm going to check your eye movements. Just follow my finger with your eyes, and don’t move your head. Finally, I’m going to do a quick Romberg test. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Standing up… yes, here we go. A little wobbly… you see? I always feel a bit unsteady. What do I do now? Just… stand here? And not move? It’s hard, you know, not to sway. I feel like I’m going to fall over.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Just stand as comfortably as you can, and if you feel unsteady, please let me know, and I’ll help you sit back down. Keep your eyes open for now. Okay, you can sit back down now. Thank you. That was helpful.
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. It's always a bit scary, standing up like that. My legs… they're not what they used to be. So, what did you find? Is it something serious? I really hope it's not… I don't want to end up in a wheelchair, you know. It's probably just old age, isn’t it? Everything's falling apart.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you're getting it checked out. Based on the examination, the otoscope showed some retraction and cloudiness of your right eardrum. Your eye movements also showed a slight nystagmus, and the Romberg test indicated some balance instability. These findings, along with your history of episodic dizziness, fullness in your right ear, and tinnitus, point towards a possible issue with your inner ear. Specifically, it could be a condition called Meniere's disease, or vestibular neuritis. However, it's important to note that this is just a preliminary assessment, and we need further testing to confirm the diagnosis. Meniere's disease affects the inner ear and can cause episodes of dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. Vestibular neuritis is an inflammation of the vestibular nerve, which affects balance. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a hearing test – an audiogram – and possibly an MRI scan of your head. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Meniere's disease… and vestibular… whatever that was. It sounds… serious. Is it curable? Will I have to have surgery? I’m not good with hospitals, you know. And an MRI… is that safe? I’ve heard things… A hearing test, alright, I suppose. I can manage that. And the MRI… well, if you think it's necessary. But please, explain everything carefully. I get confused easily, and I don’t want to make any rash decisions. And will it take long? I have that appointment later, remember?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you hear these terms. Let's take it one step at a time. Meniere’s disease isn’t curable in the traditional sense, but it's very manageable with treatment. Treatment focuses on reducing the frequency and severity of the episodes and minimizing the impact on your quality of life. Often, this involves dietary changes, medications to control the dizziness and nausea, and sometimes, physical therapy to improve your balance. Surgery is rarely needed. Vestibular neuritis can sometimes resolve on its own, or it may require medications to reduce the inflammation and physical therapy. Regarding the MRI, it’s a very safe procedure. It uses magnetic waves to create detailed images of your brain and inner ear. There are no ionizing radiations involved. We will be very careful to screen you for any contraindications, like pacemakers or metal implants. The scan itself typically takes about 30-60 minutes. I’ll write the orders for the hearing test and MRI now. The hearing test can usually be scheduled within a few days, and we can get the MRI arranged quickly as well. It shouldn’t interfere with your afternoon appointment. I’m also going to prescribe you some medication to help with the dizziness and nausea, to use as needed. And I’ll give you some information sheets about both Meniere’s disease and vestibular neuritis, so you can read more about them at your own pace. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… better, I suppose. Knowing there's medication to help is a relief. And no surgery… that's good. Information sheets… yes, that would be helpful. I like to be prepared. So, I’ll get the hearing test and MRI scheduled, and then come back to see you? And you’ll tell me what’s wrong? It’s just… everything feels so uncertain, you know? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. You'll get the hearing test and MRI, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in detail. We’ll go through everything step-by-step, and I’ll explain the findings and discuss the best course of treatment for you. I understand it's unsettling to feel uncertain, but we'll work through this together. It may take some time to figure out what's going on, but we’ll get there. In the meantime, if you experience any severe dizziness, vomiting, or hearing loss, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here are the prescriptions, the information sheets, and the orders for the tests. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I'll get the tests scheduled right away. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Thank you again. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns at all. And remember, we're here to support you. You have a good day as well, and please take care. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
