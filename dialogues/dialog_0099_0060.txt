DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor Overgaard. It’s…family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. A lot of…problems. Heart stuff, mainly. And cancer. It’s just…I want to make sure I don’t end up the same way. Preventative stuff, you know? I’d rather know what I’m up against, if anything.
DOCTOR: Preventative care is…sensible, I suppose. Though often people worry unnecessarily. Still. Heart problems and cancer, you say. On your mother’s side. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Okay. My grandmother, on that side, died of…I think it was colon cancer. Pretty quickly, from what I understand. And my uncle…he had a heart attack a few years back. He was only…fifty-two, I think. And my mother…she has high blood pressure. Really high. Always on medication for it. It’s just…it feels like a ticking time bomb, honestly. I try to eat well, I really do, but…you know genes, right? They’re not something you can just fix with a salad.
DOCTOR: Genes are…a factor, certainly. Though lifestyle plays a significantly larger role than most people appreciate. Alright. So, grandmother with colon cancer, uncle with a heart attack at fifty-two, mother with hypertension. Do you know if your uncle had any other risk factors?
PATIENT: Risk factors? Like what? He…smoked, I think. A lot. And he wasn't exactly a health nut, if you catch my drift. Fast food, didn’t exercise…the whole nine yards, really. He wasn’t very…disciplined, let's put it that way. My mother…she tries, but stress gets to her, you know? Work, family…it's a lot. She's not as bad as him, thankfully. But still. It’s…concerning.
DOCTOR: Smoking is…unfortunate. And stress, while unpleasant, is rarely a primary cause of serious illness. Alright. And what about you, Mr. Theriot?
PATIENT: Me? What do you mean, “what about me”? I told you, I try to eat well. I don’t smoke, I don’t drink excessively…I work a desk job, so it’s not like I’m doing manual labor. I'm fairly active on weekends, hiking, that sort of thing. I’m not exactly a picture of perfect health, but I’m not actively trying to kill myself, if that’s what you’re getting at. I just want to know if I need to…worry. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not “so much to ask.” It simply strikes me as…unnecessary anxiety, given your age and apparent lifestyle. However. We can proceed with a basic assessment. First, let’s get some vitals. Blood pressure, heart rate, weight, height…standard procedure. And then we’ll discuss some…screening options. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Fine. Vitals, whatever. Allergies? No, not that I know of. I haven't had to take much in the way of medication, thankfully. Though…I think I had a slight reaction to penicillin as a kid, but it was ages ago, barely remember it. Is that important? Honestly, I just want to get this over with. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: A childhood reaction to penicillin is…potentially relevant. We’ll make a note of it. Alright, let's get this over with then. If you could just roll up your sleeve and step on the scale, please. I'll need your weight and height first. And then we’ll check your blood pressure. Don't worry, it won't take long.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is all very…low-tech. I expected more. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. 181 centimeters, 60 kilograms. Blood pressure is…128 over 84. Heart rate is 72. Within normal limits. However. Your weight is…rather low for your height. Do you have any…concerns about your appetite or weight loss?
PATIENT: Low? I’m perfectly healthy! I eat just fine. I’m just…naturally slim, okay? Some people are built different. It’s not a disease, Doctor. Honestly, this is starting to feel…patronizing. Are we going to actually do something, or are you just going to comment on my physique?
DOCTOR: Very well. We can proceed. Given your family history and your…apparent preoccupation with preventative care, I suppose a lipid panel and a basic metabolic panel are warranted. We’ll also order a complete blood count. And, given your low weight, I’d like to rule out any underlying…issues. I'll write the orders now. You'll need to have some blood drawn. The lab is just down the hall. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Seriously? All this for…nothing? I told you, I'm fine. But…fine. If you insist. What exactly will these tests tell you? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks. I have a busy schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: The tests will provide a baseline assessment of your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and overall blood health. It's…standard procedure, Mr. Theriot. And it's hardly “for nothing.” It allows us to identify any potential issues before they become…serious. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours. We’ll contact you when they’re available. Here. Take this to the lab. They’ll draw the blood. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Blood tests. Fine. Just…don't bother calling me with anything trivial, okay? If something’s actually wrong, I expect a phone call. Otherwise, I’m perfectly capable of managing my own…anxiety. Honestly, this whole experience has been…underwhelming. .
DOCTOR: As you wish, Mr. Theriot. Some people...
