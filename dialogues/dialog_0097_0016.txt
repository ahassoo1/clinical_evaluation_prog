DOCTOR: Hi Nicky, welcome! It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s… alright to meet you, I suppose. It’s about my bruising. Seems to be getting worse, despite being on that… blood thinner the other doctor prescribed. Honestly, I don’t see what good these things are if they don’t do anything. I bumped my arm yesterday, just a little thing, and it’s already the size of a grapefruit. It's quite concerning, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that seems to be worsening even with a blood thinner is definitely something we need to look into. And it’s good you're voicing your concerns – it’s important to understand what’s going on and whether the medication is the right fit for you. Just to be clear, what kind of doctor prescribed the blood thinner, and do you remember the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Honestly, all doctors seem the same to me these days. A general practitioner, I think. Old man Henderson, before he… retired. As for the name… no, not a clue. Little blue pill, I believe? They all look the same, don’t they? I just take what they tell me. Though, as I said, it doesn’t seem to be doing much good. And I'm a bit tired of looking like I’ve been in a fight.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small blue pill… that helps us narrow it down, though many medications are blue. We can look through your records to see what Dr. Henderson prescribed. Do you happen to know why he put you on the blood thinner in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Now you want to know why? It was… something about my heart, I believe. A flutter, or an irregular beat. Something like that. He said it was to prevent… clots. Or a stroke, perhaps? Honestly, Doctor, I was half asleep during the explanation. It’s all rather technical, and I’m not a young man anymore to be remembering these things. Just fix the bruising, please. That's all I really care about.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nicky. It is a lot to take in. And you’re right to focus on what’s bothering you most – the bruising. Knowing the reason for the blood thinner is just helpful to make sure we’re on the right track, and to assess if it’s still the best option for you. So, to clarify, you’ve been taking this blue pill for a heart condition, to prevent clots or stroke… and you’ve noticed the bruising has been getting worse despite being on the medication?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Worse! I haven’t even fallen recently. Just a little bump, like I said. Barely noticeable. And suddenly, boom! A purple mess. It’s embarrassing, really. And it aches. I used to be able to handle a little knock without ending up looking like I went ten rounds with a boxer. This medicine… it’s probably doing more harm than good, if you ask me. It's interfering with my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bruising easily, even with minor injuries, and experiencing pain along with it. That’s definitely concerning, and we need to investigate this further. Let me ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any other unusual bleeding – like nosebleeds, bleeding gums when you brush your teeth, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No, thank goodness. Just the bruising. And it's not like I'm constantly covered in them, it just... seems to be getting easier to bruise. And bigger, naturally. I haven't noticed anything else. My gums are fine, and… well, I try not to look too closely when I… use the facilities. It’s unpleasant enough as it is, without checking for things like that. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a retired engineer, not a medical professional. I expect things to work properly, not cause problems.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Nicky. And you’re right to expect things to work as they should. You’re not expected to be a medical professional, and I appreciate you telling me everything you’ve noticed. Okay, so no other unusual bleeding aside from the bruising. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better look at the bruising and check for any other clues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it doesn’t take all day. I have a rather important… gardening appointment later. Though at this rate, I may have to cancel. I can barely lift my arm as it is. Just be quick about it, please. And try not to poke too much. It aches, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nicky. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I promise. We'll just take a look at the bruising and do a brief general exam. If you could just lie down on the table, please?
PATIENT: Alright. But be warned, Doctor, I'm not known for my patience. And if you ask me to move my arm, I may have to protest. It’s rather tender. Honestly, it feels like I’ve been hit by a truck. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a look. Hmm, this is quite extensive, and it does look tender to the touch. I’m also noting some discoloration on your skin elsewhere, have you noticed this before?
PATIENT: Discoloration? Where? Honestly, I haven't been looking at myself that closely lately. I'm a retired engineer, not a fashion model. Is it… bad? Are you saying I have some sort of terrible disease now? I knew I should have just stayed home and tended to my tomatoes. This is turning into a disaster. Don't tell me I need blood tests. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: No, no, it's not necessarily a terrible disease, please don't worry. It's just some mild discoloration that I’m noticing on your lower legs. It could be related to the bruising, or something else entirely. I just want to rule things out. And you’re right to mention the needles, nobody enjoys those. We might need to do some blood tests just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, but we'll discuss that in a moment. I'm also checking your pulses and listening to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear so far. Just a few more quick checks…
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it's quick. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel quite faint. Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening again? Perhaps a special cream? Or a bandage? I'm not particularly fond of this whole examination process. It’s quite undignified. And frankly, a bit alarming. Are you sure you’re a doctor? You seem… awfully young. No offense intended, of course.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your concern, Nicky, and I understand this is a bit unsettling. I assure you, I am a fully qualified doctor. And it's perfectly normal to feel a bit faint during medical examinations. I'm being careful, and we can take breaks if you need them. Regarding preventing further bruising, a special cream or bandage wouldn’t be very effective in this case. We need to figure out why you’re bruising so easily first. That's why the blood tests might be helpful – they can give us a lot of information. Okay, everything else seems normal, but the bruising is concerning enough that I want to get some blood work done. It will help us rule out any underlying causes and make sure you’re on the right medication. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… of course. Why wouldn’t it be blood tests? It’s always blood tests. Honestly, Doctor, is there anything you can do without drawing blood? It’s the most barbaric practice in all of medicine. Fine. Do your blood tests. But make it quick, and please, don’t use a huge needle. And don’t tell me it won’t hurt. I know it will hurt. Just get it over with. And afterwards, I’m going straight home to my tomatoes. They are far less traumatic.
DOCTOR: I understand your aversion to blood tests, Nicky. And I promise I’ll do everything I can to make it as quick and painless as possible. We use the smallest gauge needle we can, and the phlebotomist is very experienced. I'll also let you know exactly what we’re testing for. We'll need to check your complete blood count, your clotting factors, and possibly some liver function tests. These tests will help us determine if there’s a problem with your blood cells, your ability to clot, or if there's any underlying issue causing the bruising. I’m ordering the tests now, and the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just get it over with. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to regret coming here at all. This has been a complete waste of time. And if those tests show nothing, I'm finding another doctor. One who understands that a little bump shouldn't turn into a purple mess. A very small mess, mind you. It's not that big. Still. No. No more discussion. Just… the tests. And then, I’m going home. To my tomatoes. They don’t require blood tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Nicky, and I apologize if I’ve added to your discomfort. I assure you, we’re doing everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. The nurse, Maria, should be with you shortly to draw your blood. She’ll explain the process, and you can let her know if you’re feeling anxious or have any concerns. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and will contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any heavy bleeding, dizziness, or severe pain, please don't hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Now, let me just step out and let Maria come in.
