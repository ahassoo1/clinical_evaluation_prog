DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ to you too, Dr. Asami. Real pleasure. Well, I reckon I'm here for what they’re callin’ a men’s health check-up, tryin’ to keep things tickin’ along as long as possible, you know? At my age, seems like a good idea. I’m Londell, by the way, though I suppose you already knew that.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Londell. Good to officially meet you. That’s a very sensible idea, taking proactive steps with your health. It's excellent that you're thinking ahead. A men’s health check-up is a great starting point. Alright, let’s start with a little bit of background. I see you're 69 years old, and a member of the Cherokee Nation – thank you for sharing that with me. And your height and weight are listed as 5’3” and 150 pounds, is that still accurate?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s all pretty spot on. Five foot three, give or take a hair, and ‘round 150 pounds these days. Used to be a bit more muscle on me, but time ain't been kind to that part. Not much gettin’ done these days that requires a whole lot of strength, mostly just etchings.
DOCTOR: Etchings, that’s wonderful! A very skilled and delicate craft. It’s good to stay active, even if it's not the physical kind. So, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Mostly, yes. I’d say I’m doin’ alright. Some aches and pains, you know, the usual wear and tear. Nothing that keeps me from workin’ on my pieces, thankfully. Sleep’s not always the best, sometimes I’m up a bit in the middle of the night, but I manage. I get tired easier than I used to, that’s for sure. And my eyesight ain’t what it once was, but I’ve got glasses for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, aches and pains, some trouble with sleep, and increased fatigue – all very common as we get older. And you’ve addressed the vision, which is good. Let's dig a little deeper into these symptoms. When did you start noticing this increased fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It’s been gradual, really. Maybe… six months or so ago? Started noticin’ I’d get tuckered out after a long day at the bench. Used to be able to work late into the night, but now I’m pretty much done by seven or eight. It’s not like I’m runnin’ marathons, but it’s definitely a change. My wife, bless her heart, she noticed it before I did. She always did have a keen eye.
DOCTOR: It’s good you have someone who looks out for you, Londell. Spouses often notice these changes first. And six months is a reasonable timeframe. Is this fatigue constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s more consistent now, but at first it was kinda… spotty. Some days I felt fine, others I’d be draggin’ by noon. Lately, it’s pretty much there all the time, just… a low-level weariness. It don't really hit me hard, just… always present. Makes it hard to concentrate sometimes, too. I find myself havin' to re-do lines more often, which is a pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent, low-level fatigue with some difficulty concentrating. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s broaden things a bit. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the fatigue – things like weight loss, fever, chills, night sweats, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever or chills, definitely not. No night sweats either. Weight’s been pretty stable, maybe lost a pound or two, but nothin’ drastic. Bowel habits… well, they ain’t what they used to be, if you catch my drift. A little constipated more often than I’d like, but I manage with a little somethin’ extra in my diet now and then. That’s about it, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable weight with a little constipation, understandable at your age. Now, have you had any changes in your urinary habits – increased frequency, urgency, difficulty starting or stopping, or pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, a little bit. I get up more often at night to go to the bathroom than I used to. Not terribly often, mind you, but enough that it wakes me up sometimes. And sometimes it takes a bit longer to get things goin’, if you know what I mean. No pain, thankfully. Just… a bit of a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased nighttime urination and slight difficulty starting the flow. That’s good information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, maybe ten years ago. They put me on some pills for it, and I took ‘em regular for a few years. Doc took me off ‘em eventually, said my numbers were lookin’ good. Other than that… nothin’ major, knock on wood. I did have a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered from that just fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure that resolved with medication, and a bout of pneumonia in the past. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Always managed to avoid those, thankfully. I ain’t one for lettin’ folks cut on me if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… is there a family history of any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Well, my father had heart trouble. He passed away when he was in his early seventies from a heart attack. And my older brother, he had diabetes. He had it pretty bad, lost a foot to it, poor fella. My mother… she lived a long life, thankfully, but she did have some arthritis that bothered her a lot. As for prostate problems… I don’t rightly know. Nobody talked much about that sort of thing when I was growin’ up.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease and diabetes. And no known history of prostate problems. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Nope, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she used to smoke a little, but she quit years ago. Said it weren't good for her. Smart woman, that one was.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I have a beer with dinner now and then, maybe three or four a week. Nothing excessive, just to relax a bit. I don't drink to excess, never have. A man's gotta have some vices, right?
DOCTOR: Indeed. And finally, do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a baby aspirin every day, doc said it was good for my heart. And I take a little somethin’ for my constipation, a fiber supplement. That's about it. Oh, and sometimes I take somethin' for my aches and pains, ibuprofen when they get bad, but not regular-like.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Kammann, that’s a very thorough overview. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yep, that sounds fine to me, Doc. Whatever you think is best. Let’s get to it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit of a murmur, which isn’t uncommon at your age. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 85. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears look clear, nose is a little congested, throat looks normal. Now, I’ll palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or abnormalities. Finally, I’ll do a brief neurological exam. Reflexes are normal, muscle strength is good. Overall, the physical exam is fairly unremarkable, but your blood pressure is a little elevated, and you have some nasal congestion. I’d like to order some routine blood work to get a better picture of your overall health, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a PSA test to screen for prostate cancer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible to me, Doc. Blood work can’t hurt. And checkin’ for prostate stuff is probably a good idea, seein’ as how my dad never got that done. Yep, go ahead and do what you think is best. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do to prepare for it, like fastin' or somethin'.
DOCTOR: Excellent. You will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw – that means no food or drinks other than water. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning at the lab across the street. They’ll take about ten vials of blood. Here’s the requisition form and instructions for the fasting. And I’ll also give you a prescription for a medication to help with your constipation. It’s a gentle stool softener. Once the lab results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to address your elevated blood pressure, constipation, and fatigue. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Nope, don't think so. Everything sounds clear enough. Fast for twelve hours, stool softener… I can manage that. Thanks for bein’ so thorough, Doc. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen and run all those tests. Makes a fella feel a bit better just knowin' what's goin' on inside.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammann. That’s my job. I want you to feel comfortable and informed about your health. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and we’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Likewise, Doc. You have a good one too. I’ll see you when I hear back from the lab.
