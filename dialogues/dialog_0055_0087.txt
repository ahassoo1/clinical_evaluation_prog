DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I am Dr. Eaddy. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. The usual. Honestly, I don't really remember what they need it for. Medicare said I should come in, so here I am. If you could just… get it done, that’d be great. I have a… thing later.
DOCTOR: “The usual,” you say. Very well. While I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Croonquist, it's important for me to have a clear understanding of why you are having these labs performed. It helps ensure we’re focusing on the correct areas of your health. Medicare generally requires a reason for testing, and I, as your physician, need to be aware of the clinical picture. Do you recall if this is a follow-up to a specific condition or concern we’ve discussed previously?
PATIENT: Condition? Concern? Look, Doctor, I’m a… a power plant guy. I don't spend my time worrying about… things. I just want the blood drawn and a piece of paper for Medicare. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. Maybe it was for my… heart? I had a checkup… sometime. Does that help? It feels like ages ago. I really don't know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's see what the records indicate. Ah, yes. It appears you had a cardiovascular evaluation approximately six months ago, with some mildly elevated cholesterol levels noted. The order for these labs does stem from that evaluation; specifically, a lipid panel to recheck those levels, and a basic metabolic panel to assess kidney function as a precaution. Do you currently experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles, Mr. Croonquist?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. Not really. Sometimes a little… tightness, maybe? But that’s probably just from… lifting things at work. Ankles? No swelling. Short of breath… well, I get a little winded climbing stairs, but I'm… not a young man anymore, Doctor. I work with generators. It's loud. Sometimes it feels like my ears are full. Is that shortness of breath? Honestly, I’m not sure what counts. Just… get the blood taken, alright? The sooner I get out of here…
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the lab work. However, it’s important to document these symptoms, even if you consider them minor. The “fullness” in your ears is noteworthy; could be related to noise exposure at your workplace, which warrants further discussion regarding hearing protection. As for the tightness, while it may be musculoskeletal, we should rule out any cardiac involvement. I’d like to perform a brief physical examination before drawing blood. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and a check of your blood pressure, Mr. Croonquist. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, with all due respect… I’ve been working around heavy machinery for forty years. A little noise, a little tightness… that's just life. I don’t need a whole examination. Just the blood, please. I have a… a commitment. Really, the sooner this is over… I appreciate your concern, but honestly, I think I’m alright. Just… draw the blood.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, while I appreciate your resilience and understand your desire for expediency, as your physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your well-being. A basic examination takes only a few moments and can provide valuable information. Ignoring potential health concerns simply because you feel alright is not a prudent course of action. However, I am not here to force a procedure upon you. If you absolutely decline a physical exam, I will document your refusal. But please understand, this may limit my ability to provide the most accurate assessment of your health. Are you certain you wish to proceed only with the blood work, despite my recommendation?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Just… get it over with. Blood, then whatever quick thing you need to do. But quick, Doctor. Very quick. I really don’t have time for this. And… try not to poke too much. I bruise easily, apparently. Medicare told me something about that. Just… do it. Please. I just want to go.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed as you wish. I will keep the examination brief and efficient. Please have a seat and extend your arm. I will start with your blood pressure, and then listen to your heart and lungs. Afterward, we will proceed to the blood draw. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Just… hurry. It’s starting to make me nervous, all this poking around. And honestly, I've never been good with doctors. Never liked them much. Just… get it done.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a bit higher than optimal, 142 over 88. We can discuss that later. Now, if you’ll take a deep breath for me… I’m listening to your heart now. Breathing normally. And now your lungs. Take another deep breath… good. Lung sounds are clear, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s not immediately concerning, but it’s something we should monitor. It's a soft systolic murmur, grade 1/6. Now, let’s proceed to the blood draw. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol swabs?
PATIENT: Latex? No. I don’t think so. Alcohol… no. But I… I faint sometimes. Not often. But it's happened. I don’t like needles. I really don’t. Just… be quick, alright? And maybe have something… soft… nearby? Just in case. This is all making me… anxious. Please hurry.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. We will take extra precautions. The phlebotomist is very experienced, and we'll make sure you're comfortable throughout the process. We will have you lie down during the blood draw as a precaution, and I will remain here with you. Please let me know if anything seems amiss. And ensure Mr. Croonquist is well-supported. If you begin to feel lightheaded or unwell at any point, please let me know immediately. We will stop the procedure if necessary. Now, please lie back on the examination table. We'll get this done as quickly and comfortably as possible.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. I hate this. I really, really hate this. Please just… be quick. And… don’t look at me. It makes it worse. Just… do it.
DOCTOR: The phlebotomist will be starting the blood draw now, Mr. Croonquist. Try to focus on your breathing. Slow, deep breaths. It will be over before you know it. Let me know if you feel any discomfort. We’re here to help you through this.
PATIENT: Just… hurry… please… it feels cold… so cold… I don't like this… I really don't like this… Stop… just stop…
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist! Mr. Croonquist, can you hear me?
PATIENT: No… no… cold… too cold… dark…
DOCTOR: <stage>I kneel beside Mr. Croonquist, maintaining a firm grip on his wrist to check his pulse and monitor his level of consciousness. I call out his name repeatedly: “Mr. Croonquist, can you hear me?
PATIENT: .
