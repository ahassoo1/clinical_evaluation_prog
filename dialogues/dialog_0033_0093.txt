DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Redfern, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Chanz. Though, honestly, paperwork… it all kinda blurs together these days. Sleep's been… well, not great, so remembering things is a bit of a struggle. You’re Dr…? Sorry, the name’s slipping my mind already.
DOCTOR: Dechêne. Dr. Dechêne. And frankly, I find it… concerning that you can't recall basic information when seeking medical attention. Now, let's try to focus. Why are you here today?
PATIENT: Right, Dechêne. See? It does come back eventually. Look, I told the lady at the front, I guess. Sleep. It's just… not restful. And I feel… sluggish. Not like I have the energy I used to. Used to be able to work all day on instruments, no problem. Now? I need a nap halfway through tuning a piano. It’s… inconvenient, mostly. And probably not good for business, if I'm being honest. Though, what is good these days?
DOCTOR: Sluggishness… and sleep disturbance. Very well. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's... a good question. A while. Honestly? It's hard to pinpoint. Since… well, since she passed, I suppose. It’s been… a couple of years now? Everything sort of… runs together. It wasn’t immediate, you understand. It crept up on me. I just… stopped sleeping properly, and then I started feeling tired all the time. Before that, I was fine. Perfectly fine. Used to wake up ready to go, you know? Now… now it's just… getting through the day.
DOCTOR: Two years. And you attribute this to… a loss?
PATIENT: Yeah. Well, it’s… logical, isn’t it? Losing your wife… it takes it out of you. Though, two years? Shouldn’t I be… over it by now? People always say time heals all wounds. Sounds like a load of nonsense to me. I still… I still miss her cooking, mostly. She made a fantastic kibbeh. Anyway, I’m here because I’m tired. I want to feel normal again, if that makes any sense. Not… dragging myself around like a ghost. I need to be able to focus. My customers expect a certain… quality. And I can't deliver it if I'm half-asleep.
DOCTOR: Right. So, grief. We'll note that. Are you currently receiving any treatment for this… grief?
PATIENT: Treatment? No. What would I do, talk to someone? Honestly, that sounds… a bit ridiculous. I just… get on with it. Always have. Besides, who has time for that? I have instruments to fix. And frankly, dwelling on things doesn’t exactly help the sleep problem, does it? I tried a bit of chamomile tea, once. Didn't do a thing. I figured I’d just… power through it. But it's starting to affect my work, and that's… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to a more… practical assessment. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. I had a bit of a bad back once, lifting a cello, but that sorted itself out. The usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Nothing serious. I’m generally a healthy man. Always have been. Eat reasonably well, don't smoke, only a social drink now and then. I take Medicare, if that's what you mean. Though, I haven't exactly been to a doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Medicare. Noted. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I'm aware of. I mean, I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes during pollen season, but everyone does, don’t they? Nothing serious. No rashes, no breathing difficulties, no… anaphylactic shock or anything dramatic like that. I've always been pretty robust, to be honest. My wife… she had hay fever something awful. I always felt quite sorry for her. So, no. No allergies. Unless you count a mild aversion to paperwork, which I do. But I doubt that qualifies as a medical condition.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nope. Not a single one. I don’t believe in filling myself with… chemicals, if I can avoid it. I'll take a bit of aspirin if I have a headache, but that’s about it. My wife… she used to take something for her blood pressure, but that’s neither here nor there. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. A good night’s sleep, a healthy diet… that sort of thing. Though, clearly, the sleep part isn’t working out so well at the moment. Which is why I’m here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Lie down? Really? I haven't been on one of those since… well, a very long time. Is it absolutely necessary? I feel perfectly fine standing up. I mean, sluggish, yes, but not… incapacitated. But, alright. If you insist. Just try not to poke me too much, if you don't mind. And please, no surprises.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Redfern, I am a professional. Deep breaths, please. In… and out. Heart rate is… regular. Slightly elevated, but not concerning given your reported fatigue. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This may be slightly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Slightly uncomfortable? That doesn’t sound promising. Alright, go ahead. But be gentle, please. I have instruments to fix, you know. Can’t be having a damaged nerve. Ouch! See? That was uncomfortable. Is that normal? Everything feels a bit… jumbly, to be honest. Not the most relaxing experience, I must say.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… within normal limits. Though, slightly diminished. Again, not necessarily concerning given your reported fatigue and… lack of recent medical attention. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Blood pressure is 130/80. Acceptable. Well, Mr. Redfern, physically, there’s nothing immediately alarming. But your complaints of fatigue are… persistent. And your grief, as you’ve noted, is longstanding.
PATIENT: Persistent? That's one way to put it. It’s ruining my life, frankly. So, you’re saying there’s nothing wrong with me? That's… frustrating. I came here expecting a diagnosis, a solution, something. Not to be told I'm just… grieving. So what now? Am I supposed to just… carry on like this indefinitely? Because frankly, that doesn't sound very appealing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I am not dismissing your concerns. However, a simple physical examination will not reveal the cause of… emotional distress. Given the duration of your symptoms, and your… reluctance to seek psychological support, I recommend a series of blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue. We'll check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and complete blood count. In addition, I strongly suggest you consider a referral to a grief counselor. While I understand your reservations, prolonged grief can have a significant impact on your physical health. Addressing it is crucial. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Fine. Whatever. As long as it gets me closer to a solution. But a grief counselor? Honestly, that sounds… ridiculous. I’m not one for talking about my feelings. It won’t bring her back, will it? Fine. I’ll… consider it. But no promises. So, blood tests. Where do we start? And how long will this take? I have instruments waiting, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood tests. The lab is down the hall, third door on the left. They’ll need your insurance information, of course. It should take approximately fifteen minutes. The results will be available in three to five business days. I will contact you with the findings. In the meantime, I will also provide you with a list of local grief counseling services. Here is the requisition. And here is the list. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes, you say? Alright. Well, thank you, I suppose. Though, I'm not holding my breath for any miraculous cures. And I doubt I’ll be contacting anyone about grief counseling. But I appreciate the… effort. So, just the blood tests, then? And I'll… see you in a few days, I guess. Let's just hope this gets me somewhere. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a… productive day, Mr. Redfern. .
