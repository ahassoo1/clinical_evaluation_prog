DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Rannells. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It's about this… medical marijuana. My daughter—bless her heart, she tries—she keeps telling me about it for my… discomfort. I understand you can certify one for it, and frankly, I’m tired of all the nonsense. It’s just… a lot to keep track of at my age.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Rannells. I understand you're interested in exploring medical marijuana as a potential treatment option and seeking a certification. That's perfectly reasonable. Before we proceed, I’d like to get a more comprehensive understanding of the “discomfort” you mentioned, as well as your overall medical history. To start, could you describe this discomfort in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? It's… everywhere, really. My joints ache, naturally. I was a dancer, you know. A serious dancer. It’s in my hips, my knees… even my hands. And then there’s the… nerve pain. Shooting pains, mostly in my legs. It keeps me up at night. It's just… old age, I suppose. Though I do try to remain active. One must, you know. It’s terribly important.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing a fair amount of pain, Ms. Rannells, and it’s commendable that you remain active despite it. To clarify, when did you first start noticing these joint aches and nerve pains?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think. The aches… probably started subtly about ten years ago. Really bothering me, maybe seven. The nerve pain is more recent. Perhaps… three, four years? It comes and goes, you understand. Though lately, it's been… more go than come. It interferes with my bridge games, which is simply unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. And you mentioned it interferes with your bridge games – is that the main way it affects your daily activities, or are there other things you find difficult?
PATIENT: Well, naturally. It makes it difficult to concentrate, you understand. One must have a clear head for bridge. Though, honestly, it's just… unpleasant. Walking is a bit of a chore some days, and gardening… forget about it. My roses are simply suffering. Though, I assure you, I manage. One must maintain standards. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Rannells. It sounds like this pain is impacting several aspects of your life, and it's good you're proactively looking for solutions. Now, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well. I've always been… remarkably healthy, all things considered. A little arthritis, naturally. High blood pressure, which is what everyone gets these days, I believe. My general practitioner—Dr. Ramirez, very good woman—keeps it under control with medication. And… oh, yes. I had a hysterectomy, goodness, thirty years ago. Other than that, nothing of any real consequence. I do take a daily vitamin, of course. And a little something for my nerves, prescribed by Dr. Ramirez. Nothing strong, you understand.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Rannells. So, to confirm: you have a history of arthritis and high blood pressure, currently managed with medication by Dr. Ramirez. You also had a hysterectomy thirty years ago, and take a daily vitamin and a mild medication for your nerves. Could you please tell me the name of the medication you take for your nerves?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now, let me see. Dr. Ramirez changes them periodically. It’s… something ending in “-pam,” I believe. A small white pill. Honestly, I don't concern myself with the details. I simply take it as prescribed. It’s… helps me sleep, mostly. A little vague, I suppose. But really, I don’t make a habit of memorizing pharmaceutical names. It’s all rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Rannells. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall the exact name. We can try to obtain that information from Dr. Ramirez’s office later if needed. Now, are you currently experiencing any other medical problems, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Certainly not. I may be seventy-four, but I am not ailing. I'm perfectly… functional. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. My vision is a little… blurry for reading, but I have glasses for that. A perfectly normal consequence of age, you understand. I maintain a very active social life. I certainly wouldn't be able to do that if I was feeling unwell. It’s simply out of the question.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Rannells. And you have no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve always been very careful about what I take, you understand. I certainly wouldn’t ingest anything that would cause me harm. Though… I did have a slight rash once, years ago, after using a new hand cream. But that was hardly an allergy, more of a… sensitivity. It cleared up on its own, naturally. I've never had any serious reactions to medication. None at all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Rannells. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your joints and nervous system. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? I’ve seen doctors my entire life. I assure you, my condition is quite apparent. But… very well. If you insist. Though I doubt it will reveal anything I haven’t already told you. I do have a rather busy afternoon, you understand. Bridge, then tea with Mildred. Don’t let it take too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Rannells. I’ll keep it as brief as possible. First, let’s start with your joints. Could you please bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It creaks, naturally. It always creaks. As I said, a dancer. Serious wear and tear, you understand. It’s not exactly a secret. I haven’t been able to do a plié in years, not without assistance. Is that what you were hoping to see? Because frankly, it’s rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Rannells. Yes, I do note some crepitus and tenderness. And there’s some limited range of motion. Now, could you please extend your arms and try to grip my fingers?
PATIENT: There. And? Is my grip remarkably weak? As I said, I've always been rather petite. Though I do manage to hold a bridge hand perfectly well. It's all about technique, you understand. It’s not about brute strength. Honestly, I find all this prodding rather unnecessary. It’s not exactly a pleasant experience. Is there a point to all of this?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Rannells. Your grip is adequate, and your reflexes are normal. Now, could you please stand and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Is my gait particularly… uneven? As I said, the nerves. It’s not exactly a graceful walk, but it gets me from point A to point B. Honestly, I don't see what this accomplishes. I’ve been walking for seventy-four years. I think I have a reasonable grasp on my ambulatory capabilities. Can we please get on with it? I have a tea date, you understand. And Mildred is notoriously punctual.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Rannells. Based on your history and the physical exam, it appears you have some degree of osteoarthritis in your knees, as well as some mild neuropathy likely contributing to the nerve pain you’re experiencing. The tremor is subtle, but worth noting. Do you have any questions about what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: Osteoarthritis? Neuropathy? Fancy words, doctor. I simply have aches and pains, as most people do at my age. And a tremor? Honestly, I’ve always been a little… shaky. It’s probably just the caffeine. I drink a perfectly reasonable amount of coffee, you understand. Is this going to affect my certification? Because frankly, that's the only reason I’m here. And I’d like to know if it’s going to be a long and complicated process. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Rannells, I understand your frustration. While I’ve given those terms, my intention isn't to alarm you. The findings do help me understand the best course of action. Regarding the medical marijuana certification, the criteria in our state are fairly straightforward. We assess the qualifying condition and ensure there are no contraindications. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings today, you do likely qualify. However, I would like to order some blood work to rule out other potential causes for your nerve pain, and to ensure there are no interactions with any medications you may be taking. The blood work is a simple panel, and we can get the results back quickly. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? Really? More prodding and poking? Honestly, it's becoming rather tedious. But... very well. If it’s absolutely necessary. Though I assure you, I am perfectly healthy for a woman of my age. And I’d like to know, before I agree to anything, how long this will take? And how much it will cost? I don’t simply write blank checks, you understand. I have a budget. And Mildred… well, she doesn’t appreciate being kept waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Rannells. The blood work is standard procedure, and it shouldn't take long – just a few vials. The lab is located right across the hall, and it usually takes about 15-20 minutes. As for the cost, the blood panel is approximately $150. Once we have the results, we can review them together, and if everything looks clear, I can complete the certification. The certification itself is an additional $200 fee, which covers the necessary paperwork and submission to the state. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the blood work?
PATIENT: $350? Honestly, doctor. That seems… exorbitant. But… very well. If that’s the price of alleviating my discomfort, I suppose I have no choice. But I expect a prompt turnaround. And I’d like to know exactly what the blood work is testing for. I don’t want any surprises. And if it turns out to be unnecessary, I expect a full refund. Do we understand each other? And please, let’s not waste any more of my time. The clock is ticking.
DOCTOR: Perfectly, Ms. Rannells. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, the blood work is necessary to rule out any underlying conditions and ensure your safety. The panel will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone level, and vitamin B12 and D levels. It will help us assess your overall health and identify any potential deficiencies or abnormalities. Here is the requisition form. You can take this to the lab just across the hall. They’ll be expecting you. The results typically come back within 24-48 hours. Once we have them, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. I believe that is all. Just… please expedite the process. As I said, my time is valuable. And I expect a full explanation of the results, in plain English, not all this medical jargon. I don't have a degree in medicine, you understand. I simply want to alleviate my discomfort. And please, don’t keep me waiting. Mildred will be most displeased. Good day, doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Rannells. I will ensure a prompt turnaround, and my nurse will be in touch soon to schedule a follow-up appointment. I will also make sure the results are explained in clear, understandable language. Have a pleasant day, and please let us know if you have any questions.
