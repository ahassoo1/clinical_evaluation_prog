DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. Been happening for a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Time… slips away, you know? It's just bothersome, that's all. Don't need a fuss, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. It’s perfectly alright if you're not certain of the exact timeline. "A while now" is a good starting point. And it’s good you came in to get it checked out. So, the shaking is primarily in your hands?
PATIENT: Yes, hands. Sometimes… feels like it goes up my arm a little. Not always, though. Hard to say. It's worse when I try to… do things. Like, holding a cup. Or writing. Not that I do much writing these days. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more noticeable when you're actively using your hands, when you're trying to hold something or write. And it can sometimes extend up into your arm. Besides being bothersome, has the shaking interfered with any daily activities?
PATIENT: Interfered… hmm. Well, I used to enjoy… woodworking. Not professionally, just a hobby. It’s been a while since I picked up a chisel, though. Too difficult now, I reckon. Spilling coffee, too. More than usual, anyway. It’s not… life-threatening, Doctor. Just annoying. Really annoying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it’s impacting things you enjoy, and causing some frustration. That’s valid, Mr. Jezik. Even if it isn’t life-threatening, it’s important to address things that lower your quality of life. Now, have you noticed anything else accompanying the shaking?
PATIENT: Accompanying…? Like… other symptoms? Well, I’ve been feeling a bit… tired lately. But I’m seventy-nine, Doctor. Who isn’t tired? And my… balance isn't what it used to be. But again… age, probably. It’s hard to say what’s normal and what isn’t these days. Don't think so, really. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point, Mr. Jezik. It can be difficult to distinguish what’s typical for your age and what might be something else. Just to be thorough, let's explore a little further. When you say tired, is it a general fatigue, or more like muscle weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not muscle weakness, exactly. Just… worn out. Like I haven't slept enough, even when I have. It’s… hard to describe. It’s not like I can’t do things, just… don’t want to, if that makes sense? And it’s not all the time. Some days are better than others. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure I'm being very helpful. My memory… it's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Mr. Jezik. It’s perfectly normal to have difficulty remembering details, and you’re doing a good job describing what you’re experiencing. The fact that it fluctuates – some days are better than others – is useful information. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Past medical… Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… high blood pressure, I think. But that was a long time back, and I think they had me on pills for a while. Stopped taking them eventually. Doctor said it was okay. Everything else… I really can’t recall. Nothing major, I don't think. Mostly just aches and pains, you know, the usual old age stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a history of high blood pressure that was managed with medication, then discontinued. That's helpful to know. And have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don't think so. Nothing that I recall, anyway. Maybe a few broken bones when I was a kid, but nothing… serious. Definitely not since I got older. Just the gallbladder. Really. My memory is a mess, Doctor. Sorry about that.
DOCTOR: You’re not causing any trouble at all, Mr. Jezik. It’s perfectly alright if details aren’t clear. We’ll work with what we have. Now, thinking about your family… Do you know of anyone in your family with similar symptoms, like shaking or tremors?
PATIENT: Tremors… My mother's brother… Uncle Jan, I think his name was… he had a bit of a shake later in life. But it was… different, I think. He had a hard life, you know? Lots of stress. I always figured it was just that. No one else, not that I recall. My father was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. It’s probably nothing to do with family, really. Just bad luck, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your Uncle Jan had some tremors later in life, but it sounds like it may have been attributed to stress. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Too expensive, for one thing. And… I used to enjoy a beer with dinner, years ago. But I don’t anymore. Not for a long time now. Doctor said it might be interfering with my sleep, so I cut back. Now, I just have a glass of water. Plain and simple. Not much of a drinker these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, and you used to drink alcohol but have stopped. That’s good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… just a little pill for my waterworks, you know? Getting older. And… sometimes I take something for my knees when they act up, but not every day. Allergies… not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I think. It's hard to remember. I really wish my memory was better, Doctor. This is probably a waste of your time.
DOCTOR: You're not wasting my time at all, Mr. Jezik. It's perfectly normal to forget details, and we're getting a good picture here. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just check your reflexes, coordination, and look at your hands a bit more closely. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam… Well, alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do, you know? But… yes. Go ahead. Just be gentle, Doctor. These old bones aren’t what they used to be. And please don't take too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common for your age. And your coordination seems a bit…slowed, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I do notice a slight tremor in your hands when they're at rest, and it becomes more pronounced when you try to perform a task. It’s subtle, but it’s present. I’m also checking your gait to see if I can see anything. Your gait is a little unsteady, and I notice a slight slowness in your movements. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Thank you for your cooperation.
PATIENT: Well… what does it mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I just want to know… I don't want any fuss. Is it… Parkinson's? I read about that… Is it that? Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, it’s understandable to be concerned. Based on the symptoms you’ve described and the findings from the physical exam – the tremor at rest, the slowness in your movements, and the unsteady gait – there is a possibility it could be Parkinson’s disease. However, it’s too early to say definitively. Many other conditions can cause similar symptoms. To get a more accurate diagnosis, I'd like to order some further testing. This will include blood tests to rule out other causes, and I would also recommend a referral to a neurologist. A neurologist is a specialist in disorders of the nervous system and can perform additional tests, such as a DaTscan, which can help confirm or rule out Parkinson’s disease. It's important to remember that even if it is Parkinson’s, there are effective treatments available to manage the symptoms and maintain a good quality of life. We’ll work through this together, one step at a time. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A neurologist… more tests… Honestly, Doctor, I just wanted a simple answer. But… alright. If that's what you think is best. A neurologist, you said? Do I need a referral from you? And… how long will that take? I don't want to wait months for an appointment. I just want to get this sorted, one way or another. It's unsettling, not knowing.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Jezik. It's unsettling not knowing, and I wish I could give you a definitive answer right away. Yes, you will need a referral from me to see a neurologist. I'm sending a referral request to Dr. Anya Petrova, a highly-regarded neurologist in the city. I'll also include all of your medical records and the results of today’s exam. I will call the office and see what the current wait time is. Typically, it takes a few weeks to get an appointment, but I'll do my best to expedite the process. I’ll have the receptionist call you directly to schedule the appointment once they have a date. In the meantime, if you notice any significant worsening of your symptoms – increased tremor, difficulty walking, or changes in your speech – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's alright. Getting the referral is the main thing. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, and for trying to get me in to see the specialist quickly. And thank you for not dismissing it as just… old age. I'll wait for the receptionist to call. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care of yourself, and I hope you have a good day.
