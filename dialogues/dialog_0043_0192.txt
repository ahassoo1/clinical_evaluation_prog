DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I’m here for this… exam. The military one. Need to get it done. Don't have time to mess around with paperwork later, you know? It's August 2nd, right? Just making sure everyone’s on the same page.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is August 2nd. And you are quite right to be proactive about this examination for the military. I understand wanting to ensure everything is completed efficiently. To clarify, is this a periodic health assessment, or are you preparing for a specific deployment or enlistment?
PATIENT: Enlistment. Definitely enlistment. Look, I'm… well, I'm getting a bit older, maybe. But still good for it, you know? Always been strong. Always been healthy. Never really needed a doctor before now, to be honest. Just doing what they tell me to do. Paperwork, tests… whatever. Don’t see why it needs clarifying, really. It's the enlistment exam. Pretty simple.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying, Mr. Hartness. It is good to have a clear understanding. And it's perfectly alright that you haven't needed regular medical attention before now; that's excellent. However, these enlistment exams are quite thorough, and we want to ensure we capture a complete picture of your current health status. To start, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? What's to tell? I've broken a bone, maybe. When I was a kid. Skiing accident. Healed fine. Nothing serious. Never been sick, never been in a hospital. I eat good, I sleep okay, I work hard. That's it. I'm a mechanic, always been one. Strong back, strong hands. That's the whole story. Don't need a long list, I can promise you that. And frankly, I don’t have a long list.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Mr. Hartness. It sounds like you’ve been quite fortunate with your health. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma?
PATIENT: High… what was it? Blood pressure? No. Never. Asthma? What even is asthma? Sounds… weak. No, nothing like that. Look, I spend my days working on engines. Heavy lifting, greasy hands, the whole thing. Not sitting around wheezing. I’ve never had anything diagnosed. Never needed to. Are you going to ask me about childhood illnesses now? Because honestly, I barely remember being sick as a kid. Just… no. No chronic anything. Are we done with this part yet? It's all very… pointless.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It's helpful to confirm these things even if you've been healthy. Just a few more questions, and then we can move on to a physical examination. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason, even briefly?
PATIENT: I just told you! No hospital. No surgeries. Skiing accident when I was a kid, broke my arm, went to the doctor, got a cast, healed. That’s it! Are you writing this down? It's the same story! Look, I'm a practical man. I fix things. I don’t need fixing. This whole process is a waste of my time. And frankly, it's a little… insulting. You think a strong man like me has been sitting around in hospitals? It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem repetitive, Mr. Hartness. I assure you, I'm not questioning your strength or health. It’s simply standard procedure to gather a complete medical history before any enlistment. We want to ensure your well-being and ensure a smooth process. Let's move on to your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: Family history? Now you want to talk about them? Honestly. Alright, fine. My father… he worked in a factory, like me. Strong man. Died of… old age, I guess. Heart gave out. Always smoked. Mother… she was okay. Lived a long life. Bit of arthritis in her hands. Grandparents… mostly gone now. Can’t really remember. Nothing… dramatic. No cancers or anything. They were… regular people. Like me. Strong, working people. Is that what you want to hear? Are we almost done? Because frankly, I have things to do. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hartness. That's helpful. Now, regarding your current lifestyle, do you currently use any tobacco products, alcohol, or recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Seriously? Look at me. Do I look like someone who needs… recreational drugs? I work hard all day. Come home, eat dinner with my wife, sleep. That’s it. No. Absolutely not. I have a beer sometimes, with dinner. Maybe a glass of wine. But nothing… excessive. And I used to smoke, when I was younger. But I quit. Years ago. Decades. Clean living, mostly. I need to be sharp for my work, you know? Can we just get this over with? I don't have time for this interrogation.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your honesty, Mr. Hartness. That is very helpful. Now, one final set of questions before we move on to a physical examination. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not really. I get a bit of hay fever sometimes, in the spring. But that’s it. Nothing serious. No reactions to any medications that I know of. My wife gives me something for it if I get a cold. Never had a problem. No food allergies. I eat pretty much anything. I'm a practical man, remember? Don’t get fussy about things. Seriously. No allergies. Are we finally done with the questions? This is ridiculous. My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Hartness, we are finished with the preliminary questions. Thank you for your patience and thorough responses. Now, I'd like to proceed with a physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, examining your abdomen, and a few other standard assessments. Is that agreeable with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. Just… don’t poke around too much. I've got things to do. Let's go.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. We’ll keep it as efficient and comfortable as possible. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know. Your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, respiration rate is 16, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. All within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and assess your range of motion. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Range of motion is full and without pain. Finally, I’ll take a quick look at your ears, nose and throat. Ears are clear, nasal passages are normal, and throat appears healthy. Alright, Mr. Hartness. The physical examination is complete. Everything appears to be within normal limits. Do you have any concerns or questions about anything I’ve done so far?
PATIENT: Nope. Everything feels… normal. Like I told you it would. Wasted a lot of time for nothing, really. Are we done? Can I go now? I've got work to do, you know. This whole thing has been… pointless. Seriously. Just tell me if I'm good to go or not. Don't need a lecture. Just the answer.
DOCTOR: Based on the information you’ve provided and the findings of the physical examination, there are no immediate contraindications to your enlistment. However, as a standard protocol, I would like to order a complete blood count and a urinalysis to further assess your overall health. These tests will provide a more comprehensive picture and ensure there are no underlying issues we may have missed. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: More tests? Seriously? Look, I already told you I’m a healthy man. I work hard, I eat good, I sleep okay. I don't need… poking and prodding. But… fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But I expect this to be quick. And I expect the results to be… normal. I don't have time for this. Just tell me where to go to get these… blood tests done. And how long it will take. This is ridiculous. Seriously.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. These tests are a routine part of the enlistment process and will be completed quickly. I’ll write you a requisition for the complete blood count and urinalysis. The laboratory is located just down the hall, room 203. They are open until 5:00 PM today. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to return. Once I have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and finalize your medical clearance. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Fine. 24 to 48 hours. I expect them to be quick. And don't bother calling me if everything is normal. Just… tell the receptionist to let me know when they’re ready. I’ve got work to do.
