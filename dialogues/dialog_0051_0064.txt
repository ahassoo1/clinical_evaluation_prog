DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. GLAZEWSKI. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but… enough that I thought I should come see someone. It’s a little scary, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, chest pain is definitely something we want to take seriously. It is good you came in. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More like… a squeezing? Like someone is hugging my chest very tight. It happens when I walk, mostly. Or if I climb the stairs. Sometimes even if I just get… excited, you know? Like, talking fast. It goes away when I rest, pretty quick. Usually.
DOCTOR: A squeezing sensation, brought on by exertion… and sometimes even with excitement. That's helpful to know. How long has this been going on for, Sherion?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started… maybe three months ago? At first, it was just when I was doing a lot of walking, like when I go to the market. But now… it happens easier. Even just walking around the house sometimes. I didn't think much of it at first, just thought I was getting old! But then… it started worrying me. My husband, he said I should come see a doctor. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s good your husband encourages you to take care of yourself. Three months… and gradually getting more frequent. Okay. And where exactly in your chest do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Right here. Not on the side, not in my back… right in the middle. It feels like… it starts here and maybe spreads a little bit… but not much. Mostly just here. It’s not a big pain, but it's… uncomfortable, you know? Like a heavy weight.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Centrally located, some slight spreading… a heavy, uncomfortable sensation. Do you have any pain in your arms, jaw, neck, or back at all when this happens?
PATIENT: No, no pain in my arms, or my jaw, or my neck. My back feels okay. Sometimes, I get a little… breathless when I’m walking and the pain comes. But that's it, really. Just the squeezing and the breathless feeling. And it goes away when I sit down. It's a relief, always.
DOCTOR: Okay. Breathlessness with the pain… and relieved by rest. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain worse, besides walking or excitement?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. Eating doesn’t make it worse. Cold weather doesn’t make it worse. I haven't noticed anything specific. I tried taking it easy for a few days last week, and it seemed a little better then, but then I had to go to the market… and it came back. I don’t think anything makes it worse, exactly, just doing things makes it happen.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to ask you a few questions about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see... High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me years ago, maybe ten years ago? I take a little white pill every morning for it. High cholesterol… I don’t think so. And no, no diabetes. My mother had it, but I haven’t. I get checked every year. I see Dr. Ramirez for my check-ups. He’s very good.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see your history of hypertension here, managed with medication. That's good. And no history of diabetes or high cholesterol noted. Have you ever had any surgeries, Sherion?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. When I was maybe forty? And… I had a little operation on my hand, when I broke it falling down the stairs. That was a long time ago too. But nothing else. Just the gallbladder and the hand. Small things, really. Nothing important.
DOCTOR: Okay, cholecystectomy and hand surgery noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications other than the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. Just the white pill for the blood pressure. Sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it’s really bad. A little yellow pill. But not every day. Only when my hands are hurting. And… sometimes I take something for a headache, if it’s a bad one. But that's it, really. Nothing else regularly. The doctor said not to take too many pills, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so antihypertensive medication regularly, and as-needed medications for arthritis and headaches. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky, I think. My daughter, she's allergic to cats, but I'm fine. We have a little cat, a fluffy white one. He's very sweet.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any heart problems – like heart attacks or strokes – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father, he had a heart attack when he was older. Maybe in his seventies? And my uncle, on my mother’s side, he had a stroke. He didn’t recover very well. It was sad. But… no one else, really. My mother, she lived to be ninety, and she was healthy until the very end. Just a little weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of heart attack in your father and stroke in your uncle. And lastly, Sherion, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh, um… well, I mostly stay home. I like to cook, I like to watch television. I go to church on Sundays. I used to walk more, but now… not so much. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but… I like my arepas!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright Sherion, thank you for that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Just routine things to get a better picture of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. It’s okay. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. I hear a normal heart rhythm, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's not alarming, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Your lungs sound clear. Your pulse is regular and strong. No swelling in your ankles. Okay, Sherion. Everything sounds relatively normal, but the elevated blood pressure and the murmur are things we'll want to investigate further. Given your symptoms – the chest pain brought on by exertion, the breathlessness – and your family history, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Tests are okay. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what's going on. What kind of tests? Is it… scary? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: No, nothing to be scared of. It's not usually painful, just a little bit uncomfortable sometimes. We'll start with an EKG, which is a quick test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It's completely non-invasive – we just put some stickers on your chest. Then, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a picture of your lungs and heart. And finally, I'm going to order a blood test to check your cholesterol levels and other important markers. It’s standard procedure, Sherion. We'll get a more complete picture this way. Do you have any questions about any of those tests?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don't think so. Stickers and pictures and blood… it doesn't sound too bad. Will I have to go to a special place for these tests? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have my church group meeting on Wednesday. I don't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: The EKG and chest X-ray can be done right here in the clinic. I'll write you a referral slip, and the nurses will schedule them for you. The blood test can be done at the lab across the street. It shouldn't take long at all. As for the results… the EKG results will be available almost immediately. The chest X-ray results usually take a day or two, and the blood test results will be back in about three to five business days. We should have everything back by the end of next week. I'll call you as soon as I have the results, Sherion. And if anything urgent comes up, we'll contact you right away. In the meantime, I'd recommend taking it easy and avoiding strenuous activity. And if the chest pain gets worse, or you experience any shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. You explained everything very well. Thank you. I feel a little better knowing what's going on, and what we’re going to do. I hope everything is okay. I really don't want to miss my church meeting!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. It's my job to make sure you're comfortable and informed. We'll do everything we can to figure out what's going on. And I hope everything is okay, too. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. The nurses will be in shortly to schedule your tests and give you the referral slips. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all. Thank you again for your time. You’re a very kind doctor. I’ll see you next week, then. Hopefully with good news!
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Sherion. You take care now, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We'll be in touch soon. .
