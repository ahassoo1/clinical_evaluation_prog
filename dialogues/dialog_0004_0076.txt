DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's these bumps on my legs. They're on my shins, and they really hurt. They're red, and kinda… hard. Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “A little while now…” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez… maybe a month or so? It started with just one, I think, and then more kept popping up. Not all at once, you know? Slowly. It’s hard to remember exactly when, things slip my mind these days. But definitely not longer than two months, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are these bumps causing any other symptoms besides the pain?
PATIENT: Just the pain, really. They’re itchy sometimes, but not all the time. And… they look kinda ugly, if I'm being honest. My wife noticed them right away, she always does! But no fever, no swelling anywhere else, just these red spots on my shins hurting.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed anything that seems to make them worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, really. I work a lot on my feet, moving stuff around, so I figured it was just from that. They seem a little worse after a long day, but even when I rest, they don't go away completely. I haven’t tried anything special to make them better, to be honest. Just been hoping they'd go away on their own.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what kind of work do you do, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, I work at the warehouse down on Elm Street. Mostly unloading trucks, moving boxes, that sort of thing. A lot of walking, a lot of bending… it's physical work, you know? Been doing it for… well, a long time now. Since before I was married, I think! It keeps me busy, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Aluia. I'd like to take a look at these bumps. If you don't mind, please sit on the examination table and pull up your pants legs a bit so I can get a good look.
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Here you go, Doctor. Be careful, they're a little tender.
DOCTOR: Alright… yes, I see them. Several erythematous, slightly raised nodules on both shins. They appear to be fairly firm to the touch. No signs of ulceration or weeping. Pulses are good, no significant edema. Do you have any history of diabetes, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, not that I know of. Never been told I had it. My wife keeps an eye on my sugar, sometimes I get a little shaky when I skip a meal, but she always gives me a snack. But no doctor ever said anything about diabetes. Is that what you think it is?
DOCTOR: No, I'm not saying that's what it is, but it’s important to rule out potential causes. These bumps could be related to vascular insufficiency, and diabetes can contribute to that. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel, including a glucose level, to start. We’ll also do an ankle-brachial index to assess blood flow in your legs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Yes, that’s alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's causing these bumps and how to make them stop hurting. Blood work and… what was it, ankle-bra-something? Sounds a little scary, but if it helps… then yes. Do I need to do anything to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: The ankle-brachial index is non-invasive, Mr. Aluia. We’ll just be taking blood pressure readings on your arms and ankles. As for the blood work, you’ll need to fast for eight to twelve hours beforehand. No food or drink other than water. The lab will give you specific instructions when they call to schedule the appointment. I'm sending the orders to the lab now. They should be in touch within a day or two to set up an appointment. In the meantime, try to avoid prolonged standing and keep the area clean and dry. Do not attempt to self-treat with creams or ointments. We will review the results when they come back and formulate a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. No eating, don’t mess with the bumps… and wait for the lab to call. Sounds good. You think it's something serious, Doctor? I mean, I’m not a young man anymore…
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, I’ve explained we need further testing before we can determine the cause. Jumping to conclusions won’t help. I will contact you with the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I’ve documented our discussion and the pending lab work. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
