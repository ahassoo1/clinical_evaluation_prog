DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Particia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor Shely. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. They started a couple of days ago, and they just won’t stop. Not a serious thing, I’m sure, but awfully annoying when you’re trying to enjoy a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can certainly be disruptive. Could you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Well, they come and go, mostly after I eat, though sometimes just… randomly. They’re pretty strong, not little tiny ones. They make me jump, even! And then everyone looks at me. It’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve tried holding my breath, like my mother always told me, and drinking water upside down... nothing seems to work for very long.
DOCTOR: I see. So they began a couple of days ago, are triggered somewhat by eating, but also occur spontaneously, and are strong enough to be noticeable and disruptive. You've also attempted some common remedies – holding your breath and drinking water upside down – without sustained relief. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about what you’ve been eating recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had a lovely roast chicken on Sunday with all the trimmings. And yesterday, I made a big pot of kokoda - that's Fijian fish salad, you know, with coconut cream and lime. I do love my cooking! Today, just a bit of toast for breakfast. Nothing too unusual, I wouldn’t think. Though, now you mention it, I did have a rather large slice of pawpaw after lunch yesterday. It was very ripe and sweet.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. Roast chicken, kokoda, toast, and a large portion of ripe papaya yesterday. Now, aside from the hiccups, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me see. No, not really. I’ve been a little tired lately, but that’s just old age, I suppose! And my knees ache a bit, but that’s the arthritis acting up. Nothing that’s come on with the hiccups, no. No heartburn, no trouble swallowing… just the hiccups. They're really the only thing bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no associated symptoms like heartburn, difficulty swallowing, or other new complaints. Fatigue and knee pain are present, but you attribute those to age and arthritis, respectively. Ms. Sucich, could you please tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, the arthritis, of course, as I mentioned. The doctor diagnosed that years ago. And I had my gallbladder out when I was in my forties. Otherwise, I've been quite lucky, really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but that’s been well-controlled with medication for ages. And… let me see… oh, I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but that cleared up completely.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, a history of arthritis, gallbladder removal in your forties, a past history of hypertension currently well-controlled with medication, and a previous episode of pneumonia that resolved. Do you recall the names of any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh yes, let me think. I take lisinopril for the blood pressure, one tablet every morning. And I take glucosamine for the arthritis, two capsules with breakfast. That’s it, I think. Just those two. I always keep them in the little pill organizer, so I don’t forget!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 1 tablet daily for hypertension, and glucosamine 2 capsules daily for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've always been able to eat everything, thankfully. And I haven’t had any trouble with medications in the past. Never had a rash or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, really! My daughter always asks me if I’m sure, but I always tell her, “No, dear, I haven't a single allergy!”
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no known allergies. Now, could you briefly tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Let me see. My mother lived to be 92, very healthy for her age, though she did have a bit of trouble with her eyesight towards the end. My father had heart problems, unfortunately. He passed away when he was in his sixties. And my brother, he has diabetes, but other than that, nothing too remarkable. Most of us just live a long time, thankfully!
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. History of longevity, a father with heart problems, and a brother with diabetes. Finally, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! My mother wouldn't dream of it. And I followed her example. Always thought it was a dreadful habit. Never touched a cigarette in my life.
DOCTOR: Very good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, when I'm feeling fancy. Not every night, mind you. Maybe once or twice a week. It’s mostly for the taste, really. And it goes well with my cooking, you see! Nothing excessive, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, no history of smoking and occasional, light alcohol consumption. Alright, Ms. Sucich. I’ve noted all of this information. Looking at your chart, I see you’ve had regular check-ups and your vital signs have been stable. Based on what you've told me, and reviewing your record, the hiccups are likely benign and self-limiting. However, given their persistence, we should investigate further to rule out any underlying causes. I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Of course! If you think it's best to check, then I'm happy to. I trust your judgment completely. I haven’t felt any pain or anything, but it’s always good to be sure, isn’t it? Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your lungs sound clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. Heart sounds are regular rhythm, no murmurs appreciated. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. I don't feel any masses or organomegaly. Now, I’d like to check your neurological function. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you go. Is that alright? I’ve always had good eyesight, even now. Though reading small print is getting a bit tricky these days!
DOCTOR: Very good, your eye movements are smooth and symmetrical. Your reflexes are normal and strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Based on the physical exam, there are no obvious neurological deficits. Given the persistent hiccups despite home remedies, and given your age, I'd like to order a few tests just to be cautious. I'd like to get a complete blood count , a basic metabolic panel , and a chest X-ray. The CBC will check for any underlying infection or anemia. The BMP will check your electrolyte levels and kidney function. And the chest X-ray will rule out any problems in your lungs or mediastinum. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds very thorough, Doctor. If you think those tests are necessary, then I’m happy to have them. I trust your judgment completely. Better to be safe than sorry, I always say. When will I be able to get those done? And will I need an appointment?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I agree, it's best to investigate. Our lab can draw the blood today, and we can schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow morning. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. You don’t need a separate appointment for the blood draw; you can just come to the lab during their regular business hours. The lab technician will give you instructions on fasting, if any, prior to the tests. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they are available, and we’ll discuss them at a follow-up appointment. Would next week work for you?
PATIENT: Oh, next week would be fine, yes. Plenty of time. So, I just go to the lab whenever suits me during their normal hours? And they’ll tell me if I need to avoid eating anything beforehand? That’s very convenient. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sucich. Yes, just go to the lab during their regular hours, and they will provide any necessary instructions regarding fasting. While we await the results, I would recommend continuing to stay hydrated and avoiding any activities that might exacerbate the hiccups, such as carbonated beverages or overeating. If the hiccups worsen significantly or you develop any other symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or difficulty swallowing – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've answered all my questions, and I feel much reassured. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kind manner. It's lovely to have a doctor who takes the time to listen. I’ll go to the lab tomorrow and get those tests done. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Sucich. I'm glad I could reassure you. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you next week. Have a pleasant day, and try to relax.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor Shely! Thank you for everything. I will. Have a lovely day as well!
