DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. It’s Hartness, Delron Hartness. I’m here for… the thing. The army test. Gotta get this done, you know? They want me to take it before… well, before anything happens. It’s a pretty important test.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Hartness. The pre-employment physical for the Army. I understand it’s quite important. We want to make sure you're in good health and fit for service. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about why you are joining the Army?
PATIENT: Joining? Well, that’s… complicated. It’s not like I want to join, exactly. My boy, Erik, he’s been… pushing it. Says it'll make a man of me. Honestly, I just want to get him off my back. He’s always talking about duty and… well, I just want some peace. And the money ain’t bad either, gotta be real. It’s a job, you know? A steady job. Not like these… other things I’ve been doing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hartness. It sounds like a complex situation, and you're making a decision based on a number of factors. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll focus on ensuring you're physically prepared, whatever your reasons. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing like that. I’ve always been… strong. Never really been sick. Had the usual colds, you know? When I was a kid. But nothing serious. Broken a few bones, working. But they healed up just fine. Always been a hard worker. Strong back, strong hands. Still am. I don't get winded easy, either. Unless it's a really steep hill.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Hartness. A history of good health is certainly a positive. And you seem to be in fairly good shape. You mentioned breaking bones – can you tell me a little more about those injuries?
PATIENT: Yeah, well… there was the one time, back in ‘08, I was working on a Volvo engine. Heavy thing. Slipped and it landed on my foot. Messed it up pretty good. Went to the hospital, got it X-rayed, they put a cast on it. Took a while to heal, but it’s fine now. No problems with it. Then there was the one with my wrist, helping a friend move some furniture. Stupid idea, that was. Didn’t need to get involved. But I did, and… yeah, sprained it real bad. Physio for a bit, that’s it. Both healed completely. Fully functional.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a foot injury in ‘08 requiring a cast, and a wrist sprain treated with physical therapy. And you haven’t had any lingering issues with either of those injuries?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a bit. I mean, sometimes my foot gets a little cold in the winter, but that’s it. Old injury, you know? Happens. And the wrist… well, I can lift heavy things with it just fine. I use it all the time for work. No pain, no swelling, nothing. Fully recovered. I told ya, I’m a tough Swede. We don’t break easy.
DOCTOR: I can certainly see that, Mr. Hartness. Alright, let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing. I don’t like taking pills. Never have. Waste of money, if you ask me. I eat okay, mostly. Steak, potatoes, that sort of thing. I drink coffee, that’s it. And maybe a beer now and then, but nothing crazy. I don't need any of that fancy stuff. All natural, that’s me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. And you don't have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, right?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Never had a reaction to anything. Bees, spiders, pollen… doesn’t bother me. I’ve been stung by a few bees, working outdoors. Just a little pain, that’s it. I’ve got a pretty strong constitution, you know? Don’t really get sick. My wife, she’s the one who gets all the sniffles. Not me. Tough as nails, that’s what she says.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Hartness. A lack of allergies is certainly a good thing. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmmm… well, my father, he was… strong. Worked in a shipyard his whole life. Lived to be 85, but he had a bad heart the last few years. Real stubborn, he was. Wouldn't slow down. My mother, she was okay. A little frail, but she lived a long life too. She died in her sleep, peacefully. My brother… he’s got high blood pressure, I think. But he doesn’t really take care of himself. Smokes too much. That’s about it, I guess. Nothing major, really. We’re a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had a history of heart problems, your mother passed away peacefully in her sleep, and your brother has high blood pressure. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of diabetes, cancer, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. Nobody talked about that sort of thing much. Old-fashioned family, you know? Didn't really go to doctors unless they absolutely had to. Just toughed things out. My grandfather, he broke his back in a logging accident, but he lived a long life after that. Real tough Swede, he was. So, no, not that I’m aware of. Just strong people, mostly. That's what we were.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. That gives me a good overview of your medical background. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, just to make sure everything is in good working order before you proceed with the Army pre-employment physical. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. I’m a tough Swede, remember? Won’t feel a thing. Let’s get it over with. I’ve got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please step over here and lie down on the table, we’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick check of your reflexes and range of motion. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me, please.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Relax, relax. It’s not like I haven’t had a cuff on my arm before. Getting a little old, you know? Things aren’t as easy as they used to be. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148 over 92. We’ll need to monitor that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Elevated? Huh. Never had any trouble with my heart before. Maybe it’s the coffee. Or the stress. Thinking about all this army stuff. Just a strong heartbeat, that’s all. That’s what it is.
DOCTOR: I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm and some mild wheezing. Have you had any shortness of breath, coughing, or chest pain recently?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Nah, not really. Maybe a little after climbing a steep hill, but who doesn’t get winded then? Coughing… sometimes, in the mornings. Just a tickle in my throat. Old habit. Nothing serious. Chest pain? No. Never had any chest pain. I’m a tough Swede, remember? Probably just a cold coming on. Happens every now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to check your reflexes now. This might be a little startling. And I’m going to check your range of motion in your arms and legs. Can you please raise both of your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Huh. Didn't feel much. Getting old, I tell ya. Everything’s a little… slower these days. There. Like that. Little stiff, maybe. Been doing a lot of heavy lifting lately. Work, you know? Gotta make a living.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m also going to take a look at your throat and ears just to rule out any infections. Can you open your mouth and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: “Ah…” A little dry, that’s all. Didn't drink much water today. Been busy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on my examination, your blood pressure is elevated, your heart rhythm is slightly irregular, I detected some wheezing in your lungs, your reflexes are diminished, and your throat is a bit red. Given these findings, I recommend further investigation before proceeding with the Army pre-employment physical. I’d like to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm more closely, a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs, and a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute. All that? EKG, X-ray, blood tests… Sounds serious. Is something wrong? I just came here for a test, not… not a whole hospital visit. I feel fine. Maybe a little tired, but who isn’t? Is this going to disqualify me? I don’t want to get disqualified. I need this job.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, it’s not necessarily about disqualification. It’s about ensuring your health and safety. These tests are simply precautionary measures to identify any potential underlying issues that might affect your ability to serve. We need a complete picture before making any decisions. The elevated blood pressure and irregular rhythm are the main concerns, and the other tests will help us understand what’s causing them. It’s better to address any potential problems now rather than later. Do you have any history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Well… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he… he had a bad heart. Real bad. Died young, actually. But that was a long time ago. Nobody talked about it much. He worked hard, you know? Logging. Tough life. My father… he complained about palpitations sometimes, but he just shrugged it off. Said it was stress. He was a stubborn man. Didn’t like doctors. Does that mean something’s wrong with me? Is it hereditary? I don't want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: Given your family history, it’s even more important that we investigate these findings thoroughly. Palpitations and a history of heart problems in your grandfather certainly raise some concerns. I’m not saying you have a serious problem, Mr. Hartness, but we need to rule out any potential cardiac issues before you proceed. I’m going to order the EKG, chest X-ray, and blood panel. We can schedule those for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity, and I’ll write you a note for your employer explaining that you're undergoing some medical evaluation. Would you like me to refer you to a cardiologist for a consultation as well?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Is that… is that really necessary? That sounds… serious. I just want to take the test, get the job, and get on with my life. I don’t want to be poked and prodded and told I can’t do something. Can’t I just… take the test anyway? Maybe it’ll be alright. Maybe it’s just stress. I need this job, Doctor. My boy… he’s counting on me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your concerns, and I truly empathize with your situation. However, as a physician, my primary responsibility is to ensure your health and safety. Taking the test without addressing these findings could potentially put your heart at risk. While I understand your desire to proceed quickly, it’s crucial to have a complete evaluation before making any decisions. A cardiologist is a specialist in heart health, and they can provide a more in-depth assessment and determine if there are any underlying issues that need to be addressed. I'm not saying you can't take the test, but I strongly recommend a consultation with a cardiologist first. We can schedule that for early next week. In the meantime, I'll write you a note explaining that you’re undergoing medical evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. A cardiologist. Next week. Fine. Whatever. Just… get me through this. Get me the note. And… and tell me what to expect. What will they do? I don't like hospitals. I don't like doctors. This is all… a lot. Just… help me through this, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Hartness. I’ll help you through this every step of the way. The cardiologist will likely perform an electrocardiogram , which is a non-invasive test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. They may also order an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart. They’ll also review your medical history and perform a physical exam. It’s a fairly standard procedure, and it shouldn’t be painful. I'll give you the referral information for a highly recommended cardiologist nearby, Dr. Anya Sharma. Her office is very accommodating. I'm also going to write you a note for your employer, explaining that you're undergoing medical evaluation and may need to take a few days off for appointments. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… okay. A few days off… That might be a problem. My boss… he doesn’t like when people are off. Will this show up on anything? Like… a background check? I don’t want this to affect my chances. And… what if she says I can't do it? What if I’m… disqualified? What then?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, let’s address your concerns one at a time. Regarding your employer, the note simply states that you're undergoing medical evaluation and may require a few days off for appointments. It doesn't disclose the specific reason for the evaluation. As for background checks, routine medical evaluations typically don't appear on standard background checks. However, it’s always a good idea to be transparent with your employer if they specifically ask about your health. And regarding disqualification, that’s a possibility, but it’s not a certainty. Dr. Sharma will assess your overall heart health and provide a recommendation based on her findings. We won't know the outcome until after your appointment. It’s important to remember that the goal is to ensure your health and safety, and to determine if you’re medically fit to serve. I’m confident that Dr. Sharma will provide you with the best possible care and guidance. I'll be here to support you throughout the process. Do you have any other concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. Just… this is a lot. I just wanted a simple test. Alright. I’ll… I’ll call Dr. Sharma. And I’ll see what she says. Thank you, Doctor. I guess.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hartness. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Remember, your health is the most important thing. Take care, and I wish you all the best. .
