DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a little about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’ve been hearing a lot about mindfulness and meditation, and I thought I might try it. I’m hoping it could help with… just generally feeling a little more centered, I suppose. I don't really have anything wrong, exactly, just… wanting to be better.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you coming in to discuss this, Ms. Sugino. It’s excellent that you're proactively exploring ways to improve your well-being. That's a very admirable goal. So, to clarify, you're interested in exploring mindfulness and meditation as a means of stress management and overall wellness, rather than addressing a specific medical concern at this time?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! That sums it up perfectly, Doctor. It’s not like I’m ill, I just… work can be a bit much sometimes. Signal and track switches, you know? A lot of responsibility. And I find my mind races, even when things are quiet. So, yes, stress management and feeling… calmer, that’s really what I’m after. Do you… do you offer classes here, or do you recommend somewhere else to start?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Sugino. That sounds like a demanding profession – signal and track switches requires a great deal of focus and responsibility. It's very common for individuals in high-stress roles to experience racing thoughts and benefit from techniques like mindfulness. We don’t currently offer formal classes here at the clinic, but I can certainly recommend some excellent resources. Before we get to that, though, would you mind if I ask a few questions about your overall health, just to get a broader picture?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, ask away. I don't mind at all. I’m quite open about things, and like I said, I’m in good health. Hopefully!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. I see here your height is listed as 161 centimeters and your weight is 136 kilograms. Is that information still accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Everything’s pretty much the same, I haven’t changed much in a while. I try to stay active with my work, it keeps me moving, though it's not exactly… relaxing exercise.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're staying active. Now, in terms of past medical history, do you have any chronic health conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. Nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty lucky with my health. A few colds over the years, of course, but nothing serious. My mother, she had some trouble with her knees when she got older, but I seem to have avoided anything like that so far. I do have Medicare, just in case, but I haven’t really used it much.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Sugino. And it’s good you have Medicare coverage. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single one. I’ve been very careful, I suppose. Mostly just the usual doctor’s visits for check-ups and the occasional flu shot. I don’t really like hospitals, so I try to avoid them if I can!
DOCTOR: I understand completely; hospitals aren't typically anyone's favorite place. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take anything regularly. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I'll take some paracetamol, but that's about it. I try to get most things from a good diet and enough sleep, when I can. No vitamins, no special supplements, nothing like that. I’m quite…plain, really, when it comes to all that.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything, and I've never had a reaction. My mother always made sure I tried everything, even things she didn’t like. So, I'm pretty confident I don’t have any hidden allergies.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not at all. I don't smoke, haven't touched a cigarette in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol, maybe a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. As for… recreational drugs, definitely not. I don’t have much time for all that, and frankly, I don’t have any interest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so forthcoming, Ms. Sugino. That gives me a good overview of your overall health. It sounds like you’re generally in very good health, which is fantastic. Now, shifting back to your interest in mindfulness and meditation… could you tell me a bit more about what specifically you’re hoping to achieve with it?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, my work is quite demanding. Signal and track switches, it’s a lot of responsibility. But it’s not just the work itself. It's the worrying, you know? Thinking about everything that could go wrong, even when things are going right. I find myself getting… distracted, even when I’m not at work. My mind races, and I struggle to focus. I'm hoping mindfulness can help me quiet that, to be more present, and maybe… just a little bit calmer. I want to enjoy things more, instead of constantly being anxious about the future.
DOCTOR: That's very insightful, Ms. Sugino. It sounds like you're experiencing anticipatory anxiety, which is very common in high-stress professions. Mindfulness and meditation are excellent tools for managing that, by helping you focus on the present moment and reduce those racing thoughts. Given your good overall health, I don't see any medical contraindications to starting a mindfulness practice. I can recommend a few resources. There are some excellent apps, like Headspace and Calm, that offer guided meditations for beginners. I also have some handouts with information on local mindfulness classes and workshops. Would you be interested in those?
PATIENT: Yes, please! That would be wonderful, Doctor. Apps sound good, and handouts would be very helpful too. I’m not very good with technology, so I might need some help figuring out the apps, but I'm willing to try. And local classes… well, that would be nice to meet other people who are also trying to find a little bit of calm. Thank you so much for your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I'm happy to help. Here are some resources on local mindfulness classes – they range in price and level of experience. And here’s a handout with information on Headspace and Calm, and some tips on getting started with meditation. Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any trouble with the apps. To summarize, we've discussed your interest in mindfulness and meditation for managing stress and anticipatory anxiety. Given your good health, I recommend exploring these resources. I don’t see a need for any further medical workup at this time. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen and offering these resources. It’s very reassuring. I feel much more confident about trying this now. And thank you for not thinking I was… silly, for wanting to find a bit of calm.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Sugino! It’s wonderful that you’re prioritizing your well-being, and there's absolutely nothing silly about wanting to find a bit of calm. It’s a very admirable goal. Please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if you have any questions or concerns as you begin your mindfulness practice. Have a wonderful day, and I wish you all the best on your journey to finding more peace and calm. .
