DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, it’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been… annoying me for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, “ringing in your ears.” We call that tinnitus. And you said “for a bit now” – could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yeah, sorry. It started, I think… maybe three months ago? It comes and goes, but it’s been pretty constant the last month or so. It's worse at night, when it’s quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright, three months, worsening over the past month, and more noticeable at night. That gives us a good starting point. Is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly my left ear, actually. Sometimes I think I hear it in the right, but it’s not as strong. It’s like… a high-pitched whine, mostly. Not a buzzing or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily in the left ear, described as a high-pitched whine. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so. I mean, I haven’t been shouting for people or anything. But maybe things sound a little… muffled sometimes? I haven't really paid much attention, to be honest. Work’s been busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible mild muffled hearing, but nothing significant you’ve noticed. And what sort of work do you do, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: I’m a waiter. Work at a restaurant downtown. It gets pretty loud in there, especially on weekends. Lots of music, people talking… you know.
DOCTOR: I see. A busy restaurant environment. Has there been any recent exposure to particularly loud noises outside of work?
PATIENT: Not really. Maybe a concert a few months back? But nothing else I can think of. It was… before the ringing started, I think. Honestly, I go to a lot of concerts, but this is the first time I’ve noticed anything like this afterwards.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any dizziness, ear pain, or discharge from either ear alongside the ringing?
PATIENT: No, none of that. No pain, no dizziness, nothing coming out of my ears. Just… the ringing. It’s just really frustrating when I’m trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No dizziness, pain or discharge. Let's move on to your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, things like that. Broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that’s about it. Nothing major. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I did get divorced last year, if that counts as something...but that was stressful, not physical!
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood illnesses, a broken arm as a child, and recent divorce. We’ll note that stress can sometimes contribute to these types of symptoms. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. I try to stay away from doctors unless I have to be here, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, regarding your family history – are there any relatives who have experienced hearing loss, tinnitus, or other ear problems?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a tough one. I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. My dad passed away a few years ago, and my mum… she doesn’t really talk about that kind of stuff. I think my grandfather was a little hard of hearing when he got older, but that was just… old age, I think. Nothing specific.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history available. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing regular. I took some paracetamol for a headache last week, but that's it. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I just want to know what’s causing the ringing and how to make it stop. This is really starting to get on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. I understand your frustration. Let’s do a quick exam to get a better idea of what might be going on. I’ll need to look in your ears and do a brief hearing test. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Let’s just get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, your left ear canal appears clear. There’s no sign of wax buildup or infection. And your right ear also looks clear. Okay, testing at 250 Hz… 500 Hz… 1000 Hz… 2000 Hz… 4000 Hz. Your hearing seems to be slightly reduced at higher frequencies, particularly in the left ear. It’s mild, but it’s consistent with noise exposure. It’s not severe enough to require immediate referral to an audiologist, but we should monitor it. I'm going to document these findings.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… good to know, I guess. So it’s the music at work? Is that what you’re saying? What can I do about it? I can’t exactly quit my job, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s likely a significant contributor, yes. It’s very common for people who work in loud environments to develop tinnitus and mild hearing loss. We call it noise-induced hearing loss. The good news is that in many cases, it’s manageable. The most important thing is to protect your hearing as much as possible. Do you have access to hearing protection at work?
PATIENT: No, not really. We sometimes have earplugs, but they’re… cheap foam ones. They don’t block out much sound, and they’re not very comfortable. I usually just try to avoid the really loud speakers if I can, but it’s hard. It’s a busy place, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. I recommend investing in a good pair of custom-molded earplugs specifically designed for musicians or people working in noisy environments. They're more expensive upfront, but they provide much better protection and are more comfortable for long-term use. In the meantime, even using the foam earplugs when you can is better than nothing. We’ll also discuss some strategies for managing the tinnitus itself. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Um… honestly, not really. It's just… there. Sometimes when I’m really concentrating on something, I don’t notice it as much. But then I stop, and it’s right back. I just wish it would go away. It's driving me crazy at night. I haven’t been sleeping well.
DOCTOR: Okay, distraction helps temporarily. Difficulty sleeping is a common symptom with tinnitus. We can try some simple techniques. I recommend avoiding caffeine and alcohol, especially before bed. Also, try a white noise machine or fan to help mask the ringing and improve sleep quality. I'm going to write a prescription for a sleep aid to help you get through the next couple of weeks while we implement these strategies. It’s a low dose and should only be used as needed. We’ll also document the tinnitus and the mild hearing loss. I recommend following up with me in one month to see if things have improved. If the tinnitus gets significantly worse, or you experience any dizziness, ear pain, or changes in your hearing, please contact the office immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. A sleep aid might help. And I’ll try the white noise. I guess I can look into those better earplugs too. Just… please let me know if it’s something serious. I really don’t want to lose my hearing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your concern, and I don't believe this is anything serious at this stage, but it's important to be proactive. I'm printing out a summary of our discussion, the prescription, and some information on tinnitus and hearing protection. Please review everything carefully, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Dhanoa?
