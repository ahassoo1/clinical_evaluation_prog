DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, it's this…shaking. Hands mostly. Been happening a while now, honestly. Not sure why I even bothered coming in. Probably just old age, right? Don't have time for a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Right. “Shaking.” And how long precisely is “a while now,” Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. A while…a couple years, maybe? Hard to say. Things kinda blur together when you get to be my age, you know? It wasn’t this bad before, just…noticeable sometimes. Mostly when I was trying to hold a glass, or…something. Honestly, I don't recall specifics. Is this going to take long? I had a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: Two years is…significant. And it’s progressed recently, you say?
PATIENT: Progressed? I suppose. It's just...more annoying now. Harder to ignore. Makes things difficult. I used to be a very precise man, you know? A director has to be precise. Everything has to be just so. Now...well, now I spill my soup. It’s embarrassing. And frankly, I don’t need a young doctor telling me it's just “old age.” I know what old age feels like.
DOCTOR: A director, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, was a director. A producer too. Big films, back in the day. Though, that was a long time ago. Doesn't matter now. All just…memories. I haven’t done much lately, truthfully. Too much trouble. This shaking doesn't help with anything, believe me. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doc? Or am I just rambling?
DOCTOR: Right. Past occupation noted. And you’ve noticed no other symptoms accompanying this tremor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Like...feeling sick? No, not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn't? It's just the hands. They shake. Sometimes more, sometimes less. It’s frustrating, that’s all. Look, I really don’t see what a doctor can do about shaking hands. It's not like you can fix 'em, can you? I just wanted to make sure it wasn’t something…serious. Like a brain tumor or something equally dreadful. Though, I suppose if my time is up, it's up.
DOCTOR: A brain tumor is…unlikely, but we must rule out possibilities. Have you experienced any changes in your vision, speech, or balance, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: Vision? Nah, still see pretty good, I guess. Maybe need new glasses, but that's just getting old. Speech is fine, isn't it? You can understand me, can't you? And balance…well, I don’t go climbing mountains anymore, if that’s what you’re asking. I mostly stay at home. Honestly, I prefer it that way. This is all a waste of time, isn't it? Just tell me it's old age and let me go. I've got a good book waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick neurological exam. Just to…confirm what we already suspect. It will be brief. Please hold your arms out in front of you.
PATIENT: Ugh, now you want to poke and prod? Fine, get it over with. But don't expect miracles. My arms are probably just tired. I had a very stressful morning, even getting here. Honestly, the traffic…don’t even get me started. Just hurry up, Doc. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Observe the tremor in both upper extremities, more pronounced on the right. Increased muscle tone noted bilaterally. Now, please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head.
PATIENT: I'm following it, aren't I? This is…awkward. And honestly, a little insulting. I used to direct hundreds of people! I can follow a finger. Are you trying to prove something, Doc? It's just…a little tiring, that's all. I didn’t sleep well last night. And I'm not getting any younger, you know? Just tell me what you think, and let’s be done with it. I’ve got a perfectly good afternoon to waste.
DOCTOR: Based on your history and this brief examination, the presentation is suggestive of essential tremor. However, given your age and the progression of symptoms, we should rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work to assess your thyroid function and vitamin levels. And I’d like you to get an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: MRI? Blood work? Now you're just trying to make me nervous! Look, I told you, it's just old age. I don't need a bunch of tests. This is getting ridiculous. I'm not putting myself through all that hassle. Honestly, I'd rather just live with the shaking. It's not like it's…life-threatening. And frankly, I don't trust those machines. They give me the creeps. Just…forget the tests. I'm leaving. I’ve wasted enough of my afternoon already.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, while I understand your reluctance, it is my professional responsibility to investigate potential causes of your symptoms. An accurate diagnosis is crucial, even if it is simply essential tremor. The MRI and blood work will help us confirm that. However, if you absolutely refuse, I must document that you were advised to undergo further testing but declined. I will write a prescription for propranolol, which may help manage the tremor, but it’s not a substitute for proper evaluation.
PATIENT: Propranolol? Is that some kind of…pill? I don’t like pills. They make me feel funny. Look, Doc, I appreciate…well, I appreciate you trying, I guess. But honestly, I'm just going to manage on my own. I've gotten by this long, haven't I? I'll just…be careful with my soup. And maybe I’ll switch to a smaller glass. Fine. Write whatever you need to write. But don’t expect me to come back. I've got better things to do than spend my afternoons in a doctor’s office. And frankly, I don't trust modern medicine anyway. It's all just…hype. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. The prescription and a summary of our discussion are here. If your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new neurological symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. Some people… .
