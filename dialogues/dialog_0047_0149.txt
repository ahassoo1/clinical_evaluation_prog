DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Honestly, I don't quite recall why I'm here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Something about… not wanting them to do things to me? She gets so worked up about everything. I’m Wynell, by the way. Wynell Gunasekara. Though I suspect you already knew that. Doctors always know everything, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Yes, Wynell, I do have your information here. It’s good your daughter brought you in. Sometimes it's difficult to remember everything. Perhaps she noticed something that concerned her?
PATIENT: Concerned? Hmph. She worries too much, that girl. Always has. Thinks I can’t take care of myself. I’ve lived a long life, you know. A long life. And I’ve always been perfectly capable. What is she even fussing about, anyway? Is it about my feet? They ache a little, sometimes, but who doesn't have aching feet at my age? It's just… old age, dear. Plain and simple. I don’t need poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good you’re so independent, Wynell. But even capable people benefit from a check-up. Aches and pains can be a sign of something more than just “old age,” and it's my job to rule those things out. So, let's just go through a few questions, alright?
PATIENT: Questions? Honestly. I haven't been good with questions since… well, since a long time ago. Look, I just want to know if this is going to involve anyone sticking needles in me or… cutting things. Because I absolutely will not tolerate that. My daughter mentioned something about… tests. Are these unpleasant tests? I really don't do well with unpleasantness. Perhaps a nice cup of tea would help me think. Do you have tea?
DOCTOR: We can definitely talk through everything beforehand, Wynell. And no, I don’t anticipate anything involving needles or cutting at this stage. We'll start with a general conversation about your health, and then we can discuss if any tests are needed. I’m afraid we don’t have tea here, but I can offer you some water?
PATIENT: Water is…acceptable, I suppose. Though tea is much preferred. Alright, health. What exactly do you want to know? I've been… existing for eighty-three years. That should cover most of it, shouldn’t it? I used to be a podiatrist, you know. Fixed people’s feet all day. Irony, isn’t it, with my own giving me trouble now? Though it's not that bad. Just a little… twinge. Now, ask your questions. But be quick about it. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: It is ironic, being a podiatrist with foot pain. Very good. Alright, let's start with the basics. Have you been experiencing any other pain besides the twinge in your feet?
PATIENT: Other pain? Let me think… Well, my back aches sometimes, getting out of bed. It's old age, dear, like I said. Everything creaks. And my knees… they’re not what they used to be. I can still walk, thankfully. Though not as far as I once could. And sometimes, I get a little… dizziness. Nothing serious. Probably just from standing up too quickly. It happens. Are we getting somewhere, or are you just trying to make a list of everything that comes with being ancient?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Wynell. It's helpful to know all of this. The dizziness is worth noting. Does it happen often?
PATIENT: Often? Goodness, I don’t know what “often” is anymore. A few times a week, maybe? It’s usually when I stand up fast, like I said. Or if I bend over to pick something up. It doesn't last long, just a little… wooziness. I usually just hold onto something. It's not a big deal, really. Honestly, I think my daughter exaggerates everything. She's a worrier, that one. Always has been. You wouldn't believe the fuss she made when I got a splinter once… It was tiny!
DOCTOR: I understand your daughter is concerned. Even small things can be worrying when you care about someone. The dizziness, though, even if it’s brief, is something we should investigate further. Have you ever fallen as a result of this dizziness?
PATIENT: Fallen? Good heavens, no! I am perfectly steady on my feet, thank you very much. I used to walk miles, you know. Before… well, before everything started to ache. I may be old, but I'm not fragile. My daughter probably thinks I'm made of glass or something. Honestly, she treats me like I'm a helpless child. And you're asking me about falling now? This is ridiculous. I came here because she insisted, not to be interrogated about my… stability.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm making you uncomfortable, Wynell. I’m simply trying to get a complete picture of your health. It's not an interrogation, I assure you. Knowing if you've had any falls helps me understand the cause of the dizziness. Are you taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, let me see… I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take… ibuprofen? Is that what it's called? A pink one. My daughter handles most of that, to be honest. She keeps track of everything. I just take what she gives me. She says I can’t be trusted to remember. It's very demeaning, really. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. All this fuss over a few aches and a little dizziness. It’s… upsetting. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. It sounds like you’re feeling a little… disempowered, and that’s completely valid. Perhaps we can focus on getting a clearer picture of the medications you’re taking. Do you happen to have a list, or would you be comfortable with me contacting your daughter to get that information?
