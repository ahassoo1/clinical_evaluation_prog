DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my speech. It’s been… a bit off, lately. Hard to explain, really. It feels like I’m not saying things clearly. Or… maybe I just slur sometimes? I’m not entirely sure, to be honest. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it’s not constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “A bit off” and sometimes slurring. That’s helpful to start with. When you say "a little while now," can you give me a rough estimate – weeks, months?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It feels like… maybe a couple of months? Possibly longer? It’s difficult to pinpoint, truthfully. Things… don’t always stick in my mind the way they used to. It hasn’t been a long time, though. Definitely not years. Just… a few months, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few months. And has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or does it just happen randomly?
PATIENT: That’s… another tricky one. I don’t think anything triggers it, specifically. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m tired, maybe? But even when I’ve had a good night’s sleep, it can still occur. It's not like after drinking, or anything like that. I really can’t say for certain. I wish I could give you a better answer.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it getting worse, staying the same, or better?
PATIENT: I… I think it’s maybe getting a little bit worse? It feels like it’s happening more often than it used to. Or… maybe I’m just noticing it more? It’s hard to tell, really. It’s not a huge change, but… I would say it’s not improving, if that makes sense. It’s fairly consistent, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, consistent and perhaps slowly worsening. Do you notice any difficulty with understanding speech, or is it primarily with producing it – getting the words out clearly?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no trouble understanding others at all. It's definitely with me speaking. Like… I know what I want to say, but it doesn’t always come out right. It’s frustrating, to be honest. It’s not a hearing problem, or anything like that. It’s just… my mouth doesn’t seem to cooperate sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Okay. Let's talk about other things. Do you have any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness? No, not that I’ve noticed. Everything feels… normal, strength-wise. I do a lot of physical work, you see, with the construction. I haven’t had any trouble lifting things or anything like that. No shaking, or trouble walking, either. Just… the speech, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: No, my vision is fine, I think. I wear glasses, but the prescription hasn't changed in a while. No blurry vision, double vision, or anything like that. Everything looks… clear enough. I had an eye exam last year, and everything was good then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any headaches, dizziness, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… I get headaches sometimes, but everyone does, don't they? Nothing out of the ordinary. No, no dizziness, and definitely no trouble swallowing. I can eat and drink as normal. Everything goes down fine. I don't think I've had a headache with the slurred speech, if that makes sense. They're separate things, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: That’s… a tricky question. I’m on Medicare, so I’ve seen doctors before, of course. But… I don’t really remember being diagnosed with anything specific. I've had the usual things, I suppose – colds, flu, things like that. Nothing major, as far as I recall. My husband usually handles all the paperwork and keeps track of those things. I'm afraid I'm not very good with remembering details like that. Is there a way to check?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Let me pull up your electronic health record… Okay, I see here you had a bout of pneumonia about three years ago, and a sprained ankle last year. Otherwise, nothing significant listed. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I can eat all sorts of things, and I haven’t had any trouble with medications. My husband would definitely have mentioned it if I did, though. He’s very careful about that sort of thing. No allergies, to the best of my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I'm not on any regular medication. Just… over-the-counter things when I need them. Pain relievers for headaches, things like that. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I try to stay healthy, you see, and avoid taking pills if I can. My husband keeps a list of the occasional things I do take, but it's usually just for a cold or something minor. Nothing ongoing, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your strength, reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll have you follow my finger with your eyes and say a few words for me. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, strength seems normal on both sides. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Good eye tracking, no nystagmus. Now, can you say “hello” for me?
PATIENT: Hello. Is that alright? It feels… normal to me, but I suppose that’s not very helpful.
DOCTOR: Now, can you say, “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” for me, please?
PATIENT: The… the quick brown fox… jumps over… the la-zy… dog. It’s… a bit tricky. Does that sound alright? I feel like I’m stumbling over the words a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do hear a little bit of slurring there, particularly on the longer phrase. Let's check your tongue movement. Stick your tongue out as far as you can. Alright, tongue appears normal. Can you push against my hand with your arms and legs?
PATIENT: I'm pushing… is that enough? I'm trying to push as hard as I can. I don't feel any weakness, but… It's just difficult to explain. It doesn't feel weak, but… it feels like my muscles aren’t cooperating properly, maybe? Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing early symptoms of a speech disorder. It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further testing. There are several possibilities, including a mild neurological issue, or even something related to muscle fatigue. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can perform specialized tests to determine the underlying cause and recommend the appropriate treatment plan. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it something I should be very worried about? I… I suppose if you think it's necessary, then yes, I'll see a neurologist. But I'm a bit anxious, to be honest. What kind of tests would they do? And… what if it's something bad?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious, Adyn. It's better to be thorough. It doesn’t necessarily mean it is something bad. Many speech issues are treatable, and early detection is key. The neurologist may order an MRI of your brain to look for any structural abnormalities, and potentially some nerve conduction studies to assess the function of the nerves that control your speech muscles. They might also ask you to repeat some speech exercises and assess your cognitive function. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Reyes, a very experienced neurologist in the city. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try not to stress too much. I'll also give you a list of speech therapy exercises you can practice at home to help maintain your speech strength. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Speech therapy… that sounds… manageable. And Dr. Reyes… is she a good doctor? An MRI… that sounds a bit frightening, but if it helps… alright. Yes, that’s… that’s very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. What sort of speech therapy exercises? And… how long will it take to get an appointment with Dr. Reyes? I’m a bit worried about waiting too long.
DOCTOR: Okay. Dr. Reyes is excellent – very thorough and compassionate. As for the exercises, I’ll print you a handout with some simple tongue twisters, lip exercises, and breathing techniques. Start with five minutes a day and gradually increase the duration as you feel comfortable. Regarding the appointment with Dr. Reyes, it can take a few weeks to get in, unfortunately. I’ll make a note on the referral requesting an expedited appointment due to your concerns. Her office will contact you directly to schedule it. In the meantime, if you notice any sudden changes in your speech – increased slurring, difficulty understanding others, or weakness in your face or limbs – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Tongue twisters… Alright, I can try those. And… thank you for requesting an expedited appointment. I appreciate that. No, I think that answers everything, Doctor. I’m still a bit anxious, but… I feel better knowing we’re getting it checked out. Thank you for your time and patience. I’ll go home and try those exercises.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could help. Remember, early detection is key. Don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns or questions. Take care, and I hope everything goes well with Dr. Reyes. .
