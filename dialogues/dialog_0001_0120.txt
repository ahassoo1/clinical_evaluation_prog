DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Villarreal, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't really do long stories. Just… I want to have a baby. And I want it to be… easy. My husband, God rest his soul, and I, we always planned on kids. Now… well, I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want any trouble. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: “Easy” isn’t exactly a medical term, but I understand. You're wanting to conceive and hoping for a straightforward pregnancy. Okay. Let’s start with the basics. Have you been trying for a while now?
PATIENT: Trying? Well… not actively. After… after Robert passed, things weren’t exactly… conducive to that, you understand. It’s been a couple of years, maybe? Honestly, time kind of blurs. I just figured… when the time was right, it would happen. And now I’m thinking maybe it won’t just happen. Is that… a problem? I don't want to mess around with a lot of tests if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “figuring it will happen” is… not a plan. Two years is a while, especially as you get older. And, frankly, assuming everything's working optimally without some investigation is… optimistic. Look, I'm not saying we need a battery of tests right now, but we need some information. Have you had any regular check-ups recently?
PATIENT: Check-ups? Um… I have insurance, private insurance, good insurance, but… honestly, I haven’t really needed to go. Robert always took care of all that. He was very particular. I think I saw a gynecologist… ages ago? Before we were married even. I really don’t keep track of these things. Is it… is it important I remember who exactly I saw? Because I really don’t. I just want to know what I need to do to make this happen, not relive my medical history.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Villarreal, I appreciate you wanting to get straight to the point, but a basic medical history is important. Knowing if you have any underlying conditions, or even allergies, could affect things. It's not about reliving anything, it's about being safe. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Hmm… Let me think. Robert always said I had a touch of anemia, something with my iron. He’d make me drink that awful spinach juice. And… I had really bad migraines when I was younger. But nothing… serious. Nothing that required… you know, long-term treatment. I just took some pills when my head hurt. Is that what you mean? Seriously, I just want to know if I need to worry about something being… broken or not.
DOCTOR: Alright. Anemia and migraines. Okay. And are you currently taking anything for either of those?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Not anymore. The migraines… they stopped years ago, thankfully. And the spinach juice… well, I stopped listening to Robert after a while. I haven't taken anything regularly since… well, since he passed. Just whatever over-the-counter stuff for a cold, you know? Aspirin, that sort of thing. I really don’t like taking pills, doctor. It just makes me feel… unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay. No current medications. We’re going to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, weight, basic check. It won't be extensive. Then we’ll order some standard blood work – complete blood count, hormone levels, just to see where things stand. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it’s quick. And you promise you won't make me rehash my entire life story. Just… tell me if there's something wrong, and what I need to do to fix it. I haven’t got all day, you know. A woman my age has things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get started then. Blood pressure first. Please roll up your sleeve. And yes, I understand your time is valuable. We’ll be as efficient as possible. 130 over 80. Not bad. Now, height and weight. Stand on the scale for me.
PATIENT: Honestly, I hate these things. Always make me feel… inadequate. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: 164 centimeters, 130 pounds. Okay. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Take a deep breath for me. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, just a quick abdominal exam. Lie back for me. Soft, no tenderness. Everything seems normal to the touch. Okay. Physically, everything appears normal at this point. Now, the blood work will give us more information. I'll have the nurse draw those samples now.
PATIENT: Finally. Just… don't keep me waiting too long for the results. And I expect you to explain them clearly. No complicated medical jargon, please. I just want a straight answer: can I have a baby, or can't I? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask. We'll run the tests and I’ll explain the results as clearly as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It will take a few days to get the results back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment then. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No. No, that’s all. Honestly, it’s been a rather… unpleasant experience. Just get me the results quickly, and let's hope for the best. .
