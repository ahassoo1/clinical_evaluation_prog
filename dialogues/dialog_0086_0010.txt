DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, and honestly, I don’t recall exactly when it started. Perhaps a week or so ago? It’s mostly… around here, on my face, I think. <points vaguely at cheeks and jawline> It’s not terribly painful, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: “A week or so ago,” you say. Vague timelines aren’t terribly helpful, Jahaad. But alright. And is it on both sides of your face, or is it more prominent on one side?
PATIENT: Oh, you are quite right, Doctor. I apologize. My memory… it isn’t what it used to be. <pauses, gently touches his face> I believe it’s… more on this side. <gestures to his left cheek> Though, it’s hard to be certain. It seems to shift a little, if that makes sense. Not dramatically, but… subtly. It’s rather frustrating, honestly, trying to keep track.
DOCTOR: Shifting, you say. Hmm. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? <pauses, thinking intently, tapping a finger to his chin> That’s a good question. Let me see… not that I’m aware of. I’ve been keeping to my usual routine, I believe. Work, quiet evenings… I did try a new brand of face wash a few weeks back, but I stopped using it when I noticed some irritation. That wasn’t quite the same as this swelling, though. More of a… rash, I think? It’s all rather muddled, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Right. New face wash, discontinued. That's… something. Alright, let’s try to get a better picture. Have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms along with this swelling?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever, no chills… nothing like that. Just the swelling, and a slight… discomfort, perhaps? It's not really painful, more like a… fullness. And a bit of… self-consciousness, if I’m being honest. It’s rather unsettling to look in the mirror and see something different. <forces a small, apologetic smile> I do apologize for being so vague. It feels as if I’m describing something I’m not even entirely sure of.
DOCTOR: Self-consciousness is understandable, but that doesn't help me diagnose the problem, Jahaad. Let's move on. Any history of allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… <pauses, brow furrowed in concentration> I… believe I was always mildly allergic to pollen as a child. Nothing severe, just a bit of sneezing and a runny nose in the spring. I haven’t had any problems with that in years, though. As for other allergies… I don’t recall anything significant. I’ve never had a reaction to food or medication that I’m aware of. <shakes his head slightly> I truly wish I could be more precise, Doctor. It’s as if my memory is… fragmented.
DOCTOR: Right, seasonal allergies as a child. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. No regular medications. Just the occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache, perhaps. But I haven't taken anything in… well, I can’t recall precisely when. Not recently, at any rate. <pauses, tapping his fingers together> I really am sorry for the lack of clarity. Is it possible this could be… stress-related? I have been rather preoccupied with work lately, though I wouldn’t say excessively so.
DOCTOR: Stress can contribute to many things, Jahaad, but it rarely presents as localized facial swelling. Alright. Let's have a look. Could you sit up straight for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. <sits up straighter in the chair> Please, do let me know if you require anything further. I shall endeavour to provide whatever information I can, however fragmented it may be. <offers a small, somewhat anxious smile>
DOCTOR: Okay. Swelling is present bilaterally, but more pronounced on the left side, as you mentioned. No noticeable redness or warmth. Palpation reveals… some tenderness along the jawline, particularly here. <points to a spot on his jaw> And there seems to be a slight… firmness to the tissue. Hmm. <continues palpating around his neck, checking for lymph nodes> Any pain with this?
PATIENT: <winces slightly as Dr. Murtic touches his jaw> Oh… yes, a little there. Not sharp, more of a dull ache. It's… subtle, but noticeable when you press. And… yes, I think I do feel something there, along my jawline. A small lump, perhaps? It’s hard to tell. <gently touches the area himself> It hasn't bothered me much, honestly. It just… is. Is that concerning, Doctor? <looks at Dr. Murtic with a worried expression>
DOCTOR: “Just is” isn’t particularly helpful, Jahaad. We need to investigate this further. I'm going to check your lymph nodes more thoroughly. <begins carefully palpating the lymph nodes in his neck, carefully noting any size or tenderness> Do you have any history of dental problems or recent dental work?
PATIENT: Dental problems… <pauses, thinking hard> Let me see. I had a filling replaced about… six months ago, I believe. It was a straightforward procedure, no complications. And… no, I haven’t had any other dental issues recently. I’m quite diligent about my oral hygiene, Doctor. I brush and floss regularly. <touches his jawline gently again> It’s just… this swelling appeared rather suddenly, and I can't quite recall anything that might have triggered it. It's all very perplexing. <looks at Dr. Murtic with a concerned expression> Is it possible it could be… something serious? I apologize for asking, but I am growing increasingly anxious.
DOCTOR: A filling six months ago… alright. Given the swelling, the tenderness, and the palpable lymph node… it could be related to an infection. However, it’s also possible it could be something else. We need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a blood test, specifically a complete blood count and a CRP to check for inflammation. And I'd like a CT scan of your head and neck to get a better look at the tissues. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A blood test and a CT scan… <pauses, looking slightly pale> Yes, Doctor, I understand. That sounds… thorough. Is that… necessary? I mean, could it not be something minor? <looks at Dr. Murtic with a worried expression> I must confess, I am not particularly fond of scans. <pauses> But if that is what you recommend, then I shall certainly comply. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I simply hope it isn’t something too concerning. <takes a deep breath> What exactly will the scan involve? And when would I be able to get the results?
DOCTOR: “Not particularly fond of scans” doesn't change the necessity of proper investigation, Jahaad. We need to rule out more serious possibilities. The CT scan will involve lying on a table while an X-ray machine rotates around you to create detailed images of your head and neck. It’s painless, but you will need to remain still. As for results, I'd estimate 24-48 hours. I'll have the lab results back sooner. We'll discuss them as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics, just as a precaution. It won't solve the problem if it’s something else, but it’s better to err on the side of caution. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Allergies to antibiotics… <pauses, furrowing his brow in concentration> I don’t believe so, Doctor. As far as I am aware, I have never had a reaction to any medication. <shakes his head slowly> No, I don’t think I do. But… I must confess, my memory is still rather… fragmented. Could you please specify which antibiotic you are prescribing, just to be certain? And what are the potential side effects I should be aware of? <looks at Dr. Murtic with a worried expression> I do apologize for being so cautious, but I prefer to be fully informed.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m prescribing Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 875mg/125mg, twice daily for seven days. The printout details the potential side effects – nausea, diarrhea, rash are the most common. If you experience anything more serious – difficulty breathing, severe swelling, hives – stop taking the medication immediately and go to the nearest emergency room. I've also included instructions on how to take it properly. I’m scheduling a follow-up appointment for one week after you complete the antibiotics to reassess. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Amoxicillin-Clavulanate… seven days, twice daily. And a follow-up appointment in a week. <takes the document, examining it carefully> Yes, that’s… clear. <pauses, rereading the side effects> Nausea, diarrhea, rash… I shall certainly be vigilant. <looks up at Dr. Murtic, a small, anxious smile on his face> No, I believe that answers all my questions, Doctor. Thank you for your thoroughness, and for your patience. I do appreciate it. <pauses> If I do happen to recall anything further, may I contact the clinic? Or should I simply wait until the follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: You may contact the clinic, but honestly, Jahaad, don’t spend too much time dwelling on it. Focus on taking the medication as prescribed, and we'll discuss the results of the tests at your follow-up appointment. If you experience any concerning symptoms before then, go to the emergency room. Don't hesitate. The nurse will provide you with the instructions for the CT scan. <pauses, her expression softening slightly> And try not to worry. We’re being proactive, that’s all.
