DOCTOR: Hello Teretha, welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… tingling. It’s in my hands and feet, mostly. Been happening on and off for a few weeks now, I guess. It’s just… annoying, really. Not painful, just… like pins and needles.
DOCTOR: Hmm, tingling in your hands and feet… okay. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. Hard to say exactly, you know? Things slip my mind these days. It comes and goes. Some days it’s barely noticeable, other days it’s… well, more noticeable. It doesn’t seem to be getting worse, but it’s not going away either.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. It’s good you’re keeping track of whether it’s getting worse, even if the timing is a little fuzzy. Do you notice anything specific that brings it on, or makes it better?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… No, not really. I don’t think so. It doesn't seem to be after any particular activity, or time of day. I've noticed it while I'm sorting mail, while I'm resting, even while I'm sleeping sometimes, which is… strange. Nothing seems to help much either, honestly. Maybe moving around a little? But that's just a guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear triggers and no real relief with anything specific. That gives us something to work with. Have you noticed this tingling anywhere else – like up your arms, or in your legs, or… anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No, just the hands and feet. Definitely just the hands and feet. And it’s… it’s both hands, both feet. Not just one side or the other. That’s why I thought it was… I don’t know, something general? It’s not like a pinched nerve, you know? Because that’s usually just one spot, right?
DOCTOR: You’re very observant – good point about it being both sides, that does help narrow things down. And yes, a pinched nerve usually presents on one side. Now, let me ask, Teretha, have you had any other symptoms along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm... Other symptoms... Well, I've been a little more tired lately, I suppose. But I'm 63, Doctor! Who isn't tired? And my balance hasn't been the greatest, but I figured that was just getting older too. No real pain, no weakness, nothing like that. Just the tingling and… a little bit of feeling off-kilter sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit more fatigue and some balance issues. We'll definitely keep those in mind. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let’s see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but they got it under control with… with pills. I don't take them anymore, though. The doctor took me off them a few years back. And… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. But that was… a long time ago. Nothing else, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled high blood pressure and gallbladder removal. Good to know. And have you had any surgeries besides your gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries. Just the gallbladder. I try to stay out of hospitals when I can, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable! Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had diabetes, I think. Type 2. And my father… he had heart trouble. That's what got him, really. And… my sister, she’s got arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. But that's about all I can think of, honestly. It's a big family, but nobody really talked about health much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so diabetes, heart trouble, and arthritis in the family. That’s helpful. Now, just a few more quick questions. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can eat anything, take any medicine. Lucky that way, I suppose. I haven't had a reaction to anything, ever.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I told you, nothing. Not a single pill. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of things. Just… what I need, and that's usually nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Now, Teretha, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I just… I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a route to finish this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, won't be long at all. Okay, your grip strength seems good on both sides. Now, let's check your reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, I'm going to test the sensation in your hands and feet. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. And that too. Everything feels… normal, really. Just the tingling, like little pins and needles. It's not gone, it's just… hard to describe. It's there, but not painful, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. I’m noting that your sensation is intact, despite the tingling. Your pulses are present and normal in both feet, and I don't see any obvious skin changes. Now, let's check your balance, just as a quick assessment. Can you stand up for me, and try to balance for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Alright. Whoa… okay. A little wobbly, Doctor. I told you my balance wasn't the greatest. I don’t fall or anything, but it’s definitely not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a bit of instability, but nothing too concerning. Okay, Teretha, you can sit down now. Thank you. Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this tingling a bit further. Given your symptoms and family history, one possibility could be peripheral neuropathy, which is nerve damage that can cause tingling and numbness. However, other things could be going on as well. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar, vitamin levels, and thyroid function, just to rule out some of the more common causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, blood tests are fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. It’s just… I hate needles. But if it helps figure out what's going on, I’ll do it. What kind of needles are we talking about? And will it take long? I really need to get back to my route.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the needles, and we'll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. It will be a standard blood draw, just a few vials of blood. It shouldn't take longer than 15-20 minutes at the lab. And no need to worry, the phlebotomist is very skilled. The lab is just down the hall here. I'll write you a requisition form, and they can take it from there. We'll get those results back in a few days, and then we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if the tingling gets worse, or you develop any new symptoms like weakness or pain, please give us a call right away. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A few days… Okay. And you said if it gets worse, call? Weakness or pain… I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I’ll go get these tests done then. I appreciate you looking into this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I’m glad we’re getting to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. And please, take your time getting to the lab. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in a few days.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You too.
