DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I am Dr. Blim. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that’s why one comes to a doctor, isn’t it? It’s… a gentleman friend. He’s experiencing… a bit of leakage. And it's not water, if you understand my meaning. It’s rather… unsightly.
DOCTOR: "Unsightly," you say. Yes, well. This is… concerning, of course. Let's try to be precise, Ms. Wartick. You say "he," so this is pertaining to a male patient, not yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Certainly not me. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. It’s… a companion. A male friend. I was just… explaining the situation. Is it really necessary to be so… specific? It's just a bit of discharge, isn’t it? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: "Something serious" is a rather broad term, Ms. Wartick. And yes, specificity is always necessary in medicine. We are not discussing parlor games. Now, can you describe this "discharge"?
PATIENT: Well... it's... yellowish, I think. And a bit… thick. Not like water, as I said. And it smells… unpleasant. He’s quite embarrassed about it, naturally. He's a very… fastidious man, you understand. He keeps himself very clean. It’s just… appeared recently. Within the last week, I’d say. He hasn't been… ill, not as far as he knows. Just this. Is it some sort of… infection? Because I do hope it's not catching.
DOCTOR: "Catching," you say. While direct person-to-person transmission is unlikely, we must consider all possibilities. This could indicate a number of things, Ms. Wartick. And while I appreciate your… concern, it’s crucial we ascertain the source. Has your companion experienced any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, he did mention a bit of discomfort. Not exactly pain, but… a sort of stinging sensation, he called it. Mostly when… well, when he uses the facilities. And a little redness, I believe. But he's not one to complain easily, you understand. Very stoic, my companion is. It’s probably nothing, really. Just a little irritation. Men are so sensitive about these things, aren’t they?
DOCTOR: "Sensitive" is not a medical term, Ms. Wartick. Discomfort and redness, particularly in conjunction with a stinging sensation, suggests something beyond mere "irritation." Has he had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And he hasn’t complained of any abdominal pain, not that I’m aware of. He's a very active man, still enjoys his gardening, you see. He’d certainly notice if something were amiss there. He's quite particular about his health, generally. Is it… something he's done? Some sort of… unfortunate habit? He is a bit of a rogue, if I’m honest, but I hardly think it would lead to this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I am a physician, not a confessor. While I appreciate your… colorful descriptions of your companion, they are largely irrelevant. It could be sexually transmitted, it could be a bacterial infection, or a number of other things. I’m going to need to perform a physical examination to properly assess the situation. Is your companion here today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, no. He’s… rather shy, you see. And terribly embarrassed. He sent me to explain, as I've told you. He thought it would be… less awkward. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, surely you can tell something from what I’ve described. He’s a very healthy man, generally. A robust constitution. He wouldn't want to bother you unnecessarily. Perhaps some sort of ointment? Or a… pill? Something simple?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, with all due respect, I cannot provide a diagnosis – or treatment – without examining the patient. This is a fundamental tenet of medical practice. Sending you to relay information is… inadequate. I understand your companion's embarrassment, but delaying a proper examination could worsen the condition. I strongly advise that he schedule an appointment. If he refuses, I cannot offer any assistance. I am bound by ethical obligations to see the patient. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… rather inconvenient. He really doesn’t like doctors, you see. A bad experience in his youth. But… alright. Alright, I’ll tell him. I’ll explain. But don’t expect him to be thrilled. He’s a very proud man, my companion. And a bit… stubborn. But I suppose it’s better than letting it… fester. Very well. Tell me, Doctor, will it be… terribly intrusive? And how long will it take? He has gardening to do, you know. .
DOCTOR: I will require a standard urological examination. It will involve a visual inspection and potentially a urine sample. The duration will depend on the findings, but approximately thirty minutes should suffice. I understand his… commitments. However, I will not compromise on a thorough assessment. Please convey to your companion that I expect full cooperation. Now, if there are no further questions, I will need to see other patients. I trust you can communicate this information effectively. .
