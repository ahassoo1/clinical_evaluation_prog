DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I'm Dr. Panjoj. Welcome to the clinic. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. I am here because… well, to see if my mother qualifies for help at home, or… the hospice care, I believe it is called. She is… not doing well, and I am trying to do what is best for her.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re facing a difficult situation, and it’s good of you to be proactive in seeking help for your mother. Let's talk about what's been going on. To determine if she qualifies for in-home assistance or hospice, I need some more information. First, could you tell me a bit about what’s been happening with your mother’s health recently?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is… a bit complicated, I suppose. She has been… weaker, mostly. She tires very easily, even doing simple things. She used to enjoy her garden very much, but now she cannot even manage a few flowers without needing to rest for a long time. Her appetite has also… diminished. She eats very little, and when she does, it is mostly just… soft foods. And her memory… it is not as good as it once was. She sometimes forgets things that happened just yesterday. It worries me greatly.
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly sounds concerning. It’s good you’re noticing these changes. Let's try to get a clearer picture. When did you first start noticing these changes – the fatigue, decreased appetite, and memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began… approximately six months ago, I would say. Perhaps a little longer. It was… gradual at first. Just small things, like misplacing her glasses or forgetting a name here and there. But over the last three months, it has become much more noticeable. The fatigue… that worsened quite quickly. And the appetite… that has been declining steadily for the past two months, at least. It is… difficult to pinpoint an exact date, but that is my best recollection.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful. And has she seen a doctor about these changes already?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She has. She saw Doctor Lemaitre, her general physician. He… ran some tests, I believe. He said it was… something with her brain. He used a lot of words I did not understand, to be honest. He said it was… progressive. He recommended some medication, but it does not seem to be helping much. That is why I am here, to explore other options.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information. “Progressive” suggests a condition that worsens over time, which aligns with what you've described. Do you happen to know the specific name of the condition Doctor Lemaitre diagnosed?
PATIENT: I… I do not, Doctor. He told me, of course, but it was a very long word, and I am not good at remembering things like that. He wrote it down on a piece of paper, but… I seem to have misplaced it. It started with a “D”, I believe. Something like… Dementia, perhaps? I am not certain. I apologize. It was a stressful appointment, and I was very worried about my mother.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Mr. Bahta. It’s completely understandable to be overwhelmed in such a situation. Dementia is a possibility, given what you've told me. Just to be thorough, and to get a complete picture, let's go through a brief review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in her behavior – any confusion, agitation, or changes in her personality?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There have been some changes. She… gets confused sometimes, especially in the evenings. She does not always recognize familiar faces, and she repeats questions quite often. And… her temper. It is not like her at all. She gets agitated very easily, even over small things. She used to be such a patient woman, but now… she can be quite irritable. She also… gets anxious a lot, especially when she is alone. It is very upsetting to see.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Those changes are consistent with a possible dementia diagnosis, but we need to explore further. Has she had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She had one, approximately one month ago. She was attempting to get up from her chair, and she lost her balance. Fortunately, it was not a serious fall. Just a few bruises, but it frightened her greatly. And it worried me a great deal, of course. She is much more hesitant to move around now, which… contributes to her weakness, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Okay. Falls are a significant concern with progressive conditions like dementia. Now, could you tell me a little about her medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. She has… high blood pressure, I believe. She has been taking medication for that for many years. And… she had a mild heart attack approximately ten years ago, but she recovered well. Apart from that… she is generally quite healthy, for her age. She has always been very careful about her diet and exercise, but… lately, as I mentioned, she has not been able to maintain that routine. She also had… arthritis in her knees, which causes her some discomfort, but it is manageable with medication.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And has she had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, she had her gallbladder removed approximately twenty years ago. And… she had a hip replacement about fifteen years ago, on her left side. That was quite a difficult recovery, but she made a full recovery. Apart from those two… I do not believe she has had any other surgeries.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question, Doctor. On my mother’s side… her mother had some… memory problems when she was older. She did not live very long. My father… he was very healthy, for most of his life. He died of a heart attack, approximately thirty years ago. As for myself… I have no known medical conditions.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful to know. Finally, does your mother have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. She does not, to my knowledge. She has never had any allergic reactions to anything. She is quite… resilient, for her age.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bahta. This is all very helpful information. Let me just quickly review Doctor Lemaitre’s notes to get a clearer picture of the tests he ordered and the results he obtained. One moment, please. Okay, I see here he did a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a brain MRI. The MRI shows some evidence of atrophy in the temporal lobes, which is consistent with a diagnosis of dementia, specifically… Alzheimer’s disease, according to his notes. He also prescribed donepezil, which you mentioned isn't providing much relief. Now, before we discuss potential options for in-home assistance or hospice care, I’d like to perform a brief cognitive assessment myself, if that's alright with you, just to get a baseline and confirm his findings. It will involve a few simple questions and tasks. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, of course. If it will help my mother, then I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. A brief assessment… that is fine. Please, proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Mr. Bahta, just to clarify, this is a quick assessment to evaluate your mother's cognitive function. I'm going to ask a few questions to assess her memory, attention, and ability to perform simple tasks. Please don’t feel you need to assist her, unless I specifically ask you to. It's important I get an accurate understanding of her current abilities. First, could you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh. That is… a difficult question. I apologize. I am not entirely certain. Is it… August 2nd? Yes, I believe it is. I am trying to remember what my wife told me this morning.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Bahta. That's perfectly acceptable. It's good that you're aware of the date. Now, can you tell me the name of the current president?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… another difficult question. My mind is… a bit foggy this morning. Is it… Mr. Biden? Yes, I believe it is Mr. Biden. I am… not as up-to-date on current affairs as I once was.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words, and I will ask you to remember them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. Please, go ahead. I will do my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Yes. I believe I have them.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you a simple calculation. Can you count backwards from 100 by 7s.
PATIENT: Oh… that is… a bit challenging. Let me see… 100… 93… 86… 79… 72… 65… I… I seem to be losing my train of thought. This is… difficult. I apologize. I am not very good at mathematics.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Bahta. That was a challenging task. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… troubling. Let me think… Apple… something… and… a coin, perhaps? I… I cannot recall the second word. It is… on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot quite grasp it. I apologize. My memory is… not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Bahta. This brief assessment, combined with Doctor Lemaitre’s notes and your descriptions, strongly suggests a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The difficulties with recall, calculation, and orientation are consistent with this. Now, it is important that we discuss what this means and what options are available to support your mother and your family. Given the progression of her symptoms, and the limited effectiveness of donepezil, we need to consider both in-home assistance and palliative or hospice care. Do you have any initial questions before we explore those options?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… a great deal to take in. Alzheimer’s disease… I feared as much, to be honest. It explains… so much. But… hospice care? Is that… is her time… very limited? I… I am not sure I am ready to discuss that option. Perhaps we could focus on the in-home assistance first? What does that entail, Doctor? What kind of support would she receive? And… what are the costs involved?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Bahta. It’s completely natural to feel overwhelmed and to want to focus on options that provide support now. We absolutely can discuss in-home assistance first. Let’s explore that. In-home assistance can range from a few hours a week to 24/7 care, depending on your mother’s needs. Services can include assistance with activities of daily living – bathing, dressing, meal preparation, medication reminders – and companionship. More advanced care can involve skilled nursing services, such as wound care or monitoring vital signs. The goal is to allow your mother to remain in the comfort of her own home for as long as safely possible, while providing you and your family with respite and peace of mind. Regarding costs, that varies significantly depending on the level of care required and the agency providing the services. Typically, these services are covered by private insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid, depending on your mother’s eligibility. I have a list of reputable home health agencies in the area, and their representatives can provide you with a detailed cost estimate based on your specific needs. Before we proceed further, it’s important to assess your mother’s current level of functionality to determine the appropriate level of care. Would you be comfortable with me scheduling a visit to your mother’s home to conduct a more comprehensive assessment?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… a very sensible approach. A visit to my mother’s home would be… ideal. That would allow you to see her current condition firsthand. And… it would give me an opportunity to discuss her needs with you in more detail. Please, schedule a visit whenever it is convenient for you. I will… clear my schedule to be present.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's see… I have an opening on Thursday afternoon, at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thursday afternoon at 2:00 PM is… perfect. That will give me time to prepare and… ensure my mother is comfortable. Please, send me the address, and any other information I need to know before the visit.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I’m sending my assistant, Sarah, an email with her contact information. She will also send you a confirmation email with a brief questionnaire to complete before our visit, which will help me gather more information about your mother’s needs and preferences. In the meantime, if you have any urgent questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… very thorough. Thank you for your kindness and patience. I believe… that is all for today. I am… grateful for your help. I look forward to our visit on Thursday.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I understand this is a difficult time, and I’m here to support you and your family in any way I can. It was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to meeting your mother on Thursday as well.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you again for your time. .
