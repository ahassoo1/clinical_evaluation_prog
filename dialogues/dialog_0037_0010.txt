DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jahaad. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, and… honestly, I don't recall exactly when it started. Perhaps a week or so ago? It’s just… present. I’m hoping you can help me figure out what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week or so of swelling. That’s a good starting point. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me where exactly you’re experiencing this swelling?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. It’s primarily around my jawline, I believe. And… maybe a little on my cheeks? It’s not terribly painful, thankfully, just… noticeable. I apologize for being so vague; my memory hasn’t been the best lately.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jahaad. It's perfectly alright. We'll get to the bottom of this together. So, swelling around the jawline and cheeks, present for about a week. Has this swelling been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It seems to be… more prominent in the mornings, I think. Throughout the day it… lessens a bit, but it always returns. It’s not a dramatic difference, just… subtle. I’ve also noticed it seems slightly worse after eating, but I’m unsure if that’s just a coincidence.
DOCTOR: Okay, more noticeable in the mornings and potentially after eating. That’s helpful. And is there any pain associated with the swelling at all?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. It’s not painful to touch, or when I move my jaw. It’s more… uncomfortable, in the sense that I’m aware of it, and it feels… odd. It doesn't ache or throb or anything like that, just… present. I wish I could describe it better, Doctor. I feel like I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Jahaad. It’s good to know it’s not painful. Let’s try to get a bit more information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, perhaps? But I’ve also been rather busy lately, so that could be the cause. Oh! And my mouth feels a little dry, but I drink plenty of water, so… I’m not sure if that’s related. Nothing else immediately comes to mind, Doctor. It's mostly just the swelling and, well, feeling a bit foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased fatigue and a dry mouth along with the swelling and feeling a bit foggy. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. No fever, chills, or night sweats. I’ve been feeling generally well, aside from the… everything we’ve discussed. I’m glad it’s not accompanied by any of those symptoms, honestly. It’s… reassuring, I suppose. Would it be helpful if I listed any medications I’m currently taking?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Knowing what medications you're on is very important. Also, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Certainly. I take a low dose of Lisinopril for blood pressure – just 10mg daily. And… that’s it, really. As for allergies… I don’t believe so. I have no known food allergies, and haven't experienced any severe reactions to pollen or anything of that nature. I get occasional seasonal sniffles, but nothing beyond that. I’ve never had a truly serious allergic reaction, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily for blood pressure, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, let's quickly go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the high blood pressure, which was diagnosed about two years ago. I’ve otherwise been quite healthy, I believe. No major illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and a balanced diet. Though, with the swelling… it’s made it slightly more difficult to exercise comfortably, to be honest. I don’t want to push myself too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other medical conditions, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Good. And has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had similar issues like swelling, or any autoimmune conditions, or problems with their salivary glands?
PATIENT: That's… a good question. My mother had some issues with her thyroid, I believe, but I don’t recall the specifics. And… my grandfather, on my father’s side, had arthritis, but again, I’m vague on the details. I don't believe anyone specifically had issues with swelling or salivary glands, but I’m afraid my knowledge of their medical history is limited. We weren’t particularly close, and medical discussions were… uncommon. I apologize for being unable to provide more concrete information, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jahaad. It’s understandable. Alright, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week, but I don't drink heavily. And I do not use any recreational drugs whatsoever. I lead a fairly quiet life, mostly focused on my work and maintaining my health. I consider myself quite… temperate, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Jahaad. Thank you for being so open. Okay, last few questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you work or go to school?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I’m a Speech-Language Pathologist. I work at a clinic about twenty minutes from here. It’s… rewarding work, but it can be quite demanding. I enjoy helping people, but it can be emotionally draining at times. It’s kept me quite busy lately, though, which could be contributing to the fatigue we discussed. I am generally quite active during the day, however, which is why this swelling is so perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Speech-Language Pathologist, working at a clinic nearby. That makes sense. Okay, Jahaad, with your permission, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then take a look at your jaw, neck, and mouth. We'll feel for any tenderness, check the range of motion in your jaw, and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please proceed. I trust your expertise and am happy to cooperate in any way I can to determine the cause of this swelling. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate. I hope we can find some answers soon.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Okay, blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit – all within normal limits. Alright, Jahaad, I'm palpating your jawline now. Do you feel any tenderness in any particular spot?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not particularly. It doesn’t feel acutely painful when you press, just… the general discomfort I’ve been experiencing. It’s difficult to pinpoint a specific spot of tenderness. Perhaps a slight pressure along my jawbone, but nothing severe. It feels… a little stiff, perhaps, but that could be my imagination. I hope I’m being helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Jahaad. It's good to know there's no acute tenderness. I'm now checking the range of motion in your jaw. Open and close your mouth for me, as wide as you comfortably can. Okay, good. There's a slight asymmetry in your jaw movement – a little more resistance on the left side. And I do notice some mild swelling along your submandibular gland on both sides, but it’s more pronounced on the left. It’s not significantly inflamed, but it's definitely there. Now, let's take a look inside your mouth… Your oral mucosa appears healthy. No signs of any lesions or infection. Your salivary glands appear to be… normal in appearance, although they are slightly enlarged. Okay, Jahaad. Based on my examination, the swelling appears to be centered around your submandibular glands, with some mild asymmetry in your jaw movement. There's no obvious inflammation or infection, and your oral mucosa looks healthy. Given your symptoms – the swelling, fatigue, dry mouth, and mild asymmetry – and your medical history, a few possibilities come to mind.
PATIENT: I see. That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you being so diligent. A few possibilities? That doesn’t sound particularly reassuring, to be honest. Could you elaborate on those possibilities, if you don’t mind? I’m trying not to jump to conclusions, but I would appreciate some understanding of what might be going on.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jahaad. It’s good you’re asking. It's important to understand all the options. One possibility is sialadenitis - inflammation of the salivary glands. While there's no acute inflammation right now, it could be a subacute case, or resolving infection. Another possibility, given your fatigue and dry mouth, could be Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that causes dryness of the mouth and eyes, and can affect the salivary glands. Less likely, but still a consideration, is a blockage of the salivary duct, which could lead to swelling. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, inflammatory markers like ESR and CRP, and some tests to check for antibodies associated with Sjögren’s syndrome. I’d also like to consider imaging – perhaps an ultrasound of your salivary glands – to rule out any blockage or structural abnormalities. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. Blood tests and an ultrasound seem prudent. I understand you need more information to make an accurate diagnosis, and I'm happy to cooperate. Sjögren’s syndrome… that sounds rather concerning, to be honest, but I trust your judgment. What is the process for these tests? Will you schedule them for me, or do I need to make arrangements separately? And… approximately how long will it take to receive the results? I’m a little anxious, I confess, but I appreciate your thoroughness and explanation.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be anxious, Jahaad. We're taking these steps to get to the bottom of this, and hopefully rule out anything serious. I will schedule the blood tests for you right here in the clinic. The lab is just down the hall, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes. As for the ultrasound, I'll write you a referral to a radiology center nearby. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment at your convenience. Typically, the blood test results come back within 3-5 business days. The radiology center will usually have the ultrasound results available within 24-48 hours of the scan. Once I have both sets of results, I’ll contact you immediately to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, to help manage your dry mouth, I recommend staying well-hydrated, chewing sugar-free gum or candies to stimulate saliva production, and avoiding caffeinated beverages and alcohol, which can worsen dryness. Do you have any questions about the tests or the recommendations?
PATIENT: That’s very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for outlining everything so clearly. Three to five business days for the blood tests, and then 24 to 48 hours for the ultrasound results… I can certainly manage that wait. The recommendations for the dry mouth are sensible. No, I don’t believe I have any further questions at this moment. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness, Doctor AX. I feel… somewhat reassured, knowing we have a plan in place. I will schedule the blood tests with the receptionist now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Jahaad. You’re very welcome. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day.
