DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that's why one comes to a doctor, isn't it? It's about… a problem my gentleman friend is experiencing. A rather unpleasant discharge, if you must know. Honestly, it's quite distressing.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We address all concerns here, Ms. Wartick, though it’s typically the patient who presents with the ailment. Nonetheless, let’s proceed. Could you describe this discharge in as much detail as possible?
PATIENT: Oh, don't be like that, Doctor. He's a… private man. Doesn’t much care for doctors, you see. And he certainly isn’t going to come here himself. I’m doing him a favor. As for the discharge… well, it's… yellowish, I'd say. Not a bright yellow, mind you, more of a… sickly shade. And there’s a rather… noticeable odor. Not a pleasant one, at all. It’s been going on for a few days now, and he’s getting quite worried. Though I think he’s being overly dramatic, frankly.
DOCTOR: A yellowish discharge with an odor… hm. And for how many days, precisely, has he been experiencing this?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it must be… four days now, perhaps five. It’s hard to say exactly. He doesn’t tend to share these things readily, you see. I noticed it on Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday when he… when we were together. It wasn't there the previous weekend, I’m quite certain. Though, he could have been… discreet about it. Men are like that, aren’t they? Always trying to hide things.
DOCTOR: Right. And has he experienced any other symptoms alongside this discharge?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, he has been a bit… irritable. More so than usual, I mean. And he complained of a slight… burning sensation when he… you know. But he also has a bit of indigestion sometimes, so it could just be that. He’s not one to make a fuss, you see. Very stoic. But I did notice he went to the restroom rather frequently yesterday. Is that relevant, Doctor? I'm not sure what one looks for, honestly.
DOCTOR: Irritability, a burning sensation, and increased urinary frequency… yes, those could be relevant. Is there any pain associated with urination, or is it simply the increased need to go?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't believe he mentioned any pain, exactly. Just that he had to go more often. And it wasn't a comfortable trip, if you catch my meaning, but I assumed that was just… well, being a gentleman. He doesn’t like to discuss these delicate matters, you understand. Always very reserved. Honestly, Doctor, sometimes I think he'd rather suffer in silence than bother a physician. It’s quite frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: Very well. And has he had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no fever that I’m aware of. He hasn’t said anything about chills, and he certainly hasn’t complained about abdominal pain. Though, he does get indigestion sometimes, as I mentioned. Perhaps that’s what you mean? Honestly, Doctor, he's a very healthy man. Always has been. This is all quite perplexing, really. I mean, a gentleman like him… getting something like this… it's simply not done.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, while I appreciate your detailed account, it’s difficult to ascertain much without directly examining the patient. However, based on your description, the symptoms suggest a possible infection. To rule out more serious conditions, a urine sample is necessary. We’ll also need to check his temperature and perform a physical exam. Though I must say, relying on second-hand information from a… companion… is far from ideal.
PATIENT: Oh, I understand, Doctor. I suspected as much. A urine sample… well, that might be… challenging. He’s a very proud man, you see. Doesn’t care much for… indignities. But I suppose if you insist. As for a physical exam… honestly, I don't know if he’ll allow that. He's very particular about his personal space. Perhaps if you were… discreet? And a woman physician, naturally. He wouldn't dream of letting a man examine him. It’s all rather complicated, you see. But I'll do my best to persuade him. Though, I make no promises. He's quite stubborn, you know. Really, Doctor, it's a wonder I put up with him. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wartick. I understand the… difficulties. If he is amenable, we can proceed with the urine sample and a limited examination. It would be best, for diagnostic purposes, to obtain a sample first, and then discuss the possibility of a physical assessment. Please stress the importance of this for his health. And I assure you, I will be as discreet as possible. Perhaps schedule another appointment for him?
