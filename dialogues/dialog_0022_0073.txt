DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s my stomach. Been…well, it’s been awful. And nothing the other doctor gave me is working. Honestly, I've tried everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re dealing with some stomach issues and haven’t found relief with previous treatments. That’s frustrating, I’m sorry to hear that. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about what "awful" feels like?
PATIENT: What do you mean? It's diarrhea! Constant diarrhea. I go to the bathroom… a lot. It’s… watery. Is that specific enough for you? I don’t need to draw you a picture. It's ruining my life, frankly. I'm a painter, you know. I can't exactly be running back and forth all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant, watery diarrhea. I understand. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know… weeks, maybe? It started gradually, just feeling a bit off, then got worse and worse. I lost track after a while, to be honest. It’s not like I'm keeping a diary of bathroom trips, Doctor. Really, I’m not sure why you need to know the exact date. It's just… been forever. And nothing stops it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. Knowing the approximate timeframe helps me narrow down potential causes, and rule things out. "Weeks" is helpful. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I’ve tried eating different things. Bland food. Spicy food. It doesn't matter. Coffee makes it… well, you can imagine. But even without coffee, it's still happening. I really don’t see how knowing my eating habits is going to solve this. It just is. It’s always there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems largely unaffected by diet. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Well… I'm tired. Really tired. More tired than usual, I mean. I thought it was just from… everything. But yeah, I guess I'm just exhausted all the time. And a little… crampy sometimes, when it’s really bad. But mostly just tired. Is that important? It feels like everything is connected to… this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and cramping along with the diarrhea. And how would you describe the cramping?
PATIENT: It’s… lower abdominal. Like, right down here. It comes and goes, it’s not constant. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, other times it’s like… sharp pains. But it's always worse before I have to go to the bathroom. Does that make sense? It feels like things are… contracting, I guess. I don't know medical terms, Doctor. I just know it's unpleasant.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. And have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… sometimes. Not a lot. Just… a little. It doesn't happen every time, but yeah, I've seen it. It’s… not pleasant to talk about, obviously. I thought maybe it was from straining. Is that bad? I really don’t want to make a big deal out of this. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Ms. Woodring. It’s important information, and I appreciate your honesty. Seeing blood in your stool is something we need to investigate. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Look, I was widowed a few years back. That was a medical condition, I suppose. Aside from that, no. I've always been healthy. I eat okay, I work hard. I don’t sit around feeling sorry for myself. The other doctor just shrugged it off as a stomach bug. Said to drink more water. Clearly, that didn’t work. I haven't had anything serious. That’s why I’m not sure why I’m even here.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Ms. Woodring. That is a significant hardship. It’s good to know you’ve generally been healthy. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. I told you, I’m healthy. I haven't needed any surgeries. I've always taken care of myself. This is all very… frustrating. I feel like I’m just being asked a bunch of questions that aren’t going to solve anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother had… well, she had some issues when she was older. Some stomach problems, I think. But she lived far away, and we weren’t very close. I don’t know specifics. She passed a long time ago. My father was…healthy as a horse. So, no, not really. Nothing that would be relevant. Honestly, I don’t understand why you’re asking about my family.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sometimes family history can provide clues, but it's not always essential. Let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything right now?
PATIENT: Just what that other doctor gave me! The pink stuff. For… you know. The diarrhea. It didn't work, as we've established. I don't take anything else. I don’t like taking pills. I prefer to deal with things myself, if possible. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you tried something for the diarrhea, but it wasn't effective. And you don’t regularly take any other medications. One last thing, Ms. Woodring. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat shellfish, I'm around cats… I don't have any allergies. Really, I'm a pretty simple person. Can we just… do something about this now? I'm wasting my whole day here.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for that information. Alright, Ms. Woodring, based on what you’ve told me – the constant watery diarrhea for weeks, fatigue, cramping that’s worse before bowel movements, and the occasional blood in your stool – it sounds like we need to investigate this further. While it could be several things, these symptoms warrant some testing to rule out potential infections, inflammatory conditions, or other underlying causes. Would you be comfortable if I conduct a brief physical exam, including listening to your abdomen and checking for any tenderness?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t want anyone poking around down there. I’m already uncomfortable enough. Can't you just… give me something? Some stronger pills? Or run some tests, but no poking. I have a job to do, and frankly, I don’t have time for a full examination. Is there anything you can do without… touching me?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Woodring. A thorough examination can provide valuable information, but I respect your wishes. We can proceed without a detailed abdominal exam for now. However, to get a clearer picture, I do recommend some tests. I'd like to order a stool sample analysis to check for infections, parasites, and blood. I also recommend a complete blood count to check for signs of inflammation or anemia. We may need further testing if those results are not conclusive. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Stool sample, blood work… whatever. Just… tell me where to go, and how long it will take. I need to get back to work. And honestly, if it's something really bad, just tell me straight. I don't want to be kept in the dark.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. I'll have the nurse come in and provide you with instructions and the necessary containers for the stool sample. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the blood for the CBC right away. It usually takes a few business days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a medication to help manage the diarrhea symptoms while we await the results. It’s an anti-diarrheal called loperamide. It's available over-the-counter, but I'll provide a prescription to ensure you have access to it. I will contact you as soon as the lab results are available to discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get the nurse in here. The sooner I can leave, the better. Loperamide… whatever. Just… let’s get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Woodring. I'll let the nurse know to come in right away. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before we receive the lab results. Thank you for your patience. .
