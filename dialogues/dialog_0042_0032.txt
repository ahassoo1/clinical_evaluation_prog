DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Krok is the name. Radford Krok. Though, frankly, I don't recall precisely why my wife scheduled this appointment. Something…unpleasant. A bit embarrassing, to be quite honest. Old age, you know. Things don't work quite as they used to. It's...a discharge, she said. From…down there. Not a subject a gentleman typically discusses.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It can be difficult to talk about these things, and you're absolutely right, it’s not something people often discuss freely. Don’t feel embarrassed at all; it’s a very common issue, especially as we get older. We’re here to help, and I assure you, I’ve discussed this with many patients. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Well…it’s been going on for…some time, now. A week, perhaps? Maybe longer. Honestly, I’ve been preoccupied with the state of my tomato plants, so I haven’t paid it much heed. My wife, of course, noticed. She’s rather…observant. It’s…clear. Not bloody, thankfully. More…mucus-like. And…a bit smelly, if I’m being truthful. Not a pleasant aroma. It’s certainly not normal, I can assure you of that. I keep myself quite clean, you see. Always have.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Krok. It’s helpful to have that detail. So, it's been happening for at least a week, a clear, mucus-like discharge with an odor. And you haven’t noticed any blood?
PATIENT: No, no blood. Definitely not. And…wait now…there was a bit of discomfort, perhaps a week ago. Not pain, exactly. More…a stinging sensation, after I…urinate. It didn't last long, just a moment or two. I dismissed it as simply being cold. The air conditioning in the house is rather fierce, you know. My wife insists on keeping it at a frigid temperature. A woman and her comforts, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, stinging with urination that occurred around the same time as the discharge. That's useful information, thank you. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or any changes in your urinary habits – like needing to go more frequently or feeling like you can’t empty your bladder completely?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills... not that I've noticed. My wife would have mentioned it, certainly. She’s very attentive to such things. As for needing to…go more often… well, an old man goes often, Doctor. That’s simply the nature of things, isn’t it? I haven’t felt any…incompleteness, no. I empty the bladder as thoroughly as always. Though, I must say, the flow isn't quite as forceful as it once was. But that's to be expected, at my age.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It's good to know you haven't experienced a fever or changes in your urinary habits aside from the expected age-related changes. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Well, I’ve always been a sturdy sort. Didn’t get much sick as a boy. Had the usual childhood maladies, I suppose, measles, mumps... nothing serious. As for more recent history… I had my prostate checked, oh, perhaps ten years ago. The doctor said it was a bit enlarged, but nothing to worry about at the time. I’ve got high blood pressure, managed with medication. And…arthritis, in my knees. Makes getting around a bit difficult, especially in damp weather. Beyond that… I can’t rightly recall. It’s been a long life, Doctor. Things tend to…blur.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. That's helpful. So, you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and arthritis. You had your prostate checked ten years ago, and it was noted to be enlarged. Do you recall what medication you're currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medication… hmm. Now that is a question. My wife handles all of that, you see. She's quite organized. Let me think… a white pill, I believe. Small, round, white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And… another one. A blue one, perhaps? No, a yellow one. No… I honestly can’t recall the name of it, Doctor. It’s terribly frustrating, you know. I used to have a sharp mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright. We can look up your medications through the clinic's system, if you don’t mind me checking your chart?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, by all means. Do whatever you need to do. It’s probably all there, neatly recorded. My wife is very meticulous about such things. I’m afraid my memory isn't what it once was. Go ahead, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krok, I'm looking at your record now. It appears you’re currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for your high blood pressure, and you’ve been on it for several years. And I see a note from ten years ago confirming the enlarged prostate. Now, just a few more questions. Have you had any recent surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had a need for them, thankfully. I've always been a robust individual. A bit of arthritis, a bit of high blood pressure… but nothing that required a knife, thankfully. I have a healthy aversion to hospitals, you see. Far too many germs.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Well, my father lived to a good age, I believe. A heart ailment, eventually. My mother, she passed away relatively young, some sort of illness. Can't recall the details now. My brother, he was always a sickly sort, prone to catching every cold that went around. No… I don’t believe there's any history of… this sort of thing in the family. No, not that I recall. Though, family records weren't always kept meticulously, you understand. It was a different time.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for what you can recall, Mr. Krok. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmm. Well, I enjoy gardening, mostly. Tomatoes, cucumbers… a bit of squash. Keeps me active, you see. I used to enjoy a good game of chess, but my eyesight isn't what it once was. And…I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. A good Shiraz, perhaps. Nothing excessive, you understand. And… I used to smoke a pipe, years ago. Gave that up a long time ago, thankfully. My wife insisted.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. That’s very helpful. So, gardening, occasional wine, and you previously smoked a pipe but have quit. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements… hmm. Let me think… My wife gives me something for my joints, occasionally. Some sort of powder, I believe. Mix it with water. Glucosamine, perhaps? Or something like that. And… I take an aspirin every morning, for my heart, she says. Just a small one. And… that’s all I can recall, Doctor. Honestly, my wife handles all of that. I'm a bit lost in the details, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine supplement and a daily aspirin. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… hmm. Well, I suppose so. I'm not a fan of being poked and prodded, you understand. But if it’s necessary… Yes, go ahead. But please be gentle. And… perhaps explain what you're doing as you go along? I like to know what's happening, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I’ll explain everything as I go. We’ll start with checking your vital signs—your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Finally, I'll need to perform a brief abdominal exam and a genital exam to assess the source of the discharge. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated but not critically high. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses felt. Now, I’ll need to perform a brief genital exam. I’ll be wearing gloves, and I’ll maintain your privacy as much as possible. I’m looking for any signs of inflammation or infection. Okay, Mr. Krok. During the exam, I observed some mild redness around the opening of the urethra, and there is a small amount of discharge present. There is no obvious pain with palpation of the prostate. I’ll need to send a sample of the discharge to the lab for analysis to determine the cause.
PATIENT: Redness, you say? Discharge… Yes, that’s what my wife noticed. It's all rather unpleasant, isn't it? And you think a laboratory analysis is necessary? What sort of… analysis? I hope it’s not too invasive. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a fan of all this poking and prodding. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok. It is a bit unpleasant, but it’s necessary to determine the cause of the discharge and ensure we get you the right treatment. The laboratory analysis, a urine test and a sample of the discharge, will help us identify if there's an infection—either a bacterial infection, like gonorrhea or chlamydia, or another type of infection. It will also help rule out other potential causes. The sample collection is not overly invasive; it involves a simple swab. Based on my initial examination, it’s unlikely to be anything overly serious, but we need the lab results to confirm. The redness could be a sign of inflammation, which is common with infections. I also want to check your prostate one more time. It's important to rule out prostatitis, an inflammation of the prostate. This will involve a digital rectal exam, which is where I gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel the prostate gland. I know it’s not comfortable, but it will give me more information. Would you be alright with that?
PATIENT: A digital… rectal exam? Honestly, Doctor, you're not making this easy. I suppose… I suppose I have no choice, do I? If it's necessary… very well. But please, be quick about it. And gentle. My wife will be most displeased if I’m in too much discomfort. It’s all rather… humiliating, you see. I'm an old man, Doctor, not some young buck.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok. And I assure you, I will be as gentle and quick as possible. It won't take long. Okay, Mr. Krok. Your prostate is slightly enlarged, as noted in your previous records, but it's not acutely tender. There are no obvious nodules or masses felt. Alright, Mr. Krok. Now that I’ve completed the examination, I will send the samples to the lab. The results should be back in about 3-5 business days. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids—about 8 glasses of water a day—to help flush out your system. And try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the urinary tract. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Three to five days… Hmm. Very well. Plenty of fluids… no caffeine… Yes, I can manage that, I suppose. My wife makes a lovely chamomile tea, quite soothing. And… what if it is an infection, Doctor? What sort of treatment would I require? Will it be… painful? And is it… contagious? My wife and I… well, we are quite close. I wouldn't want to… pass anything on to her.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Mr. Krok. Let’s address them one by one. If it is an infection, the treatment will depend on the type of infection. Most bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics—either orally or sometimes intravenously, if it’s a more severe case. The antibiotics typically cause some mild side effects, such as nausea or diarrhea, but they are generally well-tolerated. As for pain, the antibiotics themselves shouldn't cause significant pain. However, you might experience some mild discomfort or burning sensation during urination while you're taking the antibiotics. And yes, some infections are contagious, particularly sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea or chlamydia. However, these infections are easily treated with antibiotics, and your wife can be tested and treated as well if necessary. We would, of course, discuss testing options for your wife if the lab results indicate a contagious infection. It's important to get both of you treated to prevent reinfection. For now, let's focus on getting the lab results back. Once we have those, we can develop a specific treatment plan tailored to your needs. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Contagious… Well, that’s… concerning. My wife would be most upset. Yes, testing her… that’s… sensible, I suppose. I wouldn't want to put her at risk. No, I don’t believe I have any other questions at the moment, Doctor. Just… get the results back as quickly as possible, please. And… try not to poke and prod too much next time, if there is a next time. This old body isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I’ll prioritize getting those results back to you as quickly as possible. And I assure you, I’ll be as gentle as possible with any future examinations. Here’s what we’ll do. I’ll give you a written summary of today’s visit, including the instructions to drink plenty of fluids and avoid caffeine. I’ll also give you a lab requisition form for your wife, just in case we need it. And I’ll call you as soon as the lab results are back, typically within 3-5 business days. Do you have any questions about the paperwork?
PATIENT: No, no paperwork questions. My wife handles all of that, you understand. Just… call with the results. And thank you, Doctor. For… everything. It’s been… informative, I suppose. Though, I must say, it hasn’t been the most pleasant morning. I believe that’s all. Good day to you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krok. I understand it wasn’t the most pleasant experience, but I’m glad we could get everything checked out. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before I call with the results. Have a good day as well, Mr. Krok. And please, take care of yourself.
