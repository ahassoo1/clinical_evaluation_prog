DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... well, it's... about starting a family, I think. My... a friend and I, we are thinking about having a baby. I just... wanted to make sure everything is okay first, you know? It's been a long time since... well, since I thought about these things. I’m not sure where to begin.
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful idea, Mr. Verrall. It's always a good idea to get a check-up before starting a family, especially after a long time. We’ll go through everything, and I'll do my best to answer all your questions. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health... ... That’s a good question. I work, mostly. Sales, traveling around. Not much exercise, I’m afraid. I eat... when I can. Sometimes it’s not the healthiest things, when you're on the road. I don't get sick often, I think. Just the usual colds, maybe. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time, honestly. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s not bad, Mr. Verrall, but it's good that you're here now. Traveling for sales and irregular eating habits can definitely impact health, and we'll want to address that. Let's start with a bit more detail about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… diabetes… I don't think so. I’ve never been told I have those. I had… something with my stomach when I was younger, a long time ago. But it was fixed, I think. Just a bad infection. And… I broke my arm once, when I was a boy. Does that count? I really can’t remember much beyond that. It was a long time ago, Doctor. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s not always easy to recall things from the past. The stomach infection is good to know, and a broken arm isn’t usually relevant, but thank you for mentioning it. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… …No, I don't think so. Not that I remember. Nothing major, anyway. Maybe… maybe I had my tonsils out when I was very small? My mother might have told me, but… I don't recall going to the hospital for anything serious. I've been pretty lucky, I suppose. Or… maybe I just don't remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. We'll proceed as if there haven’t been any surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any genetic illnesses?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tough one. My… my parents are both gone now. And I didn't really talk to my relatives much. I know my father had some problems with his heart, I think. He was… not very healthy, towards the end. And my mother… she had trouble with her… bones, maybe? Arthritis, something like that. But beyond that… I don't really know. It’s not something we talked about much. It’s a… complicated story, my family.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Verrall. Family history can be difficult to gather, especially with loss and complicated relationships. Knowing about your father’s heart problems and your mother’s possible arthritis is helpful, though. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, not at all. Never smoked a day in my life. And I very rarely drink. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, now and then. But not often. And… definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested in those. I like a quiet life, mostly. And work keeps me busy enough.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Verrall. Now, let’s see if you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things. And I've taken medicines before, for colds and headaches, and never had any trouble. I don't have any skin allergies either, as far as I know. I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. So, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just… vitamins sometimes, when I remember. But mostly, I don’t take anything regularly. I try to eat healthy when I can, and get enough sleep. Which… is not always easy, with the traveling. But no prescriptions, no daily pills, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’m a bit nervous, if I’m honest. It’s been a long time since I’ve been to a doctor. But I understand it’s important.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright to be nervous, Mr. Verrall. It’s good you're here, and we’ll take things at your pace. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 142/88. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. It's not alarming, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, your exam is within normal limits, but the elevated blood pressure and slight heart murmur warrant further investigation. Do you have any questions about what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure… a murmur… Is that bad, Doctor? Should I be worried? I don't understand what a murmur is. And what does “investigation” mean? Will I need… tests? I'm a little scared, to be honest. I haven’t been feeling unwell, so this is… unexpected.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be concerned, Mr. Verrall, especially when you're not experiencing symptoms. Let me explain. Elevated blood pressure, also known as hypertension, means your heart is working a little harder to pump blood through your body. It’s common, and often manageable with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. A heart murmur is simply an extra sound your heart makes while beating. Many murmurs are harmless, often called "innocent murmurs," but it's important to determine the cause to rule out anything serious. By "investigation," I mean we’ll need to do some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Specifically, I’d like to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a lipid panel to check your cholesterol, an electrocardiogram to look at your heart’s electrical activity, and a urine analysis. We might also consider an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart, to get a more detailed look at its structure and function. These tests will help us determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure and the heart murmur, and guide any necessary treatment. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Wow… that’s a lot. CBC… CMP… lipid panel… It all sounds very complicated. And an… echo-whatsit? An ultrasound of my heart? I’m not sure I understand all of that. What will these tests do exactly? And will they hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I'm also worried about the cost… I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: You're right, it does sound like a lot, Mr. Verrall. Don't worry, I'll explain everything as clearly as I can. The CBC checks the different types of cells in your blood, which can help detect infections or other problems. It's a simple blood draw. The CMP checks your kidney and liver function, as well as your blood sugar and electrolyte levels. Another simple blood draw. The lipid panel checks your cholesterol levels, which can help assess your risk of heart disease. Again, a blood draw. The ECG records the electrical activity of your heart, which can help detect irregular heartbeats or other heart problems. It's a painless test where we attach small electrodes to your chest. The echocardiogram uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart. It's painless, but requires a technician to move a probe around on your chest. None of these tests should hurt significantly. You might feel a slight pinch with the blood draws, but that’s it. The results typically take 24-72 hours to come back, depending on the lab. I understand your concern about the cost, and that you don't have insurance. I can discuss options with you, like potential financial assistance programs or looking for labs that offer discounted rates. The cost will vary depending on the lab, but I will do my best to find the most affordable options. We can also prioritize the most essential tests first. Would you like me to connect you with our billing department to explore those options?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful, Doctor. I’m a bit overwhelmed with all this… and the thought of the cost is worrying me. I’m happy to do the tests, if they’re necessary, but I need to know what to expect. And maybe… could we start with the least expensive ones first? I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It helps a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. I completely understand. It’s a lot to take in. I’ll have our billing department contact you directly to discuss payment options and potential assistance programs. We’ll certainly prioritize the least expensive tests first. I recommend starting with the CBC, CMP, and lipid panel. These will give us a good baseline understanding of your overall health. While we’re waiting for those results, let’s discuss some lifestyle modifications that can help lower your blood pressure. Things like reducing salt intake, eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, regular exercise, and stress management can make a big difference. I'll also give you a handout with information on these lifestyle changes. Do you have any questions about that, or about anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Lifestyle changes… I suppose I could try to eat better. It’s hard when I’m traveling, but I could pack some healthier snacks. And maybe walk more instead of taking taxis when I can. It’s just… I’ve gotten into bad habits over the years. But I’m willing to try. A handout would be helpful, yes. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It takes courage to address these things, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Small changes can make a big difference over time. Here's that handout. It includes tips on diet, exercise, and stress management. So, to recap, we'll order the CBC, CMP, and lipid panel, and I’ll have the billing department contact you about costs. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results and plan further steps. In the meantime, please try to focus on incorporating some healthier habits into your routine. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Pfennig. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll try my best to follow your advice and I’ll look forward to hearing from the billing department. And I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care and have a good week.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again.
