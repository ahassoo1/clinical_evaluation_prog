DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I'm Dr. Press. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Well, I’m trying out for a… a sports team. Need to get a check-up, make sure I'm still in good enough shape, you know? It’s for the… uh… the Eagles. Local team.
DOCTOR: The Eagles, right. And you’re trying out… at 62?
PATIENT: Yeah, well, age is just a number, right? I keep myself fit. Used to be a wrestler, a long time ago. Still do some training. It's a… a different kind of team than you might be thinking. Not the NFL. More… recreational. But still competitive.
DOCTOR: I see. And is this a new development, this tryout, or have you been maintaining this level of activity for some time?
PATIENT: Oh, for a while now, yeah. Been training with the guys for… maybe six months? This tryout is just to see if I can actually play a game, you know? It’s a bit more serious than just the workouts.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any… difficulties with the training?
PATIENT: Difficulties? Not really. Just… takes a bit longer to recover, that’s all. Knees get a little creaky sometimes. Nothing a good rub doesn’t fix. And maybe a little ibuprofen. But nothing serious. I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, just now and then. After a hard session. Like I said, nothing regular. Maybe… two or three times a month? It helps with the soreness, you know? Is that… bad? I don’t really keep track.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, while occasional use isn't necessarily alarming, frequent use of ibuprofen can have side effects, particularly with your age. We need to get a better understanding of how much you’re taking and for how long. Now, let's move on to a full review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Uh… not really? Everything seems… normal, I guess. What do you mean? Is that… related to the ibuprofen? I just thought you were asking about my knees.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Kingan. We need to assess your overall health. Let's start with your heart. Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Sometimes a bit winded, but that's just from the training, I think. Palpitations… what are those? Like, my heart racing? No, not really. Everything feels… okay. Look, is this going to take long? I have a thing later.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, a thorough medical history is vital, especially before undertaking strenuous activity. Now, do you have any history of high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think so? The doctor told me a while back, something about watching my salt. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Never been told that. Honestly, Doctor, I go to the doctor when something hurts. Not just for check-ups. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. I need to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your knees. If you'll just lie down on the examination table, please.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just… try to be quick, alright? I really need to get going after this. It's… a bit complicated.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat and relax. I'm going to start with your blood pressure. 160 over 92… not ideal. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing is a bit labored, some mild crackles in the lower lobes... and a slight murmur. Now, knees. Which knee bothers you more?
PATIENT: The right one, I guess. It’s a bit stiff in the morning. Feels… grindy, if that makes sense. Not much pain, just… uncomfortable. And the crackles? Is that bad? Look, Doctor, I just need a piece of paper saying I'm fit to play. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: There's some crepitus, as you mentioned, and mild tenderness over the medial joint line. Range of motion is limited. Mr. Kingan, with all due respect, I cannot simply sign off on a form stating you're fit to play without a proper workup. Your blood pressure is elevated, I detected a heart murmur, and your knees show signs of osteoarthritis. To proceed safely, I recommend an EKG, a chest X-ray, and a referral to an orthopedist. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues and assess the extent of the damage to your knees. Playing a sport, even a recreational one, in your current condition could be dangerous.
PATIENT: An EKG? A chest X-ray? Look, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, but I'm not going to go through all that. I just need to know if I can play or not! This team… it’s important to me. I haven't been feeling this good in years. I just want to enjoy myself. Can’t you just… give me something for my knees? Maybe some stronger ibuprofen? I'll be careful, I promise!
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your enthusiasm, but my priority is your well-being. Prescribing stronger medication without a proper diagnosis would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. You have multiple concerning symptoms that require investigation. I strongly advise you to reconsider your refusal of these tests. We need to establish a baseline of your cardiac and musculoskeletal health before you risk exacerbating any existing conditions. I’m not willing to compromise your safety for the sake of a recreational sports team. I can provide you with a referral to a cardiologist and an orthopedist. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor… this is ridiculous. Fine. Fine, send me to your cardiologists and orthopedists. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time and money. Just… please hurry. I need to get this done as quickly as possible. And… can you at least write me something for the pain in the meantime? Just to tide me over?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will schedule you appointments with both a cardiologist, Dr. Anya Sharma, and an orthopedist, Dr. Ben Carter. I’ll have the receptionist provide you with their contact information and appointment dates as you leave. As for pain management, I can prescribe a short course of naproxen, but I want to be clear: this is only a temporary solution, and it does not address the underlying issues. It is crucial that you follow up with the specialists and adhere to their recommendations. Here is the prescription. Please take it as directed. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, that’s all. Just… get me out of here. And tell your receptionist to make the appointments as soon as possible. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist will be in touch. Please, do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. .
