DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're a new patient to the practice. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, first time here. Uh… well, it's these bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They’re red and… kinda hard, you know? And they hurt. Not all the time, but when I brush against them, ouch. That’s why I came. They've been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Alright, bumps on the shins, red, hard, and painful to the touch. And you say this has been ongoing for "a little while?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… three, four months now? It started with just one, I think. Then another. Now there’s… well, I stopped counting. They don't itch, thankfully. Just… ache when you touch 'em. And they're getting a little bigger, I think. Not fast, but… noticeable. I work a lot on my feet, so I figured maybe it's something from that.
DOCTOR: Work on your feet, you say. What sort of work do you do, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: I move freight, mostly. Hand loading and unloading. Warehouse work, you know? Been doing it a long time. It keeps me busy, but it's hard on the body, for sure. Lots of walking and bending. Sometimes lifting heavy things too, but not too heavy. Mostly boxes and stuff. I try to be careful. But these bumps… they don't feel like a strain or something like that. More like… something in the skin. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Something in the skin… I see. And just to clarify, these bumps are solely on your shins?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just my shins. Both legs, kinda the same amount on each one. Not anywhere else on my body. And they're… well, they look kinda round. Like little… knots. I showed my wife, but she’s not a doctor, so she just said I should come see you. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Aluia. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. No problem. I hope it’s not anything too serious. I need to keep working, you know? Bills don’t pay themselves.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. And I understand your concerns about work. We'll do our best to determine the cause and a suitable plan. Now, if you’ll allow me, I'm going to palpate the bumps on your shins. Please let me know if anything is particularly tender.
PATIENT: Okay, go ahead. I'll tell you if it hurts. Just be gentle, alright? My legs get tired easy these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. They are firm, as you said, and slightly raised. No warmth to the touch, no signs of infection at this point. I do note some slight discoloration of the skin surrounding a few of the lesions. And yes, these are tender to the touch, as you indicated. They appear to be located directly over the periosteum. Based on this initial examination, they could be shin splints, although the lack of a recent increase in activity is unusual. Given the firm nature and the location, we should rule out other possibilities as well. Have you had any recent injuries to your legs?
PATIENT: Injuries? Not really. I bump my shins sometimes, working in the warehouse, you know? But nothing serious. Like a little knock against a box or something. It hurts for a minute, then it goes away. I haven't fallen or anything. I’ve been working at the same place for… oh, goodness, almost 20 years now. I know the layout pretty well. I haven't had any cuts or scrapes on my shins either, that I remember. Is this… is this something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, it's difficult to say definitively at this stage. Shin splints are a possibility, but the persistence and firmness of these lesions warrant further investigation to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out any underlying systemic issues. Additionally, I’m going to order an X-ray of both shins to assess the bone structure and rule out stress fractures or other bony abnormalities. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Uh… I don’t think so. Never had an X-ray with dye before. I've had a few X-rays over the years, broken a rib when I was younger, playing baseball. But just regular ones, nothing with dye. My wife has some allergies, but I don’t. I’m usually okay with most things. I take a little medicine for my blood pressure, but that’s all. Does the dye… does it hurt when they give it to you?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Aluia, the dye itself doesn’t typically cause pain. It’s administered intravenously, and some patients experience a mild warming sensation. It’s more important to rule out an allergic reaction, which is why I ask. Now, regarding your blood pressure medication, what specifically are you taking?
PATIENT: Oh! Right, sorry, Doctor. I get a little forgetful sometimes. I take… Lisinopril, I think. A little white pill. Ten milligrams. I take it every morning with my breakfast. My wife helps me keep track of my pills, mostly. She’s very organized. She'd be mad if I forgot to tell you.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, ten milligrams daily. Alright. We'll proceed with the blood work and X-rays. I'll have my nurse draw the blood now and send you to radiology afterward. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend you reduce your activity level and avoid any strenuous work that aggravates the pain. We'll discuss the results and formulate a plan once they are available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Reduce my activity… yeah, I can do that. It’s hard, but… I need to take care of myself, I guess. Um… will this be expensive? The tests, I mean. I have Medicare, but… sometimes there are still costs. And my wife and I are on a fixed income.
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, Medicare typically covers these standard diagnostic tests. However, there may be copays or deductibles depending on your specific plan. My nurse can provide you with information on potential costs and assist you with any billing questions. I assure you, we’ll do our best to keep the costs reasonable. Now, let's get the blood work and X-rays ordered, and then we can discuss this further. I'll have the nurse come in shortly. Is there anything else before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything for now. Thank you. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to look at my legs. It's just… worrying about bills, you know? I’m sure it’ll be alright. Just want to get back to work, if I can.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Aluia. Let’s proceed. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: .
