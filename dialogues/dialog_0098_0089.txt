DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… lovely to meet you. Oh dear, what does bring me in? It's a bit of a muddle, honestly. I’ve been having some… well, pain. Down low, in my tummy. It comes and goes, but when it does come… it’s quite something. I believe it has something to do with… the lupus? Yes, that’s it. I was diagnosed some years ago, and I’ve been told it can flare up in different ways. But this pain… it’s been particularly troublesome lately. I apologize for being so vague; my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Yes, lupus can certainly present in many ways, and flares are common. It's perfectly alright to be vague, we'll get to the bottom of it together. “Down low in your tummy,” you said. Can you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Describing it… that's tricky. It’s not… a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… cramping, I suppose? Like a very strong squeezing. And sometimes it feels… deep? Like it’s not just on the surface. It’s hard to explain. It comes in waves, you see. And it… radiates? Does that make sense? It sort of spreads out. Mostly it’s in the middle, but sometimes I feel it on my sides, too. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least. And it feels… different each time. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, other times it knocks me flat. I do apologize for rambling.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Ms. Glymph. That's helpful information, thank you. "Cramping, deep pain that radiates," and varying intensity… I see. And how long has this particular flare-up been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. How long… Let me see. It feels like… weeks, perhaps? But time… it slips away from me. I believe it started gradually, a little niggle here and there, and then it built up. I think it’s been worse the last week or so. I’ve been trying to manage it with… over-the-counter remedies, you know, things for stomach upset. But they don’t seem to be doing much good. I truly can’t pinpoint a date, I'm afraid. It's all a bit of a blur. Would looking at my appointment history help? Perhaps I went to the doctor about it previously?
DOCTOR: Yes, let me just take a look at your recent appointments… Ah, yes. It appears you saw Dr. Ramirez about similar symptoms six months ago. She noted some abdominal discomfort and ordered some blood work. Let's see… the results here indicate slightly elevated inflammation markers, but nothing definitive at that time. Ms. Glymph, do you recall anything about what Dr. Ramirez discussed with you then?
PATIENT: Oh, Dr. Ramirez… a very kind woman! Six months ago… hmm. I remember feeling unwell, certainly. And the blood work… yes. She said something about my lupus being… stable, mostly. But that the inflammation could be causing some discomfort. She suggested… watching it, I think? And taking some pain relief when needed. I’m afraid the details are a bit hazy. I remember being reassured, mostly. That it wasn't anything serious. But this… this feels different. More intense, perhaps. And it’s lasting longer. I did try to manage it with the remedies she suggested, but they haven’t been very effective this time around. It’s just… worrying. I always worry when the lupus flares up.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Glymph. It's good you were previously seen and evaluated. “More intense and lasting longer” are important points. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a bit more of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits – anything different with your stools, or how often you’re going?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Bowel habits… that feels… rather personal. Well… let me see. I suppose… they have been a bit… irregular. Not terribly so, but not my usual routine. A little constipation, mostly. And sometimes… a bit of diarrhea. It’s… unpredictable, really. It hasn’t been constant, more like it comes and goes. And it's often tied to the pain, I think. When the pain is worse, my stomach… isn’t happy. I apologize for being so… circumlocutory. This is all very unpleasant to discuss. I do hope we can get to the bottom of it soon. It’s just… draining. Both physically and mentally.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary at all, Ms. Glymph. These are important details, and it's perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable discussing them. It’s helpful to know about the irregularity and its connection to the pain. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this flare-up?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Other symptoms… Yes, actually. I’ve been rather… tired. More tired than usual, even for me. And a little bit of nausea, not constantly, but it comes in waves, like the pain. I haven't actually been sick, but I feel… queasy, sometimes. And… this might sound silly, but I’ve been feeling a bit warm, flushed, you know? Not a fever, exactly, but warmer than usual. And… my joints have been aching a bit more. My hands, mostly, and my knees. They’re not swollen or anything, just… achy. It's hard to say if it's related, though. My joints often ache with the lupus. It's all so… interconnected, isn't it? It’s difficult to pinpoint what’s causing what.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is interconnected, Ms. Glymph. Fatigue, nausea, warmth, and increased joint pain are all things we need to consider. Just to complete the picture, are you experiencing any changes in your urine – color, frequency, or any pain or burning?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My urine… Now you are asking personal questions! Well… I haven’t noticed anything dramatically different, honestly. The color seems normal. I suppose I’ve been going a bit more frequently, but I’ve been drinking more water, trying to stay hydrated with all this… unpleasantness. And no, no pain or burning. Nothing like that. Just… more trips to the restroom. I do apologize for being so… rambling. I feel like I'm just listing symptoms now, without any coherence. Is this helpful, Doctor? I’m afraid I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Glymph, and not at all rambling. Every detail is important. Alright. Now, do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see... I take Hydroxychloroquine, for the lupus, of course. I've been on that for years. And I take a low-dose Aspirin, as a preventative measure. And I take a Vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were a bit low. Oh, and occasionally, when my joints are particularly achy, I take Naproxen, an anti-inflammatory. But I try not to take it too often. And that's it, I believe. Just those few things. I try to be diligent about taking them, but sometimes... well, sometimes I forget. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. Is that important, Doctor? Would forgetting a dose affect things?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Ms. Glymph. Forgetting a dose occasionally is not usually a major concern, but we should be mindful of it. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me see. No, I don’t believe so. I've never had a severe reaction to anything, thankfully. I might get a little bit of a sniffle with certain pollens in the spring, but nothing serious. And no food allergies that I'm aware of. I can eat pretty much anything. My mother always said I had an iron stomach! No, no allergies that I know of. I am quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. Is that all, Doctor? Are we getting closer to understanding what’s going on? I truly appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's… comforting to talk to someone who understands.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Glymph. You’ve given me a lot of valuable information, thank you. Alright, with your permission, I would like to do a brief physical exam now. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical exam sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Yes, please do. Listen to my heart and lungs, and… palpate my abdomen. You’ll have to forgive me if I flinch a little; it’s been rather sensitive lately. But I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I just want to figure out what’s going on, and get back to feeling like myself again. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I’ll try to remain as still as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That’s… a bit uncomfortable. Not terribly painful, but… definitely tender. More on the right side, I think. It’s… a dull ache, rather than a sharp pain. It’s difficult to describe. It feels… sensitive, like there’s something… inflamed underneath. And… yes, a little bit lower down, too. It’s… radiating, like it’s spreading outwards. Please, don’t hesitate to stop if it’s too much. I just want you to know what you're feeling. It's… a bit unnerving, honestly. Is that normal, Doctor? Should it be this sensitive?
DOCTOR: I’m being very gentle, Ms. Glymph, and I’ll stop if it’s too much. The tenderness on the right side, and the radiation you’re describing, are concerning. I also note some mild guarding, which means your muscles are instinctively tightening to protect your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but there’s a small amount of rebound tenderness. Based on this exam, and your symptoms, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on, but it could be a flare of your lupus, or another issue entirely. Given the location of the tenderness, and the presence of rebound tenderness, I think it would be prudent to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will help us rule out other possibilities, such as appendicitis or diverticulitis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A CT scan… that sounds… rather serious. But if it will help to figure out what’s going on, then yes, please do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I suppose… it’s better to be safe than sorry. Blood work and a CT scan… alright. I just hope it’s not anything too… dreadful. I do apologize for being so… anxious. It’s just… this pain is quite debilitating, and I worry about what it might signify. And the lupus… it’s always lurking in the background, isn’t it? Yes, please, proceed with the blood work and the CT scan. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for taking my concerns seriously. I feel a little bit better already, just knowing that we’re taking steps to investigate.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, and I’m glad you feel a little better knowing we’re investigating. I'll write the orders for the blood work and CT scan now. The lab will take a sample from your arm, and the CT scan is a painless imaging test. The radiology department will schedule it for you, and we’ll review the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a mild pain reliever to help manage the discomfort. I also want you to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. And if the pain worsens significantly, or you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A mild pain reliever… yes, that would be wonderful. And I will avoid heavy lifting, certainly. And… if the pain worsens, or I develop a fever… yes, I understand. That's… quite a lot to take in. Actually, yes, I do have a question. The CT scan… will it involve any radiation? I've heard things about the risks of radiation exposure. And… will the results be available quickly? I'm rather anxious about waiting. And… Should I be worried? Is this something serious, Doctor? Please, be honest with me. I understand if you can’t give me a definitive answer, but… any reassurance would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Ms. Glymph. Yes, a CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation exposure. However, the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis and ruling out serious conditions far outweigh the risks in this case. The radiation dose is minimal, and we use the lowest possible setting to obtain the necessary images. As for how quickly the results will be available, it typically takes a few hours for the radiologist to interpret the scan. I will check on them regularly and let you know as soon as I have the results. As for whether you should be worried… it’s understandable to be anxious, but I don’t want you to panic. The tenderness and your symptoms could be a flare of your lupus, or something else entirely. The CT scan will help us determine the cause, and we’ll develop a treatment plan accordingly. It's too early to say definitively what's going on, but we are taking all the necessary steps to investigate and ensure you receive the best possible care. I want to be honest with you: given the location of the pain and the presence of guarding, we need to rule out more serious conditions, like appendicitis or diverticulitis. But that doesn't mean those are what's going on. We are simply being thorough. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That… that is reassuring, thank you, Doctor. Being thorough… yes, that makes sense. And the lupus… it’s always lurking, isn’t it? So, a CT scan to rule out… appendicitis and diverticulitis. Yes. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at this moment. I suppose… I just need to try and remain calm, and wait for the results. And… I will try to avoid any heavy lifting, and keep a close eye on the pain. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. You’ve been very kind and patient with me, and I appreciate it more than words can say. I feel a little bit better already, knowing that we’re on top of things. And… thank you for being honest with me. That means a lot. I think… I think that’s all for now. Perhaps I’ll see you again when the results are available?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Glymph. That’s perfectly alright. I will be in touch as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them in detail then. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Get some rest, and I’ll see you soon. Take care.
