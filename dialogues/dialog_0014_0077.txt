DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Good morning to you too, Doctor. They say I gotta come. Something about the… the place I work. Been working there a long time, you know. Never had trouble before. They just… told me to come get checked. Don't feel sick, mind you.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's… good you're not feeling sick, but sometimes things show up before you do, you understand?
PATIENT: Show up? Like… a surprise? I don’t understand. I feel fine. Strong as an elephant, nearly. What kinda things are you lookin’ for, exactly? They didn’t tell me what they wanted you to check. Just… come. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s standard protocol for long-term employees, especially given… your age. It's not necessarily about old age, though that does factor in. They likely want to ensure everything’s functioning as it should. Let’s start with a bit of your history. Have you had any major illnesses, anything you've been treated for regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Hmm. Not really. Had the usual… fever when I was a boy. Malaria, I think. Everyone gets malaria back home. And my wife… bless her soul… she used to drag me to the doctor for little things. But me? I'm a strong man! Never needed much doctoring. Just… the fever, a long time ago. And maybe a cough now and then when the harmattan winds blow.
DOCTOR: Alright. Malaria as a child… and occasional coughs. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No! Never had no surgeries. Why would I need surgery? I told you, I’m strong! I still work, you know. Down in the mine. Hard work, but good work. No time for… cuttin’ and slicin’. Never needed it. Don't mess with what works, I always say.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. No surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My wife is… gone now. Passed on a few years back. Good woman, she was. We had children, yes. Three boys and two girls. They all… gone to the city. Lagos. Big city, Lagos. Don't come to visit much. Too busy. They send money, though. That's good. Don’t see them much, but they send money. What about my family? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It can be. Sometimes conditions run in families. Did anyone in your family have… heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: High… what did you say? High… pressure? Not that I know of. My father… he was a farmer. Strong as a bull, that one. Lived a long life, he did. Worked the land till the very end. My mother… she made palm wine. Good wine, she did. But I don’t remember anyone havin’… what did you call it? Pressure. Or… sugar sickness. They just… worked hard and lived. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No known family history of those conditions. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never taken no medications. What for? I don’t need medications. I eat good food. Palm oil, yams, fish… that’s all I need. My wife… she used to take little pills for her headaches. But me? No pills. Waste of money, I say. Strong man doesn't need pills.
DOCTOR: Very well. No medications. And do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? What kinda allergies? Like… to the sun? No. I work outside all day. Sun is hot, but I don't get… allergic. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when the dust blows, but that's just dust. No allergies, Doctor. I'm a strong man! Never had allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Now, to get a better picture of things, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? You mean… poke and prod? Is it gonna take long? I got things to do, you know. Though, if it's quick… alright. Go ahead. But be gentle, eh? This old body is all I got.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure, just to be sure. And I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Roll up your sleeve, please. 160 over 95. Hmm. A little elevated. Breathing sounds are a bit… diminished. Heart sounds are regular, but a little… faint. And your chest feels… somewhat congested. I'd like to check your reflexes now.
PATIENT: Elevated? What’s elevated? Is that bad? Diminished? Faint? You’re using too many big words, Doctor! Congested? I told you, I feel fine! I’ve been down in that mine for forty years! A little dust, that’s all. Forty years, you know! What’s all this poking and prodding for? Just tell me straight: am I sick or not?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, “sick” is a very broad term. Your blood pressure is higher than it should be, and your lungs don’t sound as clear as they ought to. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything drastic, but it warrants further investigation. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. It’s standard procedure, given your age and occupation. The X-ray will help us see if there’s anything going on in your lungs, and the blood work will give us a better idea of your overall health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? Now you want to take my blood? And look inside my chest? Is this necessary, Doctor? I told you, I feel fine! Forty years in the mine, no trouble. Is this about the mine? They sendin’ you to scare me? To make me retire? They want to get rid of an old man, eh? I don't need X-rays and blood work! I just need a good rest and some palm wine.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, this has nothing to do with the mine or forcing you to retire. It’s about ensuring your health and wellbeing. Given your elevated blood pressure and diminished lung sounds, I strongly advise these tests. It’s better to be safe than sorry. I understand you feel fine, but these tests can detect potential problems before they become serious. Are you refusing the tests?
PATIENT: Refusing? You make it sound like I'm… difficult! I just don't see the point! You poke and prod, you take my blood, you look inside my chest… for what? To tell me I’m old? I know I’m old! Everybody knows I’m old! Look, I’ll tell you what. I’ll go home, I’ll drink some palm wine, I’ll rest for a week. Then I’ll come back. If I still feel fine, then what’s the point of all this… trouble?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, with all due respect, that's not a safe approach. Ignoring these findings could have serious consequences. I strongly recommend you reconsider. However… if you absolutely refuse, I need you to sign a waiver acknowledging your decision against medical advice. It outlines the potential risks of delaying these tests. It’s a standard form. I’ll have to document your refusal in your chart, and I will advise you to seek a second opinion if you change your mind. But I must advise strongly against it. I am a medical professional, Mr. Bigger. I am trying to help you. But I cannot force you to accept treatment you do not want.
PATIENT: Waiver? You want me to sign something? What kinda trouble is this gettin’ into? Look, I just want to go home. I don’t want no trouble with papers and signin’ and… lookin’ inside my chest. Forty years, you know? Forty years in that mine, and I’m still here! I’m a strong man. Just… let me go home. I’ll think about it. Maybe. But I don't like all this… fuss. Just tell me where to go to get this… paper signed, so I can be on my way. And no more poking and prodding, eh?
DOCTOR: Very well. The waiver is right here. Read it carefully before you sign. It explains the risks of refusing these tests and your right to seek a second opinion. I will document your refusal and advise you to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see. Just… try to rest, Mr. Bigger. And consider what I’ve said.
PATIENT: Rest? Forty years in the mine and she tells me to rest! There. Happy now? Let’s get this over with. Doctors these days… just makin’ trouble…
