DOCTOR: Good morning, Tasmia. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, okay? The nurse already went over it – it’s my blood pressure. It’s been high. My husband made me come.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse mentioned something about elevated blood pressure. I see. Alright. And how long has it been running high, would you say?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really know. He checks it all the time. Gets worried about everything. Maybe a few weeks? It’s just… always a number. He says it’s bad. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good he’s attentive to your health, even if it’s causing some concern. Feeling fine is always a good sign, but high blood pressure doesn't always have symptoms, which is why it's important to check it. Do you happen to know what the numbers were when it was highest, or roughly what he told you they were?
PATIENT: Numbers? No. He just… sighs and says it’s “too high.” Honestly, I tune him out after that. I really don't pay attention to those things. He’s the one who worries about health stuff. I just… live my life.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, let’s see if we can get a better idea of what’s going on today. I'm going to take your blood pressure myself, just to get a baseline. Then we can talk a little bit more about your overall health, if you don’t mind. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any trouble with anything. Just… get it over with, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just relax your arm, please. This won't take long. Okay, your blood pressure is reading 152 over 94. That is a bit elevated. Now, to get a fuller picture, would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: 152? Is that… bad? My husband always makes it sound so dramatic. Look, I don't have a medical history. I just… don’t go to doctors. I'm healthy. I work outside, I'm active. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand you feel healthy, and that's wonderful. But even people who are active and feel well can have high blood pressure. It doesn't always have symptoms, as we discussed. Let’s just go through a few quick questions, just to be sure. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Never. I told you, I don’t go to doctors. He takes me when he gets scared. But I’m fine. I eat normal food. I don't sit around all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? What about them? My mom was… fine. I guess. She worked. Didn’t sit around talking about her blood pressure. My dad… he’s gone. He worked too. They weren't sickly people. This is really a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I just told you! Nothing. He tries to get me to take something for my joints sometimes, but I refuse. I’d rather deal with a little soreness than fill myself with pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tasmia. Given your blood pressure reading and the fact that you haven’t been regularly monitored, I’d like to run a few simple tests. Just to rule out anything serious. A basic blood panel, a urine test, and an EKG to check your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Seriously? Now you want to poke me? Look, I’m leaving. This is ridiculous. My blood pressure is probably just a little high because I’m sitting here answering a bunch of pointless questions. It’s wasting my whole morning. I’m fine. I’m perfectly fine. .
DOCTOR: Tasmia, I understand your frustration, but elevated blood pressure can be a sign of something serious. Ignoring it could lead to health problems down the road. I strongly recommend we at least run those basic tests to get a clearer picture. If everything comes back normal, great. You can go back to your life. But it’s important to rule things out. If you refuse the tests, I have to document that. I also need to advise you to follow up with a primary care physician for regular monitoring. I can give you a list of doctors in the area. Would you like that list, or would you reconsider the tests?
