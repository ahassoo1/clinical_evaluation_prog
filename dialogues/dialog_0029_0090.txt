DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. I believe it has something to do with… a surgery? My husband… he took care of most of the arrangements. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. Something about getting cleared for it, beforehand?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like you're here for a pre-operative evaluation. We want to make sure you're healthy enough for the surgery and discuss any potential risks. Do you recall what surgery you're scheduled for, if that’s okay to ask?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s… cosmetic. Something to do with… well, I think it was my stomach. After… everything, it just… changed. It wasn't… pleasant. My husband thought it would help me feel better about myself, and I… I agreed. But the specifics… they escape me, I'm afraid. It’s terribly embarrassing to admit.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Brightful. It's very common to feel overwhelmed with details, especially when dealing with something personal like surgery. And there's absolutely no need to be embarrassed. We can figure this out together. So, it's a cosmetic procedure involving your stomach. Do you remember roughly when the surgery is scheduled?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. He… he made the appointment quite some time ago. I believe it was… sometime this month? Perhaps towards the end? August… yes, that sounds right. I… I have a calendar at home, but I haven’t been very good at looking at it lately. Everything feels a bit… hazy. Is that alright? I truly am sorry for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Ms. Brightful. We have you scheduled for a tummy tuck on August 28th. Does that sound correct?
PATIENT: August 28th… yes! That sounds right. Thank goodness. I was beginning to worry I’d completely misplaced everything. My husband would be… well, he’d be quite upset if I’d missed the appointment. He worries so much. A tummy tuck… yes. Thank you for reminding me, Doctor. That’s a great weight off my mind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Now, before we proceed, let's go over a bit of your medical history, just to be thorough. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any reactions to anything in… a very long time. But I should mention… my husband handles most of my prescriptions. He keeps track of everything. I used to be quite organized, but… things have been difficult since… well, you know. Perhaps he kept a list? I really wouldn’t know. I apologize again; I feel like I’m being a terrible patient.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize, Ms. Brightful. It’s perfectly alright, and very common for family members to assist with these things. We'll do our best to gather all the necessary information. Alright, let's move on to your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure. A small pill, every morning. And… sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little something to help me rest. Again, my husband… he makes sure I have everything I need. I believe it’s a… a light sedative? He’s very careful about dosages. He wants to make sure I’m healthy, you see. I… honestly, I couldn’t tell you the names of them. Would it be alright if we contacted him? He’d have all the specifics, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a very reasonable request. We can certainly contact your husband to verify the medications. Before we do that, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a bit complicated. I had… a rather difficult childbirth, many years ago. There were complications. And… well, my husband passed away last year. He had a… a heart condition. It was very sudden. I… I don’t recall many details. It’s… a blur. I’ve seen a doctor regularly since then, mostly for… check-ups. And… grief counselling. That’s about it, I think. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Brightful. And please, don't feel like you're rambling at all. It sounds like you’ve been through a great deal, and it’s perfectly understandable that things are difficult to recall. Knowing about the difficult childbirth and your husband's passing is important. We'll proceed at your pace. Let's just take a moment, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That… that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. A physical exam is good. I suppose it's best to be thorough. Thank you for being so… patient with me. It means a great deal. Where should I… begin?
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you don’t mind, please go ahead and lie down on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then I'll take a look at your abdomen. It's a standard check-up, nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Alright. That’s… that’s fine. Just let me know if I need to… adjust. It’s been a while since I’ve had a proper examination. Everything feels… a little stiff. Please, don’t hesitate to tell me if you need me to move a certain way. I just want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful. Just breathe normally. Deep breaths are good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute. Rhythm is regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but slightly diminished at the bases. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Just let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your abdomen is soft, but there's some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. I don't feel any obvious masses. There’s some scarring consistent with a previous surgery. Okay, that’s good. Everything seems alright so far. Now, could you tell me a bit about your weight history?
PATIENT: Oh… my weight. That’s… a sensitive topic. After my husband… passed away, I didn’t really take care of myself. I wasn’t eating properly, and I… I gained some weight. Then, I tried to lose some, but it was… difficult. It’s been a constant battle, really. I believe I’ve lost a few pounds recently, but I haven’t weighed myself in a while. He always worried about my weight… he liked me a little… fuller. I suppose I’ve fluctuated a bit over the years. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m just rambling again.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Brightful. And you’re not rambling at all. It’s perfectly normal to experience weight fluctuations, especially during times of stress or grief. Knowing this gives me a better understanding of your overall health. We’ll check your current weight and height here in the office. If you’re comfortable, could you step onto the scale when you're ready?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, of course. I… I suppose it’s best to know. Oh dear. It’s… a bit more than I thought. I haven’t looked at a scale in quite some time. Is it… bad? I always worried about disappointing him. He was very particular about… appearances.
DOCTOR: Your weight is 93 kilograms, and your height is 155 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 38.6, which falls into the obese category. It's important to remember that BMI is just one measure of health, and doesn't tell the whole story. However, it does indicate that you may be at increased risk for certain health conditions. We can discuss strategies to improve your overall health, if you're interested. This could include diet modifications, exercise, and potentially referral to a nutritionist. But first, let’s finish the exam. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. I… I suppose I knew that, deep down. He always said I needed to… take better care of myself. It’s alright. I’m used to it. As for allergies… I don't think so. But, like I said before, my husband managed my prescriptions. He’s the one who would know for sure. I haven’t had any reactions to anything in… well, I can’t really remember. Is that helpful? I truly am sorry for being so vague. I just… I feel like my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. It's common to have memory lapses, especially when dealing with stress or grief. And don’t worry about being vague – we’ll do our best to gather all the necessary information. Since you're scheduled for surgery, it's important to rule out any underlying health conditions that could complicate things. Do you have any history of heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… complicated. My husband… he had a heart condition. He passed away suddenly from it. I believe I’ve been checked for high blood pressure… yes, I take medication for that, as we discussed. Diabetes… I don’t think so, but he always worried about my sugar intake. He made sure I didn't eat too many sweets. As for other serious illnesses… I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing major. He took care of everything. I always relied on him. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m just repeating myself.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Brightful. Knowing about your husband’s heart condition and your history of high blood pressure is important. We’ll run some tests to check your blood sugar levels and assess your overall cardiovascular health. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. My husband… he wouldn’t have allowed it. He was very… strict about those things. He always said they were bad for your health. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And… no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never. Is that alright? I always tried to be a good wife.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. That's very good to know. Now, before we proceed, I’m going to need to review your insurance information and get your consent for the pre-operative tests. Can you please verify your insurance details for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Of course. I have private insurance. My husband… he took care of all the paperwork. It’s… Brightful Healthcare, I believe. The policy number… let me see. Here it is. The policy number is… BHF-789-456-123. Is that correct? I hope everything is in order. He always made sure everything was paid on time. I just… I worry about things getting mixed up. He was so organized.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Brightful. Yes, everything looks good. Brightful Healthcare, policy number BHF-789-456-123. We'll submit the pre-operative tests to your insurance for coverage. Alright, so to summarize, you are scheduled for a tummy tuck on August 28th. You have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication. Your husband recently passed away from a heart condition. And you have private insurance. Does that sound correct?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds right. That… that’s everything. It feels… strange, hearing it all laid out like that. He… he would have remembered everything. He always took care of everything. Is… is that it, Doctor? Or is there anything else I need to do? I just… I want to make sure I’m prepared. For the surgery. And… and everything else.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Brightful. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. For now, we’ve covered the basics. We'll need to get some blood work done and an EKG to assess your heart function. I’m also going to order a chest X-ray, just to be safe. I'll give you the lab orders and instructions for scheduling the tests. The results will take a few days, and once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and finalize the pre-operative plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Blood work, EKG, and a chest X-ray. I… I suppose that’s alright. Just… just tell me, Doctor… is it safe? Is the surgery safe? I… I worry. He always said I was too fragile. And… and will it hurt? I… I haven’t been through anything like this before. He always protected me from… from everything.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Brightful. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious before surgery. Let's address them one at a time. Regarding safety, every surgical procedure carries some risk, but tummy tucks are generally considered safe when performed by a qualified surgeon – which I am. We take every precaution to minimize those risks, and we'll discuss them in detail during the follow-up appointment. As for pain, we will manage your pain with medication. We'll discuss the options available to you, and we'll create a pain management plan that's tailored to your needs. You will experience some discomfort after the surgery, but we'll do everything we can to keep you comfortable. I want you to feel confident and prepared for this procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address right now?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That’s… that’s good to know. Pain management… that’s a relief. And… and the precautions… I suppose I just… I don’t want to worry him. He’s already been through so much. I… I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Maybe… maybe I’ll think of something later. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being so… patient with me. It means a lot. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Besides the tests, I mean. Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I understand your concerns, and I'm here to help in any way I can. As for preparation, for now, just focus on getting the tests scheduled. Avoid taking any blood thinners, like aspirin or ibuprofen, for two weeks before the surgery. And please, let me know if you have any pre-existing medical conditions, or if you're taking any other medications that I should be aware of. It's also important to arrange for someone to drive you home after the surgery and to help you with everyday tasks for the first few days. You'll be sore and tired, and you'll need some assistance. I'm going to have my nurse come in and give you a printed sheet with detailed pre-operative instructions. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… no, I think I understand. Avoid blood thinners, arrange for transportation… and let you know about any medications. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much for everything. I… I feel a little bit better now. A little bit less scared. I hope… I hope I won’t be too much trouble. I think… I think that’s all for now. .
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Ms. Brightful. You won't be any trouble at all. Remember, I'm here for you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will be in shortly to give you the pre-op instructions. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. .
