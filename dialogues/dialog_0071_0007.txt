DOCTOR: Good morning, Lakiya. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Galena. I am here because… it is painful. It has been painful for some time now. I would like to be done with this visit as quickly as possible, if we could.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I understand wanting to be quick. Pain, you say… can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… in my back. Lower back, mostly. It started, I think, maybe six months ago? It is a sharp pain. Not always there, but when it is… it is difficult to stand, to sit, even to breathe properly. I do physical work, you see. Fence work. It does not help.
DOCTOR: Six months… lower back, sharp pain, comes and goes… and you do a lot of physical labor, fence work specifically. Okay. Is the pain constant when it is there, or does it ebb and flow even within a given day?
PATIENT: It… flows, yes. Some hours it is barely noticeable. Others… I cannot lift a post. It is worse when I bend. Or twist. Lifting is bad too, of course. It is… a heavy job. I try to be careful, but it happens.
DOCTOR: Right. Worse with bending, twisting, lifting… and it varies throughout the day. Have you noticed anything that relieves the pain at all?
PATIENT: Relieves…? Not really. Lying down, sometimes. But I cannot lie down all day, Doctor. I have work to do. Warm water on it… a little. But it does not last. Nothing truly stops it. And the medicine… the pills… they do not seem to do much good either.
DOCTOR: Okay. So lying down offers some temporary relief, warm water a little… and the medications aren't very effective. What medications have you tried, if you recall?
PATIENT: Let me see… The white pills. Small, round. And… yellow ones. Longer. My husband… he used to get them for me. I do not remember the names. I just take what I am given. The pharmacy knows, I suppose. I have Medicare. They keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me just pull up your medication history here… Okay, I see some ibuprofen and tramadol listed. Have you been taking those regularly, or only when the pain is particularly bad?
PATIENT: Tramadol… yes. That is one of them. Ibuprofen too. I take the tramadol when it is… unbearable. The ibuprofen, more often. Every day, almost. It doesn’t stop the pain, but it makes it… less sharp, maybe. I do not like taking so many pills. It feels… wrong. But what else can I do?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're aware of the potential issues with long-term pain medication. Let's move on to some other questions, then. Have you had any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No. No numbness or tingling. My legs… they ache sometimes, after a long day. But not numbness. And my feet are fine. I can feel everything. It is just the back. Mostly. Sometimes it feels like the pain goes into my hips, a little. But not the legs.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no numbness or tingling, just aches in the legs after work and sometimes pain radiating into the hips. Have you had any problems with your bladder or bowels recently?
PATIENT: Problems…? No. Not really. Everything… works as it should. I haven’t noticed anything different. Why do you ask, Doctor? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Just routine questions, Lakiya. We need to rule out everything. Sometimes back pain can affect those areas, so I want to make sure. Alright. And have you had any fever, unexplained weight loss, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No fever. No weight loss. And I do not sweat at night. I sleep… well enough. It is a warm bed. Is this going to take much longer, Doctor? I have a job to get back to. People are counting on me.
DOCTOR: Almost finished with the questions, Lakiya, I promise. Just a few more. Do you have any history of cancer in your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she had something. A long time ago. I was young. I don’t remember exactly what it was. Something in her chest, I think. She… she passed away a long time ago. My father… he was healthy. No cancer that I know of. Is that enough? Can we get to finding out what is wrong with my back now?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That’s helpful. Alright, Lakiya, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just going to check your range of motion, feel your back, and do a few simple neurological tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: I suppose so. As long as it is quick. I need to get back to work. I do not want to keep people waiting. What exactly will you be doing? I do not like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: It will be quick, I promise. I’ll just have you lie down on the exam table. I’ll gently feel along your spine to check for tenderness or muscle spasms. Then I’ll ask you to bend forward, backward, and to the sides to see how far you can move comfortably. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes and strength in your legs. No poking or prodding, just gentle assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Just… be gentle. And please, do not take too long. I have a fence to build. Where is this table?
DOCTOR: Right this way. Just lie down comfortably on your back, and we'll get started. I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, let’s start with you lying flat on your back. Now, I’m just going to gently feel along your spine here… Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes. Right there. That hurts. A little. Not terrible, but… yes. It is always sore there. Like a knot. A tight knot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a bit of muscle spasm there. And it does feel tight, as you say. Now, I'm going to ask you to bend forward at the waist, as far as you comfortably can. Just go slowly, and stop if you feel any sharp pain. Okay… and how far were you able to go?
PATIENT: Not very far. It hurts too much. I cannot go any further. It feels like something is… pulling. Like a muscle is stuck. I can barely touch my knees. And it is painful to even try. I do not want to make it worse. Ooh… that hurt. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright. No need to push it. Let's try bending backwards gently now. Just as far as you comfortably can. And how does that feel?
PATIENT: Better. But still… uncomfortable. It is a different kind of pain. More of a stretching pain. It feels like something is… stuck. Like it needs to… pop. But I do not want to force it. I have done that before, and it made things much worse. It is all so uncomfortable. I just want it to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Just lie back down, please. I'll gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Now, I’m going to ask you to push your legs up against my hands. Push as hard as you can. Strength is good in both legs as well. Okay.
PATIENT: I am pushing as hard as I can. It is a little difficult. My legs are tired. From work, you see. But I am pushing. I am trying. Is that enough? Can you tell what is wrong now? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Everything seems to be neurologically intact, which is good. Based on your history and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a muscle strain or sprain in your lower back. It’s common with physical labor, especially bending, twisting, and lifting. However, to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to get an X-ray of your lower back. That will help us to see if there are any fractures or other bony abnormalities. Would you be alright with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray…? I do not like radiation. Is it necessary? I just have a sore back. It has happened before. Usually, it just goes away with rest. And warm water. I do not want to spend more time here. And I do not want to be exposed to… whatever that radiation is. Can you not just give me something for the pain? And tell me to rest? Is that not enough? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about radiation, Lakiya. The amount of radiation from an X-ray is very small, and the benefits of ruling out a fracture often outweigh the risks, especially since this pain has been going on for six months. However, if you’re truly opposed to an X-ray, we can proceed without one. But in that case, I would strongly recommend physical therapy. A therapist can teach you proper lifting techniques and exercises to strengthen your core and back muscles, and prevent future injuries. I can also prescribe a stronger muscle relaxant to help with the pain and spasms, and recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. Would you be interested in those options?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… that will take time. And I do not have time. But… a stronger muscle relaxant… that sounds better than nothing. And maybe the pain reliever. But I do not want anything that will make me sleepy. I need to be able to work. Can you prescribe something that will help with the pain, but not make me… slow? And I still need to know… how long until it gets better? Is this something I will have to deal with forever? I really do not want this to be forever.
DOCTOR: Okay. I can prescribe cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant that tends to be less sedating than some others. And I'll write you a prescription for naproxen for the pain and inflammation. As for how long it will take to get better… it's hard to say for sure without an X-ray. Muscle strains typically improve within a few weeks with proper rest and treatment. However, since this has been going on for six months, it may take longer, and require consistent physical therapy to fully resolve. It's unlikely to be a "forever" problem, but it will likely require ongoing management to prevent recurrence. I will also give you a handout with instructions on proper lifting techniques and back care exercises. It's important to follow those instructions carefully to avoid re-injury. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. I think that is all. Just… the prescriptions. And the handout. I need to get back to work. People are waiting. And I really hope this helps. I do not want to be in pain forever. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lakiya. I’ll have the nurse bring you the prescriptions and the handout. Remember to take the medications as directed and follow the instructions in the handout carefully. If your pain worsens or doesn’t improve after a few weeks, please come back and see me. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Get back to work safely, and take care of your back.
