DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rowbottom, yes. Look, I don't have time for pleasantries. I noticed… well, something wasn't right after using the facilities yesterday. Blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be concerning. And frankly, at my age, concerning is always the default setting, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You’re right to get it checked out, Mr. Rowbottom. It's always best to be proactive, and at any age, noticing a change like that warrants a look. So, you noticed blood after using the restroom yesterday. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it wasn't gushing, if that's what you're thinking. More like… streaks. Bright red, mostly. And it wasn't in the bowl, exactly. More… on the paper, you understand? I haven't changed my diet or anything. I eat the same sensible things I always have. Steak, mostly. A good man needs his protein, you know. Though, to be honest, the quality of steak these days… it's just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Mr. Rowbottom. So, bright red streaks on the toilet paper, not in the bowl itself. And no changes to your diet. Has this happened before, even just once?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've always… regular as clockwork, you see. Always have been. This is new. And frankly, it's unsettling. I’ve lived a long life, and my body’s usually pretty good about telling me when something’s amiss. This just… appeared. I don’t like surprises, especially not those kinds of surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rowbottom. A sudden change like this, especially with a history of regularity, is definitely worth investigating. Let's go through a little bit more detail to get a clearer picture. Besides the blood, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? You doctors always ask about everything. Look, I haven't been feeling unwell, if that's what you mean. No stomach cramps, no pain, no… weakness. Just the blood. And a general feeling of… annoyance, to be perfectly honest. It’s the principle of the thing, you see. Everything was fine before. Now it isn’t.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem extensive, Mr. Rowbottom. It's simply my way of ensuring I have a complete understanding of your health. You're right, we want to figure out why things have changed. No pain, no cramps, no weakness – that’s good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements themselves?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? What do you mean, “changes”? They're… normal. Solid. Look, I don’t spend all day examining my… output, you understand? They're what they always are. Brown. Consistent. Is this really necessary? I'm an old man, not a… a laboratory specimen.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom. I apologize if I’m being overly detailed. It's just important to rule things out. So, you’re saying the consistency is the same as usual – solid, brown. Have you noticed any changes in frequency?
PATIENT: Frequency? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom. Hasn't changed. Maybe once a day, sometimes twice if I have a particularly good steak. It’s not like I’m counting the minutes, you know? I'm not a… a statistic. This is becoming ridiculous. Are you going to actually do something, or are we just going to talk about my… habits all day?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Rowbottom. I apologize for the extensive questioning; I’m just gathering information. Let’s move toward a physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and do a quick rectal exam. This will help me assess the situation and determine what further steps might be needed. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? At my age? Really? Look, I’m not keen on having strangers poking around. Frankly, it sounds… invasive. And unnecessary. I told you, I’m perfectly regular. Solid. Brown. What more do you need to know? I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I think I’m fairly capable of knowing when something’s seriously wrong, and this… this doesn’t feel like a serious emergency. Can’t we just… take a blood test? Or something? Anything but that.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom, and I absolutely respect your wishes. A rectal exam is often helpful, but it’s not the only way to proceed. Let’s start with a blood test. We can check your complete blood count, which will give us some information about any potential blood loss and overall health. We can also test for fecal occult blood, which will determine if there's any hidden blood in your stool. Would that be a good first step for you?
PATIENT: Yes. A blood test. That sounds… reasonable. Much more reasonable. I’m not thrilled about needles, mind you, but it’s better than… that. And frankly, if it puts your mind at ease, Doctor, I’m willing. Just… please be quick about it. And try not to bruise me too badly. I have a golf game next week.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. We'll get the lab order sent over right away, and you can have your blood drawn here at the clinic. It shouldn't take too long. While we’re waiting for the results, do you have any allergies to medications or any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I've always been a strong constitution. Ate whatever was put in front of me, and never had a problem. Medical conditions… well, I’ve got the aches and pains of an old man, naturally. Arthritis in my knees, a bit of a bad back. Nothing serious. Used to smoke, years ago, but quit when my wife… well, never mind. Other than that, pretty robust for my age, I’d say. No major problems. Just… getting old. That’s the biggest condition of all, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Rowbottom. And you’re doing well to stay robust, despite it all. So, no allergies, arthritis in the knees and back, and a history of smoking, but you’ve quit – that’s excellent. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen, when my knees act up. Nothing regular. Maybe once or twice a week, if I’ve been on the golf course. And a multivitamin, to keep things… ticking over. I'm not a big fan of pills, mind you. Always preferred a good steak. But the doctor insisted, years ago. Said it wouldn't hurt. And frankly, I haven't argued with a doctor in a long time.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Rowbottom. So, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and a daily multivitamin. Alright. I’ll note all of this. While we wait for the lab results, I’m going to listen to your abdomen, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? My insides aren’t what they used to be. And try not to poke too hard. It’s a delicate operation, being an old man. Get it over with quickly. I have a perfectly good crossword puzzle waiting for me at home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I will be very gentle. I’m just going to listen in a few different spots. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright, everything sounds normal in here. No unusual sounds or tenderness. Now, we just need to wait for the lab results. It usually takes about an hour. While we’re waiting, is there anything else you’d like to discuss, or any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing that you haven’t mentioned?
PATIENT: An hour? An hour? I have things to do, Doctor! But… well, alright. I suppose I can sit here for an hour. As for other symptoms… no, not really. Just the usual aches and pains. And a bit of… forgetfulness, lately. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? Can't remember where I put my keys half the time, or what I had for breakfast. Nothing serious. My wife used to remind me of everything. But that was a long time ago. No, nothing serious. Just an hour, you say?
DOCTOR: Yes, about an hour, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll let you know as soon as the results are in. And forgetfulness is common with age, you’re right. It's often nothing to worry about. In the meantime, you can relax. I have a few magazines here, if you’d like one. Or you can just close your eyes and rest. I’ll be right here if you need anything. We will discuss the results when they come back and formulate a plan from there. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Magazines. Fine. Anything to pass the time. As long as it doesn’t involve poking and prodding. I’ll take… whatever you have. Something about golf, if you have it. Or maybe something about… history. I used to read a lot of history. Whatever. Just… let me know when those results are in. And try not to keep me waiting too long. I have a golf game to prepare for, you know. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. Here you are. And I'll be sure to let you know as soon as the results are available. Please, make yourself comfortable. .
