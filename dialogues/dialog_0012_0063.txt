DOCTOR: Hi Larin, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor Yoshino, nice to meet you too. It’s my back. It’s been… really bad lately. Like, worse than usual. It hurts all the time, but especially when I try to stand up straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain. And you said it’s been worse lately, and especially when you stand. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I work at the factory, you know, putting boxes together? It started a couple weeks ago, just a little ache. But now… now it feels like something is stuck, and pulling. Makes it hard to even bend over to put my shoes on. And sleeping… sleeping is hard. I have to lie really still, and even then it wakes me up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started a couple of weeks ago with a little ache while you're at work, at the factory putting boxes together, and has gradually gotten worse. It’s now a pulling sensation, making it difficult to bend over and affecting your sleep. I understand. Can you point to exactly where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right here. Not so much on the sides, but right here. Sometimes it feels like it goes down my leg a little, but mostly just in my back. It’s a deep ache, you know? Not like a sharp pain. More… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a deep, heavy ache right in the middle of your lower back, potentially radiating slightly down your leg. Not sharp, but more of a constant ache. And when you say it "goes down your leg," can you describe that feeling?
PATIENT: It’s not always there, Doctor. When it does go down, it feels… like a tingling. Not numb, exactly. Just… like pins and needles, but not all the way down to my foot. It’s more in the back of my thigh, you know? And it gets worse when I try to stand for too long. Sometimes it feels like it’s pulling on my leg, too. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Tingling in the back of your thigh, not going all the way to your foot, and worsens with prolonged standing. It sounds like it could be affecting a nerve. Now, have you had any back problems before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Years ago, I hurt my back at work – different job, lifting something heavy. They gave me some pills, and it got better. But it's never been completely right since then. And… well, you know. I was told a while back I have cancer. It's in my… my lungs. I see the other doctor for that. I don’t know if this back pain is… connected to that, or not. I just thought I should tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know about your history of back pain and your lung cancer diagnosis. That's important information. It's good you brought that up, and it’s certainly possible the back pain could be related. We’ll need to consider both possibilities. Just to clarify, are you currently receiving any treatment for your lung cancer?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I get… pills, every day. And I go to see Doctor Ramirez, for check-ups and… scans. He says the pills are doing okay, but… you know. It's still there. He didn’t say anything about my back hurting, though. He just checks my lungs.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re on daily medication and seeing Dr. Ramirez regularly for check-ups and scans for your lung cancer. He’s focused on your lungs, and hasn’t specifically addressed the back pain. Now, let's talk about other things. Do you have any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can feel everything. But sometimes my feet feel… cold. Even when it’s warm. And I’ve been tripping a little more lately. Not falling, just… stumbling. Like I can’t feel my feet quite right. It’s hard to explain. It’s not numbness, just… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no true numbness or weakness, but you've noticed your feet feeling cold and some instability - tripping or stumbling. That's good information. Are you experiencing any problems with your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Everything is… normal there. No trouble going to the bathroom, or anything like that. Sorry if that's a strange question.
DOCTOR: It's not a strange question at all, Larin. We ask to rule out some serious causes. Now, let’s talk about medications. Besides the pills for your cancer, are you taking anything else regularly?
PATIENT: No, just the pills Doctor Ramirez gives me. Sometimes I take something for a headache, if I have one. But that’s it. Nothing else. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but he took me off of it a couple of years ago. He said it was okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the cancer medication and occasional headache relief. You were previously on blood pressure medication but are no longer taking it. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway. I haven’t had any trouble with the cancer pills, or anything else I’ve ever taken.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your back, legs, and reflexes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on with my back. It’s really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could please lie down on your stomach for me, that would be great. Okay, I’m feeling some tenderness right here, along your spine in the lower back. There’s also some muscle spasm. Your range of motion is limited, especially when bending forward and to the sides. Reflexes are normal, and strength is 5/5 in both legs and feet. I also noticed some decreased sensation to light touch on the tops of your feet. It's subtle, but it's there. Your lungs sound clear. Okay, I think we have enough information for now. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you have a combination of mechanical back pain – likely aggravated by your work and potentially related to your previous back injury – and some possible nerve involvement, given the tingling and decreased sensation in your feet. The fact that you have a history of cancer is also important to consider.
PATIENT: That… that sounds about right. It’s just… is it the cancer? Is it getting worse? I’m scared it’s spread to my back.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Larin, and it's important we address it. While your symptoms could be related to the cancer, it’s also very common to have back pain unrelated to cancer, especially given your history of injury and the type of work you do. To be sure, we need to get some imaging done. I’d like to order an MRI of your lower back to get a better look at the spine and nerves. That will help us rule out any involvement from the cancer and identify any other potential causes of your pain, like a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. Will it show if the cancer has spread?
DOCTOR: Yes, an MRI will give us a very good look at the spine and surrounding tissues to see if there are any signs of cancer spread. It’s the best way to get a clear picture. In the meantime, while we’re waiting for the MRI, we can start some conservative treatment to help manage your pain. I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug – an NSAID – to help reduce inflammation and muscle spasm. I’ll also recommend physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles, improve your posture, and reduce your pain. Would you be able to start physical therapy right away?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I can try to get someone to watch the kids. I just… I’m worried about the pain getting worse before the MRI. Will the medicine help with that? And how long does it take to get the MRI?
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll try to get you scheduled for the MRI as quickly as possible - usually within a few days to a week. I'll have the scheduling department call you directly to set up an appointment. The muscle relaxant and NSAID should help manage the pain in the meantime. It might take a few days to reach their full effect, so please be patient. If the pain is severe, you can take them as directed on the prescription label. We can also discuss other pain management options if needed. I'm also going to give you a handout with some simple exercises you can do at home to help stretch your back and prevent further injury. It's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Do you have any questions about the medications or the exercises?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… what if the MRI shows something bad? What then?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Larin. If the MRI does show something concerning, we will discuss all of your options with you in detail. That might include referral to an oncologist for further treatment, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy. We’ll work together to develop a plan that’s right for you. It’s important to remember that we’re taking things one step at a time. We don’t know anything for sure yet, and we need to wait for the MRI results before we can make any decisions. I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Do you have a primary care physician we can coordinate with, or another specialist you're seeing?
PATIENT: Yes, I see Doctor Ramirez, for the cancer. He’s at the clinic over on Elm Street. And… well, that’s it, really. He's the only one. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better, just knowing we’re doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. I’m glad I could help ease some of your worries. I’ll send the MRI order to the radiology department and will have them contact you to schedule the appointment. I’ll also send a note to Dr. Ramirez to let him know what we’ve discussed and the plan for your back pain. Here are the prescriptions for the muscle relaxant and NSAID. Please take them as directed and let me know if you have any side effects. And remember to follow up with me after you have the MRI results. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Yoshino. You’ve been very kind. I guess I’ll just wait for the phone call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your MRI appointment. And remember to listen to your body and take care of yourself. Have a good day, and I'll see you after the results are in.
