DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Thomassoni. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, to be honest. I’ve noticed some swelling, yes. It’s mostly on this side of my face, I think. <points vaguely to left side of face> It’s been… a little unsettling, and I haven’t a clear recollection of when it started, precisely.
DOCTOR: “A little unsettling,” you say. Right. And you can’t pinpoint when this…“swelling” began?
PATIENT: No, I’m afraid not. It feels… recent, but beyond that, the details are rather hazy. It's frustrating, truly. I do apologize for the vagueness; I wish I could be more precise. It’s just… things haven’t been entirely clear lately. Is it alright if I describe what it feels like? Perhaps that will be more helpful.
DOCTOR: “Feelings” are… subjective, Mr. Thomassoni. But proceed, if you must. Though I assure you, a precise timeline is far more useful. Describe this… sensation. Be concise.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… a pressure, mostly. Not painful, exactly, but definitely noticeable. It’s… a fullness, if that makes sense? And… warm. It feels warmer than the rest of my face, especially when I touch it. It isn’t constant; it seems to come and go. <rubs cheek gently> I also feel a slight… tingling sensation sometimes. Does that offer any clarity? I’m truly attempting to recall anything else that might be pertinent, but my memory… well, it’s proving uncooperative.
DOCTOR: Warmth and tingling… Right. And has this been accompanied by any changes in vision?
PATIENT: Changes in vision… hmm. <pauses, concentrating> That’s… a good question, Doctor. I haven't specifically noticed any changes, but… <frowns slightly> now that you mention it, things might be a little blurry, perhaps? It's difficult to say with certainty. I wear glasses, you see, and I haven’t adjusted my prescription recently. I suppose it's possible my vision has deteriorated gradually, and I haven’t consciously registered it. Would you recommend a vision test, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Naturally. A vision test is… prudent, given your lack of… observational skills. But first, let's proceed with a physical exam. Please remain still. <gestures towards the examination table> If you could sit, and I'll take a look. Do you have any allergies to latex or topical anesthetics?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. I haven’t experienced any allergic reactions in the past, to my knowledge. Latex or… topical anesthetics, you said? <frowns slightly, thinking> No, I’m quite certain I’m alright with both. Though, if you’d prefer to err on the side of caution, I wouldn’t object to using alternatives. I simply don’t have a documented history of any allergies. <nods, indicating he is ready to sit> Please, proceed at your convenience.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Palpation reveals… definite edema. Not significant, but present. Tenderness… mild. <Listens to the patient's sinuses with stethoscope> Sinuses are clear bilaterally. No audible crepitus. <Examines patient’s ears with an otoscope> Tympanic membranes appear normal. No signs of infection. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Blood pressure 120/80. Pulse 72 and regular. <Steps back slightly> There’s no obvious lymphadenopathy. Overall, your vitals are unremarkable. <pauses> Do you have any history of recent trauma to the face?
PATIENT: Recent trauma… <pauses, furrowing his brow in concentration> No, Doctor, I don't believe so. I haven’t experienced any falls or injuries to my face that I can recall. I lead a rather… sedentary lifestyle, truthfully. Mostly office work, and quiet evenings at home. So, I haven’t been involved in any activities that would typically lead to facial trauma. Is it possible this could be something else entirely? Perhaps an… infection, or an allergic reaction to something I’ve ingested? <looks at Doctor with a slightly concerned expression> I truly wish I could offer more concrete information, but my memory remains… elusive.
DOCTOR: Elusive is… a polite way to put it, Mr. Thomassoni. Given your vague history, and lack of any clear precipitating factors, a possible diagnosis would be… a mild case of cellulitis. Though the lack of significant pain or fever is… atypical. We'll need to rule out other possibilities. <Looks directly at the patient> I'm going to order a complete blood count, and a sedimentation rate. I’ll also order a CT scan of your sinuses, just to be certain there’s no underlying infection. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. A complete blood count, sedimentation rate, and a CT scan of my sinuses… to rule out infection. <nods slowly> That sounds… thorough, which I appreciate. <pauses, a slight look of concern crossing his face> The CT scan… is that something I need to prepare for? And… is it expensive? I do have private insurance, but I always worry about out-of-pocket expenses. <looks at Doctor expectantly> I apologize for inquiring about the financial aspect, but it’s a concern I’m often preoccupied with.
DOCTOR: "Preoccupied" is an… understatement, I presume. The CT scan requires no special preparation, just your cooperation. As for the cost… that's a matter for your insurance company. I provide the medical necessity, not a billing service. <pauses, with a slight wave of his hand> The lab technician will draw your blood now. The scan will be scheduled for tomorrow morning. Come back with the results. And try to recall any relevant information between now and then. <gestures towards the door> I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavor to… recall any pertinent details. Thank you for your time, and for ordering the tests. <nods politely, a slightly deflated expression on his face> I will see you tomorrow morning, then, with the results. <turns to leave, looking slightly bewildered> <exits slowly>
