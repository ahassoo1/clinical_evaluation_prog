DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… well, numbness in my leg. It’s been happening on and off for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your leg. That’s good you’re getting it checked out. "On and off" is helpful – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It doesn’t happen constantly, thankfully. It usually starts in my foot, a kind of tingling sensation, and then spreads up my calf. It’s… difficult to describe. Not painful, exactly, just… absent. Like it’s not quite there. It usually lasts for maybe an hour or two, and then fades. It seems to come and go with activity, though not always. Sometimes it happens when I’m resting, sometimes when I’m working. I do a fair bit of walking, and I’m on my feet quite a lot for my work, animating and setting up shots.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tingling starting in the foot, moving up the calf, not painful but an absence of sensation… and it lasts an hour or two. And it doesn’t seem consistently linked to activity, which is good to know. You mentioned animating and setting up shots – is that a physically demanding job, or is it mostly sitting?
PATIENT: It’s… a bit of both, actually. The animating itself is done at a computer, so quite a lot of sitting. But setting up shots involves moving equipment, adjusting lights, and generally being on my feet and reaching for things. It can be a fair amount of bending and twisting, and I often have to carry some fairly heavy things, though I try to get help when needed. I suppose it's not intensely physically demanding, but it’s not entirely sedentary either. It requires a lot of focus, and I often forget to take breaks when I’m deeply involved in a project.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. So, periods of sitting, periods of lifting and moving, and sometimes you lose track of breaks. Okay. Have you noticed anything that specifically triggers it, or makes it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I’ve been trying to pay attention. It seems… worse after I’ve been on my feet for a long stretch, definitely. Like, after a particularly long shoot day. And I think it’s worse when it’s colder, but that might just be me noticing it more because I’m less comfortable in general when I'm cold. I haven’t noticed anything that makes it better, specifically, other than just sitting and resting it. It hasn't been debilitating, so I haven't been actively trying to find relief, if that makes sense. Just… observing.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Observing is good. And it’s good it hasn’t been debilitating. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I haven't had any major illnesses or surgeries. I do wear glasses, for nearsightedness, but that’s it. I get regular check-ups with my primary care doctor, and the last one was normal. I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, though I admit I have a bit of a sweet tooth. And I get a decent amount of sleep, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No major medical conditions, regular check-ups, wear glasses, reasonably healthy... That’s all good to hear. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I've taken various medications over the years – antibiotics when I’ve been sick, pain relievers for headaches – and never had any issues. I’m not particularly sensitive to anything, as far as I’m aware. I’ve even tried a few different kinds of shellfish, just to be sure, and was fine.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking anything at the moment. No prescription medications, no over-the-counter drugs, and no supplements. I try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. I prefer to let my body heal naturally whenever possible. I do occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, but it's quite infrequent. Maybe once or twice a month, if that.
DOCTOR: Okay, infrequent ibuprofen use only. That’s good to know. Now, let’s shift gears a bit and talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… My mother’s side of the family… my grandmother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my uncle, her son, also has it. On my father’s side… he had high blood pressure, but managed it with diet and exercise. And… I think my great-grandfather had some heart issues, but that was a long time ago, and I don’t have a lot of details. No one that I’m aware of has had anything neurological, if that’s relevant. My family generally lives quite long lives, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so diabetes on your mother's side, high blood pressure on your father's, and some heart issues further back. No known neurological conditions. That’s helpful. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I’ve never been a smoker. I occasionally drink alcohol, socially, but very rarely. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner a few times a year. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. I generally prefer to stay away from those. I lead a pretty quiet life, mostly focused on my work and spending time with friends.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, infrequent alcohol use, no recreational drugs. That’s all good to know. Alright, Tarin. Based on what you’ve told me, and your age, we need to consider a few possibilities. The numbness you're describing, radiating from your foot up your calf, could be related to nerve compression, possibly in your lower back or along the path of the sciatic nerve. The fact that it's intermittent and doesn’t consistently correlate with activity makes a more serious issue less likely, but we need to investigate further. I’d like to do a quick physical exam to assess your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam seems like a logical next step. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please proceed when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Tarin, if you could lie down on your back for me, please. We'll start with some basic neurological tests. I’m going to check your reflexes in both legs, and then assess your muscle strength. I'll also be checking sensation in your feet and legs. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. First, let’s check your reflexes. Okay, good reflexes bilaterally. Now, let's check your strength. Can you lift your right leg straight up while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Certainly. Like this? I can hold it up for a bit, though it’s a little awkward. Is this what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Good strength. Now, lower it slowly. And now, let’s do the same thing with your left leg. Lift it straight up, please. Good. Now, lower it slowly. Now, let's check sensation. I'm going to lightly touch your feet and legs with this, and I want you to tell me when you feel it. Close your eyes, please. Can you feel this on the top of your foot?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It’s… a light tingling sensation. I feel it clearly on the top of my foot.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one as well. It’s a bit less distinct than the last one, but definitely noticeable. It feels… slightly duller, perhaps? It's still there, though. I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one. It feels… similar to the one on the top of my foot, clear and distinct. Not painful, just… a light pressure. I can feel it clearly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one too. It's… fainter than the others. I have to concentrate to notice it, but it's definitely there. It's a very light sensation, almost like a… a buzzing. It’s present, but noticeably less strong than the others.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, here?
PATIENT: …No. I don’t feel anything there. It’s completely numb. No sensation at all. Completely absent.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Tarin. Based on the physical exam, you have decreased sensation on the outer aspect of your left foot. The strength and reflexes are normal, which is reassuring. The decreased sensation, combined with your symptoms, is suggestive of peripheral neuropathy. Now, there are many causes of peripheral neuropathy. It can be caused by diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, certain medications, or even just compression of a nerve. In your case, given your age and overall health, the most likely cause is a compressed nerve, possibly in your lower back or along the sciatic nerve pathway. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or other underlying medical conditions. I'd also like to get an MRI of your lower back to look for any signs of nerve compression. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood tests and an MRI seem like a logical next step to get a clearer understanding of what's going on. Please proceed with those orders. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can to find the cause and a solution.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I've ordered the blood tests and the MRI. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood draw, and the MRI center will contact you to schedule the scan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that aggravate your symptoms. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, as needed for pain. And I want you to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or severe pain, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I appreciate you taking the time to thoroughly assess my condition. I understand the next steps, and I'll be sure to contact you if anything changes or if I experience any new symptoms. Thank you again, Doctor. I look forward to hearing back with the results.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day.
