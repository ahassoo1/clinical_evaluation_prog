DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. My name is Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. I have a… a pain. In my throat. It’s been bothering me. I need to get this over with quickly, if you don’t mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're busy, Tammie. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. So, this throat pain… how long has it been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's... a difficult question. A few days, I suppose. Maybe longer. It all feels… blurry, honestly. I don't keep track of these things. It just started hurting, and now it does. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Alright, a few days or longer. That’s helpful. And could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It… hurts when I swallow. Like something is scratchy, you know? And a little sore. It's not… excruciating, but it's certainly unpleasant. I don't understand why I need to explain this in such detail. It hurts when I swallow. Is that clear enough for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very clear, Tammie. Scratchy and sore when you swallow. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the throat pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what, exactly? I haven't been paying attention to… things. I work. I don't have time to catalog every little ache and sniffle. No, I don’t think so. Maybe a little tired, but that’s just life. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, no cough, no runny nose, no body aches?
PATIENT: No, no, none of that. I told you, I haven't been looking for anything. Really. I just want something for my throat so I can get back to work. All this questioning… it’s a waste of my time, frankly. Is there a quick remedy, or not?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam of your throat, just to take a look. It will only take a moment. Can you open wide and say “ah”?
PATIENT: Really? You need me to open my mouth? I’m here because it hurts when I swallow, and now you want me to… perform? Fine. Ah. There. Happy?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I see some mild redness in the back of your throat. Your tonsils don’t appear significantly swollen, and I don’t see any white spots. There’s no obvious pus. Your lymph nodes are a little tender, but not significantly enlarged.
PATIENT: Redness? Tender… what-nots? What does that mean? Is it serious? I need straight answers, Doctor. I don’t have time for medical jargon. Just tell me what I need to do to feel better. And quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie. It looks like you likely have a mild case of pharyngitis - inflammation of the throat. It’s most likely viral, meaning antibiotics won’t help. We can manage the symptoms to make you more comfortable. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. Honestly, Doctor, do you think I'd be here if I was falling apart from allergies? No. I don't have allergies. Never have. I just want something to stop the pain. Is that so much to ask? I really need to get back to work. I don’t understand why this is so complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Alright. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed, and plenty of fluids – warm tea with honey can be soothing. Gargling with warm salt water a few times a day can also help. I’m going to recommend a throat lozenge as well.
PATIENT: Salt water? Lozenges? That's it? I came to a doctor for this? I could have gotten that advice from my neighbor! Is that really all there is to it? I… I suppose it’s better than nothing. But I’m telling you, if this doesn’t improve quickly, I’ll be very disappointed. Do I need a note for work? Because I will need one if I have to miss any shifts.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your frustration, Tammie. While it seems simple, these measures are usually effective for a viral pharyngitis. If your symptoms worsen – high fever, difficulty breathing, severe pain that prevents you from swallowing – then you should seek medical attention immediately. And yes, I can certainly provide a note for work. It will state that you were seen for a sore throat and advised to rest and take over-the-counter medication. Is there anything specific about your job duties that I should include in the note?
PATIENT: Well… yes. I operate machinery. Precision work. They need to know I might not be at 100%. Something about needing to be focused. And… and that I might need to take breaks if my throat gets worse. Honestly, they should just let me stay home. This whole thing is just… inconvenient. How long will this note be valid for? And are you sure this is all I need?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ve noted that you operate precision machinery and may require frequent breaks due to throat discomfort. I’ve made the note valid for three days, giving you time to recover. And while I can’t guarantee anything, Tammie, based on the exam, this is the most likely cause and treatment plan. If you aren’t improving within a few days, or if your symptoms get worse, please do come back, and we can consider other possibilities. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that’s all. Just… give me the note. And hopefully, this will be over soon. I have things to do, you know. Important things. Thank you… I suppose. .
DOCTOR: Here you go. And please, don't hesitate to come back if your symptoms don’t improve. Get some rest, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, Tammie.
