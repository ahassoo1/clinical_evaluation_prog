DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having some… discomfort. Down there. In the… groin area. It’s been going on for a little while, and I thought it best to get it checked out. I’m not quite sure how long, exactly… a few weeks, perhaps? It's not constant, but it's worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Stepro. It’s perfectly alright. These things happen, and it’s always best to get them checked. Please, don't feel embarrassed at all. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Or maybe it’s been longer… time seems to slip away from me these days. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache, sometimes a heaviness. And occasionally… a bit of a twinge. It doesn’t come and go on any specific schedule, if that makes sense. I haven’t noticed anything else… no fever, no other changes, just the discomfort.
DOCTOR: Right, a dull ache and heaviness, with occasional twinges… and no specific pattern. No fever or other changes, good. Just to clarify, Ms. Stepro, is the discomfort on one side, or both?
PATIENT: Oh… um… that’s a good question. I… I haven’t really paid close enough attention, to be honest. I tend to just… notice the general feeling, rather than pinpointing exactly where. I think… it’s more noticeable on the left side, perhaps? But I couldn’t say for certain. It’s difficult for me to remember details like that. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Stepro. It’s perfectly common to have difficulty recalling specifics. More noticeable on the left, we’ll keep that in mind. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Urinary habits…? Changes… hmm. Let me think. I suppose… I have been going to the bathroom a little more frequently, now that you mention it. But I also drink a lot of water, so I always assumed it was just that. I don’t feel like I have to go more urgently, or anything. It’s just… more trips throughout the day. Is that what you meant?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Stepro, that’s helpful. Increased frequency, without urgency. And no pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. Just… more often. And… sometimes it feels like I don’t quite empty my bladder completely, but that might just be my imagination. I’ve always been a bit… anxious about these things, you see. I worry a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re bringing these concerns to me, Ms. Stepro. Anxiety can certainly play a role in how we perceive things. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s… difficult. I’ve seen a few doctors over the years, of course, but I don’t always remember everything they told me. I have Medicare, so I’ve been checked out regularly. I believe I had… high blood pressure, a few years back? They put me on medication for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. I wasn’t very good at remembering to take pills consistently. And… I think I had a touch of arthritis in my hands, but it's not bothering me much these days. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in the past, and some arthritis. We can look through your records to confirm. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Yes! I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. That was… quite a long time ago, now. Maybe twenty years? It was a fairly routine procedure, as I recall. And… I think I had a small cyst removed from my arm, but it was very minor. Nothing major. Honestly, my memory is just… not what it used to be. I feel terrible that I can't be more precise.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Stepro. Don't worry about being precise. We have access to your records and can verify those details. Now, regarding your family history—are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that's another tricky one. My mother… she had diabetes, I believe. And… my father, he had heart problems. But they lived in Colombia, and I didn't see them very often. We weren't very close, and I don't know much about their medical history beyond that. I have a sister, but we haven't spoken in years. I'm afraid I can't be much help with that, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, diabetes and heart problems in the family. And you mentioned you drink a lot of water—would you say you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. I prefer water, honestly. It’s better for me, you see. I try to take care of myself as best I can.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Ms. Stepro, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a gentle external examination of the pelvic area. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be causing your discomfort. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… reasonable. If you think it will help, then please do. I’m a little nervous, but I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle, if you don’t mind. And… perhaps tell me what you’re doing as you go along? It helps me feel less anxious when I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stepro. I will explain everything as I go, and be as gentle as possible. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just lie back on the examination table, and try to relax. I’m listening for any unusual sounds. Everything seems normal so far. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not particularly. It feels… normal, I suppose. A little pressure, but no pain. It's just… a bit awkward, lying here. I don't often lie on my back for very long. And... is there anything you've noticed yet? Anything concerning? I’m always a little worried it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: No significant tenderness at this point, Ms. Stepro. Now, I’m going to examine the external pelvic area. I will be palpating the lymph nodes in your groin and checking for any irregularities. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m feeling the lymph nodes… they appear normal in size and texture. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort at this moment, as I’m palpating?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. No pain or discomfort. Just… a little bit strange, having someone touch me there. I suppose I’m just… sensitive. And… I’m relieved that you haven’t found anything concerning yet. Do you think it could be a muscle strain, perhaps? I’ve been doing a lot of woodworking lately, and I sometimes strain my back.
DOCTOR: A muscle strain is a possibility, Ms. Stepro. However, given the location and the fact that you mentioned increased urinary frequency, I’d like to order a urinalysis and a complete blood count. These tests will help rule out any infection or other underlying conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, then please do. I just want to know what’s going on, and I trust your judgment. A urinalysis and a blood test… alright. Where will I go to have those done? And… how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, Ms. Stepro. The technician will collect the samples. It should only take a few minutes. The results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, severe pain, or difficulty urinating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright. 24 to 48 hours… I can manage that. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with me. I do tend to worry, as I said. So, I just go down the hall to the lab, and they’ll take care of it? And then you’ll call me when the results are back?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Ms. Stepro. You go down the hall to the lab, they'll collect the samples, and we’ll call you as soon as we have the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything I’ve been worrying about. I suppose… I just need to wait for the results now. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I truly appreciate it. I’ll go down to the lab now, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stepro. Please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before we call with the results. Get well soon, and I’ll speak with you shortly. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
