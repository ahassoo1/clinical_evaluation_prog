DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ambris. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s embarrassing, but… my breath smells bad. Really bad, apparently. My ex-husband… well, let’s just say he made it very clear on his way out the door. It's just… unpleasant. I’d like to get it fixed if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Hmm. An…olfactory concern. Yes. While not life-threatening, persistent halitosis – that is, bad breath – can certainly be… disruptive. Let’s try to ascertain the cause. Now, has this been a recent development, or has this been an ongoing issue for some time?
PATIENT: Oh, don't patronize me with the big words. It's been… a while. Not like just started, you know? Probably a few months, at least. Look, I work outside, on the highway. It's not exactly a perfume factory out there. But it seems… worse lately. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: No, no. My apologies. Simply attempting to be thorough. Several months, you say. And you work outdoors, on the highway… Yes, that could contribute. But it’s rarely the sole culprit. Do you notice it consistently, or only at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? It's pretty much always there. Maybe worse in the morning, but it's not like it goes away completely. I brush my teeth, obviously. Do I need to start flossing, is that what you're getting at? Because frankly, I don't have time for all that.
DOCTOR: Well, while I won't prescribe a flossing regimen at this juncture… good oral hygiene is fundamental. But persistent halitosis despite regular tooth brushing suggests a more…complex etiology. Now, tell me, do you experience any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I don't have a fever. My teeth don't hurt. I'm not sick. Look, I just want you to fix the bad smell, not give me a medical quiz. Is it something I ate? I had a really strong garlic sausage last week… could it be that?
DOCTOR: Garlic sausage... plausible, but unlikely to persist this long. Ms. Ambris, while I appreciate your…directness, a complete history is essential. Let’s rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any changes in your sense of taste or smell recently?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Everything smells and tastes normal. Look, I spend all day breathing in exhaust fumes, I'm pretty sure my sense of smell is already shot. Can we just skip to whatever test you’re going to give me? I have work to get back to.
DOCTOR: While I understand your desire for expediency, Ms. Ambris, proper medical assessment requires a systematic approach. Very well. I suppose we can proceed with a brief physical examination. I will need to examine your oral cavity, and perhaps listen to your respiratory system. If you would be so kind as to have a seat.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… try not to poke around too much, okay? It’s embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I shall be as efficient as possible. Now, please open wide. Hmm. No obvious signs of decay or infection. Your gums are slightly inflamed, but nothing remarkable. Your tongue appears… coated. Lungs are clear. No congestion. Slightly coated tongue, mild gingivitis. Now, have you any allergies to medications or… anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Ugh, coated tongue? What does that even mean? Look, I'm not allergic to anything, okay? I’m a highway worker, not a delicate flower. I eat what I want, when I want. I don't have time for allergies. Is this going to take much longer? I really need to get back to work. My crew is probably wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: A coated tongue can indicate various things, Ms. Ambris, from dehydration to… less concerning causes. And while your… robust lifestyle is admirable, it doesn't preclude the possibility of allergies. Nevertheless. Let us proceed. Do you experience any postnasal drip?
PATIENT: Post… what now? Look, sometimes my nose runs, okay? Especially when it's cold. Is that what you're asking about? It's a nose. It runs when you're sick or it’s cold. I don't need a medical degree to tell you that. Is this going anywhere or are we just playing 20 questions?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, your… dismissive attitude is hindering our assessment. Postnasal drip can be a source of halitosis. Now, do you frequently experience sinus congestion or headaches?
PATIENT: Look, I get headaches, okay? Who doesn't get headaches? I work outside all day, breathing in fumes, dealing with traffic. It's not exactly a relaxing job! Are you seriously trying to tell me my bad breath is from a headache? This is ridiculous. I'm starting to think you have no idea what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your… resistance to a comprehensive evaluation, and the absence of any acute findings, I suspect this may be related to a combination of factors: dehydration, poor oral hygiene, and potential environmental exposure. However, to rule out any underlying medical conditions, I recommend a referral to a dentist for a professional cleaning and assessment. And I would also suggest increasing your fluid intake. I shall provide you with a referral slip.
PATIENT: So… you're just sending me to the dentist? After all this? Seriously? Look, I brush my teeth, okay? I don’t need a dentist telling me how to brush. Waste of my time, waste of my money. Fine. Whatever. Just give me the slip. I have work to do.
