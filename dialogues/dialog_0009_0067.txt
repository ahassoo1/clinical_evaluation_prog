DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Petrimoulx, right? Yes. Well, it’s this pain… when I breathe deep. It’s been… a little while now. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Just… hurts when I take a big breath.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Petrimoulx is correct. And it's perfectly alright that you're not sure of the exact timeframe, Mr. Ruocco. We'll figure it out together. So, this pain with deep breathing… Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. It’s… in my chest, I think. Sort of a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp. It doesn’t come and go too much, just… always there a little bit when I try to fill my lungs. Does that make sense? I used to do a lot of heavy lifting, you know, construction work. Maybe it’s something from that? I don’t… I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Ruocco. A dull ache in your chest with deep breaths. And yes, a history of heavy lifting is helpful information. We'll definitely consider that. Does anything specifically make the pain worse – like coughing, or lying down, or perhaps moving a certain way?
PATIENT: Let me think… Coughing doesn’t seem to bother it much. Lying down… no, not really. It’s… it’s probably worse when I’m trying to do something. Like, if I’m bending over, or reaching for something high up. Just… using my chest muscles, I guess. Honestly, Doctor, it’s just… a discomfort. I don’t like it, but I’ve been pushing through it. I'm a stubborn old man.
DOCTOR: Well, it's good you're here now, even if you are a stubborn one! It’s always best to get these things checked out. So, to clarify, the pain is more noticeable when you’re actively using your chest muscles—bending, reaching, that sort of thing. And it’s been present for… a while now, just a consistent discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Consistent discomfort. Not a sharp pain, just… there. And yes, when I'm doing things. When I'm sitting still, it's not so bad. I… I don't remember anything specific that started it. It just… gradually got to be there, you know? I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. I wish my memory was better.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Mr. Ruocco. Don't worry about the memory – we'll gather all the information we can. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health problems that I should be aware of—like heart trouble, lung issues, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… I don’t think so. I had a bad back for a while, from the lifting, but that’s been better for years. No heart trouble, that I know of. And no lung problems. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit… oh, goodness, it must be thirty years ago now. Doctor, I really don't remember much. I’ve never been one for going to doctors much, either.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll take it slowly. Knowing you used to smoke is important, even if you quit thirty years ago. And it's good to know about the back pain. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. No medications at all. Never really needed them, thankfully. Just… a little bit of aches and pains now and then, like any old man gets. I try to stay active, you know? Keep moving. But this chest pain… it’s different. It’s just… nagging.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes. I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was… oh, a long time ago. And… I think I had a hernia operation once, but that was years and years ago. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit fuzzy. I'm not sure I remember exactly when. It was before my divorce, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendix removal and a hernia operation, both some time ago. That's helpful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any health problems that run in your family—like heart disease, lung cancer, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question... My mother... she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father... he worked in construction too, and he had bad knees when he got older. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. My sister... she's still alive, but I don't talk to her much. I honestly don't know about her health. We don't keep in touch.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, and knee problems in your father. That’s good to know. Thank you. Now, Mr. Ruocco, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also feel around your chest to see if there are any areas of tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what's causing this pain. And get it fixed, if possible. I'm getting too old to be dealing with aches and pains all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Okay. I'm listening to your heart now... sounds regular. Your lungs are clear. I'm feeling your chest… there's some slight tenderness here on the left side, and I feel a little bit of a clicking sensation.
PATIENT: Clicking sensation…? Oh, dear. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm just… worried now. It’s been a long time since I’ve been to a doctor, and I never know what they’re going to find.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mr. Ruocco. The clicking sensation I feel is called crepitus, and it often happens when there's some inflammation or minor irritation around the cartilage that connects your ribs to your breastbone—what we call the costochondral junctions. It doesn’t always mean something serious. Often, it's caused by minor muscle strain or inflammation. Given your history of heavy lifting, and the tenderness I feel, it's likely costochondritis – inflammation of this cartilage. However, to be absolutely sure, and rule out anything else, I'd like to order a chest x-ray. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Oh, goodness. Another test. I suppose so, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I just… don’t like being poked and prodded. And I don’t have insurance, so I worry about the cost. But if it will help figure out what’s wrong… yes, okay. Do you think it’s really serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco, both about the tests and the cost. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. The x-ray is mostly to rule out other possibilities, like a problem with your lungs or heart. It's a precaution. Based on what I’ve found so far, and your symptoms, I don’t believe it’s anything immediately life-threatening. But it’s important to be thorough. We can discuss the cost with the billing department and see if there are any options available to help. In the meantime, while we’re waiting for the x-ray results, I recommend avoiding activities that worsen the pain, and I can prescribe you some anti-inflammatory medication to help reduce the discomfort. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Anti-inflammatory… yes, that sounds good. Anything to help with the pain. And avoiding activities… well, that’s hard, I like to stay busy. But I can try. I’ll try to take it easy. So, just rest and medication until the x-ray… Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. I'm glad I could explain everything to your satisfaction. Here's the slip for the x-ray. The radiology department is just down the hall, and they’ll let you know when they’re ready for you. And here’s the prescription for the anti-inflammatory medication. It's naproxen, 500mg, twice daily with food. Take the medication as directed, and if you have any side effects—like stomach upset—please let us know. The x-ray results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they're available. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your patience with my… foggy memory. I’ll go get the x-ray done now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. And don’t worry about your memory – it’s perfectly alright. Take your time, and if you have any concerns at all, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, Mr. Ruocco.
