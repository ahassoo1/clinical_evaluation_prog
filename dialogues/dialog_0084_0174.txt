DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s… difficult to explain. Just a general sadness, really. And it’s been going on for quite some time. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I’d like to get this sorted, if you don’t mind. I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not yourself” and a general sadness for some time… That is a good reason to come in, and we'll try to sort it out as efficiently as we can. To help me understand a little better, can you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… It started, I believe, sometime after my divorce. That was… oh, goodness… nearly three years ago now, in November of 2022, I think. It wasn’t immediate, you understand. It crept up on me, slowly. At first, I just put it down to the change, but it hasn’t… lifted. Perhaps a bit more than three years. Time does rather slip away, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does. So, starting around November 2022, following your divorce. And it's been a gradual worsening, not something sudden?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. Like the tide coming in, slowly but surely. It wasn’t a dramatic event, not a single moment. Just… less enjoyment in things. Less energy. Less… everything, really. I still do things, you understand. I have to. My work… it keeps me busy. But it takes effort. A lot of effort. And frankly, Doctor, I’m rather tired of effort.
DOCTOR: I understand. Less enjoyment, less energy… that sounds very draining. You said it takes a lot of effort to do things now, even things you used to enjoy. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically you've been finding difficult?
PATIENT: Well, the work, of course. Ski patrol, lifeguarding… it requires alertness, enthusiasm. Things I find… lacking, these days. I manage, because I have to. But it's not the same. And then… socialising. I used to enjoy a good party, a chat with friends. Now… I find excuses not to go. It’s just easier to stay home, really. Watch the television. Though even that feels… empty. It’s… hard to explain. Everything feels muted, somehow. Less vibrant.
DOCTOR: Muted, less vibrant… I'm starting to get a clearer picture. So, work is becoming more challenging, and you're withdrawing socially. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My sleep is… fitful. I wake up several times during the night. And I rarely feel truly rested, even after a full eight hours. As for appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I have no interest in food at all. Other days, I eat just to… fill the void, I suppose. It’s not enjoyable, though. It’s just… something to do. Everything feels… disconnected, if you understand. Food, sleep, even socialising… none of it feels quite real.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Ms. Derasmo. That sounds very difficult, and certainly concerning. It sounds like this has been impacting many aspects of your life. Before we go any further, I want to quickly review your medical history. I see here you have a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril, and osteoarthritis. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. The hypertension is well controlled, thankfully. I take my medication regularly. And the osteoarthritis… well, that's just old age creeping up, isn't it? It’s a nuisance, certainly, especially in the winter. Makes getting around a bit stiff, but I manage with some over-the-counter pain relief. Nothing major. I assure you, Doctor, I am generally a robust woman. It’s just this… feeling that’s troubling me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And no recent surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I haven’t had to go under the knife, thank goodness. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. A few bumps and bruises from my work, naturally, but nothing serious enough to require a visit to the hospital. I pride myself on my good health, you see. Which is why this… this sadness, this lack of energy… it’s so unsettling. I’m not one to complain, Doctor. It’s not in my nature. But I’m starting to worry that this is… more than just a passing phase.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to complain, and I appreciate you coming in to discuss this with me. It takes courage to acknowledge these feelings. Now, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… Let me think. My mother… she suffered from anxiety, I believe. She was a worrier, always fretting about something or another. Not clinical, mind you, just… a nervous disposition. My father was a strong, stoic man. Didn't talk much about his feelings. As for siblings… I have one brother, but we haven't spoken in years. He moved to America decades ago, and we lost touch. So, not much in the way of a strong family history of… this, exactly. Mostly just ordinary ailments, really. High blood pressure, arthritis… the usual things.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of anxiety in your mother, otherwise fairly unremarkable. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications other than the lisinopril?
PATIENT: No, just the lisinopril. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in letting nature take its course, you see. A good night's sleep, a healthy diet… that’s usually enough. But as I said, the sleep isn't what it used to be. And I find myself… less inclined to cook, less inclined to exercise. It’s a vicious cycle, really. And frankly, Doctor, I’m rather tired of talking about it. Is there any chance we can get to the bottom of this soon? I have a shift at the beach tomorrow morning, and I need to be at my best.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Derasmo. You're right, we’ve talked for a while now, and it’s time to move towards figuring out what’s going on. Based on what you’ve told me – the prolonged sadness, the loss of enjoyment, the changes in sleep and appetite, your social withdrawal - it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Now, I want to be clear, I’m not making a definitive diagnosis just yet. We need to rule out any other possible causes. I would like to do a brief physical exam, just to check your thyroid function and rule out anything else. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Depression… Well. That’s… not entirely surprising, I suppose. Though I always thought of that as something… other people experienced. A physical exam… Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Though I assure you, Doctor, I feel perfectly healthy. Apart from this… feeling, of course. But if it will help us get to the bottom of things, then yes. Let’s get on with it, shall we? I have a lot to do, you see. And the sooner we figure this out, the sooner I can get back to my life.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit back on the exam table, please. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your thyroid. It won't take long. Okay. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but not significantly. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything sounds normal so far. I would like to order some blood work, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a complete blood count. This will help us rule out any other underlying medical causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood work… Yes, I suppose that’s necessary. Though I must say, Doctor, I’m not particularly fond of needles. But if it will help… then yes, let’s get it done. Vitamin D… that’s the sunshine vitamin, isn’t it? I haven’t been getting out much lately, as you know. So perhaps that’s not surprising. Just… please, be quick? I have a shift at the beach tomorrow, and I need to be at my best. It’s a lot of responsibility, you see. People’s lives depend on me. And I can’t afford to be feeling sluggish and… down.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Derasmo. We’ll get this done as quickly as possible. The phlebotomist is very good, and it shouldn't take long at all. While we're waiting for the results, I'd like to ask you a few more questions. Have you been experiencing any feelings of hopelessness, or thoughts of harming yourself?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… Well. Yes. Sometimes. It’s not… a constant thing. But there are days when… when it all feels rather pointless, you see. The work, the socialising… everything. But harming myself? Oh, no. Never. That would be… unthinkable. I have a responsibility, you see. To my community, to the people who depend on me. And besides… I’m a practical woman, Doctor. I don't dwell on such things. But the hopelessness… yes. That’s there, sometimes. A quiet despair, lurking in the background. But I manage it. I always have. It’s just… harder now. Much harder.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Derasmo. It takes courage to talk about these feelings. And it’s important to know that feeling hopeless is a common symptom of depression, and it’s nothing to be ashamed of. Given what you've told me—the prolonged sadness, loss of enjoyment, changes in sleep and appetite, social withdrawal, and the feelings of hopelessness—I do believe it's likely you are experiencing a depressive episode. I want to assure you that this is treatable. We have several options available, including therapy and medication. Before we discuss those, I’d like to get the results of your blood work to rule out any other potential causes. In the meantime, would you be open to discussing some coping strategies you can use to manage your symptoms?
PATIENT: Treatable… Well. That’s… reassuring, I suppose. Though I’ve always prided myself on my self-reliance, Doctor. I’ve always managed things on my own. Therapy… I don’t know. I’m not sure I’m one for talking about my feelings. And medication… I’ve always avoided it whenever possible. But coping strategies… yes. Perhaps that’s a good starting point. Something practical, something I can do myself. What sort of things did you have in mind? I have a shift at the beach tomorrow, you see. And I need to be at my best. People’s lives depend on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Derasmo, and we can certainly start with coping strategies. It’s all about finding what works best for you. Some things that can be helpful include regular exercise, even just a short walk each day; practicing mindfulness or meditation; maintaining a healthy diet; and spending time doing activities you enjoy. Also, it’s important to maintain social connections, even if you don’t feel like it. And try to get enough sleep. I know you mentioned having trouble sleeping, but even small improvements can make a difference. Here’s a list of resources that might be helpful, including some websites and phone numbers. We’ll also discuss these more in detail when we have your blood work results. In the meantime, if you start feeling overwhelmed or have thoughts of harming yourself, please don’t hesitate to call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is… helpful. Though I must say, it all sounds rather… time-consuming. Exercise, meditation, healthy diet… I have a lot on my plate as it is, you see. No, I don’t think I have any questions at this point. Just… when will the blood work results be ready? And… will they definitely shed some light on this? I need to know what I’m dealing with, you see. And I need to be at my best tomorrow. People’s lives depend on me. That's all. Perhaps… perhaps we can schedule a follow-up appointment? After the results are in?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Derasmo. The blood work usually takes 24-48 hours. We should have the results by Friday at the latest. And yes, the blood work should help us rule out any other underlying medical causes, and confirm our suspicions. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you on Monday morning. That will give us time to review the results, discuss your options, and develop a plan. In the meantime, if you start feeling particularly overwhelmed, or if your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to call my office. And remember, you are not alone. We’re here to help. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you for your time. And thank you for listening. It’s… difficult to talk about these things. But I appreciate your help. Monday morning… Alright. I’ll mark it on my calendar. I have a shift at the beach tomorrow, you see. And I need to be at my best. People’s lives depend on me. That's all. Good day, Doctor. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. It was my pleasure to meet you, and please remember to take care of yourself. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you on Monday. And, truly, don't hesitate to call if anything comes up.
