DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for my shots, like we talked about. Routine stuff, you know? Keepin’ up with things.
DOCTOR: Right. “Routine.” Of course. And to be clear, are we referring to the tetanus booster, influenza vaccine… or something else specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You know, I kinda forget which ones I even need. I think… the flu one for sure. And maybe that tetanus thing? I work around a lot of… well, building sites. Lots of rusty metal. Is that the one? I just trust you to know what I need, honestly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, tetanus is a good idea given your… occupation. It's sensible to stay current. And the influenza vaccine is always recommended, especially heading into the season. I'll need to review your records briefly – just to confirm dates and ensure there aren't any contraindications. Do you have any allergies to vaccines, or have you experienced any adverse reactions previously?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to a shot, not that I remember. I had all my childhood ones, and I think I got one a few years back when I cut my hand pretty bad on some plywood. But that was a long time ago. I mean, I felt a little crummy for a day or so afterwards, like any normal person, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It appears you received a Td booster – that's tetanus and diphtheria – approximately five years ago. That's… acceptable, but we generally recommend a booster every ten years unless there's a particularly dirty wound. You mentioned a cut hand. When did that occur, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, that hand thing… let me think. It was… springtime, I think. Last year, maybe the year before? It was pretty deep, needed stitches. I remember cleaning it really well, 'cause my grandpa always said a dirty wound was a bad, bad thing. It healed up okay, though. I was worried about getting lockjaw, that's why I even bothered with the doctor then. I don't remember getting a booster at that time, though. Just the stitches.
DOCTOR: Right. So, potentially five years since your last Td, and a recent wound with unknown booster status. It's… prudent to administer another Td booster today, just to be certain. We want to avoid any risk. And then we’ll proceed with the influenza vaccine. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Sounds… sensible. If you think it's best, then yes. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Honestly, I'm more worried about the flu than anything. That stuff knocks you flat. As long as it’s not too painful, I guess. I’m not a big fan of needles, if you want the truth. But I understand it’s gotta be done.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's a small discomfort for considerable protection. We'll use the smallest gauge needle possible, and I'll be as efficient as I can. I'm going to start with the influenza vaccine in your non-dominant arm, then the Td booster in the other. Please just let me know if you feel any unusual pain or discomfort during the injections. Now, if you could just roll up your sleeve…
PATIENT: Okay. Here goes nothin’. Just… try to be quick, okay? And maybe tell me a joke or something to distract me? Old Tlingit stories are good, if you know any. Though I don't think I've ever met a doctor who knew Tlingit stories.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid my repertoire of Tlingit stories is… limited. I specialize in internal medicine, not folklore. There. That’s the influenza vaccine. A slight sting, perhaps, but it should subside quickly. Now, for the Td booster… Just relax your arm. This may feel a bit more substantial than the flu shot, but it's important. Done. There. Both administered. Keep those sites clean and dry for the next 24 hours. You may experience some mild soreness, swelling, or redness. If you develop a fever or any other concerning symptoms, contact the clinic immediately.
PATIENT: Oof. Okay, yeah, that was a bit more than a sting. But… it's done, right? Feel a little achy already, but nothing I can’t handle. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you gettin’ it over with. Is there anything else I need to do? Paperwork or somethin’? Or am I good to go?
DOCTOR: No, paperwork isn’t necessary. I’ve documented the vaccinations in your record. However, I would advise you to schedule a follow-up appointment in ten years for another Td booster. And, given your… occupation, I strongly recommend you review your tetanus prophylaxis guidelines with a wound care specialist. Proper wound management is crucial. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: A wound care specialist, huh? I think my cousin, Old Man Silas, knows a guy. He works on the boats, always gettin’ nicked and cut. I’ll ask him. Ten years… that seems like a long way off, but okay. No, I don’t think that’s it. That was everything, I think. Thank you again, Doctor Korrell. I’m gonna go find a chair and sit down for a bit before I head out. Don’t want to fall over.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any adverse reactions. Have a… satisfactory day, Ms. Fornes. .
PATIENT: .
