DOCTOR: Good morning, Moshe. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I’ve been awfully sleepy during the day, even though I’m using a machine at night for my sleep apnea. I’ve had it for a good while now, and it should be helping, but it doesn’t seem to be doing the trick as well as it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information to start with. It’s helpful to know you’re already using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea, and that you feel it’s not working as well as it once did. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about this daytime sleepiness?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up or anything, thankfully! But I find myself really dragging in the afternoon. I used to be able to push through, read, maybe do some light gardening, but lately… I just want to nap. And not just a little doze, a proper nap. It’s interfering with things, you see. I like to keep busy, and this is… frustrating. I've also noticed it's harder to concentrate when I am awake. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Moshe. It sounds very disruptive to your daily life, and I understand your frustration. The difficulty concentrating is definitely something we should look into as well. Now, when you say it’s not working as well as it used to, has anything changed with the machine itself?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t fiddled with any settings, and it doesn’t make any strange noises or anything. It’s the same machine, same mask… I clean it regularly, like the nurse showed me. I’ve been using it every night, religiously, since the doctor first prescribed it, maybe five or six years now. Perhaps longer… I sometimes lose track of the exact dates. But I haven’t changed anything about how I use it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Knowing that you haven’t changed anything with the machine itself is helpful. And it’s excellent that you’ve been consistent with using it for so long, and keeping it clean. Let's talk a little about your sleep otherwise. Do you feel like you're getting restful sleep when you are using the machine?
PATIENT: That’s… a tricky question. I think so. I mean, I don’t wake up gasping for air anymore, like I used to before the machine. But I don't wake up feeling refreshed, if that makes sense. It's hard to explain. It's not a bad sleep, exactly. Just… not a good one. I still wake up a few times during the night sometimes, usually to use the bathroom, but sometimes just… because. And I don’t always fall back asleep right away. I'll lie there for a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. So, you're not experiencing the severe interruptions you had before the CPAP, but the quality of sleep still doesn't feel restorative. Waking up multiple times and having trouble falling back to sleep could be contributing to the daytime sleepiness. Let's broaden things a bit. Aside from the sleepiness, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, my knees have been a bit more achy lately, but I’m 83, so that's hardly a surprise! I also seem to be a bit more forgetful than usual, but honestly, that’s also been happening gradually over the years. Nothing major, you understand. I still remember everything from my time teaching – dates, names, the important details. But little things… where I put my glasses, things like that. Oh, and I've been a little more irritable, I suppose. My daughter pointed it out, actually. I didn’t really notice it myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Moshe. The knee pain is understandable given your age, and gradual memory changes can be common as well. Your daughter noticing increased irritability is also a good piece of information. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. I have high blood pressure, which is managed with medication. I also had a bit of a heart problem a few years back – atrial fibrillation, they called it. I take medication for that too, a blood thinner. And, oh yes, I'm diabetic, type 2. I try to watch my sugar, but it's not always easy. Apart from that… I think that’s everything major. I used to see a cardiologist regularly for the heart, but he said things were stable, so I haven’t been back in a while. My regular doctor handles everything now. And, of course, Medicare covers it all, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's very helpful. High blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and type 2 diabetes are all important things to consider. It’s good to know you’re on medication for those conditions and that you've been stable with the atrial fibrillation. Let’s talk about medications for a moment. Could you tell me the names of all the medications you’re currently taking, and the dosages, if you know them?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a bit of a challenge, I'm afraid. I have quite a few. Let me see if I can recall… For the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, I believe, 20 milligrams, once a day. For the diabetes, I take Metformin, 500 milligrams, twice a day. And for the heart, I take… Apixaban, I think it is, 10 milligrams twice a day. Oh, and I also take a baby aspirin every day, just as a precaution. I have a list at home, actually, with all the details, but I didn't bring it with me today. I can certainly get it for you next time. I think that’s everything. I'm very careful to take them all regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good, Moshe. Lisinopril 20mg, Metformin 500mg twice daily, Apixaban 10mg twice daily, and baby aspirin. It's excellent that you take them regularly, and no worries about the list – it’s always best to have it for accuracy. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke, never have. Gave that up a long, long time ago. And I very rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's about it. I'm not much of a drinker, honestly. I prefer a nice cup of tea. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. My daughter helps me with the grocery shopping, makes sure I'm getting what I need. I used to be very active, walking every day, but my knees aren't what they used to be, so I don’t get out as much anymore. Mostly I read and watch the news.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Moshe. No smoking, very limited alcohol, a generally healthy diet, and you try to stay active as much as possible. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat, just to rule out any obvious issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I understand you need to check things out. It's just a bit uncomfortable sometimes, getting old, you know? Everything creaks and groans! But please, don't hesitate to do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a bit irregular, but that's consistent with your history of atrial fibrillation. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your blood pressure is 140/85. That's a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Your throat looks clear, no signs of infection or obstruction. Your thyroid feels normal to the touch. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it sounds like your daytime sleepiness could be related to several factors: your atrial fibrillation, which can sometimes disrupt sleep; the medications you're taking; potentially, slightly elevated blood pressure; and the fact that you aren't getting as much physical activity as you used to. It's also possible your CPAP machine isn't optimally adjusted anymore. However, it's also important to rule out other possible causes. I'd like to order a few blood tests. These will check your thyroid function, your blood sugar levels, and rule out any vitamin deficiencies that could be contributing to your fatigue. I also want to do a sleep study to re-evaluate your CPAP settings and ensure the machine is working effectively. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very sensible, Doctor. I'm happy to have the blood tests and another sleep study. It's good to know we're trying to figure out what's going on. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? Being tired all the time is… draining. I trust your judgment, and I'm willing to do whatever you think is best. I’ll need my daughter to help me arrange transportation for the sleep study, though. She’s very good at those things. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Moshe. I understand your desire to feel like yourself again, and we’ll work together to figure this out. I'll write the orders for the blood tests and the sleep study now. For the blood tests, you don't need to do anything special. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. We'll schedule them at the lab here in the clinic. For the sleep study, it's best to avoid caffeine and alcohol the day of the test. And please bring a comfortable set of pajamas and anything else you normally use to get a good night’s sleep. We’ll have you fill out a questionnaire about your sleep habits before the study begins. The technician will explain everything in detail when you arrive. I’ll also send a referral to a cardiologist, just to get their input on your atrial fibrillation and ensure you’re on the optimal medication regimen. It's always good to have a specialist involved when managing complex conditions. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Moshe?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. That all sounds perfectly reasonable. Scheduling the tests, the sleep study, seeing the cardiologist… it’s good to have a plan. And thank you for being so patient and listening to me. It's easy to feel dismissed sometimes, when you’re an older patient. But you’ve made me feel heard, and that means a lot. I appreciate it very much. Perhaps just one small question. How long will it take to get the results of the blood tests? I'm just trying to gauge when I might be able to expect some answers.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Moshe. It's important to me that all my patients feel heard, and I’m glad I could provide that for you. The blood tests usually take 2-3 business days to come back from the lab. Once the results are in, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them. We’ll go over everything in detail and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been wonderfully helpful, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we're taking steps to get to the bottom of this. I’ll have my daughter help me with the scheduling. Thank you again for your time and attention. I really appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Moshe. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
