DOCTOR: Hi Jerrel, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I told the nice lady on the phone, it’s this…shaking. It’s in my hands, mostly. Been happening for a bit now. Honestly, I don’t have all day to sit here and explain it. Just…it’s annoying, alright? Makes it hard to hold a fork.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds frustrating, especially when it interferes with everyday things like eating. “A bit now” – could you tell me roughly how long this shaking has been going on?
PATIENT: Roughly? Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. Months, I suppose. Maybe longer? Time just…goes. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little tremble. Now it’s…more noticeable. Don't need a calendar telling me when my hands started acting up. It's just…old age, probably. What’s the point of digging into it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with trying to pinpoint exact timelines, Jerrel. Even a rough estimate helps us figure things out. And you’re right to think about whether it's something new or a gradual change. It’s good you're bringing it up, even if you suspect it’s just age. Sometimes, even if it is related to age, there are things we can do to help manage it. Just to get a clearer picture, is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Definitely. Worse when I’m trying to…do something. Like, holding a glass, writing… used to be a director, you know. Lots of pointing, lots of gesturing. Hard to be precise when your hand’s doing its own thing. Mostly when I’m using them, though. When I’m just sitting, it's not so bad. Though, even then...sometimes I feel it, a little quiver. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention unless it's interfering with something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more noticeable with activity, and sometimes you feel a slight quiver even at rest. That's helpful to know. Does anything specifically make it worse – like stress, caffeine, or certain positions?
PATIENT: Stress? Everything stresses me out these days. Young people… the world… Honestly, probably. Caffeine… I used to drink a little coffee, but not much anymore. It keeps me up all night. Positions… I don’t know. I just try to avoid using my hands when it’s really bad. It's just… inconvenient. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jerrel, and I appreciate you being patient. We are getting somewhere. Knowing it's linked to activity and potentially stress helps narrow things down. To get a better understanding, I’d like to ask about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned something years ago. Gave me a pill, I think. Stopped taking it after a while, didn’t seem to make a difference. Diabetes? No. Heart problems… I get a little chest pain sometimes, but I just figured it was indigestion. Old age, again. Honestly, I don't bother with doctors much. They never seem to fix anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, chest pain sometimes, and you haven't been regularly seeing a doctor. That’s good information to have. We’ll definitely want to look into the chest pain. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had similar shaking, or any neurological conditions like Parkinson's or tremors?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s… now that I’ve heard of. My aunt, on my mother’s side, I think. She was a bit… wobbly in her later years. Couldn't walk straight. Similar? Maybe. Everyone just said she was getting old. My father… smoked like a chimney, didn’t bother with doctors. Mother… she was pretty healthy, actually. Never complained much. Look, are we done soon? This chair isn’t exactly comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, your aunt had some wobbliness in her later years, and your mother was generally healthy. That's helpful. Alright, just a few more questions, then we can do a quick physical exam, and see what we find. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I’ve been a little… tired lately. More tired than usual, anyway. And… I don’t sleep as well as I used to. Wake up a lot during the night. Mostly just thinking, though. About everything. Honestly, probably just old age, again. Is this exam going to take long? I really don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased tiredness and difficulty sleeping. We’ll factor that in. No, it won’t take long, Jerrel. I just want to quickly check your reflexes, coordination, and strength, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll take a look at your hands while you’re holding something. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Could you please hold your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But don’t expect miracles. I haven't been doing much with my hands lately, mostly just watching television. Get it over with, alright? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel, I'm just assessing your movement and reflexes. I notice a tremor in both hands, which is more pronounced when you try to do something. Your coordination seems a little affected as well. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which can be common with age. I’m also listening to your heart now. I hear a slight irregularity, which warrants further investigation. Now, could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? Honestly, I never was much for physical exertion. It's probably just old age. I keep telling you that. You young doctors never listen.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel, your grip strength is a little weaker than expected. Now, could you please stand up and take a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. See? Not exactly a spring chicken anymore. Careful now, don't want to fall and break a hip. Honestly, what are you trying to prove? It's old age. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel, thank you. I see what you mean. Based on your symptoms, the physical exam findings, and your medical history, it seems like you may have a condition called Essential Tremor, but given the slight irregularity in your heart sounds, along with the weakness and slow gait, I want to rule out other possibilities as well. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also want to order an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. I might also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Ugh, tests… referrals… More doctors? Honestly, this is just what I expected. Look, I’m not going to run around getting poked and prodded. I’m eighty years old! What’s the point? I’ve lived a long life, alright? I'd rather just…be comfortable. Is there anything you can give me to just…stop the shaking? A pill or something? Not interested in all this complicated stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jerrel, and I respect your wishes. You’re right, at eighty years old, you should be comfortable. However, even if it's just to improve your quality of life, knowing what’s causing the shaking could help us manage it better. There are medications that can help reduce the tremors, but they have potential side effects, and it’s important to know the underlying cause before starting any treatment. Also, we need to rule out other conditions that could be causing the heart irregularity. I wouldn’t recommend any medication without a proper diagnosis. How about this: I can order the blood tests and the EKG, and if everything comes back normal, we can discuss medication options. If the tests show anything abnormal, we’ll need to consult with a specialist. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests and…that heart thing. But only those two. No specialists, alright? I don't want to spend my remaining days in a hospital. And get it done quickly, alright? I've got things to do. Can I at least get a prescription for something to help me sleep? This tossing and turning is driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel, just the blood tests and EKG, and I’ll write you a prescription for a mild sleep aid to help with the tossing and turning. I’ll have the lab order sent over to the front desk, and they’ll schedule you for the blood draw. And I’ll send the prescription to your pharmacy. It might take a few days for the results to come back, but we'll call you as soon as we have them. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that's enough for now. Just get those tests done quickly, alright? I don't want to be waiting around forever. Honestly, I'm exhausted just thinking about it. .
