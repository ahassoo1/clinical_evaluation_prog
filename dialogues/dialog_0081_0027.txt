DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let's get this over with. It’s my stomach. Acid reflux, they call it. Food comes back up sometimes. It’s… unpleasant. And it’s been happening more lately.
DOCTOR: Right. “Unpleasant,” yes, I understand. And when did you first notice this… increase in frequency, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know exactly. A few weeks, maybe? Honestly, I don’t keep a calendar of when I burp, if that's what you’re expecting. It’s just… more often than it used to be. It's a bother, that's all. I eat a sensible dinner, and then bam, it’s trying to come back up. Doesn’t happen every night, mind you.
DOCTOR: Sensible dinner… could you elaborate on what that typically consists of, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: What do you mean, elaborate? I eat normal food. Meat, potatoes, maybe some vegetables. Nothing fancy. I'm not one of these fellas who's always nibbling on kale and quinoa. I eat like a grown man. A perfectly reasonable dinner. Don't tell me I need to change my diet. I’ve been eating this way for sixty years, and I’m still here, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: I wasn’t suggesting you need to change your diet, Mr. Altine. Simply gathering information. And yes, you are quite right, you appear to be doing remarkably well for sixty years. However, even established habits can sometimes contribute to new or worsening symptoms. Now, aside from the reflux itself, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? Pain? No, not really. It's more of a… burning sensation, sometimes. And a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. Nothing I can't handle. Look, I’m a practical man. I don't go running to the doctor for every little thing. I figured it would just… go away. But my wife insisted. She worries too much. Honestly, I think she just likes getting me out of the house.
DOCTOR: Right. A sour taste, burning sensation... and no accompanying pain. Does this burning sensation occur during meals, after meals, or at other times?
PATIENT: After, mostly. A couple of hours after I eat. Especially if I lie down. That’s when it really gets bad. Don't need to be tilting my head to keep everything down, if you catch my drift. I used to be able to sleep flat as a board. Now I need two pillows, sometimes three! It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Two or three pillows… and does anything seem to trigger these episodes more than others?
PATIENT: Spicy food, maybe? Though I don't eat that much of it. And sometimes if I have a big glass of water with dinner. Though that’s just common sense, isn’t it? Too much fluid. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like you’re asking me to write a dissertation on my digestive system. Is there a point to all this? I've got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: There is a point, Mr. Altine. We need to gather a complete picture. Now, do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. My father smoked, and I saw what it did to him. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two, on a Saturday. Nothing excessive. I’m not a lush, if that's what you’re thinking. I like a good Cabernet, that’s all. It’s civilized. Does that bother you?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Altine, it doesn’t “bother” me. It’s simply information. Now, regarding medications, are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. Small dose. My general practitioner prescribed it. And sometimes I take an antacid if I'm feeling a bit… well, you know. Those chalky things. But that's about it. I’m not a pill-popper. I prefer to let my body handle things itself, if possible. Is that alright with you?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Altine. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. Dust, maybe. Gets to me in the spring. But no food allergies, no drug allergies. Never had a problem with any of that. Look, I’m telling you, I'm a perfectly healthy man. This whole thing is probably just… indigestion. Can we just get a prescription for something and be done with it? I really don't have time for a full workup.
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, while I appreciate your… directness, a thorough evaluation is crucial. We cannot simply prescribe medication without understanding the underlying cause. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then palpate your abdomen. It won't take long. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Palpate my… look, I’m not a fan of being poked and prodded, if you don't mind. But if you insist. Just… get it over with. Quickly, if you please. And don't tell me I need to change my diet. I'm warning you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. I will begin with listening to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply, Mr. Altine… in and out. Sounds are normal, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs appreciated. Deep breaths… good. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. Some mild guarding noted, but no significant tenderness to palpation. No masses appreciated. Alright. Everything appears normal, however, given your symptoms and history, I recommend a few blood tests to rule out any underlying issues, such as H. pylori infection, and a possible endoscopy to visualize your esophagus and stomach. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? Are you serious? Stick a camera down my throat? Absolutely not! Look, I'm not doing that. I'm perfectly capable of managing this myself. A little antacid, a glass of water, and maybe I’ll cut back on the wine. That's all I need. Blood tests, fine. But no cameras. I’m telling you, I’m a healthy man. This is ridiculous. Just give me something for the heartburn and let’s be done with it. I have a life, you know. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. However, I must strongly advise that refusing further investigation could lead to a delayed diagnosis and potential complications. Nonetheless, I will write you a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor to manage your symptoms. I will also order blood work as you requested, to rule out H. pylori and assess your overall health. Here is your prescription for omeprazole. Take one tablet daily, 30 minutes before a meal. And here is the lab requisition. Please schedule an appointment with your local lab at your earliest convenience. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve within two weeks, I urge you to reconsider the endoscopy and consult with a gastroenterologist. Do you have any questions?
