DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Korrell. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… off. Really off, for a bit now. I keep getting… diarrhea. It’s been happening a lot, and it’s… annoying, mostly. I just want it to stop. I think it’s been going on for a couple of weeks, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, you say. Annoying is… a subjective term, Jase. Can you describe what you mean by “off”?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, sorry. “Annoying” isn’t very helpful, is it? Okay, so… it’s not just having to go all the time, it’s… loose. Very loose. And sometimes it’s cramping too, really bad cramping before I go. It doesn’t feel like… a normal stomach bug, if that makes sense? Like, it’s not like a quick thing that goes away. It just… keeps happening. I also feel really tired, but I don't know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Tired, hmm?
PATIENT: Yeah, just… worn out. Like I haven’t slept well, even when I have. It's hard to explain. And… I don’t know if this matters, but my husband keeps saying I'm paler than usual? I haven't really been paying attention, to be honest. I just feel… blah.
DOCTOR: Pale, and fatigue… alright. Now, let’s try to be specific. When you say “loose,” can you describe the stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is embarrassing. It’s… watery. Really watery. And sometimes there's… well, undigested food in it, I guess? Like, you can see things that haven't really been broken down. It’s not… bloody, if that’s what you’re wondering, but it’s just… not normal. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining this.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Jase. We need to get a clear picture. Undigested food, watery consistency… and no blood, that’s good. Have you noticed any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And I haven’t thrown up, thankfully. I do feel a little queasy sometimes, especially before I… you know. But not full-on nausea, just a bit of a sick feeling. It’s hard to tell if that’s just from the stomach stuff, though. I haven’t been eating much because of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… that’s a good question. I haven’t really been trying to lose weight, and I haven't weighed myself in ages. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? But honestly, I just figured it was the heat. I haven't thought about actually weighing myself.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, let’s go over some basics. Do you have any allergies – food, medication, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My husband always makes fun of me because I’ll try anything once. He's the cautious one, definitely. And I don’t have any… medical allergies, like to penicillin or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. Just the usual painkillers for headaches sometimes, but that's it. I don’t really like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a weekend trip to visit my sister in Birmingham last month. That was it. Nothing international, or anything exciting. Just Birmingham. It was nice, but… no, nothing that would cause this, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to examine you, Jase. Let’s start with listening to your abdomen. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. Is that… is that going to be uncomfortable? I’m always a little nervous about… you know, doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be. I’ll just be listening with a stethoscope. And I'll palpate your abdomen. I need to feel for any tenderness or masses. It won't be pleasant if there is tenderness, but it's necessary to get a proper assessment. Let's start with your abdomen, and then I'll check your vitals.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just… let me know if it’s going to hurt, alright? I’m a bit of a wimp, to be honest. And… this is probably a stupid question, but what are you looking for exactly? I just… I like to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I’m listening for bowel sounds - are they normal, hyperactive, or hypoactive. I’m also listening for any bruits, which could indicate an issue with blood flow. And now I'm feeling for tenderness, masses, and rigidity. I'm noting some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. Your bowel sounds are slightly hyperactive. No masses detected. Blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 88, temperature is 98.6, and respiration rate is 16. Within normal limits. Based on your symptoms and the examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing an inflammatory bowel issue. However, this could be caused by several different things, so we’ll need to run some tests to get a definitive diagnosis.
PATIENT: Oh. Inflammatory… that sounds serious. What kind of tests? And… what if it is that? What does that even mean? I’m sorry, I’m just… I get anxious easily. I think my husband was right to make me come. I usually just try to tough it out, but… this has been going on too long.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, yes, but it doesn't automatically mean the worst. Many things can cause similar symptoms, including infections, food sensitivities, and even stress. We’re just being thorough. The tests I want to order are a stool sample to check for infection, blood in the stool, and inflammation markers. We'll also do a blood test to check your complete blood count and rule out anemia. And I'd like to order a C-reactive protein test, which is another marker of inflammation. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: Ugh, tests. Okay. A stool sample… that’s… embarrassing. And blood tests are always awful. But okay, if it helps figure things out. What happens after the tests? Like, how long does it take to get the results? And if it is something… inflammatory… what do you do about it? Do you… take pills? I really don’t like pills.
DOCTOR: The stool sample will require a collection at home, I’ll provide you with a kit and detailed instructions, it's not pleasant, but it is necessary. The blood test will be done here in the clinic. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. As for treatment, it depends on the diagnosis. If it’s an infection, we'll treat it with antibiotics. If it's an inflammatory bowel condition, the treatment can vary depending on the severity. It may involve medication, but not necessarily. There are dietary changes and lifestyle modifications that can help manage the symptoms. We'll discuss all the options thoroughly once we have the results. To clarify, have you experienced any blood in your stool at all?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I've seen, anyway. Like I said before, it's just… watery. Sometimes with undigested food, but definitely no blood. I’m just… worried about it being something serious. My grandfather had stomach problems, and he… well, it wasn't good. I don't want it to be like that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It's good that you don't see any blood in the stool, that's a positive sign. And it’s important to remember that everyone is different. Your grandfather's situation doesn't necessarily mean you'll experience the same thing. We'll get to the bottom of this, and we'll come up with a plan that's right for you. I’m going to order these tests now, and then I’ll give you the instructions for the stool sample collection. I’ll also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist, just in case we need a specialist opinion. Would you prefer a male or female specialist?
PATIENT: Oh… a specialist? That sounds… serious. Um… female, please. I’m just more comfortable with a woman, if that’s okay. And… is there anything I can do now? Like, anything I can eat or avoid to make things a little better while we wait for the results? I don't want to just sit here and worry, you know?
DOCTOR: A gastroenterologist is just a precaution, Jase. It's better to have all the information. As for what you can do now, I recommend a bland diet – things like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. Avoid dairy, caffeine, alcohol, and fatty foods. Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. And try to reduce your stress levels if possible. I'm also going to order a prescription for an anti-diarrheal medication, to help manage the symptoms in the meantime. It’s not a long-term solution, but it can provide some relief while we wait for the results. Here you are. And I'll have the nurse come in and give you the instructions for the stool sample collection and a list of foods to avoid. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay. Bland diet… I can do that, I think. Anti-diarrheal… that sounds good. Anything to stop… well, you know. I think… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Korrell. You’ve been very helpful. I guess I’ll go and try to find some bananas. And avoid stress… that’s the hard part. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Jase. Just remember to follow the instructions, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this, together. Take care, and try to relax. I'll have the nurse come in to help you with the next steps.
