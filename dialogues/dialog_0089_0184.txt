DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I don't have all day, so let's get right to it. It's… well, it's this. It's not what it used to be, you understand? Everything sags. Everything. And it's… upsetting. I want it fixed. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand you want to get to the bottom of this quickly. "Everything sags" – can you be a little more specific about what you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Specific? I just told you. My belly. It's gone soft. And my… well, everything below is not… perky, like it once was. You a doctor or you need me to draw you a picture? I used to be strong, you know? Pile driving. Real work. Now… now I just look old. That’s specific enough, isn't it? I want it tightened. Like it was before.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you, Mr. Trendler. You're noticing changes in your abdominal area and… other areas, and you'd like to explore options to address that. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, let's talk a bit more about when you first started noticing these changes. Was it gradual, or did it happen suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual? Look, time passes, doesn't it? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and poof! Everything fell down. It's been… years. Maybe five? Ten? I don't keep track of these things. I just know it wasn't always like this. I was a strong man, Doctor. Always been active. Used to swim, you know. Then my wife… well, after she passed, things just… went. That's all I know. Does that help? Or do you need a timeline down to the hour?
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. And I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult. So, about five to ten years ago you began noticing these changes, and it coincided with a significant life event. Has your activity level changed significantly since then?
PATIENT: Activity? What activity? I still walk, you know. To the shop. Back from the shop. Not much pile driving these days, if you can imagine. My knees ain’t what they used to be. And frankly, after my wife… well, there wasn’t much reason to do much of anything. Just… existing, mostly. So, yes. My activity level went down. A lot. Is that what you want to know? You askin' about how much I exercise? I haven't exercised in years. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Look around, Doctor. Do I look like I haven't gained a few pounds? I ain’t a spring chicken anymore, you know. I eat what I want, when I want. Not like when I was younger, watching every little thing. So, yes. I've gained weight. But it's not just the weight, it's… the shape of it all. Everything's gone… south. You understand? It’s the sagging. Not the pounds. The sagging. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very clear. So, weight gain and a change in the shape of your abdomen, with the primary concern being the sagging. Now, let's quickly go through some other things. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Heart problems? I'm a strong Jamaican man, Doctor. Always been healthy as a horse. Well, mostly. Bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but I take a little pill for it. That's it. Nothing serious. No sugar sickness or anything fancy like that. Just the blood pressure. And I mostly remember to take the pill. Does that answer your question? I ain’t one for all those medical terms, you know. Keep it simple, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, managed with medication. Good. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Let me think… No. I don't think so. Maybe something for my knees a while back, but I stopped taking it. Didn't do much good anyway. Just the blood pressure pill. That’s it. I’m not one for popping pills, you know. Only take what I have to. Now, can we get to the part where you tell me what can be done about this? I haven't got all day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I grew up in Jamaica! I eat everything! Ackee, saltfish, mangoes, you name it. Never had a problem with allergies. No, no allergies. Nothing. I'm a tough man, remember? Now, are you going to tell me what options I have to fix this… this situation, or are we just going to keep asking questions? Honestly, I expected a bit more from a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I just want to get a better feel for what’s going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently examine your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Look, I don't like being poked and prodded, you know. But… Alright. Go ahead. But be gentle. And don't take all day. My time is valuable, Doctor. Just get it over with. Quickly, please. I’m not one for this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound okay. Now, I’m going to gently examine your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any unusual masses or tenderness. There's some loose skin, as expected. Your blood pressure is 140/90 today, which is a bit elevated. I’m documenting all of this.
PATIENT: Elevated? What’s elevated? My blood pressure? Is that bad? Look, Doctor, I don’t need a list of everything that's wrong with me. I came here to fix something, not to hear about how old I am. Now, what can be done about this… this sagging? Surgery? Pills? What are my options? Get to the point, please. This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Let's talk about options. Given your concerns about abdominal sagging and loose skin, and considering your overall health, we have a few things to discuss. Surgery, such as a tummy tuck , is an option to remove excess skin and fat and tighten the abdominal muscles. However, it's a significant procedure with a recovery period. Non-surgical options, such as weight loss and exercise, can help to some degree, but may not provide the same dramatic results. There are also some non-invasive body contouring procedures available, but their effectiveness varies. Your slightly elevated blood pressure is something we need to address. It increases your risk for heart disease and stroke, and it's important to get it under control before considering any major surgery. Given your concerns, I recommend we start with a referral to a vascular surgeon for a full assessment of your blood pressure. We can discuss further options after that. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Vascular surgeon? More doctors? Look, I came here to get something fixed, not to run around seeing a dozen different specialists! Surgery is what I want. I don’t want to diet or exercise. I want a tummy tuck. Is it risky? Can you do it? What are the chances it will actually fix this? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not getting any younger. I need answers, not referrals. Just tell me straight – can you fix me, or can’t you? And what will it cost? That’s all I want to know. Plain and simple. Don’t waste my time with long explanations.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. A tummy tuck is an option, but it's a significant surgery with inherent risks. Given your elevated blood pressure, I'm hesitant to proceed without it being properly managed first. The risks of complications, such as infection or blood clots, are increased with uncontrolled hypertension. I can perform the surgery, yes, but I need a letter from a vascular surgeon confirming your blood pressure is under control before I can schedule it. It’s a matter of patient safety. As for cost, a tummy tuck typically ranges from $8,000 to $12,000, depending on the extent of the procedure and the facility fees. That does not include anesthesia or post-operative care. I can give you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly respected vascular surgeon in the area. She can evaluate your blood pressure and advise you on the best course of action. Would you like that referral?
PATIENT: $8,000? $12,000? That’s… a lot of money. Alright. Fine. Dr. Sharma, you say? Give me the referral. But if she tells me I need to be on some complicated diet or take a dozen pills, I'm coming straight back here. I'm not wasting my time with all that. Just… give me the information. And make sure she understands I want to get this done. I haven’t got all day. And I’m trusting you to make this happen. Now, let’s finish this. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is Dr. Sharma’s information. Her office number is 555-123-4567. Please schedule an appointment with her as soon as possible. Once she clears you for surgery, call my office, and we’ll schedule a consultation to discuss the procedure in detail. I’m documenting everything in your chart. I’m also going to write a prescription for your blood pressure medication – a refill, just to ensure you don’t run out. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s everything. Just… make sure Dr. Sharma understands the urgency. I want this done as quickly as possible. And I’m trusting you to get it done right. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Trendler. We’ll do our best to facilitate the process. Have a good day. .
