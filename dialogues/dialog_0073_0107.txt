DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. My heart... it feels funny sometimes. Like it's flapping. Not always, but when it does, it scares me a little. It's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: "Flapping," alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe a few months now? It started slow, just once in a while. Now it happens... I don't know... maybe two, three times a week? Sometimes more if I walk a lot. It doesn’t hurt, just… fast. Like a bird’s wings.
DOCTOR: A few months, increasing frequency… and it’s brought on by exertion, specifically walking. Does anything else seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Not that I’ve noticed. Just walking. Or sometimes, if I get really excited about something. Like, happy excited, not angry. My wife says it happens then too, but I don’t always feel it. She sees it. She says my face gets a little different. I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Interesting. Your wife noticing changes in your face… that's good information. So, it's associated with physical activity and strong emotions. Has this been interfering with your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Not really interfering, no. I just… I worry about it. I work with chemicals, you know? And fast heart… doesn't seem good. Makes me nervous to think about it at work. I don't feel bad, just worried. My wife says I should get it checked, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Understandable. It's wise to get these things checked out, especially given your work environment. Now, let's go through some general health questions. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been lucky. Maybe a little cough sometimes in the winter, but nothing serious. Never been to the hospital for anything big. Just the usual colds. I'm pretty healthy, I think. Work is hard, but I'm strong. No problems, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. Nothing like that. Always been too healthy, remember? My wife jokes I’m too stubborn to let anyone cut me open.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my father, he had some problems with his… blood pressure, I think. High blood pressure. He’s okay now, he takes medicine. My mother, she’s healthy as a horse. Still cooking and cleaning. No heart problems in my family, that I know of. Just my father's blood pressure. It was a worry for him.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of hypertension in your father. And you said your mother is in good health. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. I don't smoke. Never liked it. And I don’t drink alcohol, not even a little bit. And definitely no drugs. I work with chemicals all day, that’s enough. I don’t need anything else. My wife would kill me if I did.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just… sometimes a little pain reliever for my back, if I lift something too heavy at work. But not often. It's just ibuprofen, the regular kind you buy at the store. That’s it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of. I eat everything. My wife makes me try new things all the time. Sometimes I don't like them, but I don't get sick or anything. No allergies, no. Not a one.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Go ahead. I'm ready. Just… tell me if something is wrong, okay? I'm a little nervous, but I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. Let’s start with your blood pressure. … Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your heart rate is currently 78 and regular. I'm hearing some normal heart sounds, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. … Reflexes are normal, and coordination appears intact. Everything appears within normal limits, although the blood pressure is a bit high. We need to keep an eye on that.
PATIENT: Okay. A bit high… my wife says I worry too much. What does that mean, Doctor? Should I be scared? Is it because of my heart flapping? Is that what's causing it? I don't understand... what should we do next?
DOCTOR: It's good you're getting this checked out, Mr. Puder. While your physical exam was largely normal, the elevated blood pressure and your description of these heart palpitations warrant further investigation. It’s unlikely these palpitations are directly causing the elevated blood pressure, but they could be related. To rule out any underlying cardiac issues, I’d like to order an EKG – an electrocardiogram – to assess your heart’s electrical activity. We'll also do some blood work to check your electrolytes, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. And finally, I’d like you to wear a Holter monitor for 24-48 hours to record your heart rhythm over a longer period of time. Do you understand?
PATIENT: EKG… blood work… Holter monitor… That sounds like a lot, Doctor. Is it bad? Is my heart really sick? I just want to know if it's safe to keep working. Chemicals… they're not good if my heart is weak. What will these tests tell you? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m worried about losing my job if I need to take time off.
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, it’s understandable to be worried. These tests are not necessarily indicating that your heart is sick. They're simply precautionary measures to get a more complete picture of what’s going on. Think of it as gathering information. The EKG is a quick, painless test that records your heart’s electrical activity. The blood work will help us rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms. And the Holter monitor is a small, wearable device that records your heart rhythm over an extended period, which can help us identify any irregular heartbeats that might not show up during a brief office visit. As for your work, we’ll know more after the tests are completed. We can discuss any necessary work restrictions if needed. The results should be back in about a week. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A week… okay. That sounds… better. Gathering information, you said. Not necessarily sick. Yes, that sounds alright. I trust you, Doctor. So, what do I do now? Where do I go for these tests? And will my insurance cover them? I don’t have much money…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. Here are the orders for the EKG and blood work. You can get those done at the lab across the street - here’s a voucher to cover the cost of those. The Holter monitor, we can fit you with that here in the office tomorrow morning at 9am. As for insurance… unfortunately, you indicated you are not currently insured. The lab voucher will cover the blood work and EKG, but the Holter monitor is a bit more expensive. We can discuss payment options or potentially connect you with resources that may be able to help with the cost. The total cost for the Holter monitor is $300. I'll have my nurse go over the instructions for wearing the Holter monitor with you tomorrow. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity and keep a log of any palpitations you experience, noting the time and what you were doing when they occurred. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: $300… That’s… a lot of money. I'll have to talk to my wife. I don't know if we have that right now. But… I guess I need to know. Okay, I’ll talk to her. I'll come back tomorrow morning at 9am for the monitor. And I will keep a log. I promise. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I’m still a little scared, but… I feel a little better knowing what’s going on. I guess I’ll go home now and talk to my wife. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. And remember, we're just gathering information at this point. We'll figure this out together. Have a good evening, and I’ll see you tomorrow morning.
