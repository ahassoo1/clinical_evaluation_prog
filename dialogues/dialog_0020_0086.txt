DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Results discussion, right? I’m Kahrin, by the way. Just want to get this over with if that’s alright. I’ve got a pretty busy day.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Results discussion. Sorry to hear you're feeling rushed, Kahrin. I'll try to be as efficient as possible. Just to confirm, those are the results from the blood work and urine analysis we did last week, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that's the stuff. Last Tuesday, I think it was? Look, I don’t really remember the specifics of the tests, just that you wanted to check a few things. What did they show?
DOCTOR: Right, yes. Last Tuesday… Okay. Well, generally speaking, the results were a bit… unusual. I’m having a little trouble recalling the exact sequence of events that led us to order those specific tests, but I do remember noting some concerns during your initial examination. To start, your white blood cell count was slightly elevated, and there was some protein in your urine. Can you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any symptoms like frequent urination, fever, or unusual fatigue lately?
PATIENT: Hmm. Nope, nothing like that. No fever, no extra tired, and I pee normal, I guess. I haven’t really paid attention to my pee, if that makes sense. Elevated white blood cells... is that bad? Look, I'm not a medical person, so you're gonna have to explain it to me like I'm five.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. No, you shouldn’t be expected to know medical terminology. “Elevated white blood cells” basically means your body is fighting something off. It’s often a sign of infection, but it can also be caused by other things, like stress or inflammation. The protein in your urine is also something we need to investigate further. It could be nothing, like just being dehydrated, but it could also indicate a problem with your kidneys. Do you have any history of kidney problems in your family?
PATIENT: Kidney problems? Not that I know of. My grandma had… arthritis, I think? And my dad’s always complaining about his back, but he’s old. I drink plenty of water, honestly. More than most people, probably. I try to stay hydrated. Maybe it was just a weird day? I had a really salty meal the night before, actually. Lots of soy sauce. Could that do it?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your hydration, and the salty meal could certainly be a factor. Soy sauce is high in sodium, and that can temporarily increase protein levels in your urine. However, because your white blood cell count was also elevated, I'd like to rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a repeat urine analysis, and also a basic metabolic panel - that’s a blood test that checks your kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: More tests? Seriously? Look, I really don’t have time for a lot of back and forth. I've got commitments. Is this something urgent? Like, am I gonna drop dead if I don’t do these tests? Because if it’s not a big deal, I'd rather just skip it. I’m already behind on everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Kahrin, and I wouldn't order these tests if I didn't think they were important. It’s not likely you’re going to “drop dead,” but the elevated white blood cells and protein in your urine could indicate an underlying issue that we should address. Ignoring it could lead to more serious complications down the line. The repeat urine analysis and basic metabolic panel are relatively quick and simple tests. They'll give us a clearer picture of what's going on and help me determine if any further investigation or treatment is necessary. It’s best to be proactive, especially since you are uninsured and may not have easy access to follow-up care if something does develop. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Proactive. Right. No insurance, gotta be careful. Fine. Do the tests. But please, tell me how long they’ll take, and what the next steps are before I leave here. I don’t want any surprises. And can I get the results online? I'm really busy, remember? I need to know what I’m dealing with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The tests will take approximately 15-20 minutes to draw the blood and collect the urine sample. The lab usually has results back within 24-48 hours. We can set up online access to your results through our patient portal, and I will also have my nurse call you with the findings. I’ll put in the orders now. And, to reiterate, based on the initial results, we're looking at possibilities ranging from a simple urinary tract infection to something less common. We'll discuss everything in detail once we have the results. We may need to refer you to a nephrologist if the kidney function tests are significantly abnormal, but let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. Sound good?
PATIENT: Okay. Nephrologist… great. Just... get it over with, please. Where do I go for the blood work and pee? And will it cost me a fortune? I don't even have a good estimate of what this is gonna cost me. I’m on a tight budget, so I need to know upfront. No surprises, remember?
DOCTOR: Here’s a lab order for both tests. You can go to any of the LabCorp locations listed on this paper. As for cost… that’s a bit tricky. Since you’re uninsured, the cost will depend on the lab’s pricing. I can give you an estimated range, but it’s not always accurate. The blood work will likely be between $80-$120, and the urine analysis around $30-$50. However, I can have our billing department contact you with a more precise estimate before you go to the lab, and we can potentially explore payment options if needed. I understand your concerns about cost, and we’ll do everything we can to make this as affordable as possible. And again, I want to emphasize that these are just preliminary tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Don’t panic before we have all the information. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Okay, LabCorp. Fine. I guess $150 isn’t terrible. Can they just bill me directly? I don't want any hold music with insurance companies. And no, that’s all. Just… get this over with. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kahrin. Yes, LabCorp can bill you directly. My nurse will be in shortly to finalize the paperwork and give you instructions on how to access the patient portal. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. And remember, we’ll discuss the results as soon as they're available. Take care, and I hope you have a good day despite everything. .
