DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Puder. I'm Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my heart, it feels funny sometimes. Like... fluttering. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not always, but... yeah. Fluttering.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fluttering.” Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Like... fast beating. Not like when I run, you know? Just... happens when I sit. Or when I sleep. Sometimes. It stops after a little bit. Maybe a minute? Maybe longer. Hard to say. It doesn't hurt, just... feels weird.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it’s a fast heartbeat that happens at rest, or even when you’re sleeping, and it usually resolves on its own within a minute or so. Does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like... make it happen? Hmmm... Not really. I don't think so. I drink coffee, maybe? But I drink coffee every day. And it doesn’t always happen after coffee. I eat, I sleep, I work... it just... starts. Sometimes after work, I think. Long day at the plant, you know? Lots of machines.
DOCTOR: Okay, so coffee doesn't seem to be a consistent trigger, and you suspect it might be more common after a long day at the plant. Do you feel any other symptoms with the fluttering?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Not dizzy. No... shortness of breath. Just the fast beating. Sometimes a little tired, but I am always a little tired from work, you know? It's a hard job. Not sure if that's the heart or just… work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms associated with it, and you suspect the tiredness is likely related to your job. Have you ever had this happen before?
PATIENT: Um... maybe. A long time ago. When I was younger. But I don't remember it being this... often. It was just once or twice, I think. I didn’t go to the doctor then. Just went away. This has been... more regular the last few months. That's why I came in.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a relatively new increase in frequency over the last few months. And you haven't had any prior medical evaluations for this. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. No. Not to medicine, not to food, nothing. I can eat anything. I take no medicine, usually. Sometimes for headache, but that's all. The little white pills, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and you only take over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. No doctor ever told me anything. I go to work, I come home. I haven’t been to the doctor in... a long time. Maybe ten years? I felt okay. Just this heart thing now. My wife told me to come, she said it was important.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no prior diagnosed medical conditions, and it’s been about ten years since your last check-up. And your wife encouraged you to come in. Have any close family members – parents, siblings – had any heart problems?
PATIENT: My father... he had a problem with his chest. A long time ago. I think he had to have... something done. A little cut and they fixed it. But I don’t know what exactly. He lived in Yemen, you know? It was a long time ago. I was young. My mother… she was okay. No heart problems, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father had a chest issue requiring a procedure, but you don’t have specifics. And your mother had no known heart issues. And just to confirm, you’re currently working at a plant?
PATIENT: Yes. Chemical plant. Lots of machines. I check the levels, make sure everything is okay. It’s a good job, hard work, but good. I’ve been there… seven years, I think. Maybe eight. It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned being tired after work. Do you feel any other symptoms at work, like lightheadedness, dizziness, or trouble breathing, especially after physical exertion?
PATIENT: No. Not really. I get hot, you know? It’s hot in the plant. And sometimes my hands shake a little after a long shift. But that’s just… tired. Not dizzy. Not trouble breathing. Just tired and hot. The machines are loud, too. Makes my head hurt sometimes, but not like… a bad headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you experience some fatigue, overheating, and occasional hand tremors at work, along with some mild headaches from the noise. Let me just quickly check your vitals. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is 130/85, your pulse is 88 and regular, and your temperature is normal. Your lungs sound clear. I do hear a slight irregularity in your heartbeat, though. It’s subtle, but it's there. It's not immediately concerning, but it's worth investigating further.
PATIENT: Irregular? What does that mean? Is it bad? My wife will be worried.
DOCTOR: It just means your heartbeat isn’t perfectly consistent. It's not necessarily bad, but it's something we need to look into to understand why it's irregular. It could be a lot of things – stress, caffeine, dehydration, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order an EKG – an electrocardiogram. It's a simple, painless test that records your heart's electrical activity. It will help us see if there's anything we need to be concerned about. We’ll also do some bloodwork to check your electrolytes and thyroid function, just to rule out other possibilities. How does that sound?
PATIENT: EKG? Is that like… a machine? Will it hurt? And bloodwork… lots of needles? My wife… she doesn't like needles.
DOCTOR: The EKG is a simple test, Mr. Puder. It doesn’t hurt at all. We’ll put some small, sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs – like little stickers – and they’re connected to a machine that records your heart’s rhythm. It takes about five minutes. The bloodwork involves a needle, yes, but it’s quick. We only need a small amount of blood, and the phlebotomist is very good at it. We can try to make it as comfortable as possible for your wife if she comes with you. It will help us rule out other causes of your heart fluttering. Do you agree to the EKG and bloodwork?
PATIENT: Okay. Stickers and a little needle… My wife will come with me. She wants to know everything. If you can make it quick with the needle, that would be good. Yes, okay. I agree. When can we do it?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can do both tests right away. The phlebotomist is available now, and we have a room ready for the EKG. It will take about 30-45 minutes total, including the waiting time for the phlebotomist. Let’s go ahead and get started. I'll explain everything as we go. And I'll be happy to answer any questions your wife has as well.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. My wife is right behind me. She has a list of questions.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let's get started, then. I'm sure we can address all her concerns. Please, follow me. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. .
