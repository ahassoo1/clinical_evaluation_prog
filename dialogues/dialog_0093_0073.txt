DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the nurse. This… this diarrhea. It won’t stop. I’ve tried everything. It's been going on for weeks, and frankly, I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. The nurse did mention the diarrhea. “Weeks,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks. More than I care to remember, honestly. It started… sometime in July, I guess. And everything the pharmacy keeps selling me just… doesn’t work. It’s just… awful. And embarrassing, if you want to know the truth. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. It sounds quite disruptive to your life, and it's perfectly normal to feel embarrassed discussing such things. We'll get to the bottom of this. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… watery. Obviously. And frequent. What more do you need to know? It’s not like I’m enjoying detailing this for you. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, Ms. Woodring. I assure you, they're necessary to help determine the cause. When you say frequent, approximately how many times a day are you experiencing this?
PATIENT: Look, it varies! Some days it’s… okay, maybe six or seven. Other days? More. A lot more. I stopped counting after a while, frankly. It’s just… constant. And it’s ruining my life, okay? I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Six to seven times a day, sometimes more. I understand this is significantly impacting your daily life, and we’ll work to find a solution. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't ask me to look at it! Honestly. But… yeah. Sometimes. A little. It’s… not a lot, but it's there. It's disgusting. Is that… serious? Because I really don’t have time for serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me. The presence of blood and mucus is something we need to investigate further, Ms. Woodring, but it doesn't necessarily mean it’s serious. It does, however, help us narrow down the possibilities. Have you experienced any fever, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Fever… not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothing major. My stomach… yeah, it cramps. A lot. Especially before… well, you know. And nauseous, yeah, sometimes I feel a little sick to my stomach, but I haven't actually thrown up. I just… feel awful all over. Like I've got the flu, but it's just… this.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping, nausea, but no fever or vomiting. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I was… married, but my husband passed away a few years back. Otherwise, I’m healthy. I mean, I work hard, I paint houses, it’s physical work. I don’t just sit around. I don't have time for doctors or illnesses. That's about it. No allergies, no anything. What does that even matter? It’s my stomach!
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Woodring. I’m very sorry for your loss. And you are right, focusing on your stomach is important. I ask about your medical history simply to rule out anything that might be contributing to your symptoms. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… no. Not that I recall. Maybe when I was little, tonsils or something, but I don’t remember. Nothing major. Definitely nothing recently. Look, can we just get to the point? What are you going to do about this? I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Woodring. I apologize for the delay. To proceed, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. This will involve listening to your abdomen and checking for any tenderness. It’s a standard procedure to help assess the situation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. But be quick about it. I don’t have all day. And please, don’t ask me to… you know. I’m already embarrassed enough.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Woodring. I will be as efficient and respectful as possible. Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. I’m feeling some tenderness in your lower abdomen, especially on your left side. Your bowel sounds are a little hyperactive, which is consistent with diarrhea. No masses or other abnormalities detected. Your temperature is 98.7 Fahrenheit, pulse is 78 and regular, and blood pressure is 120/80. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that hurts. Especially… right there. It’s… a cramping kind of pain. Like a really bad stomach ache. Look, can we just skip the poking and prodding? I’m pretty sure it's my stomach, okay? What’s next? A pill? A shot? Just fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Woodring. Based on your symptoms and the examination, it’s likely we are dealing with an inflammatory process in your colon. However, to rule out other possibilities, such as a bacterial infection or other underlying causes, I would like to order a stool sample for testing. It will help us identify if any pathogens are present. Would you be able to collect a sample?
PATIENT: A… a what? You want a… sample? Seriously? I already told you, I'm embarrassed enough! Fine. Whatever. Just give me the container and tell me what to do. But I swear, if you make me come back for another one, I’m finding a different doctor. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for any added inconvenience. The test is a standard procedure and will provide valuable information. The instructions explain how to collect the sample. Please bring it back to the clinic within 48 hours. I will also prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. It's called Loperamide. However, this is only a temporary solution, and the stool test results will determine the best course of action. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… get this over with. And please, no more poking and prodding, or… samples. I have a house to paint. Is there anything else? Because honestly, I'm starting to feel sick just being here.
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: Alright, Ms. Woodring. That will be all for today. Just remember to bring the stool sample within 48 hours, and take the Loperamide as directed on the prescription. If your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, please contact the clinic immediately. Thank you for your patience, and I hope you feel better soon. .
