DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Beinborn. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. Too much gas. It is quite bothersome, really. I am hoping you can help me understand what is going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, “gas” – that can be quite uncomfortable. When did you first start noticing this becoming a problem?
PATIENT: Let me think… It began, oh, perhaps three months ago, I would say. Around the beginning of May, if I recall correctly. It was not so bad at first, just a little… puffiness, you could say. But it has gotten worse, steadily, over the time. Now it is… frequent. And sometimes quite loud.
DOCTOR: Okay, starting around May, gradually worsening. And you said “frequent” – could you give me a rough idea of how often you're experiencing this gas throughout the day?
PATIENT: Well, it is difficult to say exactly. Perhaps… six or eight times a day? Sometimes more if I eat certain foods. It really varies. After lunch, usually. And sometimes in the evening while I am watching television. It is… unpredictable, you see. Not a constant thing, but often enough to be a worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight times a day, often after lunch and sometimes in the evening. You mentioned certain foods… Have you noticed any specific foods that seem to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Yes, that is true. Beans, definitely beans. And… cabbage, I believe. Also, sometimes onions. If I eat a lot of bread, that seems to cause it too. Though, honestly, it is hard to pinpoint. I eat many different things during the day, working at the fast food place. It could be almost anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, beans, cabbage, onions, and bread seem to be common culprits. Working at a fast food place makes it harder to track, that's understandable. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the gas?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. Sometimes, yes, a little bit of… discomfort in my stomach. Not pain, exactly, more like… bloating. And a feeling of fullness, even if I have not eaten much. It is not always there, only sometimes when the gas is particularly bad. And… perhaps a little tiredness. But I do work long hours, so that could be something else entirely.
DOCTOR: Bloating, feeling full quickly, and some tiredness. Okay. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, that is… a delicate topic. They are… regular, I suppose. Once a day, usually. Not particularly difficult, but not… firm, if you understand. A bit… loose, sometimes. It varies, much like the gas. I wouldn't say it is a problem, problem, but it is not… ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally regular, but sometimes a bit loose. Thank you for sharing that, it’s helpful information. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I am aware of, Doctor. I have not been to a doctor in quite some time, to be honest. I do have Medicare, thankfully, but I try to avoid going unless it is absolutely necessary. I have never been diagnosed with anything, no. My mother had some trouble with her… joints, when she was older, but I do not believe I inherited that. Otherwise, I am… generally healthy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. And what about any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had any. I have been quite lucky, in that regard. I did have my tonsils removed when I was a very young boy, perhaps seven or eight years old. But that was a very long time ago. It did not cause any issues, as far as I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I am aware of. I can eat anything, as far as I know. I have never had a reaction to any food. And I have not taken any medications recently, except for an occasional pain reliever for a headache. But that is rare.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or medications. And lastly, before we move on to a brief physical exam, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am single, and I live alone. I work at the fast food restaurant, as I mentioned, full-time. I don’t have many hobbies, to be frank. I enjoy watching television, mostly. And reading. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I do not use any… recreational substances, if that is what you mean. I try to lead a quiet and simple life.
DOCTOR: Okay, single, lives alone, works full-time at a fast food restaurant. No smoking, minimal alcohol. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your abdomen and checking for any tenderness. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. Please proceed. I understand it is necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. I’m not hearing any unusual sounds at this time. I’m going to gently press on your abdomen now to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. How does that feel?
PATIENT: A little bit… uncomfortable, Doctor. Not painful, exactly, but… firm. Especially on the left side, I believe. It is difficult to say, to be honest. I am not used to being poked and prodded. But it is not terribly unpleasant. Just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little firmness on the left side, noticeable. No sharp pain reported. I’m not feeling any masses or significant abnormalities. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief examination, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms consistent with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. The gas, bloating, changes in bowel movements, and some discomfort are common signs. However, to rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order a stool test to check for any infections or inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: IBS? I… I have heard of that. It sounds… complicated. A stool test? Yes, Doctor, if you think it is necessary, please proceed. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, to be honest. Is it a difficult test? Will it be… unpleasant?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned. IBS can be frustrating, but it's a common condition, and we can manage the symptoms. The stool test is quite simple, really. You'll receive a kit with instructions on how to collect a small sample at home. It's not pleasant, no, but it's certainly not invasive or painful. You'll just need to follow the instructions carefully and bring the sample to the lab. I'll also recommend keeping a food diary for the next week to see if we can identify any specific triggers for your symptoms. Just write down everything you eat and drink, and any symptoms you experience. In the meantime, you could try over-the-counter remedies like simethicone for the gas, and peppermint oil capsules can sometimes help with bloating. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that does sound manageable. A food diary… I can do that. It might be a bit tedious, but I will try my best. The stool test… I will collect the sample as instructed. And I will look into the simethicone and peppermint oil. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel much better. So, I will collect the sample, keep the diary, and try the remedies. And then… what? I will come back to see you?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Once you have the results of the stool test, and you've had a week of keeping the food diary, please schedule a follow-up appointment. We can discuss the results, review your diary, and develop a more tailored plan to manage your symptoms. I’ll have the nurse print out the instructions for the stool test and a sample food diary template for you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You have been very thorough and helpful. I am very grateful for your time and attention. Thank you again. I will schedule the follow-up appointment as soon as I have the results. I suppose that is all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. It was my pleasure. Remember, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be right in to give you those instructions. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Have a good day.
