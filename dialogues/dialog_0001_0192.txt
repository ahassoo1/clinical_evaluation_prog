DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness, good to see… well, see you. Let's get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, the army, see? They want me to take this… exam. Before they let me actually be in the army. Gotta make sure I’m fit enough, I guess. Seems silly, but rules are rules. They sent me here. You gotta fill something out, yeah?
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-enlistment physical. Look, I've got a waiting room full of actual patients, so let’s try to be concise. No need to rehash the whole story of how you ended up joining the army, just tell me what, if anything, is bothering you. Any pain, any issues… anything at all?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Not really. I mean, I work with engines all day. Hands get a bit banged up, sometimes. Back gets a little stiff. That’s just… work. I’m a strong guy, though. Always have been. Never been sick much, either. I don’t feel bothered. Why would I be here if I was bothered? It's just a form, right? Like a check-up before they let me blow things up legally.
DOCTOR: Right. "Blow things up legally." Lovely. Look, even strong guys get things wrong with their bodies. It's my job to make sure you don’t have anything serious going on before you… engage in that activity. Let’s start with a quick review of systems. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Not that I recall. Night sweats… my wife likes the heat. We keep the bedroom warm. So, yeah, I sweat at night. Is that what you mean? Look, I'm a practical man, Doctor. I don't spend time worrying about… damp sheets. Are we getting closer to the form? It's August, it's hot. Everyone sweats.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let’s try this a different way. Any problems with your heart?
PATIENT: Heart? No. Beats fine. Always has. I lift heavy things all day. If my heart was bad, I'd know. It hasn't stopped me yet. Strong as an ox, I tell ya. Look, I don’t fall over when I bend over. Does that answer your question? Are you trying to find something wrong with me? Seems a bit… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Any trouble breathing, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. I yell at the guys at work sometimes when they mess something up. Plenty of air gets used then. I can hold my breath pretty good, too. Underwater welding, you know? Not often, but I can. So no, no trouble breathing. I'm a grown man, Doctor. I breathe. Seems a pretty basic function. What’s this all for, exactly? Is there a problem?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Hartness, I'm asking you these questions to rule things out. It's standard procedure. Do you have any stomach problems?
PATIENT: Stomach? No. I eat. Like a horse. Big meals. Sometimes it gets a bit… rumbly, after a big meal. But that’s just… food. Never had any serious trouble. Maybe a bit of heartburn sometimes, spicy food, you know? But nothing I can't handle. I need a strong stomach for the work I do. Always on the go. Is this about the food? Because I eat plenty. And I'm a healthy weight, if you look. I’m lean muscle, not… fat.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just skip ahead. Any problems with your kidneys or bladder?
PATIENT: Kidneys? Bladder? What are you… Look, I pee when I gotta pee. I drink plenty of water, keeps everything moving. Never had any issues. Never had to rush or anything. I don't sit around worrying about my kidneys! Honestly, Doctor, this is… insulting. You're asking me questions about things every man does. Are we getting anywhere with this form, or are we just going to talk about… plumbing all day?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Then we can maybe get to this form. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Examination table? Look, I'm a bit of a bigger guy, you know? Not sure that thing will hold me. And I’m wearing good work boots. They're broken in. Can’t just take those off. Seems… inefficient. Is there a chair? A sturdy one? I don’t like heights. Just… a thought. Can we just skip the listening and poking? I feel fine. I am fine.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, this is a medical examination. I need to examine you. I understand your boots are comfortable, but you’ll need to remove them. And the examination table is designed to support your weight. If you are uncomfortable, we can adjust positioning. But I cannot accurately assess your health without a proper examination. Please, just take off your boots and sit down. It will be much quicker that way.
PATIENT: Look, I don't like being told what to do. I've been working with my hands my whole life, I know my body. But fine. Fine. But if that table breaks, you're buying me a new pair of boots. Good ones. Seems a bit… unnecessary, all this fuss. But alright. Here. Happy now? Get on with it. And be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, please. Heart rate is a little elevated… 92 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but a bit distant. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Blood pressure is 145/90. A bit high. And your weight is 53 kilograms. That's… quite low for your height of 187 centimeters. Are you sure you've been eating adequately?
PATIENT: Adequately? Of course I have! What do you think I am, wasting away? I work hard, see? Burns calories. Maybe I don't sit around counting sheep all day like some folks. 53 kilograms… well, I don’t know what that is, but it sounds… small. But I’m strong. I feel strong. And I eat plenty. You're making me feel like some kind of… weakling. What’s this all mean? Are you saying I'm not fit enough for the army? Because that's ridiculous. I told you, I'm a practical man. I’m built for work. Not… numbers.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Hartness, I'm not saying you're not strong. But your weight is significantly below what is considered healthy for your height. And your blood pressure is elevated. These are things we need to investigate further. I recommend a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an EKG to assess your overall health. And frankly, given your weight and blood pressure, I’m going to recommend you consult with a primary care physician for ongoing management. It's not about whether you're "fit enough for the army" right now, it’s about your health. I can fill out the basic pre-enlistment form, but I need you to understand that I cannot sign off on your health without further investigation. Do you have a primary care doctor?
PATIENT: Primary care doctor? No. Never needed one. I fix things. I am the primary care. For my hands, mostly. And engines. Look, this is getting ridiculous. I came here for a form, not a whole medical investigation. All this poking and prodding, the numbers, the doctors… It's a waste of time and money. What's the army gonna do, send me home because my blood pressure is a little high? I’m a practical man. I can handle it. I don't need a doctor telling me what's wrong with me. Just fill out the form. Say I'm healthy. It's a simple thing. It’s just paperwork, right? Just do it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but I cannot ethically sign off on a pre-enlistment physical without addressing these concerns. Your health is paramount. A false positive on this form could have serious consequences, both for you and the army. Look, I can complete the form with the following notations: "Elevated blood pressure, requires further evaluation." And "Low weight, requires nutritional assessment." But I will not sign off stating you are in perfect health. I strongly advise you to see a primary care physician for a complete check-up. I'll give you a referral list. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Referral list? Look, this is getting absurd. You're making a big deal out of nothing. It’s just a form. Fine. Write whatever you want. “Elevated blood pressure,” “low weight.” Whatever. Just… get it over with. I’ve got things to do. I need to get back to work. I don’t have time for doctors and lists and… whatever this is. Waste of a perfectly good afternoon. Just fill it out. And hurry. Just… get it done. I'll take the list. Maybe. But don’t expect me to call anyone. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Here you go. I’ve included the referral list as you requested. I strongly encourage you to schedule an appointment with a primary care physician as soon as possible. I understand you're busy, but your health is important. Please, take care of yourself. And frankly, I'm not comfortable signing off on this form without you acknowledging that you understand the risks of proceeding without further medical evaluation. You'll need to sign this. .
