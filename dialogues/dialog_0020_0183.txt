DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Beinborn, you say? Fine. I am here because… well, I am tired. Always tired. It is not a good feeling, you know? Like the sun is very heavy. And the liver… the other doctor, he said something about the liver. But I don't remember exactly what he said. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, always tired… feeling like the sun is heavy, that’s a good way to describe it. And something about the liver from a previous doctor. I understand it can be hard to remember details, especially when it’s been some time. Let's try to piece things together. When did you first start noticing this persistent tiredness?
PATIENT: Persistent… you use big words. Just tired, okay? I think… maybe six months ago? It started slowly. I used to work all day, no problem. Now, I need to sit down after a little bit. Even walking to the market is too much sometimes. My wife, she does most of the shopping now. She says I look… pale. I don’t know about pale.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, starting slowly… and now it's affecting your daily activities, like walking to the market. Your wife has noticed you looking pale. Okay. Has anything changed in the six months, besides the tiredness?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm. Let me think. The weather is hotter, maybe? No… that is always the case this time of year. I eat the same food, mostly. Injera, like always. And… oh! The doctor, the first doctor, he gave me some pills. Yellow pills. But they didn’t do anything. I stopped taking them. Waste of money, really.
DOCTOR: Yellow pills…do you remember what the doctor told you those were for?
PATIENT: No, I do not. He spoke quickly, and his English… not so good. Something about… the body? And needing help. He just said to take the pills. I did for a week, maybe two. No change. So I stopped. My wife said I shouldn't waste my money on things that don't work. She is a practical woman.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s frustrating when medications don’t seem to help, and even more so when you can't recall the specifics. Let me see if I can pull up any records from your previous doctor… Okay, it looks like you saw Dr. Alemayehu six months ago. He did note fatigue and some mild jaundice. He prescribed ferrous sulfate for possible iron deficiency anemia. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Ferrous… what now? Iron… is that like the metal? I don’t know anything about metal. I just know I am tired. And… well, sometimes my stomach feels… off. Not sick, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And I don’t have much appetite. Not like before. My wife makes good food, but I don’t want to eat much of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some discomfort in the stomach and a decreased appetite alongside the tiredness. We'll investigate the cause of this. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or urine color?
PATIENT: Bowel… you ask a lot of… private questions. I will answer, but it is not polite. They are… darker, maybe? Not normal color. And the water… when I go to the bathroom, the water is… brown sometimes. Like tea. It worries my wife.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Grumman. It’s important information. Darker bowel movements and brownish urine can certainly be concerning. I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? Will you poke me with needles? I don't like needles. I already had enough trouble with the pills that didn't do anything. Just looking at me is fine, maybe. But no poking.
DOCTOR: No poking, I promise. Just a basic exam – listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, checking your skin color. No needles today. It will help me get a better picture of what's going on. We'll start with your abdomen, if that’s okay. I’ll just gently press on different areas to see if anything feels tender. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But be gentle. My stomach… sensitive. And don't take too long. I have things to do. Not many, but still. I need to sit in the sun sometimes. It helps with the tiredness, a little bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, just gentle pressure. Let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Okay. A little bit tender here, on your right side, under your ribs. Do you feel any pain radiating to your back or shoulder?
PATIENT: Yes! There. It is… achy. Not sharp, but achy. And sometimes… yes, a little bit in my back. Right here, between my shoulder blades. Like someone is pressing on me. Not all the time, just… sometimes. When I move too much, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay. And I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds clear. Your heart rate is a bit slow, but that isn’t necessarily concerning. I also notice a little bit of yellowing in the whites of your eyes. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, I am concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a problem with your liver or gallbladder. The fatigue, abdominal tenderness, changes in bowel movements and urine color, and the yellowing of your eyes all point to that. We'll need to do some blood tests to get a better understanding. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More poking? I don’t like this. Liver… gallbladder… what are those even doing? My wife always says I worry too much about these things. Maybe I should just go home and sit in the sun.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Grumman. The blood tests will give us a lot of information. They aren’t necessarily going to tell us exactly what’s wrong, but they’ll help us rule things out. The liver and gallbladder are important organs that help with digestion and filtering toxins from your body. The blood tests will check your liver function, look for signs of infection, and rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. It’s a quick procedure, and we’ll get the results back relatively quickly. We will need to draw a small amount of blood from your arm. Are you willing to proceed with the blood tests?
PATIENT: Fine. But quick, you said. Very quick. And not too deep. My veins… they are not easy to find. The last nurse, she poked me three times. It was very unpleasant. And tell me the results quickly, okay? I don’t want to worry about this for a long time.
DOCTOR: I will make a note of that, Mr. Grumman. We will take extra care to make it as quick and painless as possible. I'll personally ensure the phlebotomist is aware of your concerns. I will review the results as soon as they are available and call you with the findings. It usually takes 24-48 hours. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend avoiding alcohol and fatty foods. They can put extra stress on your liver. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Alcohol? I have a little beer sometimes with dinner. Not much. Is that bad? And fatty foods… my wife makes good food. I don’t want to tell her she can’t make her good food. She would be upset. This is complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. A small amount of beer is likely not a major issue, but it’s best to avoid it temporarily until we have the results of the blood tests. And I’m not suggesting your wife change her cooking entirely – just to reduce fatty foods for a short time. We can discuss specific options with her if you'd like. The goal is to gather information and find out what’s causing your symptoms, not to make drastic changes to your life. I’m also going to write a referral for an ultrasound of your liver and gallbladder. This will give us a clearer picture of their condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ultrasound… more machines? More poking around? This is too much. I just want to feel better. My wife, she will be very angry if I keep going to doctors and having tests. She says I worry too much. Maybe I should just rest. And sit in the sun. The sun always helps.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Grumman. You’re right to be concerned about unnecessary tests, and I want to assure you I’m only recommending these to get a clear understanding of what’s going on so we can find a way to help you feel better. The ultrasound is non-invasive, it doesn't involve any needles or poking. It uses sound waves to create an image of your liver and gallbladder. Think of it as another piece of the puzzle. We’ll combine the results of the blood tests and the ultrasound to make the best decision about your care. Would you like me to explain the ultrasound procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Explain it. But make it quick. And don’t tell me about all the scary things that could happen. Just tell me what will happen. And I still think I should just rest and sit in the sun.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The ultrasound technician will apply a gel to your abdomen, and then move a handheld device called a transducer over the gel. The transducer sends sound waves into your body, which bounce off your liver and gallbladder, creating an image on a screen. It doesn’t hurt at all. You'll lie on a table, and the technician will move the transducer around. It will take about 20-30 minutes. You don't need to do anything special beforehand. It's a very safe procedure, and we'll get the results within a few days. If you're still feeling unwell after the tests, we can discuss other options. But let’s get these tests done first, so we have a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. 20-30 minutes, you said. No poking. Okay. But if I feel worse afterwards, I’m not coming back. I'm telling you that now. My wife will be very angry. And I need to sit in the sun. You understand? Sun is important.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mr. Grumman. 20-30 minutes, no poking. And I’ll make a note of your concerns. We will carefully review the results and discuss the best course of action. We will take it one step at a time. And yes, I understand the importance of the sun! I'll have the receptionist schedule the ultrasound for you. They will likely be able to find an appointment within the next few days. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, yellowing of your skin or eyes, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s enough for today. Just schedule the test. And don’t make it too late in the afternoon. I like to sit in the sun before dinner. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Grumman. I’ll make sure they schedule it for earlier in the day. I will also provide you with written instructions outlining the procedure and what to expect. I hope you feel better soon. Remember, we are here to help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and enjoy the sun.
PATIENT: .
