DOCTOR: Hello, Keoni. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It's a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been having to go to the bathroom… rather frequently. It’s become quite bothersome lately, and I thought it best to get it checked out. I don’t… entirely recall when it started, truthfully. It feels like it’s been gradually worsening over the past few weeks, perhaps a month?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. When you say "frequently," about how often are you needing to go to the bathroom during the day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It feels like… every couple of hours, at least. Perhaps more often if I’m drinking a lot of water? I wouldn’t say constantly, but it’s definitely more than I used to. I find myself… anticipating it, if that makes sense. I don’t know if that’s helpful. It's just… a persistent feeling.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Keoni. Anticipating it suggests it’s becoming quite noticeable for you, and that’s important information. And the increased frequency with more fluids is also good to know. Now, when you go to the bathroom, do you feel like you're fully emptying your bladder, or do you feel like you still have to go afterwards?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit of a tricky one. Most of the time, I feel like I do, yes. But sometimes… sometimes it feels like there’s a little bit left. Not a significant amount, but enough that I wonder if I should try again. I don’t usually do that, though. I’ve always been… hesitant to bother. Is that making sense? It’s hard to explain the sensation.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Keoni. You're describing a feeling of incomplete emptying, and that’s definitely something we need to explore. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain or burning at all. It’s not… uncomfortable, exactly. Just… inconvenient. And a little worrying, to be honest. It’s just the constant need to go, and the feeling that I might not be emptying completely. I haven’t noticed any blood either, if that’s something you were going to ask.
DOCTOR: Good, no pain or blood is good. Let’s talk a little bit about other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain alongside this frequent urination?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, no. And… lower abdominal pain… hmm. Occasionally, a little bit of discomfort, but nothing I would call pain. It’s more of a… pressure, perhaps? And it’s not constant. It comes and goes. It doesn’t really disrupt anything, if that makes sense. It’s just… there sometimes. I’m not entirely sure if it’s related, or just… something else.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent lower abdominal pressure. That's helpful. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, urinary tract infections, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I was divorced quite a while ago, and my ex-husband handled most of the medical paperwork. I think I’ve been healthy for the most part. I don’t recall ever being diagnosed with anything serious. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing chronic. I might have had a urinary tract infection once, years ago, but I honestly don’t remember the details. I’m sorry I can’t be more precise. It feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Keoni. It's common to not remember details from the past. And it's good you're being honest about what you recall. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries or hospital stays. I’ve always been quite lucky, health-wise. Until recently, that is. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat and drink, and I try to stay active, even if it’s just a walk in the park. I suppose that’s why this is so… concerning. It’s a new sensation, and I’m not sure what to make of it. I don’t want it to become something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family—like diabetes, kidney disease, or bladder problems?
PATIENT: That’s another tricky one. My mother passed away several years ago, and I don’t recall her having any specific medical conditions. My father is still alive, but we aren’t very close, and I haven’t spoken to him in years. I know he had… high blood pressure, perhaps? But I’m not certain. And I don’t recall any family members having problems with their kidneys or bladder. I’m truly sorry I can’t offer you more information. It feels like I’m drawing a blank. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Keoni. We'll work with what we have. And it’s honest, which is the most important thing. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been very anti-smoking. I find it quite repulsive, to be honest. I've always preferred fresh air and healthy living. I’ve always been quite diligent about taking care of myself. I hope it isn’t too late to prevent something from becoming serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps once or twice a week. Nothing excessive, certainly. Just a small glass to relax. I wouldn't say I drink heavily, or even regularly. It's more of a… social thing, if that makes sense. I prefer a good meal and conversation to a night of heavy drinking. It's not something I often indulge in, to be honest. I'm not much of a drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional light alcohol use. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking any medications at all. I try to avoid them whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, if something is bothering me. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. I don't have any ongoing medical issues that require prescription medication. I really prefer to stay away from those if I can. I am quite health-conscious, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Keoni. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a brief pelvic exam to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. This will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam… Yes, I suppose so. If it’s necessary, then yes. I… I haven’t had one in quite some time. Just please… be gentle? And explain everything as you go, if you don’t mind. I'm just a little… nervous. Is there anything I should do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Of course, Keoni. I understand your nervousness, and I will absolutely be gentle and explain everything as I go. You don’t need to do anything specific to prepare. We’ll start by having you lie on your back on the examination table, and I’ll drape you appropriately to ensure your privacy. I'll listen to your abdomen first, and then we'll proceed with the pelvic exam if you're comfortable. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know, and we can stop or adjust as needed. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds alright. Listening to my abdomen first is… reassuring. Please, just take your time. And explain everything, as you said. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Alright, Keoni, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen now. Take some nice, deep breaths for me. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t hear any unusual sounds. That’s a good sign. Now, I’m going to explain the next part of the exam. I’ll be using a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix. It may feel a little bit of pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. We’ll also be checking your external genitalia for any signs of irritation or abnormalities. Again, please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. Just… take it slow, please. And explain everything as you go, like you said. I’m a little apprehensive, but I trust you. Go ahead when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Keoni, I’m gently inserting the speculum now. You might feel some pressure. I’m visualizing your cervix, and it appears normal. No signs of inflammation or lesions. Your vaginal walls also look healthy. Now, I’m just going to do a quick external exam, checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. Everything appears normal externally as well. No signs of irritation or masses. Okay, all done. I’m gently removing the speculum now. That wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: No… it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. A little uncomfortable, perhaps, but not painful. Thank you for explaining everything. It’s good to know everything appears normal. What do you think it could be, then? If everything looks alright… Why am I still experiencing this frequent urination?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Keoni. And you’re very welcome. Based on the physical exam, there's no obvious sign of infection or other immediate concern. Frequent urination with a normal exam can sometimes be caused by a few things. It could be something as simple as overactive bladder – where the bladder muscles contract involuntarily, causing you to feel the urge to urinate more often. Another possibility is interstitial cystitis, which causes bladder pressure, bladder pain and sometimes pain in your pelvis. However, those are diagnoses that require further investigation to confirm. Given your symptoms and the normal exam, I'd like to order a urine analysis and a urine culture to rule out any underlying infection that might not be immediately apparent. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Overactive bladder… interstitial cystitis… Yes, that sounds sensible. A urine analysis and culture… If that will help determine the cause, then yes, please. Whatever it takes to get this sorted out. It’s just… rather disruptive, and I’d like to know what’s causing it. How long will it take to get the results? And is there anything I can do in the meantime to alleviate the symptoms? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Okay, Keoni. I'll have the lab draw a urine sample now. It usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the results back. In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to manage your symptoms. First, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate the bladder. Also, try to space out your fluid intake throughout the day, rather than drinking large amounts at once. Finally, and this might sound counterintuitive, but pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, can help strengthen your bladder muscles and improve bladder control. I can provide you with a handout that explains how to do them properly. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A handout on the exercises would be wonderful. And I will certainly avoid caffeine and alcohol. Spacing out my fluids is something I can manage as well. It’s… reassuring to know there are things I can do in the meantime. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any warning signs I should look out for that would warrant a more immediate visit? I don't want it to escalate into something serious.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Keoni. Yes, there are a few things. If you develop a fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain, that could indicate an infection and you should contact us immediately. Also, if you notice any blood in your urine, or if you experience a sudden, significant change in your urinary habits, please let us know right away. Otherwise, we’ll await the results of the urine analysis and culture. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today to discuss the results and develop a more tailored treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results. And I will certainly be mindful of those warning signs. Thank you, Doctor Lahn. You've been very helpful, and I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I feel much better knowing we have a plan in place. I’ll see you next week then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Keoni. I’m glad I could help. Just remember to drink plenty of water, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and try those pelvic floor exercises. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your urine sample and schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
