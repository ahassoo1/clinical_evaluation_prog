DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I’m Dr. Hembrey. Welcome to the practice. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s something about a certification, isn't it? A yearly thing, I believe. My…ex-wife kept meticulous records, you see. I’m rather vague on the specifics. Something to do with keeping my…abilities up to standard. It’s all rather bureaucratic, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: A certification, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. For…work. Healthcare, you know. Though frankly, after all these years, one tends to know what one is doing without needing pieces of paper to say so. It’s simply a requirement. A bothersome one, really. Is this going to take long? I have…commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Let’s see…Mr. Venard Oriley. I do see a record of several recertification courses completed in the past, most recently…five years ago?
PATIENT: Five years…is it? Goodness. Time does fly when one is…competent. I suppose my ex-wife was correct, then. She was always…particular about these things. I do recall some testing, yes. Though, honestly, the details are lost to me. Was there a form I need to fill out? Perhaps that would jog my memory. Though, I doubt it. It was all rather tedious, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, simply having completed courses in the past isn’t sufficient for current recertification. Regulations have changed. We need to ascertain your current competency, not rely on records from five years ago. It’s a standard procedure to ensure you're up-to-date on best practices and protocols. To begin, could you describe your current role in healthcare?
PATIENT: Protocols? Best practices? Honestly, Doctor, it’s all rather…fluid. One adapts. One uses one’s judgment. I…well, I assess. I evaluate. That’s what I do. I’ve been doing it for decades. Specifics escape me, of course. It's not as if I keep a detailed log of every patient. That would be…unseemly, wouldn’t it? It’s more of a…holistic approach. Do you understand? It's about seeing the whole picture, not ticking boxes on a form. And, truthfully, I find this line of questioning…patronizing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I assure you, I have no intention of being patronizing. However, as your physician, I am obligated to conduct a thorough assessment to ensure you are practicing safely and within the established standards of care. It’s not simply about “ticking boxes,” as you put it; it's about protecting your patients, and frankly, protecting you from potential liability. Now, let’s try this another way. What types of cases do you typically assess?
PATIENT: Typical…cases. Hmm. That’s…difficult to say. A wide variety, I suppose. Geriatric mostly. People…declining. Assessing…capacity. That sort of thing. And…some neurological issues. Determining…the extent of damage, shall we say? But it’s all quite…varied. I don’t specialize, you see. I’m a general…evaluator. Does that clarify things? Though I must reiterate, I find this entire process…unnecessary. I assure you, my judgment remains impeccable. It hasn't diminished with age. Quite the contrary, actually.
DOCTOR: So, you conduct assessments primarily for geriatric patients, focusing on capacity and neurological conditions. Do these assessments take place in a hospital, a clinic, or… privately?
PATIENT: Privately, mostly. Though occasionally I’m called upon for…consultations. Private residences, assisted living facilities… that sort of thing. It’s…discreet. That’s what they pay for, you see. Discretion and…a certain level of experience. Hospitals are…chaotic. Too much bureaucracy. And frankly, the paperwork is appalling. I prefer to maintain a…smaller, more manageable caseload. It allows me to focus on the individual, rather than the…system. Does that explain things adequately, Doctor? I'm beginning to feel rather… scrutinized.
DOCTOR: Private assessments… and consultations. Very well. And do you work alone, or do you have a team assisting you?
PATIENT: Alone. Entirely alone. I prefer it that way. Less…complication. Assistants tend to…misinterpret things. They lack the…nuance required for these sorts of evaluations. It’s a delicate process, you see. Requiring years of experience and…a keen eye. And frankly, I find others…distracting. It’s best to rely on one’s own judgment. I assure you, I’m perfectly capable of handling everything myself. It’s a solitary profession, by necessity. I rather pride myself on my independence. Is this…satisfactory, Doctor? I fail to see the relevance of these questions. It's rather invasive, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, your insistence on working entirely alone, conducting private assessments without any oversight, and your… reluctance to provide specific details about your practice is… concerning. The standard of care requires accountability and peer review. It’s not simply about your experience, it’s about ensuring patient safety. I’m going to need more information, and frankly, I may need to recommend a more comprehensive evaluation by a board to verify your current competency. Without that, I cannot in good conscience certify you.
PATIENT: A board? Good heavens. Are you suggesting I’m…incompetent? After decades of experience? This is preposterous. I assure you, my judgment is sound, my evaluations are thorough, and my patients are…well, they are satisfied. They wouldn't continue to seek my services if they weren't. Frankly, I find your skepticism insulting. And this…threat of a ‘comprehensive evaluation’ is entirely unnecessary. I came here for a simple certification, not a…witch hunt. I've wasted enough of my time on this charade. I think I'll seek another physician. One who respects my experience and doesn’t question my competence. Goodbye, Doctor. I wish you well.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Oriley. As you wish. However, please be aware that practicing without a valid certification may have legal ramifications. I strongly advise you to reconsider your decision and seek proper validation of your skills. I’m documenting my concerns regarding your refusal to cooperate with a standard assessment. Have a good day. .
