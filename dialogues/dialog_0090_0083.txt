DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's… a little thing. Not a serious thing, you understand. I just… I thought a card would be nice. A “Get Well” card, or something. From a doctor. It’s for… morale. You know? My ex-wife, she always liked when I got cards. Makes a man feel… important.
DOCTOR: A card… from a doctor. I see. While I appreciate you valuing my time, Mr. Kammer, this clinic is for medical care. Are you experiencing any actual health concerns that I should be addressing?
PATIENT: Well, no, not exactly. I’m feeling… fine. Just a bit low, you see? A man gets lonely. And a card… it would just… lift my spirits. It’s a small thing to ask, isn’t it? I mean, you write prescriptions all day, what’s one more little thing? Don’t mean to be trouble, Doctor, but it’s important. More important than some aches and pains, maybe.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, my role is to provide medical assistance. I am trained to diagnose and treat illnesses, not to… fulfill social requests. I understand you’re feeling down, but a card isn’t a clinical intervention. Perhaps a therapist or counselor would be more helpful in addressing your emotional state?
PATIENT: A therapist? Doctor, are you serious? A grown man, needing a… a therapist? No, no, that’s… that’s not it at all. I just thought, as a professional, a little kindness… a little note… It’s good for business, you know? A happy patient tells his friends. And a card shows you care. It’s just… good manners. I always sent my ex-wife flowers.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I assure you, my practice is quite successful. And I maintain professional boundaries with all my patients. Repeatedly, you are requesting a service that is not within my scope of practice, and frankly, it’s beginning to feel… inappropriate. Now, if you do not have any legitimate medical concerns, I’m afraid I have other patients waiting. Are you sure there isn’t anything I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Well, now you’re being… rude. Inappropriate? I just want a card! I don’t understand why this is so difficult. It's a piece of paper, Doctor! A simple "Get Well Soon" with a signature. I always thought doctors were supposed to be… comforting. This is just… cold. I mean, I'm a patient, aren’t I? Don't patients deserve a little kindness?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, my role is to provide evidence-based medical care, not emotional support in the form of greeting cards. Your persistent request is not only outside the scope of my practice but is also taking up valuable time that could be used for patients with actual health needs. I am not going to provide you with a card. Now, I will ask you one last time: are you experiencing any physical symptoms or health concerns that require medical attention?
PATIENT: No. No, I guess not. Just… lonely. And a little forgotten, maybe. It’s… never mind. I shouldn’t bother you. You’re a busy woman. It was a silly request, I suppose. A silly, old man’s request.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you are feeling persistently lonely or depressed, I would suggest contacting a mental health professional. Here is a list of resources in the area. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. I… I understand. I won’t take up any more of your time.
DOCTOR: Then, have a good day, Mr. Kammer.
