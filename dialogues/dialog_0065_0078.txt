DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s a little hard to explain… I feel like I need a… a reset, perhaps? Or a jumpstart. I just don't feel right. I’m not sick, exactly, but not well either. Just…off.
DOCTOR: “A reset,” you say. That’s…vague. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand it’s not very precise, Doctor. It’s difficult to put into words. Let me see… I have less energy than I used to, even though I’m sleeping alright. And I feel… disconnected, almost. Like I’m going through the motions. It's been going on for a few months now, slowly getting worse. I'm still able to do my work, shaping the ceramics, but it takes more effort. And honestly, I just don’t enjoy it as much. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: So, fatigue and a lack of motivation. Many things can cause that, Ms. Pitzel. Before we jump to conclusions, let's go through a standard review. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My appetite has been a little…smaller, I suppose. Not a huge change, but I don't feel as hungry as I used to. And I think I have lost a little weight, though I haven’t weighed myself recently. Perhaps five or ten pounds? It’s hard to say for sure. I've been so focused on getting my work done, I haven't been keeping track of such things.
DOCTOR: And any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… well, no, not really. Everything is… regular, if you understand what I mean, Doctor. No problems there. Honestly, that's one thing that hasn't changed.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any difficulty sleeping despite feeling alright when you do sleep?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. No, not really. I fall asleep okay, and I sleep through the night most nights. It's not that the sleep is bad, it’s just… not restorative, perhaps? I wake up feeling tired, even after what I would consider a full night’s rest. It’s… hard to explain. It's not insomnia, it's more like… ineffective sleep?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on to other symptoms. Any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those. No fever, no chills, no night sweats. And as I said before, the weight loss is probably not unexplained, just… less appetite. I haven’t been feeling ill, just… depleted. It’s more a lack of energy and motivation than anything physical, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your mood?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. That's something I haven’t mentioned yet. I… I haven’t been feeling as happy as I used to. Not terribly sad, exactly, but… less joy in things. I find myself… withdrawing a little, I suppose. Spending more time alone. It's not depression, I don't think, but… a general feeling of… flatness.
DOCTOR: Do you have any family history of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, my aunt, my mother’s sister, struggled with depression for many years. She received treatment, and it helped, but it was a difficult time for the whole family. My mother also… she had periods of sadness, though she never sought formal treatment. She just… coped. I’m not sure if that’s relevant, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am quite healthy, thankfully. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, no heart disease. I do have some arthritis in my hands, from the shaping of the ceramics, but it’s well-managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. Other than that, I've been very fortunate. I have Medicare, and I go for my regular check-ups.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the over-the-counter pain relievers for the arthritis, Doctor. Ibuprofen, as needed. I don't take anything else regularly. And I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. I don’t drink much alcohol, and I don’t smoke.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Pitzel, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of…well, a number of things. It could be a vitamin deficiency, a hormonal imbalance, or simply stress and fatigue. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, B12 levels, and a complete blood count. Also, let’s do a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Yes, please. I'm happy to have the blood work done. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the requisition for the blood work. You can have it done at the lab across the street. They take Medicare, so there shouldn't be any issues. I also want to rule out any psychological component, although you do not seem to be exhibiting clear symptoms of depression. I recommend a brief screening questionnaire. The nurse will administer it before you leave. It’s just a formality. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No, no objections at all, Doctor. If you think it’s helpful, I’m happy to fill it out. I understand you want to cover all the bases. Thank you for being so thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Hopefully, the blood work will give us some answers.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to administer the questionnaire and answer any questions you may have. We'll contact you with the results of the blood work within a few days. If your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before I excuse myself?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've covered everything very well. Thank you again for your time and attention. I’ll go and see the nurse now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Ms. Pitzel.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
