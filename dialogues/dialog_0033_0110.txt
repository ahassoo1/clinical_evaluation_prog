DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's very nice to meet you. Well, to put it plainly, I feel like I need a little... jumpstart, you could say. I’m not sick sick, but things just aren’t… peppy, anymore. I’m getting on in years, you know, and I’d like to feel a bit more like myself again. A reset, maybe? Is that what people say these days?
DOCTOR: A “jumpstart,” right. Well, we’ll see what we can do. “Peppy” is rather vague, I’m afraid. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Vague is a good word for it, I suppose. Let me see… I don’t have the energy I used to. Even simple things, like keeping up with the garden, or playing with my grandchildren, leave me quite tired. And I’ve been… forgetful lately. Not terribly so, mind you, but enough to be concerning. I used to be so sharp! It’s just… a general slowing down, I think. And perhaps a little bit of sadness mixed in, although I wouldn’t call it depression. Just… less zest for things. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Right. So, fatigue, some memory issues, and a decreased…enthusiasm. And you’re 87, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, 87 this past March. It feels strange to say it out loud sometimes! And yes, you’ve got it. Fatigue, a bit of forgetfulness, and…well, enthusiasm is a nice way to put it. Zest, maybe? I used to be quite the gardener, you know. Had the prettiest hibiscus on the whole block. Now… I mostly sit on the porch. Not that I mind sitting, mind you. But I’d like to be doing a bit more.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s go through some basics. Any past medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for quite some time now. And I had my gallbladder removed…oh, must be thirty years ago now? Other than that…nothing too serious, thankfully. I’ve always been a pretty healthy woman, all things considered. I did have a fall last winter, but thankfully didn’t break anything, just a few bruises. That’s about it, I believe.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, and a recent fall. Any surgeries other than the gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. No other surgeries, not that I recall. I had all my children the old-fashioned way, if you know what I mean! Nothing fancy, just natural births. I always believed in letting nature take its course, as long as it could. Is that the sort of thing you need to know? I do apologize if I'm rambling. Sometimes my thoughts just… wander.
DOCTOR: No, that's quite alright. Just trying to get a complete picture. Any significant family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a bit of a tricky one. My mother lived to be 95, very strong woman, but she had…well, she had some trouble with her memory towards the end. Not Alzheimer's, the doctor said, just…old age. My father… he had heart trouble. Passed away when I was quite young, actually. And my brother… he had diabetes, but he didn’t take very good care of himself, to be honest. Not a good example, that one. Does that help? It’s a long family tree, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mother with memory issues, father with heart problems, brother with diabetes. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Let me see… I take a small dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, like we discussed. And I take a calcium supplement, Doctor Ramirez recommended that a few years ago, for my bones. Oh, and sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, nothing strong. I believe that’s all. I have a list here somewhere… ah, here it is! It’s a bit messy, I apologize. My grandchildren helped me write it.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, calcium, ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I don't have any allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I’ve always been very lucky that way. I can eat anything, thankfully! My mother always said a good appetite was a sign of good health. Although, I do try to avoid shellfish these days. Not because of an allergy, just… it doesn't sit well with me anymore. Old age, I suppose. Everything changes, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. McNabb, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It'll be fairly straightforward. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look at your reflexes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I haven't had a proper check-up in a while, so it will be good to know everything is as it should be. Please, don't hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I may be old, but I still have feelings!
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McNabb. Now, if you'll just sit back and relax. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Just breathe normally… good. 148 over 72. Slightly elevated, but not alarming given your age and recent activity. Now, let's listen to your heart… Heart rate is regular, but there's a slight murmur. Not unusual in someone your age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear… Now, let's check your reflexes… A little diminished, as expected. Alright. Now, could you tell me if you've noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet lately?
PATIENT: Well, now, that’s a good question. I have noticed they’re a bit… puffy some days. Not terribly so, but definitely not as nimble as they used to be. Especially after I’ve been sitting for a while. I usually put my feet up on a stool, and that seems to help. I just figured it was part of getting older, you know? Circulation not being what it once was. Is that a concern, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Some edema in the ankles, worse with prolonged sitting. We'll need to investigate that further. Now, Ms. McNabb, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your memory and cognitive function. It's a standard part of the exam. It's nothing to worry about, just helps me get a more complete picture. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Today's date… Let me see… It’s August, isn’t it? August… the second? Yes, I believe it is August the second. 2025, of course. I think it's the second. It's so hard to keep track of these days! My grandchildren always tell me the date, but they aren’t here right now. I do apologize, I’m usually better with dates. Perhaps I'm just a little flustered.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. McNabb. It’s perfectly normal to have a little trouble recalling things sometimes. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Let me see… What were the three words, Doctor? I apologize, my hearing isn't what it used to be. Perhaps you could say them a little slower and a little louder?
DOCTOR: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Now, can you repeat those three words back to me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Apple… table… hmm. That’s… difficult. I know I heard them, but they’ve just slipped my mind. Apple… I remember something about fruit… table… something to do with eating… Oh dear. I’m so sorry, Doctor. It’s right on the tip of my tongue, but I just can't seem to recall them. Is that…bad? It’s never been this difficult before.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McNabb. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief examination, I think it's prudent to order some blood work and a urine analysis. It will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue, memory issues, and swelling. We also need to check your thyroid function. And I'm going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. It's better to be thorough. It doesn't necessarily mean there’s anything serious wrong, but it will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… extensive. A neurologist? Is that because you think something is seriously wrong, Doctor? I was hoping for a simple fix, you know? Some vitamins, perhaps? I do appreciate you being thorough, of course. I just… I worry about all these tests. I'm not a fan of doctors' offices, to be honest. But if you think it’s necessary… then I suppose I trust your judgment. Blood work and urine analysis I can manage, I suppose. And I’ll think about the neurologist. Is it a long wait to see one?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. McNabb. It’s better to rule things out. And no, it doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We just want to get a complete picture. As for the neurologist, there is a bit of a wait – approximately six weeks. I'll have my nurse schedule the appointment for you, and she can answer any questions you have about the process. In the meantime, I'll order the blood work and urine analysis today. The nurse will give you the necessary paperwork, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. I also recommend increasing your fluid intake and elevating your legs whenever possible. And try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Six weeks for the neurologist… that seems like a long time, but I understand. And I'll be sure to drink more water and put my feet up. Thank you, Doctor Dechene. I appreciate your kindness and patience. It's a little overwhelming, to be honest, but I feel better knowing we're taking steps to figure things out. I suppose I should go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. McNabb, you can go now. My nurse will be with you shortly to review the paperwork and schedule the lab appointments. If anything changes or you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
