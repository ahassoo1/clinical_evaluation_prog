DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. It’s… my nails. They just look wrong. I don't even know how to explain it good. They ain't like they used to be, ya know? It's been goin' on a while now.
DOCTOR: "A while now"... can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh… geez. Hmm. Maybe… six months? Or more? I don't keep track of dates too good. It just kinda… happened. They always been strong, but now they bend easy. And the color… it ain't right. Not shiny like they should be. I use polish sometimes, but it don't help.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, six months or longer of noticing changes in your nail strength and appearance. You said they bend easily and the color isn't right – can you describe the color change?
PATIENT: Color… lemme think. Not as pink, I guess. Kinda… dull? And there's little white spots. Not like big ones, just tiny. Like somebody flicked paint on 'em. It's hard to say, ya know? I ain't a nail person. I just want 'em to look normal again. I use a red polish, usually. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Red polish could contribute, though it's unlikely to be the sole cause. Dullness and small white spots… Have you noticed any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Skin? Nah… not really. Maybe a little dry sometimes, but I put lotion on. I got good lotion. It smells like coconuts. No swelling or nothin’ like that. Just… normal skin. I don't pay too much attention to my hands, to be honest. They’re just… hands.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this nail issue?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… sick? No, I feel fine. A little tired, maybe, but who ain’t tired? I don’t get sick much. Just…old, I guess. I don’t know what kinda symptoms you mean. Is it about my nails? 'Cause that's all I'm worried about.
DOCTOR: I’m asking if you’ve noticed any other changes in your body. Any joint pain, fatigue beyond your normal tiredness, shortness of breath, any rashes anywhere… anything at all that might be related. It’s important to get a full picture.
PATIENT: Joint pain? Ugh, yes. My knees. They creak somethin' awful when I stand up. And my back, sometimes. But that's just old age, right? I ain't runnin' marathons, if that's what you're thinkin'. Rashes… no. And I can breathe fine. I get outta breath climbin' stairs, but that's always been the case. This is a lot of questions just for my nails.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knee and back pain, chronic shortness of breath. Do these pains come and go, or are they constant?
PATIENT: They come and go. Knees are worse when it's cold, or if I been sittin' too long. Back just kinda… aches sometimes. It ain’t nothin’ terrible. I take ibuprofen when it bothers me. It's just… livin', ya know? I don't think it's got nothin' to do with my nails though. They just look sad.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, while I understand your concern is primarily with your nails, changes in nail appearance can be indicative of underlying medical conditions. I'm going to need to perform a physical exam, and I may order some blood work to rule out any systemic issues. We'll start with your nails, of course. May I examine your hands?
PATIENT: Ugh. Blood work? You mean like needles? I hate needles. Look, I just want somethin' for my nails. A stronger polish or somethin'. You're makin' a big deal outta nothin'. But… fine. If you have to. Just be quick, okay? And don't poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look. First, I'm noting some slight ridging, longitudinal striations here on several nails. The nail plates themselves appear somewhat thin and brittle. The nail beds aren't particularly pale, but there is a subtle discoloration, a yellowish tinge… and yes, the white spots you mentioned are present, scattered across multiple nails. No clubbing or spooning noted. Skin around the nail beds appears normal, no signs of inflammation. This isn't simply a cosmetic issue. I'm concerned about the possibility of a fungal infection, or even something more systemic, like anemia or a thyroid problem. I will need to order a complete blood count and a thyroid panel. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh. Allergies? Hmm. Let me think… I think I had a rash once from some lotion. But that was years ago. And… oh! I had a bad reaction to penicillin when I was a kid. Made me swell up real bad. But that was a long time ago. Is penicillin in those blood tests? I don't want nothin' with penicillin!
DOCTOR: No, penicillin won’t be in the blood work. We’re checking your red and white blood cell counts, iron levels, and thyroid function. The rash from the lotion is good to know, but not relevant here. I’m also going to order a fungal culture of your nails, just to rule out a simple infection. It involves taking a small scraping from under the nail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Scraping? Like…with a knife? No! I don't like the sound of that. Can’t you just give me somethin’ for the nails? A special polish? Or… a cream? I don’t want you diggin' at my nails! This is gettin' ridiculous. I just wanted pretty nails! .
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I understand your reluctance, but I am obligated to investigate potential underlying causes of your symptoms. Ignoring them could lead to more serious health problems. If you refuse both the blood work and the fungal culture, I cannot provide you with any treatment. I recommend you seek a second opinion. .
