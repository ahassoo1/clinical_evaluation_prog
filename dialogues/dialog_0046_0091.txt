DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Is good to meet you as well. Well, lately I does be feeling very thirsty, all the time. And hungry too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It not making sense, you know? I just want to find out what is going on with me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling excessively thirsty and hungry, even after eating, is certainly concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. That's a very reasonable concern. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this thirst?
PATIENT: Well, it just...always there. Like I need to drink water every few minutes. Even in the night I wake up to drink. And it not like the hot weather thirst, you know? This is different. It dry, dry, dry, even if I just have a big glass of water. I does try to sip on it all day, but it not really help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like it’s a persistent thirst, not related to activity or the weather, and doesn't seem to be relieved by drinking. And you mentioned waking up at night to drink?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Almost every night. Sometimes two, three times I have to get up. It disturbing my sleep, you know? My husband, he does get annoyed too, because I bumping around in the dark. It not a good thing. I used to sleep so soundly, now I always thinking about water.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand how disruptive that would be, both to your sleep and to your husband’s. Frequent nighttime awakenings to drink are definitely something we need to investigate. Besides the thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. I does feel a little tired, more so than usual. And I does go to the bathroom more often, to pee. Not like a burning feeling or anything, just...more trips. And maybe I losing a little weight, but I not sure. I haven't really been weighing myself regularly. My clothes feeling a little looser, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased thirst, increased hunger, fatigue, more frequent urination, and some unintentional weight loss. Those are all important things to note. Do you have any family history of diabetes or other medical conditions?
PATIENT: My mother, she had the sugar, yes. Diabetes, the doctor called it. She had to take pills for it, and she had problems with her feet later on. My father, he was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. But my auntie, she had high blood pressure. That's what I remember. I not sure about anything else, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk much about sicknesses.
DOCTOR: Thank you. A family history of diabetes is important to know. And high blood pressure as well. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your current medications, if any, and any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Well, I don't take any regular medication, Doctor. Just sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take a little paracetamol. And I not allergic to anything that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I does eat a lot of shellfish though, and I love mangoes. But I not allergic to those, I eat them all the time!
DOCTOR: Good to know. No regular medications and no known allergies. That simplifies things a bit. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. We'll just check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also want to do a simple blood test to check your blood sugar levels. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. My blood pressure is usually good, I think. My husband, he checks it sometimes, and it not too bad. But I happy to have it checked properly, and the blood test too. Anything to find out what is going on with me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s get started then. I’ll just have you hop up on the examination table. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/90. That’s a little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let's get some blood drawn for those sugar levels. I'll have the nurse come in to take care of that. Just a routine blood draw, nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I does get a little nervous with needles, but I try to be brave. I hope it not too much blood, you know? I not a fan of seeing blood. But I understand it need to be done to find out what is happening. Just please be quick, if you can?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Bianca. I understand your nervousness about needles – it’s very common. The nurse is very skilled and will be as quick and gentle as possible. It’s just a small sample, and we’ll try to make it as comfortable as we can. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all. While we’re waiting for the results, are there any other concerns or symptoms you’d like to mention?
PATIENT: Well...now that you ask, sometimes my vision does get a little blurry. Not all the time, but it happens. And my skin does feel dry, itchy sometimes. I put lotion on it, but it not really help much. I thought it was just the weather, you know, the sun and all. But maybe it something else? I not sure. It just little things, really. I not wanting to bother you with foolishness.
DOCTOR: Those aren’t foolish things at all, Bianca. Blurry vision and dry, itchy skin are important things to note, especially with the other symptoms you’ve been describing. It's good you mentioned them. They could be related. The nurse is sending the sample to the lab now. It should take about fifteen to twenty minutes to get the results back. While we wait, let's talk a little bit more about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I does try to eat healthy, you know? For breakfast, I usually have a bowl of oatmeal with a little bit of sugar and milk. And sometimes a piece of toast. For lunch, I like a plate of rice and peas with chicken or fish. And a little bit of salad. And for dinner, maybe some callaloo soup and dumplings. I does like sweet things, though. I have a little biscuit with my tea in the afternoon. And sometimes I have a piece of mango or banana for dessert. I not drinking a lot of sugary drinks, though, just water mostly. But I does like a little rum punch on a Saturday night! My husband, he makes a good punch.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a fairly balanced diet overall. The oatmeal, rice and peas, and callaloo soup are all good sources of nutrients. The biscuits and occasional rum punch are fine in moderation. Okay, the lab results are back. Your blood sugar level is 210 mg/dL. Your HbA1c is 7.8%. These results are significantly elevated. Based on these results, it appears you have type 2 diabetes. This explains the excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, weight loss, and blurry vision. It’s important not to panic; diabetes is a manageable condition, and with proper treatment, you can live a healthy life.
PATIENT: Oh, Lord. Diabetes? My mother had that... But I thought I was alright. I feeling so weak already. What does this mean, Doctor? What am I supposed to do? I never thought this would happen to me. Will I have to take pills like my mother? Will I lose my feet too? Oh, this is terrible, terrible.
DOCTOR: I understand this is a lot to take in, Bianca. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed and scared. It's good you're sharing your feelings, and I'm here to guide you through this. First, let's address your concerns. Yes, your mother had diabetes, and that does increase your risk. However, diabetes is not a death sentence, and advancements in treatment mean you can live a full and healthy life. Regarding medication, we'll start with lifestyle changes first – diet and exercise. We'll work with a registered dietitian to create a meal plan that helps regulate your blood sugar levels. We’ll also discuss incorporating regular exercise into your routine. We can monitor your progress with blood sugar checks and see if medication is necessary. If it is, there are many options available. Regarding losing your feet, that's a complication that can occur if diabetes is poorly managed, but with proper foot care and regular check-ups, we can significantly reduce that risk. We’ll refer you to a podiatrist for foot care education. For now, let’s focus on getting your blood sugar under control. I’m going to write you a referral to a dietitian and a podiatrist. I’ll also give you some information about diabetes and resources for support. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review your progress and discuss a more detailed treatment plan. Do you have any immediate questions?
PATIENT: Okay…okay. A dietitian…and a podiatrist. I can try. I really can try. My husband, he will help me with the cooking, I know. He always looking after me. And I does like to walk, sometimes. Not so much lately, but I can start again. Will I have to give up my rum punch completely? Just asking… It just… nice on a Saturday night. And the mangoes… I love my mangoes. Is there anything… anything I can do right away? Besides making appointments? Something to just… help a little bit?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Bianca. And it's important to find a balance that works for you. You don't necessarily have to give up your rum punch and mangoes completely, but we’ll need to moderate your intake. Small portions and infrequent enjoyment are key. We’ll discuss this in more detail with the dietitian. As for things you can do right away, several small changes can make a difference. Drink plenty of water: Staying hydrated helps regulate blood sugar levels. Eat smaller, more frequent meals: This prevents blood sugar spikes. Increase your fiber intake: Fiber slows down sugar absorption. Start walking for 30 minutes most days of the week: Even a gentle walk is beneficial. I'm going to give you a handout with a list of diabetes-friendly foods and a sample meal plan to get you started. And most importantly, try not to stress too much. Managing diabetes is a journey, and we’ll work through it together. I'm also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, so we can discuss this further and create a more tailored treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. Two weeks… I can do two weeks. I will try my best. And thank you… thank you for not scolding me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I was so scared at first, but I feeling a little bit better now. I will read this carefully, and I will try to follow your instructions. And I will see the dietitian and the podiatrist as soon as possible. Maybe… maybe I can still have a little rum punch on a Saturday night. Just a little one. Thank you again, Doctor Glowka. You a very kind lady.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. And you’re absolutely right – a little rum punch on a Saturday night is perfectly acceptable, as long as it’s in moderation. Remember, managing diabetes is a team effort, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I’m confident that with your determination and our combined efforts, you can live a healthy and fulfilling life. Take care, Bianca, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You give me hope. I will see you in two weeks. .
