DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s… nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um… hi. Yeah, nice to meet you too. I just… moved here. Sort of new. I think this is for… regular check-up stuff? My husband said I should get things looked at since we just got here. I don’t really… remember much about it. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. That's perfectly okay. A general check-up is a great idea when you’re new to an area. We’ll just go through some questions, and I’ll take a look at you. Don't worry about remembering specifics; we'll take our time. First, can you tell me a little about what's been going on recently?
PATIENT: Recently… hmm. Everything feels kinda normal, I guess? I work… with machines. Building things and fixing stuff. It’s okay work. Nothing… hurting or anything. Just… tired, maybe? I dunno. We moved from… somewhere up north. Lots of trees. I think. My husband does most of the remembering. He’s good at that. Sorry. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Emileigh. It’s good to know you’re feeling generally okay, and that tiredness is the main thing you’ve noticed. Working with machines can be quite demanding. And don't apologize at all. It’s perfectly alright. Now, when you say tired… is this a new tiredness, or has this been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Um… I think… newer. It got worse when we moved, definitely. Everything was… a lot of boxes and stuff. Lifting and… organizing. But even before that, I was feeling it a bit. Like… harder to get going in the mornings. And I nap sometimes. Which I don't usually do. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A change in tiredness, especially with a move and all the lifting… that’s a good place to start. We’ll want to rule out anything simple. Now, outside of the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Like… what kind of symptoms? I haven’t… been sick, I don’t think. My stomach feels okay. No… headaches. Oh! Sometimes my hands are a little… shaky? But that’s probably from working with the tools. I do a lot of… fine work. Is that a symptom? I'm not sure. Sorry, I'm bad at this.
DOCTOR: You're not bad at all, Emileigh. It's perfectly normal to be unsure! The shaky hands… that could be from the work, yes, but it’s good you mentioned it. We'll take it into consideration. And no headaches or stomach issues, that's good to hear. Just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite…? Hmm. I eat… okay, I guess? My husband cooks. He makes good food. I haven’t… really noticed a change. Maybe a little less hungry sometimes? But I think that’s just because I’m tired. And weight… I don't know. I haven't weighed myself in a while. I think… maybe I’ve gained a little? But I'm not sure. It's hard to say. I just… wear the same clothes. Sorry. Is this helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Emileigh. Thank you for sharing. It sounds like we have a bit of tiredness, potentially some minor weight gain, and a slightly decreased appetite. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Have you been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never really been sick enough to need any. Just… vitamins, sometimes. My husband gets them for me. Multivitamins, I think? But I don’t take them every day. He just says it’s good to have. Does that count? Sorry, I’m probably saying too much.
DOCTOR: No, you're not saying too much at all, Emileigh. Vitamins don’t typically concern me unless you're taking a very high dose. So, no regular medications. Good to know. Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Um… I don't think so. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I'm outside? But that’s probably just bugs. My husband says I'm allergic to… housework, but I don’t think that counts. Sorry, I'm being silly. Do you want me to stop talking?
DOCTOR: No, please don’t stop talking! That was a very good joke, Emileigh. And no known allergies, that’s excellent. Okay, wonderful. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just checking your heart, lungs, and taking a look at a few things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. That's okay. I guess. I don't really… like doctors, but I know I should. Just… be quick, please? And tell me if anything hurts. I don't want to be surprised. Sorry. Is that okay to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. Perfectly alright to ask. I will definitely tell you if anything hurts, and I’ll be as quick as possible. Just a routine check-up. First, let's take your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Okay… trying to relax. It’s… harder than it looks. Is this… the squeezing thing? My husband said something about a squeezing thing. Sorry. I just… get nervous. It's silly.
DOCTOR: That is the squeezing thing, yes! It’s perfectly normal to feel a little nervous. And you’re not silly at all. Just breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 128 over 76. That's within a normal range. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s a little hard too. I don’t have very strong lungs. My husband says… never mind. Is that good? Is everything okay? I can’t really hear what you're saying. Sorry. I just… get worried.
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the lower lobes, but not significantly. Could you take a few more deep breaths for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay… I’m trying. It feels… tight? Like something is squeezing my chest a little. Is that normal? My husband said I sometimes… have a little trouble breathing when it’s cold. Sorry. I don't want to bother you.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Emileigh. You're not bothering me at all. It's good you mentioned the tightness and the difficulty breathing in the cold. I'm also noticing a slightly increased respiratory rate. While it may be nothing, I’d like to order a chest X-ray just to rule out anything concerning. It’s a quick and simple procedure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… an X-ray? Like… the kind they use at the airport? Is something wrong? My husband said my chest is… sometimes a little weak. Is it bad? I don't want to have anything… serious. I just moved here, and I don't want to get sick. Sorry. I'm probably overreacting. Is it expensive?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Emileigh, take a deep breath. It's good to be cautious. An X-ray is a quick image of your lungs, and it helps us get a better understanding of what's going on. It's similar to the airport scanner, yes, but a much lower dose of radiation. It doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong, it just helps us rule things out. We want to make sure everything is okay, especially with the tiredness and the tightness you’ve been feeling. As for cost, we can check with your Medicare insurance to see what’s covered. We'll get all that sorted out for you. Would you be comfortable with getting the X-ray today?
PATIENT: …If it will make sure everything is okay, then… yeah. Okay. I guess. But… promise you'll tell me everything that's wrong? Even if it's bad? My husband… he always tries to protect me. But I want to know. I just… I don't want any surprises. Sorry. Is that okay to ask? It's probably silly.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright to ask, Emileigh. And I promise, I will tell you everything, even if it's not what we hope for. We’ll go through the results together, and I'll answer all your questions as clearly as I can. Your husband sounds like a very caring man, but it's important for you to understand what's going on with your health. Okay. I'll have the technician come in and take the X-ray. It shouldn't take long. In the meantime, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. I'm just… nervous about the X-ray. And… I hope everything is okay. Sorry. I’m probably being silly again. Thank you for… being patient with me. You're very nice.
DOCTOR: You're not being silly at all, Emileigh. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have, even after the X-ray. I'll let the technician know you’re ready. Just try to relax, and remember to take deep breaths. We’ll get through this together.
