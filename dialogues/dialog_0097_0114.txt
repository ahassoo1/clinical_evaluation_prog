DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been bothering me. I have trouble when I try to lie flat. It feels like… like something is pressing on my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing trouble is definitely something we need to look into. And it's good you mentioned it's worse when lying flat – that’s helpful information. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Let me think… it began, oh, about three months ago, I believe. Perhaps a little longer. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It just… gradually got worse. At first, I could just use an extra pillow. Now… now it’s quite difficult.
DOCTOR: Three months, gradually worsening… that's good to know. And you’ve already tried using extra pillows. Has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Specific… well, not that I’ve noticed. Eating doesn't seem to change it. Walking doesn't change it. It's just… lying down. And sometimes, if I’m bending over to pick something up. But mostly lying down. It's very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not linked to activity or eating. Just positional – lying down and bending over. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. Sometimes my ankles swell a bit at the end of the day. Not terribly, but I do notice it. And… I feel rather tired, even after a good night's sleep. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. Swollen ankles and fatigue… both potentially important. How much swelling are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, not a great deal. Just enough that my shoes feel a little tighter. I wouldn’t say they’re huge or anything. But they are noticeably more swollen than they used to be. It’s… it's subtle, really. It’s easy to miss if I’m not paying attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, subtle ankle swelling. And you said fatigue even after a good night's sleep. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst fatigue you can imagine, what number would you give your typical fatigue level?
PATIENT: Hmm. A ten would be… completely unable to get out of bed, wouldn't it? I wouldn’t say it’s that bad. Perhaps a… a five? Six, on a bad day. I can still do my work at the library, but I come home quite drained. It's… exhausting, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a five or six on a bad day. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a time, years ago. But it was well-controlled with medication. The doctor took me off the medication about ten years ago, said it wasn't necessary anymore. Otherwise… no, not that I recall. I’ve been quite healthy, actually, all my life. A few aches and pains, of course, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled high blood pressure that was discontinued ten years ago. That's good to know. And no other significant medical history. What about any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No surgeries. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, perhaps forty years ago, and spent a few days in the hospital. But other than that… no. I’ve been very fortunate. I haven’t required much medical attention, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia forty years ago, otherwise no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, I’d like to ask about your family. Is there any history of heart disease, lung problems, or blood clots in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had… something with her heart, I believe. She was rather frail in her later years. But I don’t recall the specifics. It was a long time ago. And my father… he was healthy as a horse, really. Never a sick day in his life. I don't know of any lung problems or blood clots, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with some heart issues, otherwise no known family history of lung problems or blood clots. And finally, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. Doctor strongly advised against it, even when it was fashionable. I always thought it was a foolish habit. My husband smoked, but I made him smoke outside. It smelled dreadful.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps a few times a week. Nothing excessive, you understand. I enjoy a good Merlot, but I certainly don't rely on it. It's just a small pleasure.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. As I said, I was taken off the blood pressure medication years ago. I don't take any vitamins or anything of that sort. I prefer to get my nutrients from my food, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Thank you for all that information, Maribeth. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and look at your ankles. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be fine. Please do. I just… I do hope it doesn't take too long. I have a book club meeting this evening.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as possible. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. Now another… and out… Okay. Your lungs sound a little… diminished on both sides, but no wheezing or crackling that I can hear right now. Your heart sounds… regular, but a bit… distant. Okay, your blood pressure is 140 over 90. That's a little elevated. And your ankles do have some mild pitting edema – that’s the swelling I suspected. It’s not severe, but it's definitely present. Alright, everything seems to be fairly straightforward, but your symptoms, combined with the diminished lung sounds, elevated blood pressure and ankle swelling… it’s making me think about heart failure. It's a possibility we need to investigate. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to rule things out and get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Heart… failure? Oh dear. That sounds… rather frightening. I’ve never been told anything like that before. Diminished lung sounds? Is that bad? And what does “investigate” entail? I do hope it doesn't involve a great deal of poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Maribeth, and I apologize for any alarm I’ve caused. It’s important to remember that “heart failure” doesn’t mean your heart has stopped working. It means it’s not pumping as efficiently as it should be. Diminished lung sounds can sometimes indicate fluid buildup in the lungs, which can happen when the heart isn’t pumping effectively. As for what “investigate” entails, I’d like to order a few tests. Primarily, an EKG to check the electrical activity of your heart, and a chest X-ray to see if there’s any fluid in your lungs. We’ll also need to do some blood work to check your kidney function and look for markers that can indicate heart strain. These are all fairly routine tests, and they shouldn’t involve a great deal of discomfort. The blood work will be a simple needle prick, and the chest X-ray is just a quick picture. The EKG involves placing some sticky pads on your chest. It’s all very straightforward. Would you be comfortable with me ordering these tests for you?
PATIENT: Tests… well, I suppose it’s better to know, isn’t it? I do dislike needles, but… yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary, please do order the tests. The sooner we can get this sorted out, the better. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad you're willing to proceed. There’s nothing special you need to do to prepare for the tests, just wear comfortable clothing for the EKG. As for timing, the blood work results usually come back within a day or two. The chest X-ray report will take a bit longer, perhaps three to five business days, as the radiologist needs to review it. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and draw your blood now, and then schedule you for the chest X-ray. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I would suggest limiting your salt intake, as that can worsen fluid retention. And if you notice any shortness of breath at rest, or if your ankles swell significantly, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Limiting salt… yes, I can manage that. I do enjoy a bit of seasoning, but I can certainly cut back. Shortness of breath at rest… that’s good to know. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Maribeth. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. We’ll take it one step at a time. Sarah will be in shortly to draw your blood. Don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. And please remember, we’re here to support you. .
