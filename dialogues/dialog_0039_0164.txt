DOCTOR: Hello, Mande. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It's nice to meet you too, Dr. Kamahele. Well, it's a bit…strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’m kind of yellow. Not a lot, but enough that people have noticed. It started after I ate some fava beans – I love them, but now I think they might be the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, tired and a bit yellow… and it started after eating fava beans. Interesting. It's good you're paying attention to what might be triggering this. That’s very helpful. When you say tired, can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not just…sleepy tired. It’s like I have no energy at all. Even getting out of bed feels like a huge effort. And I get winded easily, even walking up a few stairs. It's been going on for about a week now, maybe a little longer, and it’s getting worse, not better. I just thought I was out of shape, but then the yellowing started and I remembered something my grandmother used to say about fava beans… she was Romanian, too, you know.
DOCTOR: That does sound quite draining. And the grandmother connection is interesting – sometimes those family stories hold real clues. A week or so, getting worse… okay. And you said you’re noticing the yellowing now. Where are you seeing that, specifically?
PATIENT: Mostly in my eyes, I think. And my skin is looking a little…pale, but yellowish too. It’s hard to tell, maybe it’s just the lighting. My husband noticed it first, actually. He made me look at myself in bright light, and he said I definitely looked different. He's usually not one to notice things, so that's saying something. It’s not bright yellow, just…off.
DOCTOR: Okay, eyes and skin, noticed by your husband – that’s good he’s observant! It’s good to have someone else notice these things. It sounds like we need to investigate this further. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been feeling a bit sick to my stomach sometimes, not full-on vomiting, just kind of queasy. And my urine is really dark, almost brown. I thought it was just because I wasn’t drinking enough water, but now I’m wondering if that’s connected too. Oh, and I've been a little more short-tempered than usual, if that counts for anything. My husband definitely thinks it does!
DOCTOR: Okay, queasiness, dark urine, and a bit more irritable… all potentially relevant. We’re building a picture here. Now, let's go back a little. Have you had any fever, chills, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, definitely not. And no abdominal pain, no. It's mostly just the tiredness, the queasiness, and feeling…weak, I guess. It's hard to explain. Like all the energy's been drained out of me. And the yellowing, of course. I’m just really worried about what’s going on. Is it serious? What could be causing all this? I’ve never felt like this before.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mande, and it's good you came in to get this checked out. We're going to figure this out. Given the fava beans, the yellowing, the tiredness, and the dark urine… it could be something called G6PD deficiency, which is more common in certain ethnic groups, including those with Romanian heritage. It means your body has trouble processing certain things, and it can be triggered by things like fava beans. But it’s important not to jump to conclusions. I'd like to do a quick physical exam and then order some blood tests to get a clearer picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… G6PD deficiency… I’ve never heard of that. But if it’s common with people from Romania, that makes sense. My grandmother always said we had “sensitive blood.” I guess that’s what she meant. Blood tests sound good, yes. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. And to know what’s going on, so I can stop worrying. What does the physical exam involve? Will it be uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: “Sensitive blood” – that’s a good way to put it. It might have been a family way of describing something like this. The physical exam will be pretty straightforward. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look at your skin and eyes a little more closely. I'll also feel your abdomen for any tenderness or enlargement. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all – just routine checks. I’m going to start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we’ll move on to the exam. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Vital signs first, then the exam… okay. I’m ready when you are. I hope it’s not anything too serious. It's just…it's been a little scary feeling like this. I never get sick, usually. And to feel so weak…it's not like me at all. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Kamahele. It really helps to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mande. It's my job to help you understand what's happening, and to work with you to find the best solution. And you’re right to be proactive about your health. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 – all within normal range. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs… Everything sounds clear on both sides. Now, can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay, done. Is everything alright? It feels a little strange having someone listen to my chest, but I understand it’s necessary. I just…I hope we can find out what’s going on soon. I have a trip planned in a few weeks and I really don’t want to have to cancel it. I've been looking forward to it for months.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds good so far. Your lungs are clear and your heart rhythm is normal. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Not much tenderness here, but your liver does feel slightly enlarged. That could be related to what's going on, but we need the blood tests to confirm. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything else looks normal. Now, let's talk about those blood tests. I want to check your liver function, your G6PD levels, and do a complete blood count to see if there are any other clues. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay…liver enlarged… that doesn't sound good. But I understand we need the tests. Yes, those tests sound fine. Liver function, G6PD, and blood count… whatever you think is necessary. Will the blood count show anything about the… the tiredness? Is that something they can see in the blood? I'm just…trying to understand what's happening, you know. I feel a little lost. And worried. But I trust you, Dr. Kamahele.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel lost and worried, Mande. And you are right to ask questions. A complete blood count can show clues about the tiredness – things like your red blood cell count and hemoglobin levels can indicate anemia, which causes fatigue. We’ll also be looking for signs of infection or inflammation. I'm going to order those tests now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. It should only take a few minutes. After we get the results – usually within 24-48 hours – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, avoiding fava beans and anything else that might trigger symptoms, and getting plenty of rest. Are you taking any medications currently, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Okay…stay hydrated, no fava beans, rest… that sounds manageable. I’m not taking any medications currently, no. And I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in years, actually. I usually just get a yearly checkup, but this is…different. I feel so weak and tired, it’s hard to think straight sometimes. Thank you, Dr. Kamahele, for listening and taking the time to explain everything. I really appreciate it. Now, about those results… will I be able to see them online or something? I’m a bit of a worrier, and I might want to look at them as soon as they’re available. I understand if that’s not possible, though.
DOCTOR: It's good you came in when you noticed something different. And you’re very welcome. I completely understand wanting to see the results as soon as possible. Yes, our clinic has a patient portal where you can access your lab results online as soon as they’re available. The nurse will give you instructions on how to create an account or access your existing one. However, I do recommend waiting to interpret them until we can discuss them together. Lab results can sometimes be confusing, and I want to make sure you understand what they mean in the context of your overall health. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you so much, Dr. Kamahele. I really feel better just knowing what’s going on, and that you’re taking this seriously. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I guess I’ll just wait for the nurse now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. We’re here to help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I will see you soon.
