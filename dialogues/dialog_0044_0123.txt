DOCTOR: Good morning, Carla. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s driving me a little crazy, to be honest. It's all over, really. Not just one spot.
DOCTOR: Okay, all over… I understand. That is frustrating. When did this itching start, Carla?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, oh, maybe a couple of weeks ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little annoyance. But it’s gotten worse each day, I think. Hard to say exactly, you know? Time flies when you’re… well, when you’re getting older!
DOCTOR: It absolutely does. A couple of weeks, gradually worsening… That gives us a good starting point. And has anything changed around the time it started?
PATIENT: Changed… oh dear. Let me see. Not that I can recall, really. I haven’t started using any new soaps or lotions, nothing like that. I’ve been eating the same things, same routine mostly. I did start a new plant in the garden, a hibiscus… but I doubt that would cause itching, would it?
DOCTOR: A hibiscus is an interesting thought! While it’s unlikely, we can’t rule anything out completely. It’s good you’re thinking of potential triggers. So, the itching itself… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. It’s worse at night, definitely. Keeps me up sometimes, scratching away. During the day it’s… manageable, but it’s always there, you know? A little nagging feeling. It’s not painful, just… incredibly irritating.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse at night, constant but manageable during the day, not painful, just irritating. That’s helpful. Now, can you describe the itching itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not like a bug bite, not prickly. More… dry? Like my skin is just really, really wanting to be scratched. And sometimes it feels… warm? Not hot, just… warm in patches. It’s hard to explain, really. Like a deep, restless feeling under the skin.
DOCTOR: A deep, restless feeling… warm patches… okay. And have you noticed any changes in your skin appearance along with the itching?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, I think so. It's a little red in places, not a rash exactly, just… flushed. And it feels a little rougher than usual, maybe a bit scaly. Not everywhere, just on my arms and legs mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, redness and roughness, primarily on your arms and legs. And you said it’s been a couple of weeks. Have you tried anything to relieve the itching so far?
PATIENT: Oh yes, of course. I tried some lotion, the regular kind I always use, but it didn't really help. And I took a couple of Benadryl, you know, just to see if it would calm it down. That made me a little sleepy, but the itching came right back as soon as it wore off.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lotion didn’t help, Benadryl offered temporary relief, but the itching returned. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but that's been under control for years now, with medication. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old! I don't really see the doctor much, if I can avoid it. And I don’t have insurance, so… I try to take care of things myself.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you letting me know, Carla. And it’s good your blood pressure is under control. What medication are you currently taking for that, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it’s Lisinopril, I think. Just a small dose, once a day. I've been on it for years, like you said. I usually get it refilled at the same pharmacy, so they keep track of it for me. I don't always remember the names of things, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s good you have a regular pharmacy. Now, have you ever had any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've eaten everything, tried everything… never had a bad reaction. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach! I don't even get mosquito bites, usually. That's why this itching is so strange. It's not like anything I've ever experienced.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, no known allergies. Now, just to complete the picture, have you had any recent surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no. Not for a very long time. I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was… oh, must be forty years ago now? Other than that, nothing. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal forty years ago. And finally, Carla, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be ninety-five, very healthy right up until the end. My father had some heart trouble, but he smoked for years, so that's not surprising. I have a sister, but she lives in Puerto Rico, and we don't see each other often. As far as skin conditions, nobody in my family really had anything… not that I know of. No eczema, no psoriasis… nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No significant family history of skin conditions. Now, Carla, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to take a closer look at your skin and rule out anything obvious. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm just taking a look now. I do see some areas of redness, as you mentioned, and the skin feels a little rough to the touch. It's not dramatically inflamed, but there is some evidence of irritation. I don’t see any obvious signs of infection or anything else concerning at this point. Do you feel any tenderness in those areas when I touch them?
PATIENT: Not really, no. It's not painful, just… noticeable, you know? Like when you’ve been in the sun too long. A little warm, a little uncomfortable. It doesn't hurt unless I scratch it, and then it just… itches more.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant tenderness, just warmth and discomfort. Based on what you've told me and the examination, Carla, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a form of dermatitis – a general term for skin inflammation. There are many different types, and without further testing, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. It could be something as simple as dry skin, a mild allergic reaction to something you've come into contact with, or even a reaction to the new plant. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. A complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection, and a skin scraping to check for fungal infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… alright. Yes, that sounds sensible. I just want to know what’s causing this itch, you know? It's driving me crazy. Will they be expensive? I don't have insurance, like I said… I don’t want to get into trouble with money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Carla. I’ll talk to the lab and see what the costs will be and if there are any options for financial assistance. We can discuss that before we proceed. The CBC is usually relatively inexpensive, and the skin scraping is also not overly costly. We can also start with just the CBC if you'd prefer, and see if that provides any useful information. In the meantime, I recommend using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents, and try to avoid scratching as much as possible, even though I know that's easier said than done. Would you be comfortable with me prescribing a mild topical steroid cream to help relieve the itching?
PATIENT: A cream sounds good, yes. Anything to stop this itch! And yes, please, just the CBC to start with. Let's see what that says before we do too much. I appreciate you being so understanding about the money. It's a worry, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll take things one step at a time. I’ll write you a prescription for a mild topical steroid cream – hydrocortisone 1% – to apply to the affected areas twice a day. It should help to reduce the inflammation and relieve the itching. I'll also send in the order for the CBC. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Now, if the itching doesn’t improve within a week, or if it gets worse, please call the office right away. Also, if you develop any signs of infection, such as fever, pus, or increased pain, seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. Thank you. I hope this CBC gives us some answers.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. I’m glad I could help. We'll get those test results back as quickly as possible and go from there. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Here's the prescription and the lab order. Do you need a ride home or anything else before you leave?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I have a friend picking me up. I think I'm all set. Thank you again, Doctor Asami. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. .
