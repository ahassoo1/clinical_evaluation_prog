DOCTOR: Hi Lakiya, welcome to the clinic. I'm Courtnee Maskal, and I'm a family medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Maskal. It is nice to meet you as well. I am here because of… pain. It has been quite bothersome, truthfully. I would like to get it sorted, if possible, and quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “pain,” that's a good starting point. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is in my… lower back. On the left side, specifically. It started about three weeks ago, I believe. It was a dull ache at first, but it has grown sharper with time. It makes it difficult to… bend, and lifting anything is nearly impossible. I work with fences, you see. It’s… important work.
DOCTOR: Three weeks ago, and getting sharper… and affecting your work with fences. That sounds really frustrating, especially with how important that is to you. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It is… mostly constant. Though some days are better than others. When I first wake up, it is usually not so bad. But by the end of the day, after working… it is quite severe. Sitting for long periods does not help, either. It feels… worse when I try to stand up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse with activity and sitting, and a little better in the mornings. Does anything specifically make it feel better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Not really. Resting helps a little, I suppose. Lying down flat with a warm cloth on it. But it does not last. And… I tried some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, but they did not do much good. They upset my stomach, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting and warm cloths provide some temporary relief, but it returns, and the over-the-counter medications didn’t help and caused stomach upset. I appreciate you telling me that. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your leg at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. It stays in my back. I have not had any pain go down my leg. Just… right there. Lower back, left side. It’s… a very localized pain. I am glad it hasn’t spread. That would be… concerning.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, localized pain is helpful information. And you're right to be concerned about it spreading. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just… my age, I suppose. And… I am widowed. My husband passed away five years ago. Otherwise, no. I have Medicare, if that is useful information. I try to stay active, despite this pain. It makes it hard, of course. But I am generally healthy. I do not take any regular medications, other than what I briefly tried for the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no other medical conditions, widowed five years ago, Medicare, and generally healthy. That’s all helpful. And you don’t take any regular medications. Now, have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. I have been fortunate in that regard. Just… the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing serious. I haven’t been inside a hospital in… decades. I am a private person. I prefer to avoid them, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That's good to know. And finally, regarding your family history, are there any back problems, arthritis, or other joint issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a difficult question. My husband’s mother had some trouble with her joints when she got older, I believe. Arthritis, perhaps? But… my own parents… I don’t recall any specific back problems. They both passed away a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to my extended family. I apologize for not being more helpful. I don’t have a great deal of information on that subject.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lakiya. You’ve given me a lot of good information already. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I’ll need to check your range of motion, reflexes, and do some gentle palpation of your back to see where the pain is most prominent. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… acceptable. I would like to get this sorted, as quickly as possible. Gentle is… preferred. I do not wish to aggravate the pain further. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start with having you stand up for me, if you’re able. I want to watch how you move. Please just walk around a little, as you normally would. Okay, good. Now, can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can… try. There. That is… about as far as I can go. It hurts… quite a bit. I am not sure I recommend I try further.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That's helpful to know. It appears there's limited range of motion and pain with forward flexion. Now, let’s try bending backward a little. Just go as far as you comfortably can.
PATIENT: I can go… this far. It feels… restricted. It’s not… sharp pain, but it is uncomfortable. I do not wish to push it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to gently press on different areas of your back to see where the pain is most intense. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Does this area feel tender?
PATIENT: Yes. Right… there. That is… quite tender. It feels… sore, even when you press lightly. It is where the pain is… most concentrated. Please be… gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s helpful to know. And are you experiencing any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No numbness, tingling, or weakness. Just… pain. In my back. My legs and feet are… fine. I am grateful for that, at least. I need my legs for work.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let's check your reflexes. This will just involve a quick tap on your knee and ankle. Your reflexes are… normal on both sides. Everything seems to be responding appropriately. Okay, Lakiya. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain or sprain in your lower back, possibly aggravated by your work. The tenderness and limited range of motion on the left side supports that. However, to rule out anything more serious, like a disc issue or fracture, I’d like to get an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… Yes. That is… acceptable. If it will help determine the cause of the pain, then I agree. I would like to know what is happening, and what can be done to fix it. As quickly as possible, if you please. I have fences to build.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can get that scheduled right away. I'll have my assistant come in and get the paperwork started. In the meantime, I recommend taking some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you can tolerate them, to help with the pain and inflammation. And try to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity for the next few days. While we wait for the X-ray results, I’m going to prescribe a muscle relaxant to help ease the muscle spasms, and a topical cream to apply to your lower back to help with the pain. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Muscle relaxant and topical cream… acceptable. If it will help me get back to work, then I agree. I appreciate you… expediting the process. I am not one for sitting around. And, please… ensure the paperwork is straightforward. I am not… fond of complicated forms.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll keep it as simple as possible. My assistant, Sarah, is very good at explaining things. She'll walk you through everything. To recap: we’re getting an X-ray, I’m prescribing a muscle relaxant and a topical cream, and I recommend avoiding heavy lifting and taking over-the-counter pain relievers if you can. We'll review the X-ray results as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions for me before I have Sarah come in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… sufficient. I believe you have covered everything. I will await Sarah, and the results of the X-ray. Thank you for… your prompt attention. I do not wish to take up any more of your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lakiya. We’ll get you sorted out as quickly as possible. I'll let Sarah know to come in. <stage>I turn to the door and call out, "Sarah, could you come in here for a moment?
