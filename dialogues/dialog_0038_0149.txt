DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Auelua, you said? Fancy name. Honestly, I don’t really do doctors much anymore. Been a podiatrist myself for… well, a long time. Too many years to count, really. It’s just… I’m not keen on being poked and prodded, if you catch my drift. And truthfully, I don't remember why my daughter insisted I come. Something about… not wanting things done? She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Auelua is Scottish, yes – a bit of a mouthful! And it completely makes sense – after being the doctor for so long, being on this side of things can be… less appealing. No need to worry about being poked and prodded if we don’t need to. Your daughter brought you in… hmm. It’s good of her to be thoughtful. Do you remember anything about what she was concerned about?
PATIENT: Oh, Scotland. That explains the accent, I suppose. A bit chilly, isn't it? Always thought it looked damp. And my daughter… bless her heart, she fusses. Something about… tests? And… wanting to make sure I haven't got… something. I really can't recall. Old age, you know. It steals things. Important things, usually. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. A little creaky, maybe, but who isn’t at my age? I walked here, didn’t I?
DOCTOR: It is chilly! And damp sometimes, yes. Though the scenery is lovely. Tests… alright. It sounds like she’s worried about some general health checks, then. And you walked here – that’s wonderful! Good for you. Just to be thorough, even though you feel fine, would you mind if I ask you a few questions about how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Oh, questions, are they? Well, I suppose. As long as it doesn't involve… machines. And needles. I hate needles. Always did. Ask away, but don’t expect a lot of detail. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. And frankly, I'm not sure why I'm even here. Is this going to take long? My bingo starts at two.
DOCTOR: No machines or needles unless absolutely necessary, I promise. We’ll take it slow, and if we can’t remember something, that’s perfectly alright. We’ll just do what we can. And bingo at two – good to know! We’ll try to be as quick as possible. Let’s start with… have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm. Well, I enjoy a good meal, always have. But… things don’t taste the same, I suppose. Not as vibrant. Everything seems a bit… bland. Could be the cooking, though. My housekeeper isn’t what she used to be. She burns everything. Honestly, it’s a wonder I haven’t lost weight. Although… I might have put a little on. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: A change in taste, and things seeming bland… and some weight fluctuation. That’s useful to know. It could be related to a number of things. And aside from your appetite, have you been experiencing any trouble with your digestion?
PATIENT: Digestion? Oh, dear. Well… let’s just say it’s not as reliable as it once was. Things move a bit… slower, shall we say? And sometimes… uncomfortable. I try not to dwell on it. It’s not a pleasant topic, is it? I take a little something… a pink pill, I think. My daughter orders it for me. But honestly, I can’t remember what it’s for.
DOCTOR: Slower digestion and some discomfort... and a pink pill your daughter orders for you. That’s alright, it’s not a pleasant topic at all. We'll try to figure out what that pink pill is later. Now, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy levels… Well, I tire easily, that’s for sure. Used to be able to work all day, on my feet for hours. Now? A little walk leaves me breathless. I nap a lot. A lot. And I’m not as… enthusiastic about things. Used to love gardening, but I haven't touched it this year. Just… no energy, really. It's like something's draining me.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, shortness of breath with activity, and a loss of interest in hobbies… that’s quite a lot. And it’s good you’re telling me about this. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about other parts of your body, just to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Now that you mention it… yes, a little. Especially at the end of the day. I just assumed it was the heat. It's been rather warm, hasn’t it? I usually put my feet up, and it goes down. But it does bother me sometimes. Makes my shoes feel tight. Honestly, I've had to throw out a perfectly good pair of pumps just last week. Such a waste.
DOCTOR: Swelling in the ankles, especially at the end of the day, and feeling tight in your shoes… alright. And you mentioned heat – have you been feeling particularly hot or cold lately, or have you noticed any changes in your tolerance to temperature?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s a good question. I am always cold now. Even when everyone else is comfortable, I'm shivering. I have to wear a cardigan all the time, even in the summer. My daughter keeps telling me to put the heating on, but I don’t like wasting energy. It's just… I feel perpetually chilled. And my hands are always cold too. Like ice.
DOCTOR: Always feeling cold, even when others are comfortable, and cold hands… alright. That's very helpful. Now, just a few more questions about other symptoms. Have you been experiencing any headaches, dizziness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. Nothing terrible, just a dull ache at the back of my head. I usually take a little something for it, but I can't remember what. Dizziness? Not really. Though I do feel a bit… unsteady on my feet sometimes. Could be the age, I suppose. And my vision… well, it’s not what it used to be. Everything’s a bit blurry. I need stronger glasses, I think. I keep meaning to make an appointment with the optometrist, but I keep forgetting.
DOCTOR: Occasional headaches, feeling unsteady, and blurry vision… alright. It sounds like you've been experiencing quite a few changes. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, an exam? Well… I suppose. As long as it doesn’t involve… poking. And prodding. And definitely no needles. I hate needles, you know. But a quick look… alright. Just be gentle, please. And don’t take too long. My bingo starts at two, remember?
DOCTOR: No poking, prodding, or needles, I promise. Gentle is the word. We’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears. It won’t take long at all. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 85. We’ll keep an eye on that. Your heart sounds a little faint, and I can hear some crackling in your lungs. Not alarming, but something we need to investigate further. Your ears look clear. Okay. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh, elevated, is it? I don't like the sound of that. I always try to stay calm, you know. Gets me through things. Crackling in my lungs? Well, that doesn't sound good at all. Is it serious? And my abdomen? What are you looking for in there? Honestly, I don't understand all this doctor talk. Just tell me straight, is something wrong? And please, hurry. My bingo…
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. I understand your concerns, and I'll explain everything as clearly as I can. The elevated blood pressure and crackling in your lungs are things we need to look into further, but they don’t necessarily mean anything serious right now. It’s better to find out what’s causing them so we can address them if needed. Listening to your abdomen, I'm checking for any unusual sounds or tenderness. It helps me get a picture of what's going on inside. I do hear a slight fluid build-up in your abdomen, which could be contributing to the discomfort you've been feeling. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, I’d like to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fluid build-up? In my abdomen? Oh, dear. That doesn't sound good at all. Is it… serious? Is it going to hurt? I don't like the sound of any of this, honestly. Blood tests and an X-ray… Oh, I really don't like the sound of that. X-rays… aren't they… dangerous? And all that poking and prodding for the blood tests? I really don't know, Doctor. I’m not sure I want to go through all that. I just want to feel better, and play my bingo. Can't we just give me something for it? A pill, perhaps? My daughter always has pills for everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Wynell. It’s perfectly normal to be worried about tests, and I want to assure you that we’ll take things at your pace. The X-ray uses a very low dose of radiation, and the benefits of finding out what’s going on far outweigh the risks. As for the blood tests, it’s just a small prick, and it doesn’t usually hurt much. However, without these tests, it's difficult for me to know exactly what's causing your symptoms, and I wouldn’t want to give you a medication without understanding the underlying cause. It’s like trying to fix a car without knowing what’s broken. The fluid build-up could be caused by several things, and the tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. It’s possible it’s something simple, but we need to rule out anything more serious. Would you be willing to consider the tests, even if it’s just to put your mind at ease?
PATIENT: Oh, putting my mind at ease… that does sound nice. But all that poking and prodding… and waiting for results? It just seems like a lot of fuss. And what if the results are… bad? I don't think I could handle that. Honestly, Doctor, I've lived a long life. Maybe it's just… my time. Perhaps I should just enjoy the time I have left, and play my bingo. I really don't think I want to go through all that stress and worry. Is there… is there anything else you can do? A pill, perhaps? My daughter has a whole cabinet full of them. Just something to make me feel better, and stop the swelling. Please?
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. It's completely your decision, and I respect that. I wouldn’t want to push you into anything you’re not comfortable with. However, I do feel strongly that without some basic tests, we’re just guessing, and that could be harmful. Even a simple blood test can give us valuable information. There is a diuretic – a water pill – that can help reduce the swelling. But it only addresses the symptom, and doesn’t fix the underlying cause. And there could be side effects. It's really a temporary solution. I can write you a prescription for a diuretic if you’d like, but I strongly recommend at least considering the blood tests. It would give me a much better understanding of what’s going on, and help me provide you with the best possible care. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, a diuretic… that sounds… easier. Less poking, less prodding. Just a pill, and the swelling goes away? That sounds much more appealing. Honestly, Doctor, I'm tired. I'm tired of worrying, tired of tests, tired of doctors. I just want to feel better, and play my bingo. If a pill can help with that, then that's what I want. Please, just write me a prescription for the diuretic. I promise I’ll take it. And… maybe I'll think about the tests later. But not today. Today, I just want to go home and play my bingo. Could you… could you write it quickly, please? My bingo starts in a few hours.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. I understand. I’ll write you a prescription for a low-dose diuretic. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully and let me know if you experience any side effects, such as dizziness or fatigue. Here you go. And please, if your symptoms worsen, or if you start to feel unwell, don’t hesitate to come back and see me. I wish you all the best, Wynell, and I hope you enjoy your bingo. And remember, if you change your mind about the tests, my door is always open. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. No, I think that’s all. Just the prescription, and… a safe trip home. Honestly, you’ve been very patient with me. I can be a bit… difficult, sometimes. But I appreciate you listening to my concerns. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really should get going. My bingo starts soon, and I don't want to be late. Thank you again, Doctor. And… have a good day.
DOCTOR: You have a good day too, Wynell. And enjoy your bingo. .
