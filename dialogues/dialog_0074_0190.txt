DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you have a seat?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Reisig. Thank you. I… well, I’m here because I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet lately. It’s quite bothersome, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Unsteady on your feet” – that can mean a number of things. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It’s difficult to explain precisely. It’s not… a fall, not yet. More like a wavering. As if the room is tilting, or I am. It comes and goes. I find myself reaching for things… walls, furniture… just to steady myself. When it happens is… unclear. I don't recall any specific triggers. It's been occurring for… some time now, I believe. Perhaps a few weeks? It's all a bit hazy, I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, take your time. A few weeks is helpful information. And it's good you're describing it as a wavering, rather than a full-blown fall. That gives us a starting point. Could you describe what it feels like right before you feel unsteady?
PATIENT: Hmm… Before… it's not a sudden thing, usually. A sort of… lightness, perhaps? A slight dizziness, not spinning exactly. More like… being disconnected. And then the wavering begins. It’s difficult to describe. It’s not painful, just… unsettling. As if my feet aren’t quite… grounded. I don't believe I experience any ringing in my ears or changes in my vision beforehand, if that's helpful. Does that make any sense? I fear I am not being very precise.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Lilyanna. It sounds like it starts with a feeling of lightness and disconnection, then progresses to a wavering sensation. No spinning, no changes in vision or ringing in the ears – that’s good to know. Now, has anything specific happened around the time this started?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. Let me see… Around the time it started… My husband… he passed away approximately three months ago. It was… unexpected. A heart condition. I believe I’ve been… preoccupied since then. Working has been a… distraction, thankfully. I work with the oil rigs, you see. Rotary drill operator. It’s… demanding. But it keeps my mind occupied. Perhaps that is relevant? I truly don’t recall any specific event coinciding with the start of the unsteadiness, other than… that.
DOCTOR: I see. I am very sorry for your loss, Lilyanna. That is a tremendous change and a significant stressor. It absolutely could be relevant. Grief can manifest in many ways, both emotional and physical. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I am aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been… rather healthy, surprisingly, given the nature of my work. I have private insurance, and I undergo regular check-ups as required by my employer. They haven’t flagged anything of concern. I haven’t experienced any serious illnesses or injuries, knock on wood. I take a multivitamin, if that’s of any consequence. And… occasionally, ibuprofen for minor aches and pains after a long shift. Nothing regular, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements, besides the multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. Just the multivitamin and the ibuprofen when needed. I rarely take anything at all, truthfully. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. I was advised, some time ago, to monitor my blood pressure, but I haven't been diligent with that lately, I confess. It’s been… difficult to keep up with everything.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. We can certainly check your blood pressure today. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I've never experienced any allergic reactions to anything, as far as I can recall. I can eat anything, take any medication – though, as I said, I rarely do. No sensitivities to pollen, dust, animals… nothing. I apologize if I seem… vague. My mind isn’t as sharp as it used to be. It’s been a trying few months.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Lilyanna. It's perfectly understandable given the circumstances. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s another area I'm not particularly knowledgeable about, I’m afraid. My mother passed away when I was young, and I didn't know my father. I have a few distant cousins, but I haven't seen them in years. To my knowledge, there haven't been any major illnesses that run in the family… heart conditions, perhaps? My uncle on my mother’s side… I vaguely recall something about his heart, but I couldn’t provide any specifics. I truly apologize. It’s not something I’ve ever inquired about. Perhaps that was a mistake.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Lilyanna. You're doing fine. Many people don’t have detailed knowledge of their family medical history. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. I do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs whatsoever. I find that sort of behaviour… unappealing. And quite frankly, given the demands of my profession, I couldn’t afford to. It requires a clear head and steady hands. I’ve never been inclined towards those vices, and I have no intention of starting now. I apologize if that sounds… judgmental. It simply isn’t my way of life.
DOCTOR: Not at all. That’s perfectly fine, and I appreciate your honesty. Now, could you tell me a bit about your work?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned earlier, I am a rotary drill operator in the oil and gas industry. It's… demanding work, both physically and mentally. Long hours, often in challenging environments. I operate heavy machinery, monitor equipment, and ensure the safe and efficient extraction of oil. It requires a lot of concentration, coordination, and physical stamina. We work in shifts, often rotating between day and night. It’s not glamorous, but it's… satisfying. And it keeps me occupied, as I said before. I’ve been doing it for… approximately seven years now. It’s a skilled trade, and I take pride in my work. It's essential to be focused, precise, and aware of your surroundings at all times.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, going back to the unsteadiness, has it been interfering with your ability to do your job?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question, Doctor. It hasn't completely interfered, thankfully. But it's becoming increasingly concerning. There have been a few instances where I’ve had to ask a colleague to assist me, just to steady myself. I haven't fallen, and I've been careful to avoid dangerous situations. But the fear of it happening while I’m operating machinery… that’s unsettling, to say the least. I’m capable, and I take pride in my work, but I’m not willing to risk the safety of myself or my colleagues. It’s starting to affect my concentration, which is… unacceptable. I’ve been trying to compensate, but it's becoming more difficult to ignore. I’m worried it will eventually force me to take time off, and I… I can’t afford to do that. Financially, and… emotionally. It's a troubling situation, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That's very important information, Lilyanna. It sounds like this is impacting your work and causing you a significant amount of stress. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and do some basic neurological tests to assess your balance and coordination. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. I understand it’s necessary. Please, proceed. I’m ready. I’d like to understand what’s happening, and I trust your expertise. I’m… perhaps a little nervous, but I want to get to the bottom of this. Please, do whatever you deem necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, could you try walking heel-to-toe, like you're walking on a tightrope?
PATIENT: Oh. That… that is more difficult than I anticipated. I apologize. My balance isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilyanna. It’s important for me to see what’s going on. No need to apologize. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please sit back down. Okay, everything appears normal so far. I'm going to do a quick Romberg test. Could you stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here. Thirty seconds, yes?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, you can sit down now. I noticed a bit of sway during the Romberg test. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause at this moment. Several possibilities come to mind. It could be related to a vestibular issue – a problem with the inner ear – or potentially something neurological. The fact that this started around the time of your loss is also significant, as stress and grief can manifest in various physical ways. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a referral to an audiologist for a hearing test and balance assessment. That will help us determine if there’s a problem with your inner ear. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly alright. Blood tests and a referral to an audiologist. I appreciate your thoroughness. And you’re right, the timing… it’s likely related to everything that’s happened. I just… want to understand what’s going on, and to ensure it doesn’t interfere with my ability to work. I trust your judgment, and I’m happy to follow your recommendations. Please, let me know if there’s anything else I should be doing. And… thank you. For listening, and for taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I understand your concerns, and we’ll work together to get to the bottom of this. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests now, and I’ll provide you with a referral to a highly recommended audiologist. The blood tests should take a few days to come back, and I'll contact you as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, please try to get enough rest and stay hydrated. And if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as dizziness, ringing in the ears, or difficulty speaking, please contact me immediately. Here is the referral information for the audiologist. Their number is 555-123-4567. They will schedule an appointment for you. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't believe so. You've covered everything very thoroughly. The referral information is helpful, and I will schedule an appointment with the audiologist as soon as possible. I appreciate your kindness, and your attention to detail. I’m… cautiously optimistic, and I trust we’ll get to the bottom of this. Thank you again for everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
