DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Throat. Hurts. Been... a little while, I guess. Not a good hurt, if you understand. Like swallowing glass. Honestly, I don’t have all day to explain.
DOCTOR: Right. “A little while.” Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Look, things… blur. Maybe… a week? Two? It’s hard to keep track when you’re… busy. And frankly, it doesn’t matter that much, does it? It hurts when I swallow. That's the point. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, while I appreciate your… directness, a precise timeline does matter. It helps determine the likely cause, and therefore, the proper course of action. A week or two of a sore throat could indicate a simple viral infection, but a longer duration warrants further investigation. Now, is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. It's... more when I eat. And drink. Anything, really. It's not always hurting, but… it's always there, you know? A dull ache. Like someone left a pebble in my throat. Do you need a diagram? I really don’t think it's that complicated.
DOCTOR: No, a diagram isn’t necessary. You’ve described it adequately, though minimally. Has there been any fever, chills, cough, or nasal congestion accompanying this sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever… I don’t think so. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I always feel a bit warm. It’s… humid, where I live. Chills? No. Cough… not really. A bit of… clearing of the throat, if that counts. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to those little things. They just are. Is this going to take much longer? I have… appointments.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any difficulty breathing or changes in your voice?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. I'm breathing just fine, thank you very much. Voice… maybe a bit rough, now that you mention it. But I sing. Always have. So it's probably just that. Look, it’s my throat that hurts, not my lungs, alright? Are we getting anywhere with this? I feel perfectly capable of understanding a simple diagnosis.
DOCTOR: Open, please. And try to relax. Tongue looks normal. Hmm. Tonsils are a bit inflamed, but no significant pus or obvious lesions. Lymph nodes… slightly tender. Alright. Any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I’m aware of. Never had any problems with… flowers or anything. Food, no. Medicine… I don't really take much medicine. Just… what I need. Honestly, I don't have time to fuss over allergies. Is this seriously necessary to ask? I feel perfectly healthy otherwise. Except for my throat, of course. Which is why I'm here.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: Just… throat lozenges. The cherry ones. They don’t really do anything, but they’re nice. And… sometimes I gargle with salt water. My mother always said it helped. That’s about it. Really. Nothing fancy. Look, I haven’t been feeling sick, sick. Just a sore throat. A persistent, annoying sore throat. Can we please get to the point?
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on your symptoms and brief examination, it appears you likely have pharyngitis, most probably viral. However, without a more thorough workup…and frankly, given your lack of detail and… insistence on minimal information… I can’t rule out a bacterial infection entirely. I recommend a course of supportive care: rest, fluids, continued use of throat lozenges, and warm salt water gargles. If symptoms worsen—high fever, difficulty breathing, severe pain—you must return immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Throat lozenges and… gargling? That’s it? Honestly, I could have told you that myself. Fine. Yes, I understand. Perfectly. Now, is there anything else? Because I really do have to leave. I don't want to waste any more time on something so… simple. And no, I do not want a bill. I am not insured.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I understand you are uninsured. However, a complete medical examination requires detailed information. I have provided a preliminary assessment based on what you have shared. As for a bill… we’ll discuss that with the administrative staff. Given your refusal of further testing and your insistence on self-treatment, I’m documenting a likely viral pharyngitis. If your condition does not improve within a week, or if it worsens, you should seek care from another physician. I have nothing further to add. .
