DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Rowbottom, yes. Arbie Rowbottom. Well, it's about my… business. Went to the bathroom this morning and there was… red in it. Not a good sign, is it? I've seen things, you know. Things a man shouldn't see, and this… this was unsettling. And don't tell me it's just something I ate. I know my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concern, and you’re right to get it checked out. Seeing blood can definitely be unsettling. And I respect that you know your body well. So, you noticed red in your stool this morning?
PATIENT: Yes, this morning. Bright red. Not dark, mind you. Bright. Like… well, never you mind what it looked like. Just red. And it wasn’t a lot, but it wasn’t nothing, either. I haven't had any trouble… down there… for years. Not since… well, a long time ago. Does that make sense? I don't need a lecture about… personal things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Rowbottom. You’re telling me it was bright red blood, and it’s a new symptom for you. And absolutely no lecture needed – your privacy is very important to me. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Other changes? Well… my knees ache more. Everything aches more, frankly. I'm 88 years old, you know. Things fall apart. But no… nothing different different. No stomach pain, no feeling weak, no… you know… trouble going to the bathroom before this. Just… this. And it rattled me. A man shouldn't see that. It’s a bad omen, I tell you. My grandfather used to say… but never mind. Old wives' tales.
DOCTOR: I understand. Aches and pains are common at 88, and it's good you can distinguish what's new versus what’s been ongoing. And it’s completely valid to be concerned about this blood, even if you’re otherwise feeling okay. No stomach pain, no weakness, and no changes in your bowel habits before this morning?
PATIENT: That's right. Nothing. Perfectly regular. Ate my usual toast and eggs this morning, didn't feel a thing. Then… that. It’s just… unsettling. You young doctors, you don't understand what it's like to see things. I flew planes for forty years. Saw things a man shouldn’t. And now this. It's probably nothing, I suppose. But a man has to be sure, doesn’t he? Especially a man who’s seen what I’ve seen. Don’t tell me it’s stress, though. I haven’t been stressed in decades. I retired for a reason.
DOCTOR: You’re very clear, Mr. Rowbottom, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like this is a very sudden change for you, and a concerning one. And no, I certainly won’t tell you it’s stress – you’ve earned your peace and quiet. To be thorough, let me ask a few more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Physical exam. Well, I suppose. Can’t hurt, can it? Though I doubt you’ll find anything. It’s probably just… old age catching up. But ask away. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. I have… things to do. Though, truthfully, not much. Mostly just remembering things. Some things I’d rather forget, to be honest. But that's another story. Ask your questions. Just don't poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, have you noticed any changes in the color or consistency of your stool other than the blood this morning?
PATIENT: No. Regular as clockwork, always has been. Brown, solid… you don't need the details, do you? Look, I’m a practical man. I dealt with engines, hydraulics, navigation… not… waste products. It was brown, solid, and normal. Until this morning, of course. Bright red interruption to an otherwise perfectly acceptable… output. Is that what you want to hear? Honestly, I don't understand why you need to ask so many questions about this. It's a bit… undignified, don't you think? A man of my age… discussing this with a… doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if the questions feel undignified. I assure you, I’m only trying to gather all the necessary information to understand what might be going on and ensure we get to the bottom of this quickly. It's standard practice. Alright. Have you ever had any colonoscopies or other tests of your lower digestive tract before?
PATIENT: Colonoscopies? Good heavens, no! What would a man like me need with a colonoscopy? I flew planes, I didn't… inspect my insides! No, never. And I don’t intend to start now. Sounds… invasive. And unpleasant. I’ve had enough unpleasant experiences in my life, thank you very much. No, I’ve never had one of those… things. And I’m not keen on the idea. Really not keen. Is this going to be necessary? Because if it is… well. We might have a disagreement.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom. A colonoscopy isn’t something we jump into lightly. And we certainly won’t proceed without a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits. Before we talk about that, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmph. Let me see… Well, my knees, of course. Arthritis, the doctor said. And my blood pressure used to be a bit high, but it's been… manageable. I took some pills for a while, but I stopped. Didn't like the way they made me feel. And I had a bout of pneumonia when I was stationed in… never you mind where. That was a long time ago. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been a strong man. Good constitution. Didn’t believe in doctors much, to be honest. Still don’t, really. But my daughter insisted I come in. She worries too much. So, there you have it. Knees, blood pressure, pneumonia… a relatively clean bill of health for a man of my age. Though, seeing as how I’m here discussing… this… I suppose that’s debatable.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, history of high blood pressure, and pneumonia. Thank you. And you said you stopped taking the blood pressure medication because you didn't like how it made you feel?
PATIENT: That’s right. Made me feel… sluggish. And lightheaded. I’m a pilot, you know. Always have to be alert. Can’t be taking pills that make you feel like you’re floating. I managed it on my own for years. Cut back on the salt, took some herbal remedies… you don’t need to write all that down, do you? It’s just… common sense. A man knows his own body. And I knew I couldn’t be taking medication that affected my… faculties. That's why I stopped. My daughter didn't approve, of course. She always thinks the worst. But what does she know? She sits behind a desk all day. Doesn't understand the demands of… real life.
DOCTOR: I understand. You stopped the medication due to the side effects and your need to remain alert. That’s important. And you’re right, it’s good to be aware of how medications affect you. Do you currently take any other medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little glucosamine for the knees. And sometimes, if I'm having trouble sleeping, I take a bit of chamomile tea. But that's it. Nothing serious. Just… old man remedies. My wife used to make the chamomile tea. Good woman. Gone now, of course. Years ago. But she knew her herbs. Said chamomile was good for… calming the nerves. Which, frankly, I don’t need much help with. I've seen enough to calm anyone’s nerves. Flew through a typhoon once... That'll calm your nerves, I can tell you. So, glucosamine and chamomile. That's the extent of it. Don’t need any fancy pills. Just… a bit of comfort. Is this all going somewhere, doctor? Because I’m starting to feel a bit… foolish, discussing my bedtime tea with you.
DOCTOR: You’re not being foolish at all, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s important for me to know everything you’re taking, even herbal remedies, as they can sometimes interact with other treatments. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like colon cancer, stomach cancer, or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: Hmph. Family history… Well, my father, he… he died of a heart attack. Sudden, like that. Strong man, my father. Always worked hard. My mother, she had… I think it was diabetes. She was a bit frail, always complaining. And my sister, she had some trouble with her stomach once, but I don’t remember the details. Nothing serious, as far as I know. And that’s about it. Not a particularly long-lived family, to be honest. A lot of hard work and not much… longevity. No cancer, as far as I’m aware. Though, people didn’t talk about these things much back then. Just… accepted it when things happened. No fancy tests or treatments. Just… resignation. Is this helping, doctor? Because I’m still not sure what you’re getting at. Just a bit of red in my stool, hardly a reason for all this… interrogation.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart attack in your father, diabetes in your mother, and some stomach trouble in your sister. I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if it feels like an interrogation. I’m simply trying to gather all the pieces of the puzzle. Now, before we move on, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. That’s about it. And… oh. I had a bit of shrapnel removed from my leg during the war. Nothing serious, just a small piece. They patched me up and sent me back up. Didn’t even bother with a proper hospital, just a field medic. So, tonsils and a bit of shrapnel. That’s it. Not much call for surgery in my life, thankfully. I always prided myself on my health. Tough as nails, they used to say. Until now, of course. This… this is unsettling. A man of my age… worrying about his… output. It’s a bit undignified, isn't it? Frankly, I'm starting to feel rather foolish.
DOCTOR: You're not foolish at all, Mr. Rowbottom. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about any changes in your body, regardless of your age or previous health. And it's good that you’re taking this seriously. Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Hmph. Smoke? Good heavens, no! A pilot doesn't smoke. Never have. Never will. Ruins your lungs, you know. And alcohol… I used to have a drink now and then, a glass of sherry with dinner. But I stopped years ago. Didn’t agree with my stomach. And recreational drugs? Are you serious? I flew planes during a war! I didn’t need any… artificial enhancements. No, never touched a single one. Perfectly clean living, always have. A man has to be responsible, especially a man who’s responsible for the lives of others. So, no smoking, no drugs, and very little alcohol. That's my story. And frankly, doctor, I'm starting to wonder what you're fishing for. This bit of red in my stool...it doesn't seem to require a full life history, does it?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Rowbottom. I apologize if it feels like a long line of questioning. I'm gathering all the information to understand the potential causes of the blood in your stool, and your lifestyle is an important part of that. Okay. Now that I have a better understanding of your medical history, I would like to perform a quick physical exam, if you are comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your pulse, and a brief rectal exam. This will help me assess the situation and determine the next steps. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. A rectal exam, you say? Honestly, doctor. At my age? It’s a bit… invasive, isn’t it? But… I suppose if you think it’s necessary. I’ve always prided myself on being a practical man. If it’ll get to the bottom of this… quite literally… then alright. Do what you have to do. But be gentle, mind you. Very gentle. And don't poke around too much. I've had enough poking and prodding in my life. Let's get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can go home and… remember things. Though, truthfully, I’m not sure I want to remember much right now. Go ahead. But be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. I’ll explain each step as I go. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. Okay, I'm just listening to your abdomen now. I'm not hearing anything unusual at this point… just normal bowel sounds. Your pulse is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety… or just the fact that you're here at the doctor's office. Now, I’m going to perform a brief rectal exam. I'll be using lubrication and a gloved, covered finger to gently check for any abnormalities. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should be quick. Please take a deep breath and relax as much as possible. Let me know if you feel any pain. Okay, I'm finished. I didn’t feel any obvious masses or tenderness, but I did note some… bright red blood on the glove. It doesn't appear to be a large amount, but it confirms what you told me. Your anal sphincter tone is normal. There are no signs of external hemorrhoids.
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, that wasn’t pleasant. But… I suppose it had to be done. Blood on the glove, you say? Not a surprise, really. I told you I saw it myself. So, what does it mean, doctor? Is it serious? Am I… dying? Don’t tell me it's cancer, though. My sister… she had trouble with her stomach… I don’t want to end up like her. Just tell me straight. What am I looking at here? And don’t give me a lot of medical jargon, either. I’m an old man, not a doctor. Just… the truth. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your concern, and it’s perfectly natural to be worried. I want to assure you that bright red blood in the stool doesn’t automatically mean cancer. There are several possible causes, and most of them are not life-threatening. The most common causes include hemorrhoids – which we didn't find evidence of externally, but can be internal – anal fissures , or diverticulosis – small pouches that can form in the lining of the colon. Less common causes include inflammatory bowel disease or, less frequently, colon polyps or cancer. Because you’re 88, and this is a new symptom, it's important to investigate further to rule out anything serious. I recommend a colonoscopy to visualize the entire colon and identify the source of the bleeding. This will allow us to determine the exact cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan. It's the gold standard for diagnosing the cause of rectal bleeding. I know you’re hesitant about a colonoscopy, and I understand that. However, it’s the best way to get a definitive diagnosis and ensure your peace of mind. We can discuss the preparation process and address any concerns you may have. We can also talk about alternative tests, such as a fecal immunochemical test which checks for blood in your stool, but a colonoscopy is more thorough. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmph. A colonoscopy… You keep coming back to that. I don't like the sound of it. Sounds… invasive. And unpleasant. I’m an old man, doctor. I’ve lived a long life. Do I really need to go through all that trouble just to find out what’s causing a bit of red in my stool? What about this FIT test? You mentioned it. Is that enough? Can't you just check my stool for blood? I don't want to be poked and prodded and… invaded. I've had enough of that in my life. Just tell me straight. Can I avoid the colonoscopy? Is it absolutely necessary? Or can we just check the stool and be done with it? I’m not sure I have the energy for all that… preparation. And frankly, I’m not sure I want to know what’s lurking inside me. It’s probably nothing, anyway. Just old age catching up.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your reluctance, and I want to respect your wishes as much as possible. You’ve lived a long life, and you’re right to question whether the benefits of a colonoscopy outweigh the risks and discomfort. The FIT test is an option, and it’s less invasive than a colonoscopy. It can detect the presence of blood in your stool, which would indicate the need for further investigation. However, it doesn't provide a visual examination of the entire colon, and it can sometimes miss polyps or other abnormalities. It's also a screening test and may not provide a definitive diagnosis. Because you're 88, a full colonoscopy may not be the most appropriate course of action. However, ignoring the bleeding is also not a good idea. A flexible sigmoidoscopy is a less invasive option than a full colonoscopy. It only examines the lower part of your colon, but can often identify the source of the bleeding. Here's what I propose. We can start with the FIT test. If it comes back negative, we can discuss observation and monitor your symptoms. If it comes back positive, we can discuss a flexible sigmoidoscopy. That's a less invasive procedure. That would give us more information without the extensive preparation of a full colonoscopy. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmph. A flexible sigmoidoscopy… that sounds… less dreadful. Only the lower part, you say? Alright. That… that I can consider. A FIT test first, then a sigmoidoscopy if necessary. That's… acceptable. But I want to be clear. If the sigmoidoscopy finds something… something serious… I don't want any aggressive treatments. I’m an old man, doctor. I’ve had a good life. I don’t want to spend my remaining years undergoing chemotherapy or surgery. I just want to know what’s going on, and I want to be comfortable. Can you promise me that? Can you promise me that if the sigmoidoscopy finds something serious, we won’t pursue aggressive treatments? I just want to be comfortable, doctor. That's all I ask. Can you promise me that?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I absolutely understand your wishes. And I promise you that we will always prioritize your quality of life and comfort. If the sigmoidoscopy reveals anything concerning, we will discuss all available options, including the potential risks and benefits of each. And I promise you that we will not pursue any aggressive treatments without your full understanding and consent. We will focus on managing your symptoms and ensuring your comfort, regardless of the findings. Your wishes are paramount. We can start with the FIT test today. I’ll give you the instructions, and you can collect the sample at home. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and the next steps. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Hmph. Yes. That… that sounds good. A FIT test. And then we’ll see. I suppose I can manage that. Alright. Give me the instructions. Let’s get it over with. The sooner I know what’s going on, the sooner I can… accept my fate. Though, truthfully, I’m not sure I want to know. But… better to face it, I suppose. Give me the instructions, doctor. And let’s get it over with. The sooner the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. Here are the instructions. It’s quite simple. Just follow these steps, and bring the sample back to the lab within a few days. The lab will notify us when the results are available. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as significant bleeding, dizziness, or weakness, please contact the office immediately. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Rowbottom. And remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. .
