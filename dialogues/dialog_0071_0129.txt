DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. It's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day, so let’s get right to it. It's my… well, my stool. It's black. And I take those pain pills, the ones for my arthritis, all the time. That’s what the young man at the pharmacy said could be the problem, anyway. He wasn’t a doctor, mind you, just a… counter person. But he seemed to know a thing or two.
DOCTOR: Alright, black stool... and you're taking pain medication for arthritis. Yes, that can sometimes cause changes. Just to be thorough, how long has your stool been black?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A couple of days, I suppose. Maybe three? It’s hard to say, really. I don’t spend my time analyzing my… output, if you get my meaning. It just looked different, and it worried me enough to come all the way out here. It's not like I enjoy wasting my time at the doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Dawnetta. No need to apologize. Three days is good to know. Has there been any change in the amount of stool you're passing?
PATIENT: No, not really. Same as always, I suppose. Look, are we getting anywhere with this or are we just going to sit here and discuss the… volume? Because honestly, I have a pot roast in the oven that needs tending to. My husband will be cross if it’s overdone.
DOCTOR: Point taken, Dawnetta. We'll get there. No blood in the stool, right?
PATIENT: Blood? Heavens no! I’d know if there was blood. I’m not completely oblivious, you know. It's just… dark. Like… coffee grounds. That’s what it looks like. And I told you, I'm on those pain pills. They’re strong. They have to be doing something.
DOCTOR: Coffee grounds, alright. And you’re taking pain medication regularly for arthritis... Let me just ask a few quick questions, then I'll want to do a brief exam, if that’s alright. Have you had any stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting lately?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke around? Fine. But be quick about it. And stomach pain… well, a little bit. Just the usual aches and pains that come with being old, mostly. I don’t go running marathons, if that’s what you’re asking. Nausea? No, I haven’t thrown up. I have a very strong stomach. Always have. It’s probably those pain pills, honestly. They upset everything, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be sure, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Honestly, doctor, do I look like I’ve lost weight? I haven’t been dieting, if that's what you’re hinting at. My husband makes a mean pot roast, and I enjoy a good slice of apple pie. I’m a practical woman, and I need my strength for… things. Besides, I'm a mechanic. I need fuel!
DOCTOR: A mechanic, that's wonderful! No, you don't look like you've been losing weight. Alright, Dawnetta, if you don’t mind, I’d like to listen to your stomach with my stethoscope, and just feel your abdomen. It'll only take a moment. Then we can discuss some possibilities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But if you find anything unpleasant, don’t tell me about it. I don't need to know the gory details of my insides. And be gentle, I bruise easily at my age. Honestly, poking and prodding… it's not my idea of a good time. Get it over with, then.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. Deep breaths, if you can. Okay. Your abdomen is soft, no obvious tenderness. Bowel sounds are present, though a little quiet. No masses felt. It doesn't seem to be anything immediately concerning, but the black stool, combined with the pain medication, does warrant some further investigation. I'd like to order a simple stool test – it checks for blood that isn't visible to the eye, and another to rule out infection. Also, I'll order a CBC – a complete blood count – just to see if you're anemic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More poking and prodding, I presume? Honestly, doctor, I came in here because I was worried, not to become a science experiment. Are you sure this is necessary? It’s probably just the pills. I’ve read things online… they say those things can cause all sorts of trouble. Fine, go ahead with your tests. But if it turns out to be nothing, I’m sending you the bill for my time. And my husband’s pot roast is getting cold.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Dawnetta. It could be the pills, and often is, but it's important to rule out anything more serious. These tests are fairly simple, and will give us more information. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and give you a container for the stool sample. We should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, if you notice any dizziness, weakness, or if the black stool becomes very watery, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Honestly, you’re scaring me now. Fine. Dizziness, weakness, black and watery… I'll remember. Though I can't promise I won't ignore it and just try to tough it out. I'm a practical woman, you know. And I’ve dealt with worse than a little bit of black stool. Just get it over with, then. The quicker I’m out of here, the better. And tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle. My veins aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll let the nurse know. She's very good. We'll get these tests done quickly, and I’ll call you as soon as the results are back. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. It's likely nothing serious. Do you have any questions for me before I call the nurse?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Honestly, I think you’ve poked and prodded enough for one day. Just get me out of here, so I can go tend to my pot roast. And tell the nurse… well, just tell her to be quick. That's all. I don’t want to be here all afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. I’ll get the nurse right away. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before we get the results. Have a good day… and I hope your pot roast turns out perfectly.
