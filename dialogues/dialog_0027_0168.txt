DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s… good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure, I suppose. Well, to be frank, I’m dating someone new and I thought it prudent to… get a check-up. One doesn’t want any surprises, you understand. It’s simply… responsible.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Very responsible of you. A good idea. Alright. Let's start with a little bit about your general health. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well? Yes, I suppose so. As well as one can be, considering. I maintain a very active social life, I eat… reasonably, and I certainly don’t cause any trouble. Though I have been a bit more fatigued lately, now that you mention it. Probably just the summer heat. It's rather oppressive, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: It is warm. Fatigue… okay. And has this fatigue been interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Interfering? Not precisely. It’s not as if I’m bedridden, Doctor. It just means I might… curtail an evening engagement or take an extra nap. I'm a woman who knows her limits, you see. One mustn’t overextend oneself. Though my book club was rather disappointed I missed last week's discussion on… well, it was a terribly dreary novel, truthfully. But still.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me see… well, my knees have been acting up a bit. Old sports injury, you know. Nothing a bit of topical ointment can’t handle. And I've been feeling… a little breathless occasionally. Though I attribute that to the humidity. It’s simply dreadful for one’s constitution. Honestly, this weather… it's enough to give anyone the vapors. Are you from around here, Doctor? It's always so sticky.
DOCTOR: I've been here a few years. Breathlessness… and is this breathlessness happening with activity, or at rest?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s mostly at rest, I think. Though sometimes after a particularly lively bridge game, I find myself… catching my breath. It’s hardly a cause for alarm, Doctor. I assure you. I maintain a very active mind, you see. All that strategizing… it's quite taxing. It’s more mental exhaustion than physical, I suspect. Though I did have a rather unsettling dream last night… but I doubt that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay. And… just to get a more complete picture, have you had any changes in your appetite, or any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Heavens, no! I have a perfectly healthy appetite, thank you very much. I enjoy my meals. And as for weight loss… I maintain a very respectable figure for a woman of my age, I assure you. Though my daughter keeps trying to get me to try one of those… juice cleanses. The very idea! Honestly, depriving oneself of a proper dinner… it’s barbaric. I simply won’t stand for it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a small dose of loratadine for the seasonal allergies, when the pollen count is particularly atrocious. And no allergies, thankfully. I’m rather fortunate in that regard. I find a good cup of herbal tea is usually sufficient for most minor ailments, to be honest. Though my sister swears by those… aromatherapy diffusers. Frankly, I find the scents rather overpowering. Give me a proper Earl Grey any day.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ms. Pandolfi, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic assessment. It'll help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. Though I must say, I detest being cold. Do you have a blanket, Doctor? And please, try not to use that… metal instrument on my chest for too long. It's rather unpleasant. And do be gentle. I have sensitive skin, you know. Honestly, doctors these days… not nearly as considerate as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as gentle as possible. And yes, we have a warmed blanket. I'll try to be quick. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I do hope you have a soft cuff. Those hard ones are simply dreadful. And try not to squeeze too tightly, Doctor. I bruise easily, you know. Honestly, one would think they could design a more comfortable apparatus by now. The things we endure for the sake of… health. It’s truly remarkable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is… 148 over 92. Pulse is 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. In and out…
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? I do try to breathe properly, you know. One must maintain good posture for proper lung capacity. Though all that summer pollen doesn't help matters, I assure you. It’s simply atrocious this year. Honestly, I think the world is going to ruin. It's simply dreadful. Now, are we quite finished with the… poking and prodding? I do have a luncheon engagement, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds… regular, but there are some slightly diminished breath sounds, particularly in the lower lobes. It’s subtle, but worth noting. I’d like to order a chest X-ray just to get a clearer picture of your lungs. And a basic blood workup to rule out anything else. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Good heavens. Is something dreadfully wrong, Doctor? I haven’t felt… ill, precisely. Just a little fatigued, as I mentioned. And the breathlessness. Is it… serious? Honestly, I don’t do well with medical procedures. They’re simply… unsettling. And blood work? All those needles… it’s barbaric, I tell you. Barbaric! Perhaps a strong cup of tea would suffice? It’s worked wonders for my sister in the past.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I understand your apprehension. We're not assuming anything is seriously wrong. The X-ray and blood work are simply precautionary measures, to get a better understanding of what might be causing your fatigue and breathlessness. It’s better to be thorough. The X-ray is very quick, and the blood draw is relatively painless. It'll give us a clearer picture. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: Explain it? Very well. But I expect a thorough explanation, Doctor. And please, no medical jargon. I haven’t the foggiest idea what “diminished breath sounds” even means. And I certainly don’t want to be subjected to any… frightening machinery. And I expect a gentle nurse to administer the blood draw. None of those… rough-handed technicians. Honestly, the things one has to endure… it’s simply appalling. And what exactly are you hoping to find with these tests, Doctor? Are you suspecting something… dreadful?
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, “diminished breath sounds” means I heard a slightly weaker sound when listening to your lungs. It could be caused by many things - a mild infection, some congestion, or even just the summer humidity. The tests will help us rule out anything more serious, like pneumonia or… other lung conditions. The X-ray is a quick image of your lungs, and the blood work will check for signs of infection or any other imbalances. It's a standard procedure. It doesn’t mean we suspect anything dreadful, it’s just… due diligence. We're taking all the necessary steps to ensure your health. Would you like me to write down the names of the facilities where you can get these tests done?
PATIENT: Well… if you put it that way. “Due diligence,” you say? Very well. But I insist on a full report afterward, Doctor. A detailed explanation of every single result. And I expect you to be available to answer any and all of my questions. I do not tolerate ambiguity. And if anything is amiss, I expect a prompt and thorough course of treatment. I have a very busy social calendar, you see. I cannot afford to be… incapacitated. And make sure the nurse is gentle. Absolutely gentle. Now, write down those facilities, Doctor. And please, clear handwriting. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Here you are. Both facilities are very close by. I've also included the phone numbers. And I assure you, I will be available to discuss the results with you in detail. And I'll make a note to ensure a gentle nurse is assigned for your blood draw. Once you have the results, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Hmm… very well. This is satisfactory. No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Though… perhaps a referral to a good dermatologist wouldn't go amiss. My skin has been rather dry lately. And I do believe I'm developing a small wrinkle on my forehead. One must maintain appearances, you see. Now, thank you for your time, Doctor. And please, do remember the gentle nurse. It's paramount.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. I’ll include a referral to a dermatologist with your discharge instructions. And I’ve made a very clear note about the gentle nurse. You have a good day now. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
