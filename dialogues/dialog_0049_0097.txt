DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, my husband, he insisted. He's been reading things online, you see, about…planning for things. He thinks I need one of those forms – an advance directive, or a POLST, I believe he called it? Frankly, I find it rather morbid to be discussing these matters at my age, but he is quite insistent.
DOCTOR: An advance directive or POLST… yes, well, your husband is… proactive. It is sensible to consider these things, even if it feels premature. Though, frankly, I see many patients who put this off until it's far too late. Let’s start with the basics then. Are you currently experiencing any health problems?
PATIENT: Health problems? No, not really. A little ache here and there, as one gets older, but nothing a good rest doesn't fix. I am a very healthy woman, Doctor. I assure you. I eat well, I exercise…well, I used to exercise more, but my schedule is rather full. It’s just…my husband worries excessively, that's all. He thinks a minor cough means I'm on death's door.
DOCTOR: I see. And what does your schedule consist of?
PATIENT: Well, I am a professor, you see. Foreign Languages and Literature. Very demanding, very stressful. I teach mostly French and Arabic. Grading papers, preparing lectures, dealing with…students. It’s a great deal of responsibility. And then, of course, there’s the social obligations. One must maintain appearances, you understand. It doesn’t leave a great deal of time for…self-care, unfortunately. Though I manage. I always manage.
DOCTOR: A professor… quite a rigorous profession. Do you find the stress impacts your sleep, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, everyone is stressed these days. It’s simply the way of the world. As for sleep…well, I’ve always been a light sleeper. And appetite? I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. Perhaps I drink a bit more tea than I should, to get through the evenings with the papers, but that's hardly a cause for alarm. Really, I don't see why my husband is making such a fuss. This is all rather unnecessary.
DOCTOR: While it's admirable that you manage well, even mild, chronic stress can have cumulative effects. And while tea isn’t inherently harmful, excessive caffeine intake can contribute to anxiety and sleep disturbances. Let’s move on. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. I’ve always been very careful with my health. A few childhood illnesses, measles, mumps…the usual things. But nothing serious. I pride myself on avoiding doctors, if I can. They always want to poke and prod and prescribe unnecessary medications. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. Honestly, I don’t see the point of dwelling on things that happened decades ago. It’s unproductive. Perhaps my husband mentioned something to you? He has a tendency to exaggerate.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh dear. That's a…complicated question. My mother lived to a good age, I suppose, though she was always a bit frail. My father…well, he passed away quite suddenly, a heart condition, I believe. But there’s very little history of…serious illness, really. A bit of high blood pressure on my aunt’s side, but nothing that concerns me directly. And truthfully, Doctor, I wasn't very close to either of them. It's rather difficult to recall details. I prefer to focus on the present, if you don't mind. This line of questioning is rather…depressing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's discuss your current medications, if any. Including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
PATIENT: Medications? As I said, Doctor, I take very little. Just a small cup of chamomile tea before bed, to help me relax. And occasionally, a pain reliever for a headache, if absolutely necessary. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. They’re full of chemicals, you know. I did try a vitamin D supplement last winter, but I couldn't remember to take it regularly, so I stopped. Honestly, I believe in a balanced diet and a good night’s sleep as the best medicine. My husband keeps suggesting all sorts of things – probiotics, omega-3s…nonsense, really. He reads too much online. .
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
