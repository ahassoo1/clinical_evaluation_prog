DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s these hiccups, you see. They just… won’t stop. Been going on for two days now, at least. It’s really getting to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, two days of hiccups. That is persistent. Let's try to figure out what might be going on. Can you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… normal hiccups, I guess. You know, that little jerk of the chest, and you have to breathe in quickly. Not painful, just… annoying. And they come and go, but they’re always there, even if it’s just a few every few minutes. I tried drinking water quickly, like everyone says, but that doesn’t do anything anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or anything that makes them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don't think so. I was gardening yesterday, a lot of bending over, but I garden all the time and it's never bothered me before. I had a spicy meal the night before, but I eat spicy food pretty regularly too. Honestly, they just started, out of nowhere. I was watching television, and then hic… and they haven’t really stopped since. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And are you having any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t? And maybe a bit gassy, but… well, I eat. It’s not different than usual, I don’t think. No fever, no pain anywhere, nothing like that. Just the hiccups. It’s driving me a little crazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's go through a bit of your medical history then. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m pretty healthy, actually. A little overweight, maybe, but nothing a doctor has ever really bothered with. I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was in my thirties, but that was all. And I get my yearly check-up, but everything is always fine. I don’t take any regular medication either.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And family history – any major illnesses run in your family?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had problems with his stomach, but I don't know exactly what. They weren’t big on doctors, you see. Kept things to themselves. Nothing that I’m worried about inheriting, I don’t think. Just… normal old age stuff, mostly. They both lived long lives.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to worry about bee stings, but I haven’t been stung since I was a child. So, no, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your abdomen. If you could just lie down for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I always get a bit nervous with doctors, you see. Not that I don't trust you, it's just… I don’t like feeling helpless.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Redeye. We’re just checking everything out to make sure there's nothing obvious going on. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Anything here tender?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. Just… feels normal, I guess. A little squishy, maybe? I told you, a little overweight. But no pain at all. Not even when you press here, or here, or anywhere. It's just… hiccups. Annoying, persistent hiccups.
DOCTOR: Okay. Everything feels normal to palpation, no masses or tenderness. Given your history and the exam, it’s likely these are just benign, persistent hiccups. Sometimes they just happen, and they can be frustratingly difficult to get rid of. However, since they’ve been going on for two days, and haven’t responded to simple remedies, I'd like to order a chest x-ray to rule out anything more serious, just to be safe. And a basic blood work panel to check your electrolyte levels. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we want to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I’d rather be safe than sorry, I suppose. Chest x-ray and blood work… I haven’t had those done in years. Do I need to do anything special to prepare? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a friend coming to visit next week, and I'd like to be… functional by then.
DOCTOR: Good. No special preparation for the blood work, just drink plenty of water beforehand. The x-ray doesn't require anything either. The lab should be able to get the blood work results back within 24-48 hours, and the x-ray results usually take a little longer, maybe 3-5 business days. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the x-ray for you now. In the meantime, continue to try the water-drinking technique, although I understand you've already tried that. If they become severe – if you have trouble breathing, or experience chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we’ll get these results back and see what the next steps are. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… hopefully, it's nothing serious. I really don’t want to be stuck in a hospital. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very reassuring. And the nurse will handle everything with the blood work and x-ray? I’m not very good with… procedures, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will take care of everything. She'll explain the blood work process and schedule the x-ray for you. Just let her know if you're feeling anxious and she can help make you more comfortable. It's perfectly normal to be nervous, Ms. Redeye. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have her come in now. "Nurse, could you please come in for a moment?
