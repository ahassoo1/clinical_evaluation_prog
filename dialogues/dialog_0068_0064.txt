DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I'm Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, well… my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, you know? But it’s… a pain. Like… a squeezing, sometimes. It scared me a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. A squeezing pain in your chest. And it’s not constant?
PATIENT: No, not always. Maybe… a few times a day? It comes and goes. It’s hard to say exactly. Sometimes when I walk up the hill to the bus stop, it feels worse. And… last night, when I was washing dishes, it happened then too. But when I sit down and rest, it gets better. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. So, it seems to be brought on by exertion...walking, doing dishes. And relieved with rest. How long has this been going on, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three weeks ago? At first, it was just a little ache. I didn’t think much of it. But it’s been getting stronger, you know? That’s why I came. I don’t want to ignore it. My husband, he said I should come see a doctor. He worries too much, but… he means well.
DOCTOR: Three weeks. And has the pain changed at all in those three weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. At first, like I said, just a little ache. Now… it feels heavier, more like a pressure. And it lasts longer when it happens. Before, it was just a few seconds. Now… maybe five, ten minutes sometimes. It doesn't go all the way through to my back, if that makes sense. Just in the front of my chest. And sometimes… my left arm feels a little… tingly. Not always, but a few times.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tingly in your left arm… and a pressure in the chest that lasts longer now. I’m going to ask you a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Do you have any trouble breathing when this happens, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: No, not really trouble breathing. It feels like… I don't want to say scared, but… I get a little short of breath, like I’ve been running. But I can still breathe. It’s just… not easy. And I get a little sweaty, too, when the pain is bad. I didn’t tell my husband that part, he would worry so much.
DOCTOR: Sweaty, a little short of breath… Alright. Do you have any other symptoms at all – nausea, dizziness, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness. And I haven't been feeling sick to my stomach. Just the pain, the feeling short of breath, and the… tingling. And the sweating, but only when the pain is really bad. I do get tired easier, I think. But I am older, you know? Maybe that’s just… old age catching up with me! I used to walk everywhere, but now I get winded faster.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. The doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, so he gave me a pill. I took it for a while, but he said it was okay to stop if it stayed good. And… my mother, she had problems with her heart, I think. But I don’t remember exactly what. She’s gone now. I’ve never been told I have sugar problems, and I try to eat healthy, you know? Not too much salt, lots of vegetables. But… I do love my empanadas!
DOCTOR: Alright. A history of slightly elevated blood pressure, and a mother with heart problems. Do you take any other medications currently, besides that blood pressure pill you stopped taking?
PATIENT: No, just a vitamin every morning. My daughter, she sends them to me. She worries about me too, always making sure I take my pills and eat right. I haven't had any surgeries, either. Never needed them, thank goodness. Oh! And I have Medicare. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Medicare is good to know, thank you. No surgeries, just the vitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully! I used to have a little trouble with pollen, sneezing a lot in the spring, but that doesn't bother me much anymore. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine, not that I remember. My husband… he's allergic to shellfish, but that’s him, not me!
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Ms. Chelberg. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and pulse, if that’s alright. It would be helpful to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I am a little nervous, but… I want to know what’s happening. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit back and relax. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Blood pressure is a little elevated – 145 over 90. Pulse is regular, 88. I’m also going to feel your ankles to check for any swelling. No significant swelling. I don’t see anything alarming right now, but based on your symptoms and your blood pressure, I want to order some tests. An EKG to check your heart rhythm, and some blood work, including a check of your cholesterol and a cardiac enzyme level to rule out any heart damage. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think. An EKG and blood work… okay. Is that going to hurt? I don't like needles very much, but I'll do it if I have to. What will the tests show? Will I know right away? I just want to feel better soon, you know?
DOCTOR: The EKG is completely painless, Ms. Chelberg. It just involves placing some stickers on your chest. The blood work will involve a small prick, yes, but it’s quick. We’ll send the samples to the lab, and the results usually come back within a day or two. I’ll review them as soon as they are available and we can discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I also want to gently recommend, until we have the results, to avoid strenuous activity. Light walking is fine, but no climbing hills or heavy lifting. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. No hills, no heavy lifting. I can do that. Stickers are okay, and a little prick… okay, I can handle that. I'll watch for the bad symptoms, too. A day or two for the results… okay. And you'll call me when you know something? My daughter… she can drive me if I need to go to the emergency room. She worries too much, but… I am glad she's there. Thank you, Doctor Sham. I feel a little better now, just knowing what’s going to happen.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, I will call you as soon as the results are available, Ms. Chelberg. And it's good you have a supportive daughter. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and perform the EKG. Do you have any other questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. You explained everything very well. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’ve been worrying about this for a while, you know? So thank you. I will see you when you have the results.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chelberg. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a bit. We'll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if anything changes. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon.
