DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's just for my shots, really. Routine stuff. My husband always reminds me to keep on top of 'em, you know? He's a good man.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful that you have someone looking out for you. Keeping up with vaccinations is very important. Just to confirm, you’re here for your routine immunizations today?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Routine ones. I don't really know which ones, to be honest. Whatever I'm due for, I guess? I haven't kept track this year. It's all a bit of a blur, with everything going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. We can definitely figure out what you’re due for. Before we get started, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm, medical history... let me think. I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I had chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else, and broke my wrist once falling off a horse, ages ago. Nothing major, though. No big illnesses or anything. I don't really go to the doctor much unless I have to, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you've been healthy. And it’s always better to prevent things when you can. Okay, so chickenpox as a child, a broken wrist... any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never had any of those. Just the broken wrist, and they just set it in a cast. A big ol’ plaster cast, it was. Took a while to heal, but it’s good as new now. I’ve been lucky, really. Mostly just aches and pains from working, but nothing a good night's sleep can't fix. I do a lot of inspecting, you see - lots of bending and climbing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any significant family medical history that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tough one. My mom, she had… well, she had some heart trouble later in life. And my dad, he had diabetes. But honestly, it was a long time ago, and we didn’t really talk about it much. Lots of folks in my family just… well, they didn’t live super long lives, if you know what I mean. It wasn’t always easy, and we didn’t have the best access to doctors growing up, so there wasn’t a lot of talking about prevention. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It’s common for those details to be less clear. Heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your father – I’ll make a note of that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Not really. Just ibuprofen sometimes, for my back if I've been on a tough job site. And maybe a multivitamin now and then, but I’m terrible at remembering to take it regularly. Nothing prescribed, though. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can help it. I prefer a good cup of tea for what ails ya, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen as needed and occasional multivitamins. Good to know. And tea is a wonderful remedy! Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully! And I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine before, as far as I remember. My husband always asks when I take something new, just to be safe, but I’ve never had an issue. I've been pretty lucky in that department too, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies is good to hear. Now, just to get a good overall picture, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. Well, I work a lot! Construction and building inspection keeps me pretty busy. Lots of being outdoors, climbing around. It's physical work, for sure. I try to eat reasonably well, mostly home-cooked meals. My husband's a good cook. I don't smoke, and I don't drink much anymore, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion. I used to drink a bit more, but I slowed down. Not much time for fancy hobbies, to be honest. Mostly just relaxing with my husband and spending time with family when we can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good idea. Active job, mostly healthy diet, limited alcohol. Now, before we move on to the vaccinations, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yep, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m used to folks poking and prodding me on job sites, so this shouldn't be too bad! Just let me know if it's gonna be cold, 'cause I get chilly easy.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll make sure you're comfortable. I’ll start by checking your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and briefly examine your abdomen. It shouldn't take long. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear. Nose is clear, no congestion. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Everything sounds and looks good so far. Now, based on your age and medical history, you are due for a Tdap booster, a flu vaccine, and a pneumococcal vaccine. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds like a lot of shots! But if you think I need 'em, I guess I do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I don’t really like needles, if you know what I mean. What do they do, exactly? Are they gonna hurt a lot? And what are they for? Pneumo… whatever, that one sounds scary.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. Needles aren't fun for anyone. Let’s go through them one by one. The Tdap booster protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis - whooping cough. It’s important to keep that up-to-date, as these are serious illnesses. The flu vaccine protects against the influenza virus, which can cause a bad illness and even complications, especially in older adults. And the pneumococcal vaccine protects against pneumococcal disease, which can cause pneumonia, meningitis, and ear infections. It’s recommended for adults over 65, but it’s also a good idea for people with certain medical conditions or a weakened immune system. As for pain, they'll feel like a small pinch, and it's usually over very quickly. We can also use a topical anesthetic to numb the area beforehand if you’d like. We can also stagger them, if you prefer, doing one or two today and the rest at a later appointment. What feels most comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes a little more sense when you explain it like that. Pneumonia… that does sound scary. My grandma had that, and it wasn’t pretty. Staggering them sounds… really good, actually. Doing all three at once… that sounds awful. Maybe two today, if you think that's alright? And could we definitely do the numbing stuff? Even just a little bit, to take the edge off? I don’t want to faint or anything. I’ve never been good with needles.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Two today sounds perfectly reasonable, and we will definitely use a topical anesthetic to numb the area. We want to make this as comfortable as possible for you. It's a small cream we apply a few minutes before the injection. It won't completely eliminate the feeling, but it will significantly reduce it. Let’s start with the Tdap booster and the flu vaccine today. I'll apply this cream now, and then we can get started. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. The cream sounds good. And thanks for being patient with me, Doctor. I appreciate it. I just… I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to stuff like this. Alright, let’s get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: You have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. Many people feel the same way. It's perfectly normal to be a little apprehensive. We'll take our time, and I'll let you know exactly what I'm doing every step of the way. Alright, it’s starting to numb the area. I'm going to clean the skin with an alcohol swab now. This will just help prevent infection. Now, I’m going to administer the Tdap booster. It will feel like a small pinch for a few seconds. Deep breath in… and out. There, all done! How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Ooh! That did pinch a bit, but it wasn't awful. It's… mostly just a weird feeling now. A little sore, maybe? It's over, though, right? One down, one to go? Maybe if I look away, it won’t be so bad this time.
DOCTOR: Yes, one down, one to go! And you handled that perfectly. It really wasn't bad at all. Now for the flu vaccine. It’s also given in the upper arm, in a slightly different spot. Again, it will feel like a small pinch, and it's over very quickly. Take a deep breath in… and out. There! All done. And that’s it. You did wonderfully. Everything looks good. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Ooh, that one wasn’t so bad either. Just a little sting, really. It's… kind of a relief it’s over, honestly. So, I’m done? Really done? I don’t have to come back for anything else today? I think I deserve a cup of tea now. And maybe a cookie.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely done! You conquered your fear, and you're all vaccinated for the season. That’s a huge accomplishment! And yes, you absolutely deserve a cup of tea and a cookie. In fact, you deserve the whole bakery! I'll give you a printout with details about the vaccinations, including potential side effects and when to seek medical attention. Mostly, you might experience a little soreness at the injection sites, which should go away in a day or two. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You were very patient with me, and you explained everything so well. I really appreciate it. I’ll make sure my husband knows I got my shots, and he’ll be very happy. He’s always nagging me about these things! Have a good day, Doctor. And thanks again.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Fornes. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, if you experience any concerning side effects, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And please, tell your husband I said hello. It sounds like he’s a wonderful man. Have a wonderful day, and take care of yourself. .
