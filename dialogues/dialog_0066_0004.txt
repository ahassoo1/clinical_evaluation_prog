DOCTOR: Hi Teah, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Dr. Condray, it's nice to meet you too. Well, it's just a routine visit, really. Gotta keep up with my shots, you know? My husband reminded me it was time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that's very responsible of both of you. Staying on top of vaccinations is important. Just to be sure I have everything correct, I see here your name is Teah Fornes and you’re 53 years old?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Teah Fornes, and yep, 53. Feels older some days, but not today!
DOCTOR: Well, that’s good to hear! Okay, and just to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about any medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, really. I had pretty bad arthritis in my knees for a while, but it's been okay for the last few years. Mostly just aches and pains when the weather changes. And I’ve always had high blood pressure, but I don't take anything for it right now. It usually stays okay if I watch my salt. Oh, and I had the flu pretty bad a couple winters ago, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, arthritis in your knees, generally well-controlled, high blood pressure that you manage with diet, and a bout of the flu a couple of years ago. Do you mind if I ask about any surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Let's see… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago! And I had a C-section with my daughter, but that was… oh, goodness, almost forty years ago now. Nothing since then.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child and a C-section almost forty years ago. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mom, she had diabetes, type 2, I think. And her mother… well, she had heart trouble, I remember that. My dad… he was pretty healthy, actually, for most of his life. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so diabetes in your mother and heart trouble in your grandmother. That’s good information. And how about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, huh? Well, I’m mostly retired now, so I don’t do much heavy lifting anymore. I like to get out and walk when the weather's nice, and I do a little bit of gardening. I’m married, been with my husband for… oh, goodness, over thirty years now. We eat pretty healthy, mostly. I try to, anyway.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Staying active and having a good support system is really important. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of! I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat all sorts of things. My husband's a fisherman, so we eat a lot of fish, and I’ve never had any trouble with that, and I take vitamins sometimes, no problems there either. Nope, can’t think of anything.
DOCTOR: Good to hear! No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Like I said, just vitamins sometimes. Usually a multivitamin, nothing special. And I take ibuprofen now and then for my knees when they act up, but that’s about it. Not every day, just when I need it. Oh! And I use a medicated cream for a little patch of eczema on my arm, but it's not something I use all the time. Just when it flares up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin occasionally, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and a medicated cream for eczema. Now, to get a better picture of things, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go right ahead. I’m pretty sure everything’s alright, but I don’t mind getting checked.
DOCTOR: Perfect. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll also feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Just a routine check. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Tympanic membranes are normal bilaterally. Nasal mucosa is clear. Throat is clear without erythema or exudate. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds are normal. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Everything sounds and feels good so far. What about your weight?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That's good to hear! I try to stay active, so that’s nice to know. My weight... well, it fluctuates a bit. I think last time I checked, I was around 114 pounds, give or take a few. I’m not really one to worry about it too much, as long as my clothes still fit!
DOCTOR: Okay, around 114 pounds. That's good to know. So, to recap, you're here for a routine check, you’ve had arthritis and high blood pressure in the past, and you manage those well with lifestyle changes. Family history of diabetes and heart trouble, no known allergies, and you take vitamins occasionally. Your physical exam was normal, and your weight is around 114 pounds. Do you have any concerns or questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Nope, I think you’ve got everything. You've been very thorough, Dr. Condray. I appreciate that. I guess... just tell me about what shots I need today? What are we looking at?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s see… according to your records, it's been over ten years since your last tetanus booster, so we’ll definitely want to update that. We should also get you a flu shot, since it’s almost that time of year. And, since you’re over 50, have you had a pneumonia vaccine?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness, ten years already? Time flies! I think... I think my husband and I got pneumonia shots a few years ago, but I can't remember for sure. He usually keeps track of that sort of thing… maybe we should just get me another one to be safe? I wouldn’t want to get sick, especially in the winter.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible idea. Getting another pneumonia vaccine is a good precaution, even if you're unsure. There are two types, Pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine and Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine . It looks like you haven’t had PCV13. We can give you that today, along with the tetanus booster and the flu shot. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… complicated! PCV13… PPSV23… I guess I just trust your judgement, Dr. Condray. If you think that's what I need, then that's fine with me. As long as it keeps me healthy. Let’s do it. Just try not to give me too many pokes at once!
DOCTOR: Certainly! We can spread them out if you’d prefer. We’ll start with the tetanus booster and the PCV13 today, and we can schedule you for the flu shot in a few weeks. That way, your body won’t be overwhelmed with too many vaccines at once. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds much better. Spreading them out is a good idea. Okay, tetanus and PCV13 today… and flu shot later. You're very thoughtful, Dr. Condray. Let's get it over with! I’m a tough old bird, I’ve had worse.
DOCTOR: Wonderful! Okay, this might feel like a little pinch, but it shouldn't last long. I'll start with the tetanus booster, then the PCV13. All done! Here are some bandages, and I'll give you written instructions on possible side effects. Mostly, you might experience some soreness at the injection sites and perhaps a mild fever. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to call the clinic. We’ll schedule your flu shot for a few weeks from now. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you so much, Dr. Condray. That wasn’t so bad. A little pinch, just like you said! And yes, I think I understand everything. Soreness and maybe a little fever… I can handle that. I think… no, I don’t have any other questions right now. I really appreciate you taking your time with me, and for explaining everything so clearly. It was a very good visit. Thank you again!
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Teah. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. And enjoy the rest of your day!
