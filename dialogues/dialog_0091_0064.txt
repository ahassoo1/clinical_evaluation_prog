DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay to call you Talen? It is nice to meet you too. I have… a pain in my chest. It started a few days ago, maybe four? Not a bad pain always, but it comes and goes. Like… a squeezing.
DOCTOR: Please, do call me Talen. And thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Chelberg. A squeezing chest pain that started about four days ago. I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Okay, Talen. Thank you. Hmm… when I walk, sometimes it gets worse. Not always when I walk, just… if I walk fast. Or up hill. When I sit and rest? It gets better. Usually goes away quick. I was making dinner last night and it happened then, too. Lifting things, maybe? I don’t know. It scares me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Chelberg, and it’s good you’re taking it seriously. Chest pain is always something we need to investigate thoroughly. So, to clarify, the pain is brought on by exertion – walking quickly or uphill – and relieved with rest. You also experienced it while lifting things last night. Could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Exertion… that’s a good word! And yes, resting helps. It goes away… not right away, but maybe in five, ten minutes? The pain… it’s hard to say. Not a sharp pain, not like when I fall. It’s… heavy. Like someone is sitting on my chest. And… a little tight. Like a band around me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Chelberg. “Heavy” and “tight,” like a band around your chest. And it occurs with exertion and subsides with rest, taking about five to ten minutes to resolve. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if the pain radiates anywhere – does it travel to your arm, neck, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No, not my neck. Not my jaw. Sometimes… sometimes I feel it in my left arm, but not always. Just a little… a little achy. Like when I work too hard in the garden. It’s not a bad ache, not like the pain in my chest. It just… feels tired. And sometimes… my back feels a little sore, between my shoulder blades. But I get sore backs all the time, you know? Old lady problems.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Chelberg. It’s good you’re so observant of your body. So, the pain primarily in your chest, but occasionally accompanied by a mild ache in your left arm and some soreness between your shoulder blades. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Yes… sometimes I get a little… breathless. Not when I’m walking, not when I’m just sitting. But… after the pain goes away, sometimes I feel like I can’t get enough air. Just for a few minutes. And… I’ve been a little tired lately, but I thought that was just the heat. It’s been very hot, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, the heat has been quite oppressive. So, occasional shortness of breath after the chest pain resolves, and some fatigue. Ms. Chelberg, given your symptoms – the chest pain brought on by exertion, radiating to your arm, accompanied by shortness of breath and fatigue – I'd like to perform a physical exam and order some tests to rule out any serious underlying causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor Talen. Tests… okay. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what is happening, you know? I don't want it to be… something bad. I'm a little scared.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Ms. Chelberg, and that's perfectly reasonable. We're going to take things one step at a time and get to the bottom of this. It’s good you’re here, and we will investigate thoroughly. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and I’ll feel your pulse. Then, we'll talk about a few tests. Your heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but there’s some mild wheezing on expiration. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 88 and regular. I’ll also palpate your chest wall. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little… if you push right there. But that's just from the garden, I think. I was pulling weeds yesterday, and I bent over a lot. It's sore all over my back, too.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. Some tenderness consistent with muscle strain. Now, Ms. Chelberg, based on your symptoms and the initial exam, I'm concerned about the possibility of angina, which is chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart. However, other conditions could also be causing your symptoms, so we need to investigate further. I'd like to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart, and some blood work, including cardiac enzymes, to see if there’s any damage to your heart muscle. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: EKG… X-ray… blood work… yes, okay. Sounds… a lot, but if you think it's best, then yes. I trust you, Doctor Talen. I just… want to know what’s wrong. Can I still make dinner tonight? My husband, Ricardo, he likes my empanadas.
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you to say, Ms. Chelberg. And yes, it is a lot, but it's important to get a clear picture. Regarding dinner, I would advise against any strenuous activity tonight, including making empanadas. It's best to rest and avoid exertion until we have the results of the tests. We want to minimize any stress on your heart. Perhaps Ricardo could help with the preparation?
PATIENT: Yes… Ricardo can help. He’s a good cook, actually. Better than me, sometimes! But he likes to watch me make them. It’s… a tradition. Okay, no making dinner. Resting. I can do that. What happens after the tests? How long will it take to get the results? And… what if it is something bad?
DOCTOR: That’s lovely about the tradition, Ms. Chelberg. And Ricardo is a lucky man! Regarding the results, the EKG results will be available almost immediately. The blood work will take a few hours, and the X-ray results typically come back within a day. If the tests reveal any abnormalities, we’ll discuss the findings in detail and determine the best course of action. This could involve medication, lifestyle changes, or a referral to a cardiologist – a heart specialist – for further evaluation. We will cross that bridge when we come to it, and I will explain everything clearly. I want you to know that we have many options available, and we’ll work together to ensure you receive the best possible care. For now, let's get those tests ordered. I'll have a nurse come in and take your blood pressure again and get you set up. Would you like any water before we proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, water would be nice, thank you. A cardiologist… that sounds serious. But you said we will work together. I like that. I don't want to be alone if it is something bad. Ricardo… he gets very worried.
DOCTOR: You won’t be alone, Ms. Chelberg. Absolutely not. We’ll navigate this together, every step of the way. And I understand your concern for Ricardo. We can certainly involve him in the discussion and ensure he feels informed and supported as well. Let me just finish documenting these notes, and then I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood and get you set up for the EKG and X-ray. The nurse will explain the procedures in detail, so you know exactly what to expect. Just one moment, please. I'll get the nurse right away.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor Talen. You are very kind. I hope Ricardo brought his good book. This might be a long afternoon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. And I hope Ricardo did bring his book! It’s always good to have a distraction. I'll just step out and get the nurse. She’ll be in shortly to get started. Please don't hesitate to call out if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: .
