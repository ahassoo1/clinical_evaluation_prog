DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning. I… need shots, I think? For travel. My wife, she always did the planning. Now… now I just gotta go. To… somewhere. Nepal, maybe? It’s all a bit fuzzy. It’s important though. Very important.
DOCTOR: "Shots for travel," alright. And you’re unsure of the destination?
PATIENT: Yeah, unsure. Like I said, my wife… she handled everything. I just… went. She booked it, told me when to be where, what papers I needed. Now… I got a ticket. Says Kathmandu. Is that… Nepal? It sounds Nepal-ish. I don’t really know know. Does it matter what I know? I just need what I need to go.
DOCTOR: Kathmandu is the capital of Nepal, yes. It absolutely matters what you need, Mr. Tayar. Travel vaccinations are very specific to the region you’re visiting. Do you have a date for your departure?
PATIENT: Departure… uh… Let me see… August 15th. Yeah, August 15th. Two weeks. Not much time, is it? Is that bad? I thought… you just got shots and went.
DOCTOR: Two weeks can be tight, depending on what’s required. Some vaccinations need to be started weeks in advance to be effective. And it's not a simple "get shots and go," Mr. Tayar. There are risks associated with travel, and we need to minimize those. Have you traveled internationally before?
PATIENT: Yeah, lots. With… with her. Everywhere. Asia, Africa, South America. Always with her. She… she knew everything. What shots, what pills, what to eat, what not to eat. I just followed. Never had to think about it. Is this gonna be hard? I just want to… honor her memory, you know? Go where we planned.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand you're grieving and want to fulfill a promise. However, your health and safety are my primary concern. I need a comprehensive understanding of your medical history to determine the appropriate course of action. Let’s start with this: do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… not that I know of. She always asked, wrote it down… but I never had a reaction. Maybe a bit of a stomach upset once or twice? But that was usually the food. Not the pills. I really don't remember. Sorry. She did all that. Is this important? Can’t you just give me… something for everything?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Tayar. A severe allergic reaction to a vaccine can be life-threatening. "Something for everything" isn’t a responsible approach to medical care. We need to be precise. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospital… Um… maybe? Once, a long time ago. In Bangkok. Something with… food poisoning, I think? Really bad stomach. I was sick for days. She… she took care of everything. Doctors, nurses, the whole thing. I mostly just… lay there. It was years ago. I don’t remember much. It wasn’t serious, right? She wouldn't take me somewhere if it was serious.
DOCTOR: We'll need to verify that, Mr. Tayar. Do you happen to know the name of the hospital or the doctor who treated you?
PATIENT: No, no. Absolutely not. She handled everything. I didn’t even ask. I trusted her. She spoke the language, knew the doctors… I just… rested. It was a nice hotel, though. With a pool. I just… want to get this done. Is there a way to skip this part? I’m starting to feel anxious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your anxiety, but I cannot proceed without a reasonably complete medical history. It’s unethical and potentially dangerous. We’re not simply cataloging your past vacations; we’re assessing your risk factors for travel-related illnesses. Do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Look, I just need shots, okay? I'm a grown man. I've been all over the world. She always gave me pills before and during. For everything! Upset stomach, sleeping, mosquito bites… I don’t remember what they were! Little white ones, maybe? Some blue ones? This is ridiculous! Is this going to take all day? I’m wasting time!
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, with all due respect, your lack of medical information is concerning. Given the limited time before your departure and your inability to provide a medical history, I cannot responsibly administer travel vaccinations at this time. I recommend you consult with a travel medicine specialist who can conduct a thorough evaluation and determine the appropriate course of action. I can provide you with a referral. I also suggest postponing your trip until you can be properly prepared. I’m documenting this encounter and my concerns regarding your readiness for international travel. .
