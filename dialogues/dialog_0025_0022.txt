DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. I’m Dr. Fourney. Now, you're 90 years young, which is wonderful. But tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, ninety… feels like a long time! Hmm… what brings me in… well, my tummy feels… puffy. And I don’t feel like eating much anymore. Not like I used to. Everything just… sits heavy, you know? It’s been a little while now, maybe a few weeks? I can’t really say for sure. Time gets away from me.
DOCTOR: Puffy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, puffy. Like… full of air, almost. Not painful, just… there. And big. I used to have a flat tummy, you know? Not anymore. It’s just… different now. It makes me tired, I think. Not wanting to eat and feeling… big.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, not painful, just a feeling of fullness and bloating. And this has been going on for a few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Maybe longer? It’s hard to remember exactly when it started. Everything blurs together after a while, you know? I just noticed it getting worse. I used to be able to eat a good plate of… well, I don’t even remember what I used to eat! Old age, Doctor. It’s a terrible thing.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll figure it out. Now, besides the fullness and loss of appetite, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm… let me think. I do feel a little… weak sometimes. Not all the time, but… like I haven’t got much energy. And… oh! I go to the bathroom more often, maybe? Yes, that’s it. More often. But not… a lot at a time, just more times during the day. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. So, some weakness and increased frequency of urination. Have you had any nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Nausea… no, I don’t think so. Not really. Sometimes I feel a little queasy, but that’s probably just… old age again! Vomiting? No, no, haven’t done that in a long time. And… diarrhea? What’s that again? Oh… going to the bathroom… quickly? No, not that. Everything is… slow, mostly. Very slow.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? Oh! Pooping? Yes… well, it’s not as regular as it used to be. Sometimes I go, sometimes I don't. It's… hard to explain. It's not… much. And sometimes it’s… difficult. You know? I need to… push. It’s not a big problem, but it’s… different. Like everything else. Is this… important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Soila, it is important. We need to know everything. So, you’re saying your bowel movements are less frequent, and you have to strain to go. Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh dear. I… I don’t think so. I haven’t… looked. I don’t really want to look, you know? It’s not a nice thing to look at. But I don’t remember seeing anything. Maybe? It’s been a while since I… checked. I’m sorry, Doctor. I’m not very helpful, am I? I just get confused.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Oh, yes. I think so. My clothes feel… looser. I haven't weighed myself in… well, I don't even remember the last time! I just assumed it was… getting older. Everything shrinks, you know? But yes, I think I've lost some weight. It doesn't bother me, really. Less to carry, I suppose. But… maybe it’s not a good thing? I don't know anymore. Everything feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: So, you’ve lost weight, feel weak, have increased urination, and your stomach feels full and bloated. And you haven’t been eating much. Now, have you had any medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds like a lot when you say it all together! Medical problems… hmm. I had my tonsils out when I was little. And… I think I had the flu a few times. Nothing serious, really. Old age is my biggest problem, Doctor! No, I don’t think I’ve had anything… major. I used to see a doctor when my husband was alive, but that was… a long time ago. I can't remember what he said about anything. It’s all very hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries other than your tonsils?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm… Let me think. No, I don't think so. Just my tonsils. And… maybe a stitch or two when I was a little girl, but that was a long, long time ago. Nothing important. My husband always took care of everything when I was sick. I just… let him. He knew what to do. It's hard to remember now. Everything feels… far away.
DOCTOR: What about family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? Oh dear. You mean… what about my mother and father? What do you want to know? They both… lived to be old, I think. My mother… she had a bad heart, I think. And my father… he just… got weak. That’s all I really remember. They lived in Russia, you know. Things were different then. We didn't go to doctors much. We just… dealt with things. I’m not very helpful, am I? I just don’t remember the details. Everything is… blurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications…? Oh, no. Not really. I used to take something for my… joints, I think. But I stopped. It didn't really help, and I didn't want to take too many pills. Old age is just… creaky, you know? You get used to it. No, Doctor. I don’t take anything regularly. Just… sometimes a little something for the pain, but it’s not very often. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. No, not that I know of. I used to get a little rash sometimes when I was a child, but I don’t remember what it was from. And… oh! I think I sneezed a lot when there were flowers around. But that’s not a real allergy, is it? No, Doctor. I don’t think I have any allergies. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I just don't have much of an appetite these days. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Soila, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check a few other things.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? My bones are… old. I’ll just sit here and try to remember everything you ask me. It’s hard, you know? My memory isn't what it used to be. But I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. No murmurs or extra sounds that I can detect at this point. Lungs are clear, but with diminished breath sounds bilaterally. That’s not uncommon at your age, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, your abdomen is… somewhat distended. And it’s mildly tender to palpation in the lower quadrants. It doesn’t seem to be any acute pain, but there’s definitely some discomfort there. I don't feel any obvious masses, but the abdomen is… soft and somewhat firm. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is also common with age. Okay, Soila. That's all for the physical exam. I’m going to order some blood work and a urine test. That will give us a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and… pee test? Well, alright. I’ll try not to drink too much before I come back. It all sounds very… complicated. But I trust you. Just… tell me what it means when you find out. I don’t understand all the medical… words. And… when do I need to come back? I hope it’s not too soon. My bones are tired, you know.
DOCTOR: The blood work will check your overall health, look for signs of infection, and see if you’re anemic. The urine test will check for infection and kidney function. We’ll get the results back in a few days. I'll have the nurse call you with the results and schedule a follow-up appointment then. I want to see you again in about a week, regardless of the results, just to discuss everything. And…try to drink normally, Soila. We just need a routine sample. I’ll explain everything in plain language, don’t worry. We’ll figure this out together. For now, try to rest and eat what you can. If you develop any severe pain, fever, or changes in your bowel habits, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A week… yes, that sounds alright. And I’ll try to drink normally. You’ll explain everything in… plain language? That’s good. I don’t think I have any questions right now, Doctor. I’m just a little… overwhelmed. Everything is happening so fast. But I trust you. You seem very… knowledgeable. And kind. Just… please be gentle. My old body doesn’t handle things very well anymore. And thank you, Doctor. For taking the time to listen to an old woman.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Soila. The nurse will get you scheduled for the blood work and urine test before you leave. And I will do my best. Alright. Do you have any other concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… thank you again. For everything. I’ll go find the nurse now. And I’ll see you in a week. Goodbye, Doctor. And… thank you.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Soila. We'll talk soon.
