DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, but… I’ve noticed a change in my body odor recently. It’s not… normal for me, and it’s worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright to discuss, Kerriann. Changes can be concerning, and it’s good you’re bringing it up. When you say "not normal," can you describe what's different about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, usually I don't really have much of an odor, if I’m honest. Maybe a little after a really hard day of work, but nothing strong. But lately, it's… sharper, almost a little sour, even after a shower. And it seems to be happening more often, even when I haven’t been doing anything particularly strenuous. It’s just… different. I’ve tried different soaps, but it doesn't seem to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, “sharper, almost sour,” and happening more frequently even with good hygiene. That’s helpful. And you’ve tried switching soaps already. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I’m eating the same things, sleeping okay… work’s been pretty consistent. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, my divorce was finalized about six months ago. Does… does stress have something to do with it? I know it was a hard time, but I thought I was handling it pretty well.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Kerriann. A significant life event like a divorce can absolutely impact things, even if you feel you’re coping well. Stress does have physiological effects. But let's explore all possibilities. Do you notice the odor all over your body, or is it concentrated in certain areas – like under your arms, feet, or groin?
PATIENT: It’s mostly under my arms, I think. A little bit noticeable when I take my shoes off after work, but not as bad. Definitely not anywhere else, thankfully. And it's not like... fishy or anything, just... different than my usual scent, which isn't much of a scent at all. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Kerriann. Concentrated in the armpits, not elsewhere, and you describe it as a change in your normal, not a particularly strong or unpleasant odor. Okay. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any medical conditions – like diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had my yearly check-up about nine months ago, and everything was fine then. They did bloodwork, and the doctor said I was in pretty good shape for my age. I do have high blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication. I take Lisinopril, 20mg every day. Other than that, nothing. I haven’t really been sick with anything serious in years, just the occasional cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Lisinopril for controlled hypertension, otherwise healthy. No diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues reported. And you had a clean bill of health nine months ago. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. I eat all sorts of things, no problems there. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication either. I remember taking Amoxicillin as a kid, but I don’t recall anything bad happening. Honestly, I’m a pretty boring medical case! I just want to figure out this body odor thing. It’s embarrassing, and I don’t want it to be something serious.
DOCTOR: "Boring" is good, Kerriann! We like boring. It's often the subtle changes that require investigation. And we will investigate this. Now, let's quickly touch on family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – anything like unusual body odors, or conditions that might affect sweat glands?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, had diabetes. I don't think anyone in my family ever mentioned anything about… unusual body odor. We didn’t really talk much about health things, honestly. My father was a very private man. I don’t recall anything specific about sweat glands or anything like that. I wish I could be more helpful, but… that's all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Hypertension and diabetes in the family, but no specific history of unusual body odors. Last question regarding your history, and then we'll do a quick physical exam. How is your diet generally?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of vegetables, some fruit, chicken or fish a few times a week. I do like my injera and wat, but I don’t eat that every day. I drink a lot of water. I don't drink much soda, maybe a small glass once a week. I also try to limit sweets, but I do have a sweet tooth. Overall, I think I eat pretty well for a 49-year-old. I'm not a big snacker, mostly three meals a day. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Kerriann. Sounds like a very balanced diet. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to take a look at your armpits. Just to visually assess the skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. I just hope it’s not anything serious. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kerriann. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I didn’t see any rash, redness, or signs of infection in your armpits. There is a bit more perspiration than average, but it doesn't seem to be anything dramatic. Now, I’m going to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel – just to rule out any underlying medical causes. It’s likely nothing, but it's always best to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. If that’s what you think is best. I appreciate you being so thorough. Will the blood work tell me if it’s something with my hormones or something? I've heard that can cause changes in body odor.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Kerriann. Yes, the thyroid panel will help us assess your thyroid function, which can affect body odor. We'll also be looking at other potential causes revealed by the complete blood count and metabolic panel. The results should give us a clearer picture. It will take a few days to get the results back, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your usual hygiene routine. Avoid strongly scented deodorants or antiperspirants, as they might mask the odor and make it harder to pinpoint the cause. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. Avoiding scented products makes sense. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment when I leave the office. Thank you, Doctor Asami. I feel a little better just knowing we're looking into it. Is there anything else I should be doing, or anything I should watch out for?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I'm glad you feel a little more at ease. For now, no, there’s nothing specific you need to do. However, if you notice any other symptoms – like fever, weight loss, night sweats, or changes in your skin – please call the office immediately. Otherwise, just continue with your usual routine and we’ll talk through the results when they come in. Here’s a lab requisition form. The lab is just down the hall. The receptionist will help you with the paperwork. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again for your time, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I’ll go get the blood work done now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
