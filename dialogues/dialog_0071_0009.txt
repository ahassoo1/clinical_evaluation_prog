DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. Or… Delano, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Delano is quite alright, thank you. Though I confess, I don’t see why a doctor needs to know my first name. Is this some new…protocol? It seems rather informal for a professional setting.
DOCTOR: Oh, don't mind me, old habits. Makes things a bit easier, that's all. I’m Matthias Galena, by the way. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, as your… intake person clearly documented, I’m experiencing some vision loss. It’s rather bothersome, frankly. Not debilitating, mind you, but noticeable. And it's been…progressing. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t, you see. I’m not one to waste a doctor’s time with trivial matters.
DOCTOR: Vision loss… progressing. Right. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It began…subtly. Difficulty reading small print, mostly. I attributed it to age, naturally. I am fifty-two, after all. But it's gotten to the point where even larger fonts are becoming…challenging. And it’s not just reading. Distances are…blurred. Things aren't as crisp as they once were. It's a rather frustrating feeling, I assure you. I like to keep things tidy, and now I'm relying on others to confirm what I've already done. It's...undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand. Frustrating is a good word for it. And you said it's been progressing… about how long would you say this has been going on, and has the progression been steady, or has it sped up recently?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. The initial difficulty with reading… perhaps six months ago, give or take. But the noticeable worsening, the blurring… that’s probably been within the last three months. It hasn’t been a sudden drop, thankfully. More of a…gradual slide, if you will. Though, if I'm honest, it has felt a bit quicker lately. I noticed it while driving last week – things seemed rather…washed out. Not ideal, naturally. I try to be a careful driver.
DOCTOR: Alright, gradual onset, worsening over three months, with a recent increase in speed. Do you notice it more at certain times of day, or in certain lighting conditions?
PATIENT: That's a rather astute question, Doctor. I hadn’t consciously considered it, but… now that you mention it, yes. It seems…worse in the evenings. Especially when the light is dim. My home isn’t particularly bright, you see. I prefer a more… subdued atmosphere. Daylight seems to help, somewhat. Though, of course, one can't rely on daylight indefinitely. And bright lights seem to make it…fluttery. Is that even a clinical term? It simply feels…unstable.
DOCTOR: "Fluttery" is perfectly descriptive, Mr. Alcorta. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have you noticed any pain, redness, or discharge from your eyes?
PATIENT: No, none whatsoever. That’s why I find this so perplexing. It's not as if there’s a visible issue. No discomfort, no irritation, nothing. It's simply… a diminishing of clarity. Which, frankly, is far more concerning than a simple ailment one could remedy with drops. It suggests something…deeper, doesn't it? I pride myself on being observant, and I assure you, there is nothing outwardly amiss. This isn’t a matter of pinkeye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned. No pain, redness, or discharge is good to know. Now, let’s talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, things like that?
PATIENT: Well. That's… a slightly delicate subject, if I’m honest. I used to be quite the athlete, you see. Very active. But… life has a way of intervening. I had a rather…unpleasant divorce a few years back. It took a toll, naturally. And I haven't been as diligent with my health since. I suppose my blood pressure isn’t ideal, if I’m recalling correctly. The doctor I saw briefly mentioned something about it. And my weight… has fluctuated, shall we say. I wouldn't describe myself as “healthy” at this juncture, though I resent the implication. I am perfectly capable. It's simply…motivation that's lacking.
DOCTOR: I understand. Life events can certainly impact one’s health. And it's good you're being honest with me. Do you happen to know if you’ve been diagnosed with high blood pressure, and if so, are you currently taking any medications for it?
PATIENT: I believe it was…borderline. That’s what the previous physician indicated, at least. No, I wasn’t prescribed anything. I…didn’t see the need, frankly. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. I've always been rather…skeptical of their long-term effects. And honestly, after the divorce, I simply…lost track. I wasn’t regularly seeing a doctor, so I have no idea if it progressed or not. I apologize for my lack of precision, Doctor. It’s simply not something I’ve prioritized. It seems rather absurd to be discussing this now, given the vision issue. Perhaps we should focus on that?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Alcorta. It's important to get a full picture. And it's good to know. Now, any family history of eye problems – glaucoma, macular degeneration, things like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult question. My mother… she always wore very strong glasses. But she passed away when I was quite young, so I never really had the opportunity to discuss it with her. And my father… well, he wasn’t particularly forthcoming about his health, or much of anything, if I’m honest. I vaguely recall my grandmother having some sort of…cataracts, perhaps? But I’m rather hazy on the details. The Cherokee Nation isn't exactly known for meticulous record-keeping, you see. And frankly, my family wasn’t particularly…attentive to preventative care. It’s all rather…unreliable, I’m afraid. I apologize for being unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Alcorta. We’ll work with what we have. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your eyes, if you don’t mind. It won't be invasive, just a few simple tests to assess your vision and the health of your eyes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Though I do hope it won’t take too long. I have…commitments this afternoon. And I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of bright lights. But proceed, Doctor. Let’s get this over with. I trust you have proper sanitation procedures in place? I wouldn’t want to catch anything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. Everything is thoroughly sanitized. It shouldn’t take long, and I’ll do my best to minimize discomfort. Please, have a seat and look straight ahead. First, I’m going to check your visual acuity – how well you see at different distances.
PATIENT: Very well. Do proceed. Though I must warn you, I’m rather sensitive to…unexpected stimuli. I prefer a methodical approach, if possible. No sudden movements, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I’m going to hold up a chart with letters, and I’d like you to read the smallest line you can see. Just read them as best you can. We’ll start with both eyes open, please. Now, can you read the first line for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, I can see…E, F, P, T. Though the clarity isn't…ideal. They seem rather…fuzzy around the edges. Are you certain this chart is properly illuminated? It seems a bit dim, frankly. I’m starting to strain my eyes. This is precisely why I dislike these…procedures.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me adjust the light a bit more. And I apologize if it's causing you discomfort. Now, can you read the second line for me?
PATIENT: The second line… Let me see… C, L, D, O. But they’re…almost blending together. It’s difficult to distinguish them. I’m not certain I’m providing an accurate assessment. Are you certain the letters are properly aligned? This feels…unreliable. I’m not accustomed to such imprecise conditions. Perhaps a different chart would be more appropriate? Something with…bolder lettering?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. It seems we’re having some difficulty with the standard chart. Given your discomfort, and the fuzziness you’re describing, I think it’s best if we move on to a different part of the exam. I'm going to check the pressure inside your eyes. This won't hurt, but it may feel like a slight pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Pressure, you say? I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of anything involving pressure. Is it absolutely necessary? And will it…affect my vision? I have a rather important meeting this afternoon, and I can't afford to have blurred vision. I trust you’re using a properly calibrated instrument? I wouldn't want to risk any…complications. Proceed, but be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, it's important to check the pressure. It helps us rule out certain conditions. I assure you, it's a very quick and gentle procedure. The instrument is properly calibrated. I will explain everything before I do it. I’m just going to place a small probe on your eye for a moment. It won't hurt, but you might feel a brief sensation of pressure. Just relax and look straight ahead. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Very well. But do be quick about it. And I expect a full explanation of the results afterward. I am not one for…ambiguity. And please, avoid any sudden movements. I repeat, no sudden movements. Proceed…but I hold no responsibility for any…discomfort this may cause.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Just relax. This will only take a moment… …and done. Hmm. Your pressure is slightly elevated in both eyes. It’s not dramatically high, but it’s enough to warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Elevated how? And what precisely does “further investigation” entail? I trust it doesn’t involve… invasive procedures. I have a rather low tolerance for… discomfort, as you may have gathered. Are you suggesting something is… wrong? This is most unsettling. I specifically came here for a simple vision check, not a…full-scale medical assessment. Perhaps a second opinion is warranted?
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, "elevated" simply means it's a bit higher than the average range. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it does mean we need to rule out potential causes. The next step would be a visual field test and an OCT scan of your optic nerve. These are non-invasive, painless tests that will give us a better understanding of what’s happening. An OCT scan is like a detailed photograph of the back of your eye. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, we’ll proceed at your pace. Would you be open to scheduling those tests?
PATIENT: A detailed photograph, you say? Of the inside of my eye? And a “visual field test?” It sounds…excessive, frankly. And what if these tests reveal something…unpleasant? I’m not eager to embark on a…medical odyssey, Doctor. I came here for a vision check, not a diagnosis of some… insidious ailment. Honestly, I'm starting to regret this entire visit. Perhaps I should simply…manage with glasses. This is becoming far too stressful. And what are the costs involved? I trust my insurance—or lack thereof—will be accommodated?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Alcorta. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned. These tests are not required, but they can help us determine the cause of your vision loss and prevent any potential problems down the road. Without them, we're simply treating symptoms, not addressing the root cause. The cost for the visual field test is approximately $150, and the OCT scan is $200. Unfortunately, I do see in your chart you are not insured. We do have a payment plan available if that would be helpful. We can also explore options for financial assistance at the hospital. However, given your concerns and discomfort, and the fact that you're not currently experiencing any severe symptoms, we can certainly start with just a referral to a specialist, an ophthalmologist. They can perform a more comprehensive evaluation and discuss all your options with you. Would that be a more comfortable course of action for you?
PATIENT: A specialist, you say? An ophthalmologist… That sounds… marginally more acceptable. At least it's another medical professional, another opinion. I’m not particularly keen on undergoing unnecessary tests, especially given the…financial implications. A referral, then. Yes, a referral would be… preferable. But I insist on a highly reputable ophthalmologist. One with extensive experience. And preferably, someone who doesn't relish subjecting patients to… invasive procedures. Do you have a list of recommendations? And can you assure me that this ophthalmologist will thoroughly explain all the options—including the option of no treatment—before proceeding with anything? This is paramount. I trust you understand. I am not one to be rushed into anything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. I completely understand. I have a list of excellent ophthalmologists in the area. Dr. Eleanor Vance at City Eye Care is highly regarded, and she has a reputation for being very patient-focused. She always takes the time to thoroughly explain all options, including the option of observation if appropriate. Another option is Dr. Marcus Bell, at Lakeside Eye Associates. He is known for his expertise in glaucoma and macular degeneration. I can provide you with their contact information and their credentials. I will also include a summary of your visit and the reasons for the referral. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds acceptable. Dr. Vance, you say? Patient-focused… that is encouraging. A summary of the visit… essential. And their credentials, of course. I wouldn’t want to entrust my vision to…an amateur. Please, proceed with the paperwork. And thank you… for your patience, Doctor. It’s not always easy dealing with… discerning patients such as myself. I believe that concludes our…consultation, then. I trust this process won’t be overly burdensome?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Alcorta. My pleasure. I’ll have the paperwork ready for you at the reception desk. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions. Here is the referral form, and the contact information for Dr. Vance. I hope she can provide you with some answers. Have a good day, Mr. Alcorta.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your…assistance. Though I remain cautiously optimistic. Good day to you as well.
