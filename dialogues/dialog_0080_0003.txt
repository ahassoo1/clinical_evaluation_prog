DOCTOR: Hi Jerrel, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, it's this…shaking. It’s in my hands, mostly. Been happening for a bit now. Honestly, I don't remember exactly when it started, but my daughter, bless her heart, she kept telling me to come get it checked. She worries too much, that one. Anyway, can we just…get this over with? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel, no problem at all, we'll try to be as quick as we can. It’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in. Shaking, you said – mostly in your hands?
PATIENT: Yeah, hands. And sometimes…a little in my leg, I think. It's not constant, you know? It comes and goes. More when I’m trying to do something…precise. Like, holding a fork. Or…well, never mind. It's just annoying, really. I used to have steady hands, you know. For directing. Important for directing. Not like these youngsters today, always waving the camera around. No finesse.
DOCTOR: Right, so it’s intermittent, comes and goes, and seems worse when you're trying to do something that requires fine motor skills?
PATIENT: Fine motor…is that like, with my fingers? Look, I just know it makes things harder. Harder to eat, harder to hold things…it's embarrassing, that’s what it is. I don’t need a fancy explanation, just…can you fix it? Is that what you do?
DOCTOR: I understand, Jerrel. It’s frustrating when something like that interferes with everyday life, and embarrassing too. I'll do my best to figure out what’s going on and how to help. “Fixing it” depends on what’s causing it, of course. Let’s start with a little more detail. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, besides trying to be precise?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm…let me think. Coffee, maybe? I always had a cup or two in the morning, back when I was…working. But I've been trying to cut back. It doesn't seem to make a huge difference, though. Stress, definitely stress. All these…changes. Everything’s always changing. It’s exhausting. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. It just…happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so coffee might be a factor, and stress seems to definitely make it worse. That's helpful. Now, just to get a full picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…being sick? No, I feel fine. A little tired, maybe. Old age, you know? I’m 80 years old! What do you expect? Look, are we getting anywhere with this? Because I really do have to leave soon. This whole thing is taking too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jerrel. Just a few more quick questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam, and I'll give you my thoughts. Have you noticed any stiffness in your joints, or any pain with the shaking?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Maybe a little ache sometimes, but that's just…being old. Stiffness…sometimes my hands feel a bit creaky in the morning, but I just work them out. It's nothing. Honestly, I think you're asking a lot of questions for something that's probably just…nerves. I used to deal with a lot of pressure, you know? Directing, it's not easy. A lot of people depending on you. Maybe it’s just resurfacing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or significant stiffness. I appreciate you telling me about the pressure you used to be under with directing, that’s definitely something to consider. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any changes in your memory or balance recently?
PATIENT: Memory? Look, I’m 80! What do you expect? I forget things all the time. Where I put my glasses, what I had for breakfast… perfectly normal! Balance is…okay, I don’t fall or anything. My daughter keeps offering me a cane, but I refuse. I’m perfectly capable. Honestly, are we done yet? This is ridiculous. I’m wasting my whole afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel. I understand your frustration and I’ll try to be as quick as possible. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Can you just hold your hands out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. extends hands, which are visibly trembling There. Happy? It's worse when I try to hold them still, you know. It's like, the more I concentrate, the more they shake. It's infuriating. I used to have such steady hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the tremor. It's most noticeable at rest, and does seem to increase with concentration, as you said. Your muscle tone seems normal, and your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common for your age. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just a quick check. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. takes a somewhat shallow breath There. What now? This is like being a kid again, poked and prodded by doctors. It’s humiliating. Honestly, I haven’t felt this helpless in years. Just tell me what's wrong and what I need to do to fix it.
DOCTOR: Alright, heart sounds are a little irregular, and your breathing sounds a bit quieter than they should be, but nothing immediately alarming. Given your age and these findings, and the tremor in your hands, it could be a few things. It could be essential tremor, which is a common condition that causes shaking, particularly in the hands. However, with the irregular heartbeat, we need to rule out other possibilities. I think it’s best to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm and blood work to rule out other underlying causes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: EKG? Blood work? More poking and prodding? Honestly, I don’t even know what an EKG is. Look, can't you just give me something for the shaking? A pill, maybe? Something to calm my nerves? I don't want a lot of tests. I just want this to go away. And I really do have to leave soon. My lunch...
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Jerrel. An EKG is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It’s painless; we just put some sticky pads on your chest. And the blood work will give us a broader picture of your overall health. It’s the safest way to figure out what’s going on and ensure we’re not missing anything serious. I could prescribe something to help with the shaking, but it’s important to know the cause first. Masking the symptom without addressing the underlying problem isn’t ideal. Let’s do the EKG and blood work. I’ll explain everything thoroughly afterward. It’ll take about 30 minutes, and then we can discuss the results and a plan. Would that work?
PATIENT: Ugh. Thirty minutes. Fine. But you better be quick. And you better explain everything in plain English. None of that doctor talk, understand? I just want to get this over with. My daughter will be furious if I'm late. She makes a huge deal about being on time. sighs heavily Just...let's get it done. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel. I promise I'll explain everything in plain English, and we'll go as quickly as we can. The technician is right down the hall, in room 3. They’ll get you set up for the EKG, and then we’ll draw some blood right here in the office. I'll come find you as soon as you're done, and we’ll go over everything. Here’s a slip with the technician’s name and room number. hands Jerrel a small slip of paper Do you have any questions before you head down?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it over with. waves the slip dismissively and starts to slowly walk down the hallway, looking annoyed And hurry. Lunch is at one. muttering under his breath Young people, always rushing things…no patience anymore.
