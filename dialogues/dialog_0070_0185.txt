DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my breath. It smells. Bad. Really bad. My ex-husband… well, let’s just say it was a major point of contention. Is that all you need to know? I don't have time for a life story.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to get straight to the point. Bad breath, or halitosis, can be quite bothersome. And certainly a valid reason to seek medical attention. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: What do you mean, "more about it?" It smells! Like… old food, maybe? I don’t know. It’s just bad, okay? I brush my teeth, sometimes. And I use mouthwash when I remember. Is that good enough detail for you? Honestly, I work outside all day fixing roads, I don’t have time to analyze my breath.
DOCTOR: Of course, that's helpful to know. It sounds like you’re very busy, and I appreciate you coming in despite that. When you say “sometimes” brush, roughly how often would you say you brush your teeth per day?
PATIENT: Look, don't judge me, okay? Some days it's morning, some days it's night, some days… not at all. Okay? It depends. Long shifts, you get tired. I’m not exactly prioritizing dental hygiene when I'm patching potholes. It's not like I'm going on dates or anything.
DOCTOR: I'm not judging you at all, Zelina. I simply need a clearer picture to understand the possible causes. It’s quite common for busy schedules to impact routines. Aside from the frequency of brushing, have you noticed if certain foods or drinks seem to make the odor worse?
PATIENT: Ugh, everything makes it worse, probably. I eat whatever's fastest. Coffee, sandwiches… sometimes just a protein bar if I don’t have time for anything else. It’s not like I'm sitting down to a gourmet meal, okay? And yeah, coffee definitely makes it worse. But I need coffee to get through the day. So… what’s the point of even asking?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know about the coffee, thank you. We’re just trying to identify potential contributing factors, and coffee can certainly play a role. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bad breath?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I don’t have a fever or anything. My gums bleed sometimes when I brush, but that's just… from not brushing enough, I guess. Does that count? Look, I'm a highway worker, not a doctor. I don't know what symptoms I'm supposed to be looking for. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, you're absolutely right; you shouldn't have to be. I apologize if I'm asking too many questions. The bleeding gums are relevant, thank you for mentioning that. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any recent changes in your overall health?
PATIENT: Changes? No. Same old, same old. I'm tired, I ache, I'm divorced. What kind of changes are you even talking about? I haven't been sick or anything. I’m pretty sure I haven’t even been to a doctor in… well, a long time. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent illnesses, no other changes in your health… I appreciate you letting me know. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies? No. Not that I know of. I take ibuprofen sometimes for my back, and that's it. Never had a reaction. Look, I'm not a delicate flower, okay? I work outside all day, in all kinds of weather. If I was allergic to something, I'd know about it. This is getting really annoying. Can we just get to the part where you tell me how to fix my breath?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Zelina. I assure you, we are getting there. I just need to rule out a few possibilities first. To complete the picture, do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I haven't been to a doctor in years! What do you think I am, made of medical diagnoses? No. No conditions. I'm… generally healthy, considering my job. Can we please just move this along? I have a road to fix.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. No known medical conditions. Very well. I'd like to take a quick look at your mouth, if you don't mind. Just to check the condition of your gums and teeth. It will only take a few moments. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The sooner this is done, the better. I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zelina, please open your mouth for me. Alright. I see some redness and a little swelling of your gums, which is consistent with infrequent brushing. There’s also a coating on your tongue, which can contribute to bad breath. Your teeth appear to be in generally fair condition, although it looks like you could benefit from a professional cleaning. Do you experience any pain when I press on your gums?
PATIENT: No! Don't poke around too much! No pain. Just… stop. Honestly, it's probably just the coffee. Can't you just tell me to drink less coffee and be done with it? I have work to do. This is so pointless.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I assure you I’m not trying to waste your time. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed, the most likely cause of your bad breath is poor oral hygiene, potentially exacerbated by your diet and coffee consumption. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. Since you haven’t had a dental check-up recently, I would strongly recommend scheduling an appointment with a dentist as soon as possible. They can provide a thorough cleaning and identify any underlying dental issues. In the meantime, here are some things you can do: Brush your teeth twice a day: Aim for at least two minutes each time. Floss daily: To remove food particles and plaque from between your teeth. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water can help prevent dry mouth, which can contribute to bad breath. Limit coffee consumption: If possible, try reducing your intake. Tongue scraping: Gently scrape your tongue to remove bacteria. Does that sound manageable for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. I'll... try to brush more. And maybe drink a little less coffee. I can't promise anything, though. I have a hard job. Look, I'm not a dentist. I fix roads. I appreciate you telling me what I should do, but honestly, I don't have time for a whole routine. Can I just go now? I really need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Zelina. I understand your busy schedule, and I appreciate you coming in. I'm happy to provide a note for your employer explaining your visit and recommending a brief period of rest if needed. If your bad breath persists despite these measures, or if you experience any other symptoms, please don’t hesitate to see a dentist or return to see me. Here is the note for your employer. Drive safely, and I wish you all the best. .
