DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, it’s a bit… complicated for me to recall exactly. I believe it has something to do with a surgery I’m planning? My… my husband was very involved in the arrangements, and I’m just here for… clearance, I think he said. It's pre-surgery, definitely. I apologize for my vagueness. It’s been… difficult since he passed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Brightful. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, and it’s perfectly alright if you’re having trouble recalling details. We can take our time. It sounds like you're scheduled for a surgery, and we’re here to ensure you’re medically cleared for it. Do you recall what type of surgery you’re scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s… that’s the part that’s most hazy, I’m afraid. I think it has something to do with… my appearance? He mentioned wanting me to feel… better about myself again. It wasn’t a necessity, he assured me, just something… elective. Is that… helpful? I really wish I could be more precise. It was a lot to manage, even with his help. I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Brightful. Let me see if I can access your records to get a better idea. Ah, yes. It appears you are scheduled for a panniculectomy – removal of excess abdominal skin – on August 15th. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Panniculectomy… yes! That sounds right. That does sound right. He did mention something about… excess skin. After… after the pregnancy, and then everything else. Yes, that’s it! Oh, thank goodness. It’s good to finally have a name for it. So, that’s what this clearance is for? To make sure I’m healthy enough for a panniculectomy?
DOCTOR: Exactly. We want to ensure you are a good candidate for surgery and minimize any potential risks. To start, could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Hmm. Well, I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing major. No serious surgeries before this, aside from… a wisdom tooth removal, years ago. I do have a bit of… high blood pressure, I believe. It’s usually well-controlled with medication, though. And I was diagnosed with mild asthma when I was a child, but I rarely need my inhaler these days. Is that… sufficient? I hope I’m not forgetting anything crucial. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and a history of asthma. That's good to know. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. It’s a small, white pill… I take it every morning. Ah, here it is. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once daily. Does that… answer your question? I try to be diligent, but with everything… it’s easy to get things mixed up.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg daily. Excellent. And you mentioned a history of asthma. How often do you find yourself using an inhaler, if at all?
PATIENT: Very rarely, Doctor. Honestly, it's been years since I've needed it. Maybe once a year, if that, during a particularly bad allergy season. It’s a blue one… albuterol, I think. It’s just sitting in the medicine cabinet, really. I mostly just avoid things that trigger it, like strong perfumes or a lot of dust. I’m usually fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any serious reactions to anything, as far as I can recall. Actually… I think I had a bit of a rash once after eating shellfish, years ago. Nothing severe, just a few itchy bumps. It was a long time ago, and I haven’t eaten it since, so I don’t really know for sure if it was an allergy. Is that… important? I apologize for being so vague. I really wish I had a better memory for these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible shellfish allergy. We'll make a note of that. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult one. My mother… she had diabetes, I believe. And her mother… she had heart problems, I think. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t really talk about medical things much. My husband’s side of the family… I don’t know them very well, to be honest. He didn’t talk about it much either. He… he preferred to focus on the present. I'm sorry. I wish I could give you more detailed information. It's just… a lot of it is lost to me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. We can work with what you have. Now, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. My husband and I… we always led a very healthy lifestyle. It was very important to us. I’m sorry, I know that’s a rather blunt answer, but it’s the truth.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything else you’d like to tell me about your health concerns or any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose I’m just… anxious about the surgery, naturally. It’s not that I don't want it, it's just… a big thing. And I worry about the recovery, being alone… My husband… he would have taken care of everything. I just hope I’m strong enough to go through with it. And I hope… I hope it will make me feel better, like he wanted. Do you think… do you think I’m a good candidate for this surgery, Doctor? I trust your judgment, of course, but I’d just like to know what you think.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, it's completely understandable to feel anxious about a surgery, especially under these circumstances. It's brave of you to pursue this, and it's okay to be worried. Based on the information you’ve provided so far – your medical history, medications, and overall health – you appear to be a reasonably good candidate for a panniculectomy. However, to be absolutely certain, and to ensure your safety, I’d like to perform a physical exam and order some routine blood work. This will help us assess your current health status and identify any potential risks. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. A physical exam and blood work… that makes sense. I just want to make sure everything is… as safe as possible. I trust your judgment completely. Let's do whatever you think is best. When would you like to begin? I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's start with a quick review of your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at the surgical site. If you could please sit up on the examination table, we'll get started. I’ll need to expose your abdomen for the examination, but I’ll provide you with a gown and a sheet for privacy.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific. I… I’m a little anxious about this, but I trust you. Thank you for being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: There you go. Just step out of your clothes and put this on, and I’ll give you a sheet to drape over yourself. Take your time. We'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not concerning given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular with no murmurs, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, if you could lie back, please. I'm going to examine your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and there's no evidence of masses or organomegaly. Surgical site appears clean with a well-healed incision line from a previous surgery, as noted in your chart. Do you experience any pain or discomfort when I apply pressure here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn’t hurt. Just… a little strange, I suppose. I haven't really had anyone touch it since… since the last one. No pain, though. Definitely no pain. It feels… normal, I think. I'm just a little nervous, that's all. I appreciate you being so gentle. It really helps. Is everything… okay so far?
DOCTOR: Everything looks good so far, Ms. Brightful. Your abdomen is well-healed, and there are no immediate concerns. Just a little bit of expected post-surgical scar tissue. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your overall health and kidney function. We should also check your albumin level – that can give us an idea of your nutritional status, which is important for wound healing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… very thorough. Absolutely, please. Whatever you think is necessary. I want to make sure I’m as prepared as possible. A CBC, CMP, and albumin… all right. I trust your judgment completely. Thank you for taking such good care of me. It really puts my mind at ease. When can I expect to get the results? And… will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I’m glad I can help. Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw – no food or drinks, except for water. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning at the lab across the street. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. In the meantime, I want to discuss a few post-operative precautions and what to expect during recovery. We’ll also need to review your medications and ensure there are no interactions with anything we might prescribe for pain management. Would you like to discuss that now, or would you prefer to take a break?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, let’s go ahead and discuss it now, if you don’t mind. I’d rather get it all out of the way at once. Post-operative precautions and medication review… yes, that sounds good. I just want to be prepared for everything. Please, tell me everything I need to know. I'm ready to listen.
DOCTOR: Certainly. After the surgery, you’ll be monitored closely in the recovery room until you’re stable. Expect some pain and discomfort, which we’ll manage with pain medication. We’ll start with a short-acting opioid, and gradually transition to non-opioid options as your pain subsides. It’s important to take the medication as prescribed and to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while you’re on it. You’ll have a surgical drain in place for a few days to remove excess fluid. We’ll teach you how to care for it properly before you leave the hospital. You’ll need to keep the incision site clean and dry and watch for any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus. It’s also crucial to avoid strenuous activity for at least six weeks. That includes lifting heavy objects, bending over, or twisting. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week to check your incision and monitor your progress. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes sense. Pain medication, surgical drain, keep the incision clean and dry, avoid strenuous activity… six weeks, you said? It sounds… manageable, I think. A bit daunting, but manageable. The surgical drain… is that… painful? And what about showering? Can I shower after the surgery? I always worry about getting the incision wet. Is there anything else I should be aware of? This is a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining it so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be concerned about the surgical drain and showering. The drain itself can be a little uncomfortable, but it’s usually not intensely painful. We'll make sure you're comfortable before you leave the hospital. We will teach you how to care for it to minimize discomfort. Regarding showering, you can shower after the surgery, but you’ll need to be careful to avoid getting the incision wet for the first few days. We’ll give you specific instructions on how to protect it. After a week or so, once the incision has started to heal, you can shower normally. It’s also important to stay hydrated, eat a healthy diet, and avoid smoking. Smoking can significantly delay wound healing and increase your risk of complications. If you experience any fever, chills, excessive bleeding, or signs of infection, contact me immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that… that makes sense. No smoking, stay hydrated, healthy diet, watch for signs of infection… and avoid getting the incision wet for a week. I think I’ve got it. You mentioned pain medication earlier. Will I be able to take my regular medications after the surgery? I take a low dose of something for my blood pressure, as we discussed. I just want to make sure there won’t be any interactions. And… is there anything I should do to prepare my home for my recovery? I live alone, and I want to make sure everything is safe and accessible.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Yes, you can continue taking your lisinopril for your blood pressure after the surgery, as long as you take it as prescribed. We’ll review all your medications before you leave the hospital to ensure there are no interactions. However, please let me know if you're taking any over-the-counter medications or supplements, as those can sometimes interfere with pain management. As for preparing your home, that’s a great idea. It’s important to create a safe and comfortable environment for your recovery. I recommend removing any tripping hazards, such as rugs or loose cords. Make sure everything you need is easily accessible, such as medications, food, and water. It’s also a good idea to have someone check in on you regularly, especially during the first few days after the surgery. Do you have any specific concerns about your home environment that I can help you with?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. I live in a small apartment, so it's not too difficult to get around. I mostly just worry about… reaching things. I have some shelves that are a little high, and I don't have anyone to help me rearrange them. But I think I can manage. One last question, if you don't mind. How long will the surgery take? I know it's probably a silly question, but I always worry about being under anesthesia for too long. And… will I be in a lot of pain when I wake up? I've heard horror stories, and I'm a little anxious about the pain management. I apologize for asking so many questions, but I just want to be prepared for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking silly questions at all, Ms. Brightful. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about anesthesia and pain management. The surgery typically takes about 2-3 hours. We have a highly skilled anesthesiologist who will monitor you closely throughout the procedure to ensure your safety and comfort. They’ll adjust the anesthesia as needed and make sure you wake up smoothly. As for pain, you will likely experience some discomfort when you wake up, but we’ll manage it with medication. We’ll start with a short-acting opioid and gradually transition to non-opioid options as your pain subsides. We’ll also teach you techniques to help manage your pain, such as deep breathing and relaxation exercises. We’re committed to making your experience as comfortable as possible. If you experience any uncontrolled pain, please let us know immediately, and we’ll adjust your medication as needed. Do you have any other concerns or questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve answered all my questions, and you’ve put my mind at ease. Thank you for being so patient and thorough. I really appreciate it. I feel much more prepared now. So, what are the next steps? Do I need to schedule the blood work now? And… is there anything I need to do before the surgery, besides fasting? I just want to make sure I’m doing everything right.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I’m glad I could help. Yes, let’s schedule the blood work now. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you before you leave. You’ll need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand. Besides fasting, there’s not much else you need to do before the surgery. Just make sure you have someone to drive you home afterwards, as you won’t be able to drive yourself. I’ll also give you a list of pre-operative instructions and contact information for any questions or concerns you may have. We’ll see you on August 15th. Do you have any final questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been wonderful. I really appreciate your patience and kindness. I think I’m ready to go now. I’ll schedule the blood work with the receptionist before I leave. I feel much more confident about the surgery now, and I’m grateful for your help. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before the surgery. We’ll take good care of you. Have a good day as well, and please, rest well before August 15th.
