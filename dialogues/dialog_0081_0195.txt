DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor Paulino. It’s just… well, I thought it would be nice to have a little card. You know, a “Get Well” card. Or maybe one that says something encouraging. I just feel like a little something cheerful from a real doctor would be… uplifting. It's not a serious problem, mind you. Just a little… boost.
DOCTOR: Right. A…card. While I appreciate your…unique approach to healthcare, Ms. Micucci, this is a medical clinic. We deal with illnesses and injuries, not stationery requests. Perhaps you’ve mistaken this office for a greeting card shop?
PATIENT: Oh, don't be like that, Doctor. It's not just any card, you see. It's… a validation, almost. To know a proper doctor thinks of you, even if it's just a little note. You’re a real doctor, with a proper education, and a nice office here in the city. A card from someone who knows things… it means something. It’s not like I'm asking for a surgery or anything! I just thought it was something you might do. A little kindness goes a long way, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, I’ve spent the last twenty-one years of my life dedicated to the rigorous study and practice of internal medicine. My time is best utilized diagnosing and treating medical conditions, not composing personalized greetings. While I acknowledge the…sentiment, it is simply not within the scope of my professional duties. Now, is there an actual medical reason you’ve scheduled an appointment today, or shall I assume this is solely regarding a desired piece of paper?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly! You make it sound like I’m asking for the moon. It’s just a card. And yes, alright, I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately. A bit…low, you know? Not sick, exactly. Just…down. My daughter keeps telling me I need to “see someone” but I don’t have anything wrong! It’s just…life. But she insisted I come and well, I thought a kind word from a proper doctor would help. Is that so much to ask? And honestly, it’s a little rude to imply I'm wasting your time. A doctor is supposed to care about people's feelings, aren't they?
DOCTOR: “Feeling low” is a rather vague symptom, Ms. Micucci. It could indicate a multitude of underlying issues, ranging from simple stress to…more concerning conditions. To properly assess your situation, I need specifics. When did you begin feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specifics…let me think. It’s been…well, since my grandson started university, I suppose. He went all the way to California, you see. Such a long way! And he never calls enough. Not like he used to. It just makes me feel…forgotten, I guess. And my daughter keeps fussing about my diet. She says I don’t eat enough vegetables. Honestly, a little bit of dessert never hurt anyone! So, I suppose…since then. Maybe a month or so? It’s hard to say exactly. Everything just feels…a bit gray, if that makes sense. And it's very stressful, thinking about him all alone out there. I worry so much.
DOCTOR: So, a month of…generalized unhappiness precipitated by your grandson's relocation and perceived dietary criticism from your daughter. And you believe a card would alleviate these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t put it like that! It’s not just unhappiness, it’s…a feeling of being unsettled. And a card wouldn't fix it, of course. But it would be…nice. A little acknowledgement that someone cares. It’s a small thing, Doctor, but small things can make a big difference. And honestly, if you asked anyone if a kind word wouldn’t brighten their day, I think they’d say yes. It shows you’re listening, you see? That you care about more than just…illnesses and things. Is that so wrong to want? It just makes me feel like you consider me a person, not just a patient with a complaint. Honestly, my daughter says I worry too much, but a grandmother worries, doesn't she? About everything.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I am documenting your reported feelings of sadness and anxiety related to familial concerns. However, it is important to differentiate between normal emotional responses and a diagnosable condition. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep…well, I wake up a lot. Thinking, mostly. About the grandson, about the daughter, about whether I remembered to turn off the stove. Just little things, you know? I used to sleep like a log, but now… I toss and turn. Not every night, mind you. But more often than I used to. And I get up a couple of times to…well, to check things. The doors, the windows…just to be sure everything is alright. I don't think it's a big problem, but it's not as restful as it used to be. Sometimes I get a little dizzy when I stand up quickly in the morning, but that could just be my age, couldn’t it? Honestly, I worry that I’m becoming a bother to everyone. My daughter tries to be helpful, but…she has her own life, you see.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite…well, it’s been a bit off, yes. I don’t really feel hungry like I used to. Not for big meals, anyway. I still eat, mind you. A little bit of rice, some yogurt…but I don’t crave anything. And I’ve been losing weight, my daughter says. She keeps pointing it out, honestly. She says I need to eat more vegetables, but frankly, they just don’t taste as good as they used to. A little bit of sweet helps, you see? It cheers me up. But I try not to overdo it. Honestly, I'm not much of a food person anyway. I just eat to live, you know? Not the other way around. It’s just…everything tastes a bit bland lately. Even my favourite sweets don’t have the same flavour.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, based on your reported symptoms – sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, unintentional weight loss, and a general feeling of sadness – it is possible you are experiencing symptoms consistent with mild depression. However, a definitive diagnosis requires further evaluation. I'm going to take some vitals, and then we'll discuss some basic blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. Please sit here and relax.
PATIENT: Oh. Depression? Well, that sounds…serious. I just thought I was a bit…down. Honestly, I don’t like the sound of that at all. Blood work? Oh dear. I don’t do well with needles. But…alright. If you think it’s necessary. I just…I really still think a nice card would help. Just to cheer things up a bit. But alright. Blood work it is. Be gentle, please? And is it going to hurt very much? Honestly, I’m not sure I’m ready for all of this. It's all very…overwhelming. And frankly, all I wanted was a little something nice. A little kindness. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I understand your apprehension, but it's important to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. The blood work is a standard procedure and will help rule out any physical factors contributing to your feelings. The discomfort is minimal, and it will be over quickly. As for the “card”, I reiterate that it is not within the scope of my practice to provide such a service. We are here to address your health concerns, not to offer emotional support through stationery. Now, please roll up your sleeve. We'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But you don’t have to be so… abrupt about it, you know? It’s just a little card. It wouldn’t take you any time at all. Honestly, my grandson always sends me cards. Even when he’s busy. He knows it cheers me up. It’s the thought that counts, you see? But fine. Blood work it is. Just…be gentle, please. And don’t poke too much. Honestly, I feel like a little girl being scolded. All I wanted was a little kindness from a proper doctor. Is that so much to ask? Honestly, you’re making me feel worse now.
DOCTOR: 130 over 80. Within normal limits. Now, for the blood draw. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. They are highly skilled and will minimize any discomfort. We'll need a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. It's standard procedure, Ms. Micucci. And, to be clear, I am addressing your health concerns. Providing emotional support through personalized greetings is not a medical necessity. Are you currently taking any medications or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A phlebotomist? Honestly, I don't like needles at all. My daughter gives me a vitamin D supplement sometimes, but I forget to take it half the time. She says I need more sunshine, but it's been so cloudy lately. And…well, I used to take a little something for my arthritis, but the doctor said it was making my stomach upset, so I stopped. It was a herbal remedy, I think. My neighbour gave it to me. She swears by it, but it didn’t help me much. Honestly, I just… try to manage on my own. I don’t like going to doctors, you see? It always ends up being a lot of poking and prodding and…well, honestly, it makes me feel worse. And I still think a little card would have been nice. Just to cheer things up a bit. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, the reason I am asking about the herbal remedy is because some supplements can interfere with blood test results or have adverse interactions with other medications. It's important to have a complete picture of your medical history. As for the "card", I will reiterate one final time that it is not within the scope of my practice. We are here to diagnose and treat medical conditions, not to provide emotional comfort through stationery. Now, can you recall the name of this herbal remedy your neighbour gave you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it was… well, she said it was very good for joints. It was a little brown bottle, I think. And the name… it started with a “T,” I think. Or maybe a “P.” Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. She got it from her sister, who lives in the mountains. She said it was very… natural. It smelled a bit like… earth, I think. And it had little bits of leaves in it. Honestly, I don't remember the exact name. It wasn't anything fancy. She just called it “the joint stuff.” Honestly, I just tried it because she said it would help. It didn't make much difference, but it didn't hurt me either. Honestly, I just wish I could remember the name. It's all so confusing. And I still think a little card would have been nice. Just to show you care. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, "the joint stuff" is not a helpful medical history detail. The lack of a specific name makes it impossible to assess any potential interactions. We will proceed with the blood work as planned. The phlebotomist should be here momentarily. Please try to relax. I understand you are feeling anxious, but dwelling on a personalized greeting is not conducive to a productive consultation. Are there any other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you have taken in the past six months that you recall, even if you didn't take them consistently?
PATIENT: Oh dear… well, there was that time my daughter made me try that… turmeric powder? She said it was very good for inflammation. I put it in my tea, but it tasted awful. I only did it for a week, maybe. And…well, my neighbour also gave me some ginger capsules once, for my stomach. But I didn’t like taking pills, so I didn’t take them very often. Honestly, I just try to avoid taking anything if I can. I prefer natural remedies, but they never seem to work very well. And… oh, and I tried chamomile tea for sleep, but it didn’t help me sleep any better. Honestly, I just wish I could remember everything. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see? And I still think a little card would have been nice. Just to show you care. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I appreciate you attempting to recall your medical history, but we are deviating significantly from the purpose of this consultation. The numerous unverified herbal remedies and supplements you’ve mentioned are unlikely to be the cause of your current symptoms, and frankly, are adding unnecessary complexity. We need to focus on obtaining accurate blood work results to determine if there is an underlying medical condition causing your feelings of sadness and fatigue. The phlebotomist is here. Please follow them to the lab. We will discuss the results once they are available. And to be absolutely clear, a personalized greeting will not be provided. This consultation is about your health, not your emotional wellbeing through stationery.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Blood work it is. But honestly, you don’t have to be so…cold about it. A little kindness wouldn't hurt, you know? Just a little something to show you care. It’s all I ever wanted.
