DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. Now, Carmaleta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so if we could just get straight to it, that would be great. I just… want to make sure things are okay, you know? Before it's too late.
DOCTOR: Very well. “Before it’s too late” is… dramatic, but I understand wanting to be efficient. Can you tell me, in your own words, what precisely brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I just want to get pregnant. Easy. My husband… well, he was a good man. And we always planned on having a family, but… things happened. And now… I don’t want to be too old when it happens, if it happens. I want to make sure there aren't any… problems, you know? It feels like time is slipping away.
DOCTOR: Right. Fertility concerns. A common issue, unfortunately. And yes, age is a factor. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. “Problems” is vague. Are you having difficulty conceiving?
PATIENT: Conceiving? I… haven’t tried trying, not really. Not since… well, you know. It’s just… is there something I need to do before I even start? I don't want to waste time on something that won't work if there’s something wrong with me. It's been a while. Things change, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, things do change. A sensible question, really. We should ascertain your baseline health. Have you had a routine check-up recently?
PATIENT: Routine check-up? Hmm… Honestly, not since… before everything. I mean, I have insurance, a good plan, but… I just didn't feel up to it. Doctors visits and all that. It just seemed pointless, you know? Now it feels important, but… I can’t really remember the last time. Does that make sense? Everything feels a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy, yes. Understandable, given the circumstances. Alright. We'll proceed as though a recent check-up hasn’t occurred. First, let’s get some basic information. Any significant medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… well, I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox, nothing serious. And then… a bad bout of flu a few years back. Oh! And I broke my arm once when I was a teenager, a silly accident. Nothing that would… affect things now, surely? Honestly, I'm a pretty healthy person. I always have been. I eat well, mostly. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: “Mostly” is… unhelpful. And childhood illnesses are irrelevant, frankly. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… No, nothing major. Just… I had my wisdom teeth out, ages ago. And… oh, a small cyst removed from my wrist when I was younger, but that was tiny. Nothing serious at all. Look, I’m not a complicated case, okay? I just want to know if I can have a baby without everything going wrong. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not “too much to ask”. Although, your dismissal of details is… concerning. Alright. Family history then. Any significant illnesses on either side?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had something with his heart, but he lived to a good age, so it couldn’t have been too bad. I have an aunt… on my mother’s side… she had… something with her stomach? I'm really not good with these things. Everyone always gets so upset talking about it. It's just… bad news, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Vague, as expected. Very well. Let’s discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! I would never. My husband… he didn’t approve. And frankly, I find it disgusting. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but… is that a problem? It’s just one glass! I'm not a heavy drinker, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Sometimes” is still… unhelpful. And alcohol does affect fertility, even in small amounts. We will need a complete history. Now, let me ask you directly: are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh! Well... I take a multivitamin. Just a standard one, you know, for general health. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, if they’re really bad. That's it! Honestly, I'm a very healthy person. I don't go around popping pills. Is that a problem? It feels like you're implying I'm doing something wrong!
DOCTOR: I am simply attempting to gather precise information, Madam Villarreal. A multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen are… tolerable, I suppose. Now, allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I mean, I get hay fever sometimes, in the spring. But that's just a little sneezing, nothing serious. No food allergies, no reactions to… anything, really. I'm not a delicate flower, if that's what you're asking. Honestly, this is starting to feel like an interrogation! Is this normal?
DOCTOR: “Hay fever” is an allergy, Madam Villarreal. And this is a medical assessment, not an "interrogation." Very well. Before we proceed, allow me to perform a brief physical examination. It will be… cursory, but necessary. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Oh… I hadn’t expected that. Well… I suppose not. But please be quick, okay? And gentle. I just… I’m not really comfortable with people poking around. Is it really necessary? It feels… invasive. Honestly, I just want to know if there’s a problem, not be… examined like some sort of specimen.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Madam Villarreal. A basic examination is standard procedure. Please, recline on the table. I will begin with your blood pressure and pulse. Then we will proceed with auscultation of your heart and lungs. It will be… brief. And professional. Please.
PATIENT: Fine. But if it takes long, I’m leaving. I have things to do, you know. This is just… inconvenient. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated. Pulse is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal S1 and S2. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Examination is unremarkable, but further investigation is required. We will need to order some blood work to assess your hormone levels and overall health.
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, wonderful. More waiting. Look, can we at least get this done quickly? I really don't have time for this. Will it take long to get the results? And… will it be expensive? I have insurance, but… you know how those things are. Honestly, this is all so stressful. I just want to know if I can have a baby, not be put through a million tests.
DOCTOR: The blood work is standard procedure, Madam Villarreal. It will take approximately 7-10 business days to receive the results. Your insurance should cover the majority of the cost, but I cannot provide a precise estimate. We will discuss the results in detail once they are available. I am also recommending a transvaginal ultrasound to assess your uterus and ovaries. This will provide further information about your reproductive health. Please take this to the lab downstairs. They will schedule your ultrasound appointment for you. Is that understood?
PATIENT: A… transvaginal ultrasound? Oh, good heavens. Isn’t there any other way? That sounds… unpleasant. Look, can we just skip that one? I’m really not comfortable with that. I mean, is it absolutely necessary? Maybe the blood work will be enough. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I just want a simple answer, not a… a full-scale investigation! Is there anything else? I'd like to be done here.
DOCTOR: Madam Villarreal, a transvaginal ultrasound is crucial for assessing your reproductive organs. Skipping it would be… irresponsible. We need to visualize your uterus and ovaries to rule out any potential abnormalities. It is a standard part of a fertility workup, and your resistance is… concerning. I understand your discomfort, but I assure you it is a safe and necessary procedure. I strongly advise you to proceed with the ultrasound. Now, are there any further questions?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do whatever you want. It’s always something… always. But if it’s painful, I’m leaving. And I expect a very thorough explanation of everything. Honestly, this whole thing is just… awful. Is that it? Can I go now? I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. You may proceed to the lab. They will schedule your ultrasound. I expect you to follow up with me once you have received the results. And Madam Villarreal… please do try to be more forthcoming with information in the future. It will save us both time. .
