DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I am Dr. Yackey. I understand you’re here today… tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, to put it plainly, I feel… a bit worn down. Like an old engine that needs a good tune-up. I’m not sick, exactly, but I’m not as lively as I used to be. I suppose I’m looking for a… a reset, a jumpstart, to get my health back on track. I’ve been a teacher for a long time, you see, and… well, it takes it out of you.
DOCTOR: Right. “Worn down.” A rather… vague complaint, but understandable. You say not “sick”, exactly. Can you be more specific about what this “worn down” feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. It’s not a pain, not a cough, nothing like that. It's more… a tiredness that doesn’t go away with sleep. And… a lack of… pep, I suppose. I used to enjoy gardening, walking with my friends, even just keeping up with the housework. Now, everything feels like a bit of an effort. It's… disheartening, really. And my memory isn't what it used to be, though I don't know if that's just getting older.
DOCTOR: Tiredness… lack of “pep.” And… memory issues. Right. We'll need to get a better handle on these symptoms. Do you notice this tiredness more at certain times of day?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. It’s… pretty consistent, actually. It's there when I wake up, and it’s still there at night. Doesn't really come and go, if that makes sense. Though… perhaps it’s a little worse in the afternoons. After I’ve been on my feet for a while, or if it's a particularly warm day. But it's never a dramatic difference, just… a bit more noticeable. I don’t know if that helps.
DOCTOR: Consistent tiredness, slightly worse in the afternoons. And the memory issues… can you give me a specific example of what you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specific example… well, just yesterday, Mrs. Aligada came over for tea, and I completely forgot she told me about her grandson’s graduation. We talked for ages, and I just… blanked on it. She had mentioned it last week, I’m sure of it. And sometimes… I’ll go into a room and forget why I went there. Small things, mostly. It's not like I don't know who people are, just… details slip my mind. It’s rather embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Memory lapses. We'll address that. Now, let’s go through some basic medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had a touch of arthritis in my knees a few years back, but it's pretty well managed with some cream and gentle exercises. Otherwise… no, not that I'm aware of. My blood pressure has been a little high at times, the doctor used to say, but it's usually okay. I've been generally healthy, all things considered. I’ve always been active, you see. A healthy diet, mostly fish and vegetables… that sort of thing. Do you want me to list all the medications I’m currently taking? I have them written down in my purse.
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s alright for now. We can get to that later. Have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh, yes. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, back in the… late 70s, I believe it was. And… I had a hysterectomy, also quite a long time ago. Other than that… no, nothing major. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years. Nothing a good Chamorro herbal remedy couldn’t fix!
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, hysterectomy… noted. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my mother lived to be 92, which is good. She had a bit of arthritis, like me. My father passed away earlier, from a heart attack, I believe. He wasn't very healthy, to be honest. He smoked a lot, and didn't take care of himself. And… my brother had diabetes, but he lived in Guam, and I haven't seen him in many years. That's about all I can recall, really. We didn't talk about health much in my family. It wasn't considered polite, perhaps. We preferred to talk about the good things.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll move on. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. It won’t take long. If you could just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Sounds sensible. I used to be quite nimble, you know. But the years do catch up with you, don’t they? Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. I’m not as flexible as I used to be!
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs detected. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes… 2+ bilaterally. A little diminished, but within normal limits for her age. Abdomen… soft, non-tender. No palpable masses. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not concerning at this time.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Is that… bad, Doctor? I do try to watch my salt intake, but… it's hard when you enjoy good food! My husband used to say I put a little too much seasoning in everything. He loved my red rice, you see. Perhaps that’s where the extra salt came from. Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It's not immediately concerning, Ms. McNabb. But we’ll want to monitor it. Your overall clinical picture suggests… age-related fatigue, possibly with some mild cognitive decline, and slightly elevated blood pressure. I recommend a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying deficiencies – Vitamin D, B12, thyroid function. And perhaps a CT scan of the brain to evaluate the cognitive concerns further. We’ll also want to discuss lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise, stress management. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds rather serious, Doctor. Is… is something wrong? And what do you mean by “cognitive decline”? That sounds a bit frightening. I just thought I was… getting forgetful, as people do when they get older. And what sort of lifestyle modifications are you thinking of? I already try to eat healthy and stay active. I’m a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. Perhaps you could explain things a little more slowly?
DOCTOR: The CT scan is simply a precaution, Ms. McNabb. It's to rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain. “Cognitive decline” simply means a decrease in mental abilities – memory, thinking, reasoning. As you said, it's common with age, but we want to ensure there’s no underlying cause. As for lifestyle modifications… a low-sodium diet, regular aerobic exercise – walking, swimming – and stress-reducing activities – meditation, yoga. I’ll write you a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and a prescription for a Vitamin D supplement. We can discuss the blood work at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. Although… once, when I was a little girl, I had a rash after eating some mangoes, but that was a long time ago. And I don’t think that counts as an allergy, does it? This is all a bit much to take in. A neurologist… I hadn’t expected that. Is it something serious, Doctor? Should I be worried? I feel… a bit frightened, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Ms. McNabb, it’s standard procedure to rule out any serious underlying causes for your symptoms. I'm ordering these tests to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Worrying won’t help. We will address any concerns as we get the results. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks. Do you have any questions for me before I conclude the examination?
PATIENT: Two weeks… that seems a long time to wait. Well… what if… what if it is something serious? What are we looking for, exactly? And… will I feel different after taking the Vitamin D? Will it help with the tiredness, do you think? It’s just… I want to get back to my life, you see. I want to enjoy my gardening, my friends, my tea… I don’t want to feel like I’m losing myself. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. McNabb, I understand your concerns. We are evaluating for a range of possibilities, including mild cognitive impairment, early stages of dementia, and vitamin deficiencies. Vitamin D may improve your energy levels, but it’s not a guaranteed fix. We will discuss the results thoroughly at your follow-up appointment. I'm concluding the examination now. The nurse will provide you with the necessary paperwork and schedule your follow-up. If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms – severe headache, confusion, weakness – please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I will see you in two weeks. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you… I suppose. Two weeks… it seems a very long time. I hope everything will be alright. Goodbye, Doctor. .
