DOCTOR: Hi Annelle, welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well, it’s about… a friend. A friend of mine is… quite yellow. It’s rather alarming, actually. She has… trouble with her liver, I believe. Though, truthfully, I don’t recall all the details. It’s been… a long time. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It's perfectly alright. It can be difficult to remember everything, especially when you're worried about someone. So, your friend is experiencing yellowing of the skin… that’s called jaundice. And you suspect it might be related to her liver?
PATIENT: Jaundice… yes, that’s the word. It is rather… noticeable. And the liver… she’s had doctors for it, for years now. Hepatitis, I think? Or something similar. It comes and goes, this trouble. But it seems… worse lately. I just… wanted to be certain. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Okay. Hepatitis can certainly cause liver problems, and it's good you're bringing it up. It can be serious, yes, depending on the type and how long it's been going on. To get a better idea of what’s happening with your friend, could you tell me a little more about when this recent worsening started?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dates… I am terrible with dates, Doctor. Truly. It was… sometime after the spring, I believe. Perhaps… June? No, maybe July. It’s all rather blurry. She started feeling… weak, more tired than usual. And then I noticed the color. It frightened me, so I insisted she come see someone. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, don’t worry about the exact date. “Sometime after spring” is helpful. Weakness and increased fatigue along with the yellowing… okay. Has she had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… She’s been… a bit confused sometimes. Not all the time, but… forgetful. And… oh! She’s lost her appetite. Barely eats anything. She says everything tastes… metallic. Is that… typical? I do apologize for being so vague. It’s just… a lot has happened.
DOCTOR: No, please don’t apologize at all. It’s perfectly understandable to be vague when you’re concerned about someone. Confusion, loss of appetite, and a metallic taste… those can all be related to liver issues, yes. Now, has she noticed any swelling in her legs or abdomen?
PATIENT: Swelling… now that you mention it… yes. Her ankles, I believe. They seemed… puffier than usual. And… perhaps her stomach? It’s hard to say. She wears loose clothing, so I didn't pay much attention. Oh dear, this sounds rather grim, doesn’t it? I truly hope it’s nothing too serious. Is there a test you can do to find out what's wrong?
DOCTOR: It does sound concerning, but we need to figure out what’s going on before jumping to conclusions. Yes, there are several tests we can do. We’ll need to do some blood work to check her liver function, and we might also need to do an imaging scan, like an ultrasound, to get a better look at her liver and abdomen. Does she have any allergies to medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. She’s always been… quite healthy, aside from this liver trouble. She’s very careful about what she eats, and she doesn't take many medications. Just… something for her blood pressure, I think. But I’m not certain. Oh dear, I really wish I could be more helpful. I feel so useless, not knowing these details. Is it alright if I bring her in myself? She’s not… very steady on her feet these days.
DOCTOR: You're not being useless at all. You're doing a wonderful job just bringing her in and sharing what you know. And yes, absolutely, please bring her in yourself. That's a very good idea. We can get a much better understanding of her condition with a proper examination. Do you know the name of the medication she takes for her blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The name… it escapes me entirely. It’s a small, white pill, I believe. She keeps it in a little tin box in the kitchen. I’m afraid I’m not very good with details, Doctor. I truly apologize. Perhaps if I brought the box with me when I bring her in? Would that be helpful? I just want to ensure she receives the best possible care. This worry… it’s quite overwhelming.
DOCTOR: That would be very helpful, yes. Bringing the pill box is a great idea. Don't worry about remembering the name, we can identify it easily enough. And you're doing a wonderful job. It's completely understandable to be worried. Let's get her scheduled for an appointment as soon as possible. Would tomorrow morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that would be perfect. I’ll bring the pill box, and I’ll ensure she gets a good night’s rest. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. I truly appreciate your kindness. Perhaps… I should stop rambling. I’m afraid I’m taking up your valuable time. Is there anything else I should know before tomorrow?
DOCTOR: Not at all, you're not rambling. And you're very welcome. Just try to get her here comfortably, and bring any list of her medications you can find. We'll take it from there. Otherwise, just focus on getting her rested. Is there anything you need from me before tomorrow?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all. You’ve been most helpful, Doctor. I simply want to ensure my friend receives the best possible care. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I’ll see you tomorrow morning, then. I suppose… that will be all.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll do our best. I look forward to meeting your friend tomorrow. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before then. Have a good evening.
