DOCTOR: Hi Mande, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… strange, actually. I’ve been feeling really tired, and I’ve gotten quite yellow, especially in my eyes. It started a few days ago, and I think it might be connected to… fava beans. I ate a lot of them at a festival, and then this started.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is a bit strange, but good you're bringing it up. Tiredness and yellowing… that's definitely something we need to look into. And the fava beans are a really important detail. Just to clarify, when you say "a lot," roughly how many fava beans are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that's hard to say exactly. Maybe… a whole big plate? They were fresh and delicious, and everyone was eating them. I probably had two or three handfuls, easily. It wasn’t just a few, that’s for sure. I really enjoy them, normally, I’ve never had a problem before.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple handfuls… that's helpful. And you’ve never experienced anything like this after eating fava beans before?
PATIENT: No, never. I mean, I eat them every summer, usually. My grandmother used to grow them. It’s always been a family favorite. This is… new. And honestly, a little scary. I just feel so weak, and the yellowing is getting worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weakness and worsening yellowing, especially with the fava bean connection… it’s starting to sound like we need to consider a condition called Favism. It's a genetic condition where people have a deficiency in an enzyme, and eating fava beans can trigger it. First though, let's get a little more information. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… complicated. I’m not sure I understand about enzymes… But okay, I'll try to help however I can. Other symptoms… hmm. I’ve been a bit breathless, even just walking around the house. And my urine has been… darker than usual, almost tea-colored. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very important. Dark urine and breathlessness with the yellowing and fatigue... Okay, Mande, let’s do a quick physical exam, and then I’ll order some blood work to confirm what’s going on. We need to check your red blood cell count and some liver function tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work is fine. I just want to figure out what’s going on and feel better, if that’s possible. I’m a little worried, to be honest. Is it serious? I mean, this Favism… is it something to be really scared of?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're asking, and it's okay to be worried. Favism can be serious, but it's also manageable with the right care. It depends on the severity. We'll get a better idea once we have the blood work results. Okay, let’s start with your vitals, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. Then we can talk more about what to expect. Can you step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I hope it’s not too bad… I haven’t been eating much, feeling so unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, 132 pounds. And your height is 178 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. 178 centimeters. I'm quite tall, I've always been. It makes finding clothes difficult, but that’s a different story. Let’s just get to the bottom of this illness, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is 130/80, heart rate is 88, and lungs sound clear, though a little fast breathing. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let’s check your sclera – that’s the whites of your eyes. Yes, definitely some jaundice present. The yellowing is quite noticeable. I'm going to order a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a G6PD enzyme assay. That last one will tell us if you have a deficiency. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any known allergies to medications. I've had antibiotics before, and haven’t had any problems. I just hope it's not something… permanent. What happens if it is a deficiency? What kind of treatment is there?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the allergies. If it is a G6PD deficiency, the main treatment is avoiding triggers – in your case, fava beans. There's no cure, but it's very manageable. If you have a severe reaction, like a rapid drop in your red blood cell count, you might need a blood transfusion, but that's not common. We'll know more once the results come back. I'm sending the lab orders now, and they should be able to get the results back relatively quickly, within a few hours. I'll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, try to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and absolutely avoid fava beans and anything that might contain them. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No fava beans, rest, and drink lots of fluids. And wait for your call. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a little better, knowing there’s something that can be done. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I just... I hope it’s not too serious. Could anything else trigger it, besides fava beans?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mande. And you're right to ask about other triggers. Certain medications can also trigger a reaction in people with G6PD deficiency, things like some antibiotics, antimalarials, and even some common pain relievers. That’s why it's so important for me to have a complete list of everything you're taking, even over-the-counter medications or supplements. For now, let's focus on avoiding fava beans. When I call with the results, we'll discuss creating a list of medications to avoid and make sure your primary care physician is aware of the diagnosis. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough. I’ll just wait for your call and try to rest. Thank you again for your help. I really appreciate it. I’ll go home now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mande. Get some rest, and don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you feel any worse. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Here’s a card with the clinic’s number. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
