DOCTOR: Hi Ricky, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, my foot… it’s been swelling up. Mostly just one of ‘em, the left one. It started a few days ago, I think maybe last Tuesday? It’s not painful painful, more like… achy, you know? And it feels kinda warm to the touch.
DOCTOR: Okay, achy and warm, starting last Tuesday on your left foot. That gives us a starting point. Just to confirm, you’re Ricky Parascanola, 60 years old, and I see here you’re uninsured. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that's me. And yeah, still no insurance. It’s… complicated, let’s just say that. Been meaning to look into it, but things always come up. You know how it is. Does it matter for just a swollen foot?
DOCTOR: It can matter, Ricky, because it affects what resources are available to us for testing and treatment options. Don't worry, we'll work with what we have. Okay, back to the foot. Can you tell me a little more about when the swelling started?
PATIENT: Like I said, I think it was Tuesday. I was doing some gardening, pulling weeds mostly. I didn't fall or anything, didn’t hit it on nothin’. Just… started feeling a little tight later that day. And then it just kept getting bigger. I thought maybe I just overdid it, but it hasn’t gone down much. I tried elevating it a bit, that didn't seem to help a whole lot either.
DOCTOR: Gardening on Tuesday… okay. And you haven’t noticed any injuries, like a twist or a bump?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. I really didn't do anything special that day. Just the usual weeding, bendin’ over, gettin’ back up. I always feel a little stiff after a good day in the garden, but this is… different. It’s not just stiffness, it’s like it’s fillin’ up with water, almost. That’s the best way I can describe it.
DOCTOR: Okay, “filling up with water” is a good way to put it. Have you noticed any redness or changes in the skin temperature besides it feeling warm?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… I haven’t really looked at it closely, to be honest. I just felt it. But now that you mention it, maybe it's a little red around the ankle. Not bright red, more… pinkish, I guess. And yeah, it definitely feels warmer than my other foot. I haven't been checkin’ the temp with a thermometer or anything, but you can feel it. It’s just… warm. A lot warmer than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, pinkish redness and warmth. Have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms like fatigue or muscle aches?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. I’ve been feelin’ a little tired lately, but I always am a little tired. I’m 60, Doctor! <chuckles softly> It’s just… old age, I reckon. No muscle aches, nothin’ like that. Just the foot. It’s mostly just annoying, you know? Makes it hard to get a good shoe on. And I like to walk, so… it's botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or muscle aches. Just the foot and some general fatigue. Have you had any problems with swelling in your legs or feet before?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, sometimes after a long flight my ankles get a little puffy, but it goes away pretty quick. Never anything like this though. This has been goin’ on for almost a week now, and it doesn’t seem to be gettin’ better. That’s what worried me enough to finally come in. It just feels… different. And I don’t want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good you came in. A week of persistent swelling is definitely worth checking out. Alright, Ricky, I'm going to take a look at your foot and feel around. Then I’ll check your pulses. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. Just let me know if you feel anything weird, I guess. I'm not really sure what you're lookin' for, but… just do what you gotta do. It doesn't hurt too bad, just a little achy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ricky, I’m feeling some definite warmth and tenderness around your ankle, especially on the inside. The swelling is most pronounced around your ankle bone. Your pulses are present, but slightly diminished on that foot compared to your right. I’m not hearing any crackling sounds or anything that would suggest an infection, but the swelling and tenderness are concerning. It’s possible this is a sprain, but given how long it’s been going on, and the diminished pulse, we need to rule out a blood clot. Do you have any pain in your calf when you flex your foot upwards?
PATIENT: Flex my foot upwards? Let me see… Ooh, yeah, that’s a little bit sore. Not awful, but definitely feels somethin’ there. Not like a sharp pain, more like a pullin’ sensation. It's in the back of my leg, kinda high up. Like… behind my knee, maybe? It's not somethin' I really noticed before today, to be honest. I just figured it was part of the foot achin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain in your calf when you flex your foot upwards is concerning. That, combined with the swelling, tenderness, and diminished pulse, raises my suspicion for a possible deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot in your leg. Now, I want to be very clear, Ricky: I’m not saying you definitely have a blood clot, but we need to investigate it immediately. A blood clot can be very serious if it travels to your lungs. We need to get an ultrasound of your leg right away. I can order that for you at the hospital. Do you have transportation to get to the hospital?
PATIENT: A blood clot?! Oh boy. That doesn't sound good at all. To my lungs, you say? No, I don't have a car. I usually take the bus, but… I don’t think I should be takin’ the bus if there’s a chance of a blood clot! What do I do? I live alone, Doctor. I don't have anyone to drive me. Maybe an ambulance? Is that what you're gonna tell me?
DOCTOR: You are right to be concerned, Ricky, and an ambulance is likely the safest option given your situation. We need to get you to the hospital quickly for that ultrasound. It’s better to be safe than sorry. I'm going to call 911 now to request an ambulance to your location. Do you know your address?
PATIENT: Yes, yes I do. It’s 142 Willow Creek Apartments, number 3B. Oh dear. This is… this is a lot. I haven’t been to the hospital in years. I just came in for a swollen foot! <chuckles weakly> I hope this isn't somethin’ too serious, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ricky, I’ve called 911 and an ambulance is on its way to Willow Creek Apartments. They should be there shortly. I’ve also alerted the hospital so they are expecting you. In the meantime, try to stay calm and avoid moving your leg as much as possible. The paramedics will assess you further and provide appropriate treatment. Do you have any allergies or medications you’re currently taking that I should inform the paramedics about?
PATIENT: No allergies, thank goodness. And… let me think… I take a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small dose, just 10 milligrams a day. And sometimes, if I’m really achy, I’ll take some ibuprofen. That’s it, I promise. Just the blood pressure pill and the ibuprofen when I need it. This is all happenin’ so fast, Doctor. I’m a bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. That’s very helpful. "Lisinopril 10mg daily and ibuprofen as needed. I’ve noted that for the paramedics." The paramedics will ask you these questions again, but it’s good to have it documented. You’ve done the right thing by coming in today, Ricky. We caught this early, and that’s important. Try to focus on that. They will take good care of you at the hospital. I’m going to stay with you until the ambulance arrives to make sure you’re comfortable. Do you have any questions for me before they get here?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. For takin’ me seriously. And for callin’ the ambulance. I was scared to death, honestly. I just thought it was a swollen foot. I hope it’s not somethin’ too bad. And… I hope this insurance thing doesn’t get in the way of gettin’ proper care. Maybe I should've looked into it sooner.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ricky. It's my job to take your concerns seriously, and you absolutely did the right thing by coming in. We’ll do everything we can to ensure you get the best possible care, regardless of insurance. The hospital has financial assistance programs, and we can explore those options as well. Here are the paramedics now. They will take excellent care of you. Remember to tell them about the Lisinopril and the ibuprofen. .
