DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s a bit embarrassing, but… well, I want to try for a baby. And I just… want to make sure everything works. You know? I lost my husband a few years back, and… things weren’t simple then, and I don’t want any complications now. I just want it to be easy, if that makes sense. I'm Carmaleta, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Carmaleta. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to ensure everything is in good order, especially given your circumstances. It's very wise to be proactive. And please, don’t feel embarrassed at all. This is a very common request, and we're happy to help. To start, could you tell me a little about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh, cycles. Honestly? They’re… regular-ish. I mean, they come. About every… month? I don’t really track them. I used to when I was younger, but after… everything… it just wasn’t a priority. I suppose they last… a normal amount of time? Look, I'm not good with details, okay? Is that a problem? I just want to know if I'm… broken or something.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a problem at all, Carmaleta. Many patients don’t track their cycles meticulously, and that’s perfectly alright. We can still gather the necessary information. “Regular-ish” is a good start. Could you perhaps give me a rough estimate of how often they occur – every 28 days, closer to 30, or maybe a bit longer?
PATIENT: Ugh. See, this is why I hate talking about this. Let me think… It feels like around 30 days, maybe a little longer. Sometimes they're early, sometimes they're late. Not very late, just… a few days. I really don't pay attention. Is there a test for all this? Can't you just… see if everything is okay? I haven't got all day, you know. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It can be difficult to recall these details, and I appreciate you sharing what you can. And yes, there are tests we can do. A simple blood test can give us a good overview of your hormone levels and ovarian reserve, which helps us understand how things are functioning. Before we order that, let me ask a few quick questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not that I recall. I mean, I had the usual childhood things, but nothing serious. A few UTIs over the years, maybe? And… well, I had a pretty bad bout of the flu last winter. But that's it. I'm generally healthy. I eat okay, I try to walk when I can, and I don't really drink or smoke. My husband… he wasn’t so healthy, so I always tried to take care of myself. Does that count? I'm not sure what you need to know, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you've been generally healthy, Carmaleta. And yes, taking care of yourself absolutely counts. No, you shouldn’t worry about knowing exactly what I need; that’s my job. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: Oh… well, there was that time I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. And… ugh… when my husband got sick, I was in the hospital with him a lot, of course. But I didn’t have anything done, not really. Just… supporting him. Is that what you mean? Honestly, this is all a bit… much. I just want to know if I can have a baby, not relive my whole life.
DOCTOR: You are doing wonderfully, Carmaleta. And I apologize if I’m pressing too much. It’s just important to have a complete picture, and I assure you, we will get there. Knowing about your husband’s illness is helpful context, thank you for sharing that. Now, just a couple more quick questions, and then we can talk about the blood tests. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I've taken all sorts of things over the years, and I haven't reacted to anything. Maybe a little heartburn with certain foods, but that's it. Really, I’m a pretty straightforward case. Can we just get to the tests already? I feel like I’m being interrogated. I have a hair appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. I understand your frustration and I apologize if I’m taking up too much of your time. We can certainly move on to the tests. Before we do, just one last quick area to cover: family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Everyone's got something. My grandmother had… I think it was diabetes. And my uncle, on my mother's side, had heart problems. Honestly, it's a long list. My mother always said everyone in our family has something wrong with them. It’s probably why I’m here in the first place. Look, can we please just do the tests? I really need to go. I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. You are right to want to get this moving. I’m sorry for all the questions. I just want to make sure we have all the necessary information. Okay, let’s order those blood tests. They will check your hormone levels and give us a good baseline. I’ll also order a complete blood count to assess your overall health. We can draw those here in the clinic. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, fine. Just get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can go. And please, don't tell me anything too complicated. Just tell me if everything is working, or if it isn't. I really don't need a lecture. Let's just do it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. That's perfectly reasonable. We'll keep it simple. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and then the results should be available in a few days. We’ll contact you as soon as they are. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. None. Just get it done. I really need to go now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Carmaleta. The nurse will be with you momentarily. Thank you for coming in today. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions later. .
