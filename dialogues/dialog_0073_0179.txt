DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. I believe it has to do with… the words. They do not come so easily now. It is… frustrating, yes? I find myself… searching. Not for what to say, but how to say it. It is difficult to explain, truly.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. "Words not coming easily" is… vague, unfortunately. Frustrating for you, certainly. But not terribly helpful for me. Let's try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific… yes, of course. It is… like a name, perhaps. On the tip of my tongue. Or… a thing. I know what it is, I use it all the time. But when I wish to say it… it escapes me. It is… recent, I think. Not always this way. It started… oh, maybe a few months ago? I do not keep good track of time, I confess. My wife… she did all of that.
DOCTOR: A few months… alright. And this happens with… all sorts of words, or specific ones?
PATIENT: It is… not everything. Common things, like “the” or “and” – those are fine. It is… the more… detailed words. Things about… my work, perhaps. Or… names of people I know. Not… close friends, usually. More… acquaintances. It is… very strange. I do not mean to be difficult, Doctor. I simply… cannot pinpoint it. It is like a fog, you understand?
DOCTOR: A fog. Right. So, mostly names and… work-related terminology?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… a good way to put it. Work… yes. Compensation, benefits… those are… tricky now. And the analysis… the job analysis part. I used to be very good at it. Very precise. Now… it is like speaking a language I have… forgotten a little bit of. It is… upsetting.
DOCTOR: Upsetting, yes. Well. Do you have any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past… medical history? I… I had a bad fall, perhaps ten years ago. Broke my wrist. Healed well, though. And… the usual things. Colds, flus… nothing serious. My wife… she always handled the doctor appointments. I was never one for… remembering details. And now… I do not believe there is… much else. I am generally a healthy man, or I was. Before… this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me see… No. No surgeries, I don't believe so. Not that I recall. Perhaps the wrist, when it broke... but it did not require… cutting, did it? Just a cast. A very uncomfortable cast. No, no surgeries. My wife… she would have remembered if there were.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That is… difficult. My parents… they passed away some time ago. Both from… old age, I think. Heart trouble, perhaps? I do not recall specifics. And… I have a sister, I believe. Somewhere. We are not close. I have not spoken to her in… many years. She is… very independent. I do not know if she has had any… health issues. I am sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. This is… all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications…? No. No medications. I… I do not believe so. I try to stay healthy, you see. Eat well. Walk every day. I did not… require much in the way of pills or… potions. Perhaps a vitamin now and then, but nothing… regular. My wife… she took some things for her… arthritis, I think. But I… no. Nothing for me.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, just to get a baseline. It's a fairly standard procedure. We'll check your reflexes, coordination, and some basic cognitive function. It won’t be… pleasant, but it will help rule out anything obvious. Please just follow my instructions as best you can.
PATIENT: Neurological…? Oh. I see. Instructions… yes, of course. I will try my best. I do not… like being poked and prodded, but… if it helps, I will cooperate. Please… be gentle? And perhaps explain what you are doing? It makes me… anxious, this uncertainty.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll explain everything as I go. It's quite straightforward. First, I'm going to test your reflexes. Please relax your arm… like this. Now, just let your leg fall loose. Don't try to resist.
PATIENT: Oh! That is… surprising. It jumped… did it not? Is that… normal? I do not usually… react like that. It feels… strange. A bit like an electric shock, perhaps? It is… unsettling. I hope it does not mean anything… serious?
DOCTOR: It’s within normal limits. Just assessing your reflexes. Now, I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes, but don’t move your head. Keep your gaze fixed on my finger. Do not blink, if possible.
PATIENT: It is… a little difficult. My eyes feel… tired. And the finger… it moves so quickly. I am trying, Doctor, I truly am. But it is… challenging to keep up. I feel… a little dizzy now, if I am honest. Is it alright if I blink? It feels… unnatural not to.
DOCTOR: Yes, blink if you need to. Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. Just answer to the best of your ability. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s… date? Oh dear. It is… August. Yes, I believe so. But the… number? I… I cannot recall the number. Is it the… second? Or the third? I am so sorry. This is… frustrating. I used to be very good with dates. My wife… she always said I had a good memory. Now… it seems to have… deserted me. It is the second, isn’t it? Or am I wrong?
DOCTOR: It is August 2nd. Never mind. Let's try something easier. Can you tell me the names of three objects in this room?
PATIENT: That… is a chair. And… That is… a desk. And… A lamp. Yes, that is a lamp. Is that… sufficient? It is… harder than it looks. I can see the objects, of course. But… naming them… it takes… effort. It is… strange. I used to be able to do this… without thinking.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this brief assessment, and your… self-reported difficulties, it appears you’re experiencing some mild cognitive impairment. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further testing. It could be age-related, stress-related, or something else entirely. I’m going to recommend a full neurological workup, including an MRI and a series of cognitive tests. I will also refer you to a neuropsychologist for a more detailed evaluation. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: MRI…? Neurological… workup? A neuropsychologist…? Oh dear. That sounds… rather serious, doesn’t it? Is it… bad? Is something… terribly wrong? I just wanted to know why I cannot find the words anymore. Is it my age, then? I am… not as young as I once was, I suppose. What… what will these tests involve? And… will they be painful? I… I am not good with hospitals. Or… needles. And… what if they find something… unpleasant? Oh, this is all… very unsettling. I… I do not know what to ask. It is… all a bit much to take in.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious. It's a precautionary measure. An MRI is a scan, no needles involved. It’s painless, although you'll have to lie very still in a rather loud machine. The neuropsychologist will give you some tests to assess your memory and cognitive function. Nothing invasive. As for finding something unpleasant… that’s why we're doing the tests, to find out what's going on. I'll give you a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Albright, and a neuropsychologist, Dr. Chen. Their offices will schedule the appointments and explain the procedures in detail. I’m going to prescribe a mild Vitamin B complex, it sometimes helps with cognitive function. I suggest you also try to reduce stress and engage in mentally stimulating activities, like puzzles or reading. Do you have any further questions, or shall I write up the referrals?
PATIENT: Puzzles… and reading. Yes, I suppose I could try that. My wife… she always enjoyed puzzles. Dr. Albright… and Dr. Chen. I will… write those names down. And the Vitamin B… yes, that sounds… sensible. Will… will I be able to… understand the results? I am not very good with… medical jargon. And… will they be able to… fix it? Can they… make the words come back? I… I just want to be able to… speak normally again. Yes, please… write up the referrals. I… I think that is all for now. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Here are the referrals and the prescription. Their offices will explain everything in detail, and yes, they will try to determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend a treatment plan. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Yes… thank you, Doctor. A good day… yes. I… I hope so. .
