DOCTOR: Hi Jahaad, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… this swelling, actually. It’s been a bit bothersome, and to be honest, I’m not entirely sure why it started. My memory isn’t the best, so I can’t recall anything specific that might have caused it.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling… that's a good place to start. And don't worry about the memory thing, it happens. We'll figure it out together. Can you tell me where exactly is this swelling located?
PATIENT: It’s… hmm. It feels like it’s mostly in my neck, on this side. And maybe a little bit around my jawline, but it’s hard to say for sure. It doesn’t hurt terribly, just… feels full, you know? It's been there for a few days, I think.
DOCTOR: Right side of the neck and jawline… okay. And you said a few days?
PATIENT: Yes, a few days. Though it's difficult to be precise. Time… it slips away sometimes. It wasn’t sudden, more like… I noticed it gradually getting bigger. I haven’t done anything to injure it, as far as I recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, gradually getting bigger, no injury… that's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, perhaps. And… is it just me, or is it harder to swallow sometimes? It’s not painful, exactly, just… requires a little more effort. I wouldn’t say it's severe, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some difficulty swallowing. We'll definitely look into that. Before we do a physical exam, let me ask a few more general questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… that’s a good question. As far as I know, no. I don’t think I have any allergies. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, not that I remember. I’ve had the usual vaccinations, but beyond that… no allergies, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I generally try to avoid medication if I can. I prefer… well, I don't really have a strong preference, I just haven't needed anything recently. Just the occasional vitamin D in the winter, perhaps. But nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, let's do a quick exam. I’ll just take a look at your neck and feel for any abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I trust your expertise, Doctor. Whatever you need me to do, just let me know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some slight swelling in the right side of your neck, as you mentioned. There are a couple of lymph nodes that feel a little enlarged, but they aren’t particularly firm or tender. Your thyroid feels normal in size and consistency. I'm not detecting any other obvious abnormalities. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It's… not painful. Just a bit of pressure, maybe. It’s not uncomfortable enough to make me pull away, but I can feel it, certainly. It's… difficult to describe. Just a dull sensation. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Not particularly painful, just a dull sensation… Okay. Given the swelling, the enlarged lymph nodes, and the difficulty swallowing, it could be a few things. It could be a simple infection, like a viral illness, or it could be something else. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a few blood tests. They'll help us rule out any serious causes and determine if there’s an infection present. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps to figure things out, then absolutely. Blood tests are fine. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I’m trusting your judgment. Will I need to fast beforehand? Or are there any specific preparations I should make?
DOCTOR: Good. No need to fast for these tests. Just drink plenty of water beforehand. I'll give you a lab order slip, and the phlebotomist will take care of everything. They'll draw a small amount of blood, and the results should be back within a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if the swelling gets significantly worse, you develop a fever, or you have trouble breathing, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds manageable. Drink plenty of water, no fasting… I can do that. And I’ll keep an eye out for worsening symptoms, fever, breathing difficulties - all of that. No, I don’t think I have any questions at this moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. Perhaps… just one small thing. Will the results be sent to my insurance automatically? Or will I need to provide them with something?
DOCTOR: Yes, the results will be sent directly to your insurance provider. I'll also have a copy sent to my office, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. Do you have any preferences for how we communicate those results - phone call, email, or another appointment?
PATIENT: An appointment would be best, I think. I… I tend to forget details easily, so having a face-to-face discussion would be much more helpful. It’s just… easier for me to process information that way. And it allows me to ask any questions I might have, without… losing track of them. If that’s alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that's perfectly alright. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from now. That should give the lab enough time to process the results. We can go over everything in detail then. Here's the lab order slip. The phlebotomist is just down the hall. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time and patience, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so thoroughly. I’ll head down the hall now. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. Take care, and I'll see you next week. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day as well.
