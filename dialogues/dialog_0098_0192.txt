DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, good morning. Hartness, Delron Hartness. Look, it’s pretty simple, really. I’m here for this… exam. For the army. Gotta get this done, you know? They want me to take it before… well, before anything else happens. Don't really see what the big deal is, I’ve always been a healthy guy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. An exam for the army… I see. And you said you generally consider yourself to be in good health?
PATIENT: Generally? Yeah. Look, I work with engines all day, keeps a man busy. Lifting, turning… all that. Not like some folks sitting around doing nothing. Never been sick much, if that’s what you mean. A little sniffle now and then, but nothing a good Swedish winter hasn't cured. I haven't needed a doctor for… well, a long time. Not counting the dentist, obviously.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And when did you last see a dentist, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Uh… last year, I think? Maybe the year before. It’s… regular. Every couple years. Just a check-up, nothing fancy. Keeps the teeth in order, you know? Important for chewing. Though, honestly, I don't see why this army doctor needs to know about my teeth. Seems a bit much. Is this standard procedure?
DOCTOR: It is fairly standard, Mr. Hartness. A complete health assessment is important before starting any new physically demanding activity, even if you feel perfectly well. It helps us establish a baseline and identify any potential issues that might need addressing. As for the teeth… well, some medical conditions can be detected through oral health, and certain medications can affect your mouth. It’s a fairly comprehensive process. Now, could you tell me about any major illnesses or surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Surgeries? Hmm… Let me think. Not much, really. When I was a boy, I had… the measles, I think. And chickenpox. Everyone got those back then. Nothing serious. As for surgeries… I had my tonsils out when I was young. That's about it. Really. Nothing since. I’m a pretty tough Swede, you know? Don’t break easily. I remember being back on my feet within a week after the tonsils. Doctors these days make too much fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, measles and chickenpox as a child, tonsillectomy… and no other significant illnesses or surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Oh, you mean my wife’s family? They’re a bit… delicate, if you want my honest opinion. Her mother had… something with her heart, I think. Always complaining. And her brother had problems with his… digestion, maybe? Always moaning about his stomach. But my side of the family? Strong as an ox, every one of us. My father lived to be ninety, working on the farm his whole life. So, no. Nothing runs in my family. Strong genes, that’s what it is. You won't find any weakness there.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. So, we have some potential cardiac history on your wife’s side, and digestive issues as well. And you feel your side of the family is generally healthy. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I eat anything, take anything. I’ve never had a problem. I’m a simple man. I don't fuss about. Dust bothers me a bit, maybe, if it’s really thick. But that’s not an allergy, that’s just… dust. My wife is the one with all the… sensitivities. She can't eat this, can't eat that… It's exhausting, honestly. But I don't have allergies. Never have, never will. A proper Swede doesn’t believe in allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not a one. I don’t believe in filling my body with all sorts of chemicals. My wife takes something for her… nerves, I think. And something else for her… back. But I don’t need any of that. A strong cup of coffee in the morning is all the medicine I need. And maybe a little liniment for my shoulders after a long day working on those engines. But that's it. All natural. A proper man relies on his own strength, not pills and potions.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications currently. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I eat. I sleep. It’s pretty straightforward. I work on engines all day, six days a week. It's honest work, keeps me busy. I eat a good, solid Swedish meal – potatoes, meat, vegetables. Nothing fancy. And I sleep well enough. Not as much as I used to, maybe. But who needs ten hours of sleep? A man’s got things to do. My wife likes to garden. And watch… those television programs. But my lifestyle is simple. A good, hard worker. What more is there to say?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. That's helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask about smoking, alcohol consumption, and… recreational drug use. It's important for a complete assessment. These questions are confidential, of course.
PATIENT: Now that’s a question. Look, are you suggesting I spend my time with… those sorts of things? I work hard, I provide for my family. I don't have time for foolishness. I might have a beer with my friends on a Saturday night. A proper Swedish lager. But that’s it. And I certainly don't smoke. Never have. Bad for the lungs, you know? As for… recreational drugs… That’s preposterous! I'm a respectable man. Do you really think I’d be wasting my time with… that? Honestly, the nerve! I’m here for the army, not… Let’s just say I live a clean and honest life. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Hartness, that is more than enough. I apologize if my questions were… intrusive. It's simply protocol, a standard part of a health assessment. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I haven’t got all day. Honestly, all this fuss over nothing. I’ve always been perfectly healthy. Just a waste of time, really. But if you have to… just be quick about it. And don't poke around too much. Let’s go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Just hurry up. This cuff feels…tight already. I always hate this part. Feels like it’s cutting off my circulation. Is this going to take long? I’ve got things to do, you know. Engines don’t fix themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay… Your blood pressure is 145 over 90. A bit elevated, but we’ll keep that in mind. Your pulse is 78, regular. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, if you don’t mind. I’m going to need you to take a few deep breaths for me. Breathing sounds are clear, but I detect a slight murmur. It's faint, but worth noting. Is there any history of heart problems in your family that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: A murmur? What does that even mean? And my heart is perfectly fine. Always has been. As for family history… well, my wife's mother had some…trouble with her heart, I think. Complained a lot, always. But my side of the family? Strong as an ox, every one of them. My father worked on that farm until he was ninety. Didn’t need a doctor for anything. And that's that. Look, are you sure you're reading this right? It must be a mistake. I don’t have heart problems. I'm a Swede! We’re built tough.
DOCTOR: It’s possible it’s a normal variation, Mr. Hartness, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Now, let me take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears look clear. Nasal passages are clear. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Now, could you open your mouth and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: Ah. Is that good enough? Look, this is ridiculous. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. I eat a good diet, I work hard, I sleep enough. There’s nothing wrong with me. Are you going to find something now, just to justify all this poking and prodding? Honestly, it’s… insulting. Just get it over with. I've got engines waiting.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Your tonsils are gone, as you mentioned. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please sit with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor?
PATIENT: Fine. But honestly, this is a complete waste of my time. What could possibly be wrong? This whole thing is… well, it’s just silly. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay… Your reflexes are slightly diminished, but not significantly. Now, could you please stand up and try to walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? Is that slow enough for you? I’ve been working on engines all day, my knees are a bit stiff, that’s all. Perfectly normal. I don’t see what all this fuss is about. Honestly, it’s… Is there a point to all this, or are you just trying to find something that isn't there?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I’ve completed the physical exam. Your overall health appears generally good, but I did note a few things: elevated blood pressure, a slight heart murmur, diminished reflexes, and some stiffness in your gait. Given these findings, I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of your condition. Specifically, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an electrocardiogram to assess your heart function, and a urine analysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Look, are you serious? I came here for a simple exam for the army, not to be poked and prodded like some… some laboratory rat! I told you, I'm perfectly healthy. This is a complete waste of my time and money. What exactly are you hoping to find? Honestly, it’s… insulting. I don’t need tests. I need to get back to my engines. This whole thing is ridiculous. I’m not paying for tests. Just… just forget it. I’m leaving. I’ll get the exam somewhere else. I don’t trust this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, please. I understand your frustration, but these tests are important. Even if you feel perfectly well, it's crucial to identify any potential underlying issues before starting a physically demanding activity. Ignoring these findings could have serious consequences. I’m not trying to upset you, I’m trying to ensure your safety. However, if you’re absolutely opposed to the tests, I respect your decision. But I strongly recommend you discuss these findings with another physician before proceeding with the army exam. I have a feeling that they may want this. I can write you a referral to a cardiologist and a general practitioner if you’d like. It will give them a clearer picture of what I found. Would that be okay?
