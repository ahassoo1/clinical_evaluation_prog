DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… muscle weakness, really. It’s been getting worse for a few weeks now. Hard to explain exactly, but things just feel… heavy. Like I’m always tired, even when I’ve slept.
DOCTOR: “Heavy,” you say. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Like… lifting things, even small things, takes a lot more effort than it used to. It’s not painful, exactly, just… draining. And it’s not just my arms, it’s kinda all over, but mostly my legs, I guess. Makes getting up from a chair a real chore. I work as an insurance appraiser, so I’m on my feet a lot, checking out cars… and it’s making that harder and harder.
DOCTOR: And when did you first start noticing this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably around the beginning of July. Maybe the tenth? Yeah, around July 10th. It was just a little thing at first, thought I was just tired from a long week. But it hasn’t gone away, and like I said, it's gotten worse since then. It's pretty consistent, too. Doesn't seem to be any better or worse on certain days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. Not really. I’ve been a little more thirsty than usual, maybe? But I live in Arizona, so that could just be the heat. No fever, no dizziness, no… anything else that really stands out. Oh! Actually, now that I think about it, I've been a bit clumsier than normal. Dropped my phone a couple times, tripped over the rug. But I always was a little bit of a klutz, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “A bit of a klutz,” you say. Has this clumsiness been a recent development, or is it something you’ve always experienced?
PATIENT: It's… more recent, I think. I mean, I’ve always been a little uncoordinated, but not like this. It's more… frequent. And I haven’t fallen or anything, just… dropping things, bumping into furniture. Little things, really. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but it's adding to the frustration, you know? It’s just another thing making everything harder.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. Had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. But no chronic illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. That’s why this is so strange. And I haven't been taking any medications regularly. Just ibuprofen for headaches sometimes.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a tough one. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mom, she had some arthritis when she got older. But nothing really serious, nothing genetic that I know of. I don't really keep track of that sort of thing, if I'm honest. We weren't very close, and I don't know much about my grandparents' medical history at all. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I don't drink, either. And definitely no drugs. I keep pretty clean, if you know what I mean. I'm a pretty simple guy. Just work, and try to stay out of trouble. This whole weakness thing is really throwing me off. I just want to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this sorted out, if possible. Let’s get it over with. I’ve got a lot of claims to process this week. No offense, Doctor, but I'm trying to keep my schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Yeah, no problem. Just let me know if it's too hard. It's kinda hard to judge how much force I'm using, honestly. I don’t want to break anything. But I'm trying.
DOCTOR: Now, let's check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger, alternating back and forth?
PATIENT: Okay. It's a little harder than it looks. Sorry if I'm messing it up. My hands just feel… clumsy today, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. “Heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.” Mr. McKinnon, based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, I’m concerned about possible weakness, and the mild coordination issues. Given your symptoms and the fact that you're uninsured, I want to order some basic blood work to start. We’ll check your electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, blood sugar, and complete blood count. This will help us rule out some common causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, blood work sounds… reasonable. As long as it doesn't take too long. I really need to get back to work. And… how much is it gonna cost? I don’t have insurance, so I’m kinda worried about the bill. I don’t want a surprise. I just want to know what's wrong, and fix it, if possible.
DOCTOR: The cost of the blood work will be approximately $150 to $200, depending on the lab. We can discuss payment options with the billing department. I understand your concern. These tests are the most efficient way to begin diagnosing the cause of your weakness. We’ll also look at your vitamin D level, as deficiency can cause similar symptoms. If the blood work is normal, we may need to consider further testing, such as a neurological evaluation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay, $200… that's… manageable, I guess. As long as it's all that's needed for now. And yeah, vitamin D sounds good. I don’t spend a lot of time in the sun. I'm a bit of an indoor person, to be honest. So, yeah. Blood work, then see what happens. I just want a clear answer. And quickly, if possible. I’ve got deadlines.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. I’ll have the lab technician draw your blood now. They’re just down the hall. Once the results are back—usually within 24 to 48 hours—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I’ll also provide you with a printout of the lab orders. In the meantime, if your weakness worsens, or you experience any new symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, fever, or severe pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… get it done quickly, please. And thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you not keeping me all day. Let’s just get the blood drawn, and I’ll be on my way.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab technician is ready for you. Just follow the hallway to your right. They’ll take it from there. Have a good day, Mr. McKinnon.
