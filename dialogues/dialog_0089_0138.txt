DOCTOR: Good morning, Alayne. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, my daughter, bless her heart, she was worried. I’ve been having… little spells, I suppose you’d call them. Mostly just weakness on one side, it feels like. And my family… there's been a lot of bad headaches, terrible migraines, on my mother’s side. That's what she was concerned about, anyway. It all feels a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, "little spells" and weakness on one side… and a family history of migraines. That’s a good place to start. When you say weakness, can you tell me exactly where on your side you're feeling it?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a good question. It… comes and goes, you know? But mostly… it’s my right side. My arm feels heavy sometimes, and my leg… it just doesn’t feel as strong. Not all the time, though. Just… moments. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… doesn’t work right, if that makes sense? And it's not every day. Some days I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent weakness on the right side – arm and leg. No pain, just a feeling of not working right, and it comes and goes. That's helpful. Now, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a tricky one. It feels like… a while now. Maybe a few months? It started so gradually, I didn’t really pay much attention at first. Just thought I was getting old, you know? My daughter kept telling me I should get it checked out, though, so here I am. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, honestly. Everything feels a bit… mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few months of gradually worsening intermittent weakness on the right side. And your daughter encouraged you to come in – good for her! Now, aside from the weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Let me think. Well, I have been getting headaches, yes. Not terrible, like my mother’s. More of a dull ache, really, at the back of my head. And… sometimes I feel a little dizzy. Not falling-down dizzy, just… off balance. And my vision… sometimes it gets a little blurry. But that could just be my glasses needing an adjustment, I suppose. I'm getting to be an old lady with a lot of little problems, it seems!
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches – dull ache at the back of the head, dizziness, and blurry vision. We'll definitely look into all of those. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a little pill for it every day, I think. And… I had my gallbladder taken out a long time ago, but that was ages and ages ago. Other than that… not much, I don’t think. I forget a lot these days, you know. It's terrible. I hope my daughter told you everything. She's very organized, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and gallbladder removal long ago. That’s good to know. And don't worry about forgetting – it's very common. I can always double-check with your daughter if needed. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... besides the pill for my blood pressure... I think I take a vitamin D one. My daughter gave it to me, said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. And... Oh, here! This one. It's for my joints. She said I should take it for my arthritis, but honestly, I forget half the time. It's Glucosamine, I think it's called. I hope I’m not forgetting anything important. It’s hard to keep track, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication, Vitamin D, and Glucosamine for your joints. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not that I know of, dear. I’ve never really had any bad reactions to anything. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle with pollen sometimes, but nothing serious. I’m not allergic to penicillin or anything like that, I don’t think. My daughter would have told me if I was, wouldn’t she? She’s very careful about those things. I haven't had any trouble with food either, thankfully. I still enjoy a good pasta dish, you know!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… That’s what my daughter was worried about, mostly. My mother, bless her soul, she had terrible migraines. Absolutely dreadful. She was bedridden for days sometimes. And… my uncle, on my father’s side, he had a stroke, I think. A long time ago. And… there was a cousin, maybe, who had something with their heart. But honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy. Everyone always talked about the migraines, though. Those were the big worry. It's a bit of a messy family tree, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of migraines in your mother and a stroke in an uncle. That’s helpful. Now, just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, dear! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were terrible for you, and she was right about most things. And… I might have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, a very small glass. But that's it. And… definitely no drugs, no. Never have, never will. I'm a simple woman, Doctor. Just pasta and a little bit of sunshine, that’s all I need.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, very minimal alcohol use, and no drug use. Good to know. Okay, Alayne, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don’t mind. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. Go right ahead. I'm a bit of a worrier, you know, so the more you check, the better I'll feel.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, that's 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished on your right side, and your grip strength is noticeably weaker on your right hand. I'm also noticing some slight facial droop on the right side. It’s very subtle, but it's there. Do you feel any numbness or tingling in your right arm or leg?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… serious. Numbness… not exactly. But sometimes my right hand feels… clumsy. Like I can't quite get it to do what I want. And… now that you mention it, my right leg does feel a bit… heavy sometimes. Not all the time, though. Just when I’ve been walking for a while. Is that… bad? I’m starting to get a little worried now, dear.
DOCTOR: Okay, clumsiness in the right hand and heaviness in the right leg. That’s consistent with what I’m seeing. Alayne, based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of a transient ischemic attack – sometimes called a mini-stroke – or possibly an early stroke. It’s too early to say definitively, but the facial droop, the weakness, and the diminished reflexes are concerning. We need to get some imaging done immediately to rule this out. I’m going to order a stat CT scan of your brain and an MRI. This will help us to see if there’s any damage and determine the best course of treatment. I'm also going to order some blood tests to check your overall health and rule out any other potential causes. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a stroke? That sounds… frightening. CT scan and MRI… yes, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I… I don’t know much about these things. Is it… serious? Will I… will I be okay? I just want to go home and have a nice pasta dinner. But if this is what I need to do… please, tell me what happens next. I trust you, dear.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be frightened, Alayne, and it's good that we're taking this seriously. While it could be a stroke, it could also be something else. The imaging will give us the answers we need. The sooner we get the results, the sooner we can start any necessary treatment. We're going to get you admitted to the hospital right away. They have a stroke unit there with specialists who can provide the best possible care. They'll monitor your vital signs and repeat the neurological exam regularly. I will call ahead to let them know you're coming and what I suspect, so they're prepared. As for whether you'll be okay, it's too early to say definitively. But strokes are treatable, and the sooner treatment is started, the better the outcome. We’re going to do everything we can to help you, Alayne. I will be following your case closely. Do you have anyone we can contact for you?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That’s… reassuring. My daughter, bless her heart. She’s the one who brought me in. Her name is Sofia Tofani, and her number is… 555-123-4567. She’ll be so worried. Please, tell her I’m okay… or as okay as I can be right now. And… will I be able to eat pasta again? That's all I really want, you know. A nice big plate of pasta.
DOCTOR: I will call Sofia right away and let her know what's happening. I'll tell her you're in good hands, and we're doing everything we can. And yes, absolutely, you will be able to eat pasta again. We'll make sure you get back to enjoying all your favorite foods. Right now, we need to focus on getting you the care you need, but we’ll get you back to pasta dinners as soon as we can. I'm going to have a nurse come in and get you prepped for transport to the hospital. They’ll explain everything to you along the way. I'll stay with you for a few more minutes to answer any other questions you have, and then I'll go ahead to the hospital to meet the team and ensure everything is ready for your arrival. Don’t worry, you’re not alone in this. We’re going to take care of you, Alayne.
