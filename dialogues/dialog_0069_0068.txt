DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well… it’s my leg. It’s been swelling up. It started after… after the treatment. For the… you know. The cancer. It’s just… puffy. And a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. I understand. Your leg is swelling, and it started after your cancer treatment. “Puffy” and uncomfortable, you said. That's good information to start with. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about the treatment you had?
PATIENT: Oh… the treatment. Hmm. It was… a lot of… visits. With the… machines. They gave me… stuff through the vein. And then the machines… they made noises. A big room. It was… a long time ago now, I think. Maybe… two years? It made me very tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, two years ago. Sounds like you had radiation and chemotherapy. That can definitely have some lasting effects. And you’re right to bring it up, as swelling can be related. Just to clarify, is the swelling in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Oh! Just one. The left one. The right one is… fine. I can walk, mostly. But at the end of the day… it feels heavy. And it looks… bigger, you know? Not huge, but… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the left leg. And it feels heavy at the end of the day and looks a bit bigger. That's helpful. Have you noticed any pain with the swelling, Sasha?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It's more… achey. A dull ache. Especially if I… stand for too long. Or if it's very hot outside. But not, like, sharp pain. It’s… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache that's worse with standing and heat. No sharp pain. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your left leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. It might be a little… red sometimes. But I get bug bites a lot, so it's hard to tell. And sometimes it feels… warm to the touch, I guess? But I'm not sure if that’s normal. I get hot easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible redness and a feeling of warmth. It's good you mentioned the bug bites; that’s important to consider. Let’s do a quick exam of your legs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I want to get it figured out. It’s just… worrying, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sasha. I understand your worry, and we will do our best to figure this out. Please, have a seat here, and I’ll take a look. Okay. I'm noticing some mild swelling in your left lower leg, as you described. There is some warmth to the touch and a little bit of redness, but nothing dramatic. I am feeling a slight indentation when I press on the leg – that’s what we call pitting edema. Your pulses in both legs feel normal. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing lymphedema. This is swelling that can happen after cancer treatment, particularly if lymph nodes were removed or damaged during the process. It’s caused by a buildup of fluid in the tissues. However, to rule out other possibilities, like a blood clot, I would like to order a Duplex ultrasound of your left leg. It’s a non-invasive test that can look at the blood flow in your veins. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lym… what did you call it? Lymp…edema? Oh. That sounds… serious. Is it… bad? A blood clot… that does sound bad! Um… an ultrasound sounds… okay, I guess. If you think it's necessary. I don’t want anything… serious happening. Is it expensive? I just have Medicare.
DOCTOR: Lymphedema can be managed, Sasha, and it's not necessarily serious in the sense that it's immediately life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can lead to other complications. That’s why we want to investigate and address it properly. A blood clot is what we want to rule out because it can be serious. Let's focus on getting the ultrasound done first. As for the cost, Medicare generally covers ultrasounds when they are medically necessary, which this would be. There may be a co-pay or deductible, depending on your specific plan, but our billing department can look into that for you and give you a clear estimate before the test. Would you like me to have them contact you?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That's… reassuring, a little bit. If it's not immediately bad, that’s good. Yes, please. Have the billing people… call me. They can explain it better. My number is… 555-1212. And my name is Sasha Queener, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha, I've made a note of your number and name. I’ll have the billing department reach out to you to discuss the cost of the ultrasound. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I recommend elevating your left leg whenever possible. You can prop it up on a pillow when you're sitting or lying down. And gentle exercise, like walking, can help improve circulation. Avoid tight clothing or jewelry on your left leg. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: Elevate it… okay. I can do that. And walk… yes. That makes sense. Um… is there anything I should be looking for? Like… a sign that it's getting worse? Or something I should call about right away? I just… I don't want to ignore anything.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Sasha. It's always best to be proactive. You should call immediately if you experience any of the following: Sudden or severe pain in your left leg. Redness or warmth that spreads quickly. Fever or chills. Shortness of breath or chest pain. Also, if the swelling gets significantly worse very quickly, even without pain, it’s best to get it checked out. We'll get the ultrasound scheduled as quickly as possible. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment, which may include compression stockings, physical therapy, or other options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… very thorough. Thank you, Doctor. I will watch for those things. And I’ll try to… elevate it. I feel a little better knowing… what to look for. I think… that’s everything. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease a little. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your ultrasound appointment. Take care of yourself, and we'll get this sorted out. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
