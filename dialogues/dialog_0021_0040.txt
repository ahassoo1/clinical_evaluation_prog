DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Havird. Well, it’s this pain in my side again, mostly on my left. And… I seem to be getting those water infections quite often now, too. It’s been going on for a while, on and off, but it feels more frequent lately.
DOCTOR: “Side pain, and frequent water infections… right.” Frequent how frequent, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… every couple of months, for the water infections. Sometimes a bit more often, sometimes less. And the pain… it comes and goes, doesn’t really follow a pattern. It's just… uncomfortable, you know? Sometimes it's a dull ache, other times it’s sharper. I try to ignore it, but it gets tiring.
DOCTOR: “Every couple of months…right.” And this pain, is it constant, or does something trigger it?
PATIENT: It’s not constant, no. Not usually. I haven’t really noticed anything specific that causes it, to be honest. Sometimes it comes on after I’ve been doing a bit of work in the garden, but other times… nothing at all. Just… appears. I don’t think it’s anything serious, but it’s worrying me a bit getting older, you know? I just want to make sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: “Right, no obvious triggers.” Okay. And you said frequent water infections. Any fever, chills, or blood in your urine with those?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no fever or chills. And no blood in the urine, not that I’ve noticed. Just the usual… burning sensation when I go to the toilet, and feeling like I need to go all the time, even when there isn't much there. It’s just… a nuisance, really. I’ve been taking some over-the-counter stuff, but it doesn’t seem to be getting rid of it properly anymore.
DOCTOR: “Over-the-counter stuff…” What exactly are you taking?
PATIENT: Oh, just those cranberry tablets, and sometimes some of those urinary tract infection relief sachets from the chemist. The ones that turn the water pink. They help a little bit, but the feeling always comes back. I didn’t want to bother you unless it got really bad, you know? I thought maybe it was just something I could manage myself.
DOCTOR: “Right.” And have you ever had any proper tests done for these infections?
PATIENT: Tests? Well… the doctor at the clinic back home, he sometimes just gave me some antibiotics when I told him about them. He didn’t really do much testing, if I’m honest. Just asked me a few questions and gave me a prescription. That was a few years ago now, though. I moved here a while back and haven’t really found a regular doctor since.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so no recent urine cultures, then.” Alright, Mr. Espinueva, let’s do a quick examination, and then I think we’ll need to get some tests done to figure out what's going on with both the pain and these infections. Can you step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds sensible. I hope it's nothing too serious. I just want to get back to my gardening, really. It's the only thing that keeps me going these days.
DOCTOR: 116 pounds… Okay. Now, if you could lie down on the examination table, please. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything. I’m not very flexible anymore, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, a little bit there, on the left. Not terrible, but… noticeable. It’s that same area where I usually get the pain. A dull ache, really. Not sharp, but uncomfortable. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what about here?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit there too, but not as bad as on the left. It’s… hard to explain, Doctor. It’s like a deep ache, sort of. It’s not a sudden sharp pain, it just… feels uncomfortable. I’m probably just being a worrywart, to be honest. I always think the worst.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is a little tender on the left side, as you said. Now, I'm just going to quickly check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I trust your judgement. I just want to know what's going on, so I can get it sorted.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Lower back is a little sensitive, but not significantly so. Now, I think we need to get a urine sample to rule out any infection, and I'm going to order a blood test just to get a baseline. We might need to do some imaging, depending on the results of those.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. That’s good. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I’ve got a little cup with me, haven’t I? I just hope it’s not anything too serious. I’m not very good with hospitals, you know. Makes me a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: “Right.” Yes, that’ll be fine. I’ll leave you to collect the sample in private. There’s a bathroom just down the hall. Please wash your hands thoroughly before and after, and try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect the sample a few seconds later. Once you’ve done that, just bring it back to me, and we'll get it sent off to the lab. I’ll also have the nurse draw some blood. It will be a few days until we get the results.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Mid-stream… right. I think I remember what that means. I’ll be back in a moment. I just hope I can do it properly. I haven’t done one of these in years.
DOCTOR: “Take your time.” I’ll be right here when you get back. Let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: There you go, Doctor. It wasn't easy, but I think I managed it. It’s a bit cloudy, but… I did my best. I’m not very coordinated these days, you know. I hope that’s alright.
DOCTOR: “Right.” A little cloudy, yes. That's not ideal, but we can still send it off to the lab. I’ll just have the nurse come in and draw some blood, then we'll wait for the results. It will take a few days, and we'll go from there. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids, and avoid caffeine and alcohol. If you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… hopefully it’s nothing too serious. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I was getting a bit worried, to be honest. So thank you. I'll try to drink more water, and avoid those things. Just waiting now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Right.” Well, we’ll get those tests done, and we’ll figure out what’s going on. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Havird. I appreciate your kindness. I'll be waiting for your call. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: “You’re welcome, Mr. Espinueva.” Have a good day to you as well. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. .
