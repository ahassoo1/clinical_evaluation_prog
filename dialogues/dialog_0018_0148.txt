DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Stilaire. It is lovely to meet you as well. Oh… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having some… pain. Down there. In… well, you know. The… testicular region. It's been on and off, and I wasn’t quite sure who to see about it. It’s a bit awkward, really. I hope you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t feel embarrassed at all, Ms. Stepro. Your health is my primary concern, and we address all concerns with the same level of care and respect here. It’s good you came in to get this checked out. It’s certainly not awkward to seek medical attention. Just to clarify, you mentioned pain in the testicular region. As a woman, that is… unusual. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You’re right, aren’t you? That is unusual. I… I suppose I’ve been a bit confused lately. It’s all rather hazy, honestly. I'm not entirely sure why I’m feeling pain there. Let me see… it’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, thankfully. It comes and goes, like a… a muscle ache, perhaps? Sometimes it feels heavy, other times just… uncomfortable. It’s hard to explain. It’s been happening for… well, a few weeks, I think? Maybe longer. Everything feels a bit mixed up. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Ms. Stepro. It’s perfectly alright to be vague when describing discomfort, and it’s common for things to feel mixed up, especially when experiencing new symptoms. We'll work through this together. To help me understand better, could you tell me if anything specifically triggers the pain, or makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, to be honest. It doesn’t seem to be related to activity, or… anything I’ve eaten, or… anything at all, really. It just comes and goes. Sometimes it’s there when I wake up, sometimes after I’ve been sitting for a while, sometimes when I’m walking. It doesn’t seem to follow any pattern. Oh… wait. Now that you mention it… I think it might be a little worse after I’ve been doing a lot of work with the wood. But I do quite a bit of physical labor, so it’s hard to say for sure. It's just a thought.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Stepro. Woodworking, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I work with wood. Mostly furniture repair and restoration. I’ve been doing it for… oh, goodness, a very long time. It keeps me busy, and I enjoy it. But it is rather physical, as I said. Lots of lifting, bending, and… well, using my hands a lot. I suppose it's possible it could be related. I just… I don’t understand why that area would be affected.
DOCTOR: I understand your confusion, Ms. Stepro. It's certainly atypical. Now, to get a more comprehensive picture, let’s go over some of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history… that’s… difficult. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Let me think… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it was managed with medication for a while. I stopped taking it… oh, I can’t remember when. And I had my gallbladder removed… a long time ago. Other than that… I really can’t recall anything significant. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stepro. We can work with what you remember. Knowing about the blood pressure and gallbladder removal is very helpful. Do you happen to know what medication you were on for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a very good question. I really don’t. I remember the little pills… they were white, I think. And I took them every morning. But the name… I have absolutely no idea. I’m so sorry. My daughter used to manage my medications, but… well, it’s been a while since she’s been involved. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Ms. Stepro. That's precisely what medical records are for. I’ll take a look at your electronic health record to see if we can find that information. Now, let’s talk about any current medications you are taking. Do you take any vitamins, supplements, or over-the-counter medications regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I take a multivitamin every day. Just a standard one, for older people, I suppose. And sometimes, when my joints are acting up, I take ibuprofen. Just the over-the-counter kind. Nothing prescribed. I usually take two, if needed. That’s it, I think. Unless… oh! Sometimes I take a little something for sleep. Melatonin, I believe it’s called. But only when I’m having trouble sleeping, which isn't very often.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, and melatonin occasionally. Very helpful, Ms. Stepro. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I’m not allergic to penicillin, I think I remember being told that once. Other than that… no, I don’t have any known allergies. I’m pretty lucky, in that regard.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Stepro. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… that's another tricky one. My family… well, they weren't very forthcoming about medical things, if I’m honest. My mother… she had some heart trouble, I think. And my father… he had something with his stomach, but I don’t know what. I have a sister, but we haven’t spoken in years, so I don’t know anything about her health. I’m afraid I can’t be much help with that, either.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Stepro. Family medical history can be difficult to ascertain. We'll proceed with what we have. Now, just to get a better understanding of your overall well-being, could you briefly describe your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, well… I try to stay active, as I mentioned with the woodworking. I walk a bit when the weather is nice. I live alone, so I do most things on my own. I eat fairly healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables. I used to enjoy gardening, but my back isn’t what it used to be. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I suppose you could say I live a quiet life. A bit lonely, sometimes, but… peaceful.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very balanced life, Ms. Stepro. And it’s good you stay active. Now, given your description of the pain and the information you’ve provided, I'd like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. I understand it’s necessary. I… I suppose I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. But I trust your judgment. Please, proceed when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stepro. We'll take everything at your pace. I'm going to start with a general examination - checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll need to examine your abdomen and, with your permission, perform a gentle examination of the area where you're experiencing discomfort. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable at any point. First, let's start with your vital signs. Could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I can sit up. Please, take your time. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142/88 mmHg, your pulse is 78 beats per minute, and your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Your temperature is 98.6°F. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I'm palpating your abdomen now… There is some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no significant guarding or rebound tenderness. Now, I'm going to gently examine the area you mentioned. There's a slight sensitivity upon palpation in the right lower quadrant, but no palpable masses. Do you feel any pain specifically when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s a little uncomfortable. Not sharp, but… a dull ache, like the pain I’ve been describing. It's… more noticeable when you press there. On the right side, you said? It's a bit difficult to pinpoint exactly, but… yes, that area feels sensitive.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stepro. That’s helpful. Given your description of the pain, the tenderness on palpation, and your history, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. While it's unlikely given your age and gender, it's important to rule out any potential issues. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order a few tests. I recommend a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a urinalysis. We might also consider a pelvic ultrasound to get a better visualization of the area. How does that sound to you?
PATIENT: Oh… tests. That sounds… a bit overwhelming, to be honest. But if it’s necessary to find out what’s going on, I suppose I trust your judgment. A complete blood count, a… metabolic panel, and an ultrasound… Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s causing the pain.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Stepro. It’s always a bit unnerving when tests are ordered, but it’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. I’ll write the orders now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the ultrasound. In the meantime, to manage your discomfort, I recommend taking over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed, and avoiding any strenuous activity that exacerbates the pain. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I think. I’m a bit overwhelmed with all the information. I suppose I’ll wait for the results of the tests. And I’ll try to take it easy. Ibuprofen, you said? Yes, alright. Thank you, Doctor. For everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stepro. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before the nurse comes in. I'll be in to discuss the results as soon as they are available. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you.
PATIENT: .
