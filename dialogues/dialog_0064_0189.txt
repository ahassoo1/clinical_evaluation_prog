DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rowbottom’s the name. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors, waste of time if you ask me. But my daughter... she fussed and fussed 'til I came. Said I needed to get this checked. It’s… well, there was blood in my stool. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to make a fuss about.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood in the stool. I understand. It’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in; it’s always best to get these things looked at. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this?
PATIENT: When… hmm. Now, let me think. It wasn’t yesterday, that’s for sure. Probably… a few days ago? Maybe four, five? I eat the same thing every morning – oatmeal, toast, bit of jam. Nothing fancy. And it just… appeared. Didn't change anything in my diet, haven't been sick or anything. Honestly, probably just something I ate. Though, what it was, I couldn’t tell you.
DOCTOR: Four or five days ago… and no changes to your diet or any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Feel fine, mostly. A bit creaky in the mornings, like always. Old age, you know? But no stomach pain, no fever, no… well, you know. Just the blood. And honestly, it’s not like a flood, doctor. A few streaks, that's all. My daughter makes a mountain out of a molehill. Always has.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you’re feeling otherwise well. And it's very common for daughters to be concerned! Just to get a clearer picture, can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe blood? It's red, naturally. Like… well, like blood. Not bright red, mind you, more of a…darker shade. Like old jam, almost. And it wasn't mixed in with everything, you understand. It was… on top. Separate. Does that make any sense? Honestly, I’m not good at these descriptions.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Rowbottom. Thank you. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements themselves?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? You're asking a lot of questions about my… business, doctor. Never had much trouble, if you must know. Regular as clockwork. But now that you mention it… they might be a little thinner than usual. Not much, just… not as substantial, I suppose. Though, that could just be my imagination. I haven’t been paying close attention, naturally.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Rowbottom. It's very common to not pay close attention. And I apologize if I’m asking personal questions, but these details are important. So, a little thinner than usual, you say. And would you describe them as more difficult to pass, or is there any pain or discomfort when you go?
PATIENT: No pain, not a bit. Just… a little more effort. Like squeezing a bit harder. Nothing alarming, really. Honestly, I think it’s just this oatmeal. It’s a new brand my daughter bought. Keeps telling me it’s “heart healthy.” Probably just too… fibrous or something. I liked the old oatmeal better, but she won't listen. Always has to be right, that girl.
DOCTOR: It sounds like your daughter is very attentive to your health, even if it sometimes comes with a change in your usual routine. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. I haven’t been on the scales in… well, a long time. Can’t say I’ve noticed any difference. I’m a bit thinner, maybe, but that’s just old age creeping in. Everything sags a bit when you get to my age. No, haven’t lost any weight, doctor. Just… getting smaller, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, just to get a complete picture, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned something about it years ago. Gave me some pills, but they made me feel awful, so I stopped taking them. Don't bother with doctors much, as I said. Never had diabetes, never had heart trouble, nothing like that. Always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Worked on airplanes for forty years, kept me in good shape. Running around fixing things, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, and have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was a long time ago, before they had all these fancy new things. And… oh, I had a mole removed from my back a few years back. Nothing major, just a little snip. That's it, I think. Nothing else. Pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, and what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my daughter’s the only one left, really. My wife passed away… oh, must be twenty years ago now. Her mother… she had something… stomach trouble, I think. But I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago, and I never paid much attention to those things. My father... he lived to be a good age, but no, no real health problems on either side that I recall. Just… normal things. Old age catching up with everyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. Sometimes my skin gets a bit itchy in the winter, but that's just the cold, naturally. And that one time I ate some bad shellfish… but that wasn’t an allergy, just bad shellfish. No, no allergies. I’m pretty tough, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, and I’ll need to gently examine your abdomen and do a rectal exam. That's just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. It's standard procedure when someone has reported blood in their stool. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Now hold on a minute. That seems a bit much, don't you think, doctor? I told you, it’s just a few streaks of blood. Not a flood! And poking around in… well, you know… seems a bit unnecessary. Couldn’t you just give me something for it? Some pills or something? I really don't like the sound of that.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s not the most comfortable exam, I agree. But it’s a very important part of determining the cause of the bleeding. It allows me to check for any abnormalities and rule out more serious possibilities. It's a quick exam, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. However, if you're truly unwilling, we can proceed without it. But please understand that it will make it harder to get a clear diagnosis, and we might need to consider further testing, such as a colonoscopy, which is more invasive. Would you like me to explain a bit more about what a colonoscopy involves?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Now you’re talking. That sounds dreadful. And expensive, I bet. Look, I just want something to stop the bleeding. A few pills, maybe? I don’t want to be poked and prodded and have a camera stuck up… well, you know. My daughter fussed enough to get me in here, I don’t need her fussing more about some fancy tests. No, no colonoscopy. And I still don't like the sound of that other exam. Is there anything else we can do?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It sounds like you're very anxious about these procedures, and I respect your wishes. However, without a proper examination, it's difficult to determine the cause of the bleeding. Given your reluctance, we can start with a stool test to check for blood and infection. That's non-invasive and can give us some initial information. We can also discuss some over-the-counter medications to help manage any discomfort and potentially reduce the bleeding, such as fiber supplements. But I strongly recommend that if the bleeding continues or worsens, you reconsider the possibility of a colonoscopy. It's important to rule out more serious conditions, such as polyps or even cancer. Would you be willing to agree to the stool test and a trial of fiber supplements?
PATIENT: A stool test… that sounds manageable. And some fiber supplements, yes. As long as you're not sticking anything up... well, you know. My daughter will be happy I'm doing something, at least. But I'm telling you, it's probably just this oatmeal. Bad batch, I bet. Don’t want to go jumping to conclusions. So, yes, stool test and supplements. But no poking and prodding, understand?
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Rowbottom. No poking and prodding without your consent. I’ll write the orders for the stool test now, and the nurse will give you instructions on how to collect the sample. I’ll also recommend a fiber supplement and discuss some dietary changes that might help. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the test and see how you're doing. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, dizziness, or a large amount of bleeding, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… try not to worry my daughter too much. She gets worked up over everything. And… thank you, doctor. For not sticking anything up… well, you know. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to keep your daughter informed without causing unnecessary alarm. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions for the stool test. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please take care. .
