DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor Bakan. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, to put it plainly, I feel…a bit worn out. Like an old engine that needs a good tune-up, you know? I’m hoping you can help me get a “reset,” or maybe a “jumpstart” to feeling more like myself again. I'm 87 years young, and I've lived a full life, teaching little ones for many years, but lately…well, things just feel harder.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. McNabb. “Worn out” is a very good way to describe it, and it’s perfectly normal to feel that way as we get older, even with a full and active life like yours. We'll certainly try to get you feeling better. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this feeling of being worn out?
PATIENT: Well…it’s not a sudden thing, you see. It's been creeping up on me for…oh, maybe six months now? I don't have the energy I used to. Simple things, like walking to the mailbox or even preparing a meal…they just take so much effort. And I’ve been…forgetting things. Not big things, thankfully, but where I put my glasses, or what I had for breakfast. It worries me a bit, you know? It's not like me to be so…scattered.
DOCTOR: Six months, alright. And it’s the gradual onset that’s important to know. The fatigue and the memory concerns…both are certainly things we want to investigate. Could you describe the fatigue a bit more?
PATIENT: It's…a heaviness, Doctor. Not a pain, exactly. Just…a weight. I sleep alright, I think. Usually seven or eight hours, but I wake up feeling like I haven't rested at all. And it doesn't lift throughout the day. Even after a nap, it’s still there. It’s like…trying to wade through mud, all the time. And it makes me just want to…sit. Which isn't like me either, I used to be very active, always gardening or visiting friends.
DOCTOR: "Wading through mud" is a very helpful description, Ms. McNabb. And the fact that it doesn't improve with sleep is important. Now, you mentioned forgetting things…can you give me a specific example of something you’ve recently forgotten, aside from your glasses or breakfast?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Oh! Just last week, Mrs. Henderson from next door came over, and we were talking about her grandson's graduation. And…I completely forgot what I was going to tell her about my own grandson's visit. I knew I had something important to share, a funny story actually, but it just…vanished from my mind. I felt so foolish! She was very kind about it, of course, but it's still bothering me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McNabb. These things happen, and it’s good you’re aware of it. It’s helpful to have these specific details. Now, let's talk a bit about other aspects of your health. Do you have any other symptoms you've been experiencing – things like changes in appetite, weight loss or gain, any aches and pains, or problems with your sleep other than the fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh my, let me see…well, my appetite hasn't been very good lately. I don't really feel hungry, so I don’t eat as much as I used to. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, but nothing drastic. My daughter keeps telling me I look thinner, but I haven't weighed myself recently. And my knees…they ache sometimes, especially when the weather is cold, but that's just old age, I suppose. I’ve always had a bit of trouble with them. I don’t have any trouble sleeping falling asleep, just staying awake afterwards, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright, so decreased appetite and some weight loss, along with the knee pain, and the fatigue, of course. Now, Ms. McNabb, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me think…years ago, when I was in my 60s, I had my gallbladder removed. That was quite a shock, but everything went well. And I had the usual things – the flu a few times, a broken wrist when I tripped over the garden hose, but nothing serious. I’ve always been quite healthy, really. My blood pressure is a little high sometimes, but my doctor always kept it under control with medication. I think I haven't seen him in about a year, though…my daughter usually handles all the appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright, so gallbladder removal and a history of high blood pressure. And you said you haven’t seen your previous doctor in about a year. Do you happen to know what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a good question. My daughter handles all of that. I think it was a little white pill… maybe Lisinopril? But I’m not certain. She keeps it all organized, and I just…take it as directed. I really don’t pay much attention to the names, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. McNabb. We can certainly sort that out. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see…yes, I take a daily multivitamin. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take a little bit of ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, you know? Nothing else, I don't think. I used to take something for my arthritis, but the doctor took me off of it a few years ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I don't have any allergies. Never have, as far as I know. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I'm very lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. McNabb. Now, just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history…let me see. My mother lived to be 92, and she was very healthy until the very end. She did have some arthritis, like me. My father passed away when he was in his 70s, he had a heart condition. And my brother…he had diabetes, but he wasn’t very good about taking care of himself, I’m afraid. As for my children, they seem healthy enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Ms. McNabb. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…well, I live in a small house with a garden. I used to spend a lot of time gardening, but I haven't been able to do much of that lately, with feeling so tired. I enjoy reading, and I like to watch television. I used to go to church every Sunday, but I haven't been going as often since my husband passed away. I don't drink alcohol, and I don’t smoke.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. McNabb. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go right ahead. I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a nice, deep breath for me, Ms. McNabb…and exhale. Good. Listens for a few moments. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. I’m also hearing some mild crackling in your lower lungs, bilaterally. Continues with the exam. Blood pressure is 145 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Ears and throat look clear. Palpates her pulse. Pulse is 78 and regular. I check her reflexes and neurological function. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There you are. It feels a bit wobbly, Doctor, but I can manage. My balance isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. McNabb. That was helpful. Your gait is a little slow and unsteady, as you mentioned, but no significant abnormalities. Now, I’d like to order a few blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. These will check your complete blood count, kidney function, liver function, thyroid levels, and vitamin D levels. We’ll also check your blood sugar levels and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. If it will help me get to the bottom of this, then please do. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And I’d also like to order a chest X-ray to take a closer look at those mild crackles I heard in your lungs. It's a standard procedure, and it will help us rule out any potential causes. The nurse will draw the blood and schedule the X-ray for you before you leave. While we await the results, I recommend taking it easy, staying well-hydrated, and ensuring you get enough rest. I would also advise continuing the multivitamin. Based on what we’ve discussed today, and given your age and symptoms, the most likely possibilities are fatigue related to aging, potential mild anemia, or a possible underlying infection or cardiac issue. However, it's important to rule out other causes with these tests. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds…a bit worrying, Doctor, hearing about potential infection or cardiac issues. But I trust your judgment. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Will the results take long to come back? And will someone contact me when they’re ready?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. McNabb. It's best to consider all possibilities, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything serious is going on. The results should be back within 3-5 business days. The nurse will contact you directly by phone to discuss them and schedule a follow-up appointment with me. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fever – please contact the office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Do you have any questions about the blood draw or chest X-ray procedure itself?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve had blood draws before, so I know what to expect. And I’m not worried about the X-ray. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease. I appreciate your kindness and patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McNabb. That's what I'm here for. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and answer any remaining questions you may have. In the meantime, please take care and remember to rest. I’ll see you again soon to discuss the results. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much better knowing I’m getting this checked out. .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. McNabb. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Take care, and have a good day. .
