DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, I suppose I’m here because… someone told me I should establish care with a physician. New to the area, you see. Husband insisted. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. A bit of a waste of time, if you ask me. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Candice. Establishing care is a good preventative measure, even if you're feeling well. It allows us to get a baseline understanding of your health and be prepared should anything change. And no, I don’t want to waste your time. We'll just go through a fairly standard check-up, gather some information, and see if anything warrants further attention. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Heavens. That was… a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t recall much of it. I've always been rather healthy, if you must know. I did have… something with my gallbladder, ages ago. And a touch of the flu now and then, naturally. But nothing serious. Really, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Do I have to dredge up ancient history?
DOCTOR: It’s alright if you don't recall everything precisely, Candice. We can take it slow. Just anything that comes to mind – illnesses, surgeries, hospital stays, things like that. Even if it seems minor, it can be helpful. You mentioned gallbladder issues. Do you recall when that was, and if it required surgery or any ongoing treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it was… back when my Harold was still a young man. Before the children, certainly. Yes, a surgery. A rather unpleasant one, if I recall correctly. Though, honestly, everything feels like a blur these days. I believe it was at… City General? Or was it St. Luke's? I really can't say. And no ongoing treatment, no. I simply recovered and moved on. It was decades ago, Doctor. Really, is this necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. It’s helpful to have a general idea, and you’ve given me a good starting point. Knowing you had gallbladder surgery helps us understand your overall health picture. To continue, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, let me see… Harold reminds me to take something for my… joints. They ache, you know. Getting old is not for the faint of heart. A little white pill, I think. And sometimes I take something for… indigestion. After a rich meal, you see. I can’t recall the names of either, honestly. Harold handles all of that. I just take what he gives me. Is he allowed to fill those prescriptions, Doctor? It seems a bit… unconventional.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for spouses to help manage medications. However, for safety reasons, it's important for me to have a complete and accurate list of everything you're taking, including dosages. Would you be comfortable having Harold bring in the medication bottles when he has a moment, or perhaps check with his pharmacy to provide a list?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a great deal of trouble. Harold gets quite… testy when you ask him about things like that. He considers himself very organized, you see. I suppose he could bring the bottles, but don't expect a cheerful disposition. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure it’s worth the bother. I’ve been taking these things for years and I feel perfectly fine. Is there anything else? I do have a luncheon to attend, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Candice. We can certainly proceed at your pace. However, even medications taken for years can sometimes have interactions or side effects we should be aware of. It’s a part of providing the best possible care. Since getting the exact list is proving difficult right now, let's shift gears. Could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. Well, I always avoid shellfish, it gives me a dreadful rash. And I think I’m allergic to penicillin, but it was so long ago. I had a reaction, of course. A rather unpleasant one. But honestly, I’m not entirely sure. My mother always said I was sensitive to… dust mites? Is that even a thing? It’s all rather hazy, Doctor. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite flustered.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Candice. It’s perfectly normal to not remember every detail. Knowing about the shellfish allergy is helpful, and we'll make a note of the possible penicillin allergy to be cautious. Now, just to get a better overall picture of your health, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, heavens. That's another long story. My mother… well, she lived to be a very old age, but I don't recall any specific illnesses. My father… he was a strong man, but he had a touch of the… gout, I believe. And my sister… she had something with her… lungs, perhaps? Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. We weren’t a particularly close family, you see. Is this really necessary? I feel like I’m being interrogated.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like an interrogation, Candice. I’m simply trying to gather information that might be relevant to your health. Knowing about family history can sometimes help us identify potential risks. It’s alright if you don’t recall specific details. Just knowing about your father’s gout and your sister’s lung issues is helpful. Now, thinking about your lifestyle, could you tell me a little bit about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Oh, good gracious. Well, I attend a luncheon with the ladies every Tuesday. And Harold and I… we watch television. And sometimes we have visitors. It’s a quiet life, you see. Very respectable. We don't go in for any… wild behavior. Do you mean… drinking or smoking? Because no. Absolutely not. Harold wouldn't allow it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Candice. That’s helpful to know. Now, just to finish up with the background information, could you please tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Must we? I haven’t been weighed in… ages. Honestly, Doctor, it’s rather indelicate to ask a woman her weight. But… very well. Harold insists I’m… rather tall. Six foot two, I believe. And… well, I’ve always been… slender. Perhaps 140 pounds? It fluctuates, you see. Mostly depends on whether I've been enjoying myself at the luncheons. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Candice. Thank you for your patience. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. We’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Well, I suppose… if you must. But please be gentle, Doctor. My bones aren't what they used to be. And do try to be quick about it. I really must be going soon. Harold is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just sit here on the table, and I’ll begin. Alright, blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We can monitor that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat appears normal, no redness or swelling. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Alright, Candice, everything sounds and looks reasonably good. Given your age and history, I'd like to order some routine blood work to get a baseline and check your cholesterol and other key markers. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, heavens. More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite an ordeal. I suppose… if it's absolutely necessary. But please, no complicated procedures. And do try to make it as quick and painless as possible. I really must be going soon. Harold will be quite cross if I’m late for tea.
DOCTOR: It's a simple blood draw, Candice, and it shouldn't take more than a few minutes. It will give us a good baseline to work from and help us ensure you remain healthy. I'll write the order for the lab now. They’ll take the sample from your arm. You’ll need to be fasting for eight hours beforehand, so we’ll schedule that for tomorrow morning. Here you are. The lab is just down the hall, and the receptionist will help you schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: Questions? Oh, goodness no. I’ve endured quite enough for one day, I think. Just… tell me, Doctor, is there anything seriously wrong with me? I do hope not. Harold would be terribly upset. And please, remind me to tell him you said to fast. He can be… particular about these things. I think that's all. I really must be going now. Thank you, Doctor. Though honestly, I’m not sure what all the fuss was about.
DOCTOR: Based on today’s exam, everything appears to be within normal limits, Candice. The blood work is simply a preventative measure to establish a baseline. I will make a note to remind you about the fasting for tomorrow. It was a pleasure meeting you, and please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. .
