DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been bothering me. When I lie flat, it gets much harder to breathe. It’s quite unsettling, really. I’d like to get it sorted out, if possible. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing difficulty when lying flat… unsettling is a good way to put it, yes. It’s good you came in. We’ll certainly get to the bottom of it. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, I believe, sometime in… April, perhaps? Yes, April. It wasn’t sudden, not exactly. It just… gradually became more noticeable. At first, I thought it was just the pillow, but it’s not the pillow. It’s definitely worse when I'm lying completely flat. I usually have to prop myself up with two pillows now, just to be comfortable enough to sleep.
DOCTOR: Gradual onset in April… and requiring two pillows now for comfortable sleep. Okay. And is this difficulty breathing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not constant, no. It’s mostly when I’m trying to sleep, or if I happen to be lying down reading. During the day, when I’m upright, I don’t notice it much at all. Walking around, doing things… fine. It’s really just when I recline. And it’s not a cough, or a wheeze, or anything like that. Just… shortness of breath. It feels like I can't get a full breath.
DOCTOR: Alright, shortness of breath with reclining, no cough or wheeze… and it’s not interfering with your daily activities when you’re upright. Hmm. Do you have any chest pain associated with this, Maribeth?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, Doctor, not at all. No pain. It’s not like a tightness, or anything like that. It’s just… hard to breathe. Like someone is sitting on my chest, but without the ache. It’s a peculiar sensation, honestly. I don’t know if that makes sense. Is this taking too long? I have a luncheon to attend later.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Maribeth, you're doing perfectly fine. It's helpful to describe it like that, "like someone sitting on your chest, but without the ache." That helps me understand. Let's see… have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet lately?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me think… yes, actually. A little. My feet do feel a bit puffy at the end of the day, now that you mention it. I thought it was just the heat. It’s been quite warm this summer. I usually take my shoes off as soon as I get home. I don't really pay it much mind, to be honest. It’s not severe, just… noticeable. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Puffy feet, especially at the end of the day… yes, that is important. And do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, but that hasn’t bothered me in ages. And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that’s just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I suppose. Oh, and I was divorced, quite a long time ago now. Does that matter? I have Medicare, if that’s relevant. I’m trying to recall everything… I don’t want to forget anything important.
DOCTOR: No, your marital status is not relevant, Maribeth. I appreciate you trying to recall everything. Gallbladder removal, arthritis…okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think… I take a small dose of a water pill, prescribed by my previous doctor, for the swelling in my feet. And I take something for my arthritis, but it’s just over-the-counter. Ibuprofen, I believe. Nothing else, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. I don’t want to become reliant on them. Is that all you need to know? I really must be going soon, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, water pill and ibuprofen… alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, if that’s alright. And then I’d like to take a quick look at your ankles. It will just take a few moments. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I have a bit of a sensitivity to dust, but it’s just a sneeze or two. Nothing serious. You may proceed. I’m ready when you are. But please be quick, if you would. I don’t want to be late for my luncheon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your breathing sounds a bit diminished on both sides, but not dramatically so. I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m hearing and seeing, it sounds like you might be experiencing some fluid buildup, possibly related to your heart. It’s important to rule out heart failure. I’d like to order an EKG and a chest x-ray, and perhaps some blood work to check your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. Is it very bad? I’ve never had any chest pain, or anything like that. Blood work… and an x-ray? Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I suppose so. I do want to get to the bottom of this. But please be as quick as possible. I have a luncheon with the ladies, and I promised to bring the potato salad. I really don’t want to disappoint them. What exactly will these tests show? Will it be painful? I don’t do well with needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Maribeth. It's good you're getting this checked out. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have heart failure. These tests will help us determine the cause of your shortness of breath and swelling. The EKG is painless—we just place some stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. The blood work will involve a small needle prick, but it’s quick, and the phlebotomist is very good. As for the x-ray, it doesn't involve any needles, it's just a brief exposure to radiation. It will allow us to see the size and shape of your heart and lungs. It's all very routine. I'll have the nurse draw the blood first, and then we'll get you set up for the EKG and x-ray. It shouldn't take too long. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity and try to elevate your legs as much as possible. And we'll make sure you get to your luncheon as soon as possible, potato salad and all. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Very well. If you think it’s best, Doctor, then I suppose so. Blood work first… and then the EKG and x-ray. Avoid strenuous activity… and elevate my legs. Yes, I can manage that. Just… please be as quick as you can. I really don’t want to miss my luncheon. And I do hope it’s nothing serious. I’m not a young woman anymore, and I don’t have the energy for a lot of medical fuss. Alright. Let’s get it over with. Where do I go first? And will the nurse be gentle with the needle? I faint easily, you know.
