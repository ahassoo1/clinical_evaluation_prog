DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fontanazza. I am Dr. Blim. I see here you are 33 years of age. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh... hello. Yes, 33. My husband... he said I should come. Something about... learning? I don’t really remember why. Just… something the clinic wanted me to do. It’s not like I’m sick sick.
DOCTOR: "Learning," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. He said it was… important. Something about… keeping things okay? He worries too much. It’s just… a check-up thing, right? Not a real problem. I work hard, you know. Sheet metal. It’s heavy.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Fontanazza, even those who feel well benefit from routine assessments. It’s a preventative measure. Now, let's try to be precise. You mentioned sheet metal work… is this new, or have you been doing this for some time?
PATIENT: Um… a long time. Maybe… ten years? I don’t really keep track of dates. It’s… physical work. Lots of bending, cutting. Heavy things. My back gets… tired sometimes. But everyone’s back gets tired, right? It's normal. I don't need a lecture.
DOCTOR: "Tired" is subjective, Ms. Fontanazza. Can you describe this tiredness?
PATIENT: It's… achey. Like, after a long day. Not sharp pain, just… heavy. And sometimes, if I bend just so… a little bit of a twinge. But I take some… pills. Over-the-counter ones. They help. Mostly. I don't know what kind, my husband gets them.
DOCTOR: "Over-the-counter ones," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. He buys them at the store. Little white pills. They help with the achey feeling. I don’t like to complain. It's just work, you know? And I have to work. We need the money. He's very particular about me not missing days. Is this a problem? Should I be not taking them?
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, taking medications – even those available “over-the-counter” – without proper medical guidance is… ill-advised. Now, let’s move on. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes. In my hands. But only after a really long shift. Like, after cutting all day. They feel… kind of cold. Not completely numb, just… tingly. Like when your foot falls asleep? Is that… bad? Honestly, I just rub them and they go away. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” is rarely the case, Ms. Fontanazza. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Weakness? Not… really. I can still lift things. I have to. Like I said, sheet metal is heavy. Sometimes, I drop things… but that’s probably just because I’m tired. Or clumsy. I always have been clumsy. He says I need to slow down, but… things need to get done. I don't have time for weakness. Is this taking a long time?
DOCTOR: We are gathering necessary information, Ms. Fontanazza. Now, about your family… does anyone in your family have a history of back problems, arthritis, or nerve issues?
PATIENT: Uh… my mother… she had… something in her hands. Always complaining about them. I think she saw a… doctor. For her hands. Arthritis, maybe? It was a long time ago. I don’t really remember. She’s… not here anymore. My father… he worked in a factory. Very strong man. Never complained about anything. He's gone too. So… not really. That I know of.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Fontanazza, let's discuss your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I feel okay. I eat… normal food. Maybe too much salt sometimes. But everyone likes salt. My husband says I should eat more vegetables. He worries too much, honestly. I don't get sick very often. I just… work. And try not to cause trouble. Is this all? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, with all due respect, this is hardly sufficient. However, given your… insistence, I will perform a brief physical examination. It will be… quick. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your back.
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But make it quick, okay? I have things to do. Just… try not to poke too much. It's already sore.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Fontanazza, I’m going to palpate your spine to assess for tenderness and range of motion. Tell me if you feel any sharp pain. I note some muscle guarding in the lumbar region. Tenderness to palpation at L4-L5. Range of motion is slightly restricted in flexion and extension. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Ugh. That does hurt. Not… sharp, but… achy. And it makes my back feel… tighter. Like, I can’t bend as much. And please, be gentle with the… reflexes? I don’t like being poked and prodded. And don't take too long, please. My shift starts soon.
DOCTOR: Patellar and Achilles reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, though slightly diminished compared to normative values. Sensory examination is grossly intact, though subjective reports of mild tingling in the hands remain. Very well. I will also auscultate your heart and lungs, for baseline purposes. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PATIENT: Okay… is it over now? Everything okay? It all felt… kind of unpleasant. What did you find? I don't understand all those words you said. Diminished… something? And what does bilateral mean? Just tell me if it's bad. Please.
DOCTOR: Bilateral means “both sides.” And as for your question, your examination reveals evidence of mild lumbar strain, with some radicular symptoms – the tingling in your hands. Your grip strength is slightly diminished, and reflexes are somewhat reduced. While not immediately life-threatening, your condition requires attention. Your current approach of self-treatment with over-the-counter analgesics and ignoring these symptoms is… suboptimal. I recommend a course of physical therapy, and I will prescribe a muscle relaxant to alleviate some of the discomfort. Additionally, I strongly advise you to schedule an MRI of your lumbar spine to rule out any structural damage. However, given your insurance status, the MRI may prove… problematic.
PATIENT: Ugh. MRI? That sounds expensive. And physical therapy… I don't have time for appointments. I have to work. Muscle relaxant… is that a pill? Will it make me sleepy? I need to be able to do my job. This is getting complicated. Can’t I just keep taking the white pills and try to rest when I can? This is too much. Honestly, I think I just need a good night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I reiterate, your current self-treatment is… inadequate. Ignoring these symptoms will only exacerbate the problem, potentially leading to chronic pain and disability. While I understand your concerns regarding cost and time constraints, delaying proper diagnosis and treatment is… irresponsible. Given your reluctance to pursue further investigation, I will prescribe a short course of cyclobenzaprine – the muscle relaxant – and provide a list of basic stretching exercises. However, I must document your refusal to undergo MRI and physical therapy. I strongly advise you to reconsider. A proper diagnosis is crucial. If your condition worsens – or if you experience any numbness, weakness, or loss of bowel or bladder control – seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just… please don’t make me come back if it doesn't work. And can you write down the stretching exercises? I don’t remember things very well. Honestly, this is all very stressful. Is that everything? I really need to get going. My husband will be worried. Thanks… I guess. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I will make a note to follow up via telephone in two weeks, despite my reservations. Some patients… .
