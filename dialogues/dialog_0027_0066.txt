DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing a rather peculiar sensation in my back – a sort of “popping” or “clicking” sound and feeling. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sensation in your back. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I believe, about three weeks ago. Perhaps a little longer. It wasn’t constant at first, just occasionally when I was… well, moving around at work, mostly. Now it seems to happen more frequently, even when I’m just sitting.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you describe exactly where in your back you're feeling this popping or clicking?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… primarily in my lower back, Doctor. Right around where my spine curves inward. Sometimes it feels like it’s on one side more than the other, but it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly. It’s not a pain, not really. More of an… awareness. A mechanical feeling, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A mechanical feeling... I see. And does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Lifting things at work, of course. I install and repair electrical systems on various types of transportation equipment - trains, buses, that sort of thing. Lots of bending and twisting. That definitely aggravates it. Also, prolonged sitting seems to make it a bit stiffer, and then the popping happens when I get up.
DOCTOR: Okay, lifting, bending, twisting… and prolonged sitting. And have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs, or any numbness or tingling in your feet or hands?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No pain down my legs, no numbness, no tingling. That’s why I haven't been too concerned, but it’s become frequent enough that I wanted to get it checked out. I don’t want it to develop into something more serious.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed at your own pace. I’m happy to answer any questions you might have during the exam.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie down on your stomach for me, please. I'm going to start by feeling along your spine, checking for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Okay... I'm feeling some mild tenderness right here, on the left side. And there's a slight restriction in your range of motion when I ask you to bend forward. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel a bit of pressure when you press there, on the left side. And bending forward… it’s not painful, exactly, but it feels…tight. Restricted, as you said. It’s not the same flexibility I used to have, certainly. I’ve noticed that, even just getting out of bed in the mornings. It's a subtle difference, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes seem normal, and strength is good on both sides. No obvious signs of nerve compression there. Now, could you slowly rotate your torso, both to the left and to the right, and let me know if you feel any discomfort or catching?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Rotating to the left feels a little tighter than the right, and I can feel a slight… pop or click when I reach a certain point. It doesn’t hurt, but it’s definitely there. The right side feels smoother, more natural.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, the clicking sensation is reproducible with rotation, particularly on the left side. It sounds like we're dealing with some possible facet joint irritation or dysfunction. It's fairly common, especially with jobs that involve a lot of twisting and lifting. Now, this isn’t something that is necessarily serious, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left untreated, could potentially lead to more chronic pain. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. A job involving twisting and lifting… that certainly sounds plausible. I appreciate you explaining it to me. And yes, I would prefer to avoid it developing into chronic pain, if at all possible. What sort of treatment would you recommend?
DOCTOR: Alright. Typically, we start with conservative treatment. I’d recommend a course of physical therapy to strengthen the muscles supporting your back and improve your range of motion. We can also discuss some pain management options, like over-the-counter anti-inflammatories, if needed. In some cases, we might consider a cortisone injection into the facet joint if the pain is severe, but let's start with the physical therapy first. Does that sound like a reasonable approach to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable indeed. Physical therapy seems like a good starting point. And I'm glad you mentioned the anti-inflammatories – I do have some at home, so I can certainly start those as well. Do you have any recommendations for a good physical therapy practice in the area?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. There’s a highly-regarded practice called “Active Motion Rehab” just a few miles from here. They specialize in musculoskeletal issues and have excellent therapists. I can print out a referral for you with their contact information and address. And, just to be clear, if your pain worsens significantly, or if you develop any numbness or tingling in your legs, please don’t hesitate to contact me immediately. We want to rule out anything more serious. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds excellent, Doctor. Active Motion Rehab, I’ll make a note of that. And thank you for reiterating the warning signs – I appreciate your thoroughness. I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes. I think I have a good understanding of the plan now. Thank you very much for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mastrantonio. I’m glad I could help. Here’s the referral for Active Motion Rehab, and a summary of our discussion. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. I wish you a speedy recovery. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is everything. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much more at ease now knowing what’s likely going on and having a plan to address it. I appreciate your help. .
