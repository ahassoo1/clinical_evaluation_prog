DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. My face gets very red. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Maybe a month? It comes and goes. Not always after eating, not always after… anything. Just happens. It's a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Around a month, give or take. I try to remember exactly when it started, but… time goes. It’s not painful, just… warm. And red. Very red. My wife… she would always notice. She's… gone now. But she always knew when I was getting warm.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, flushing can have a number of causes, Mr. Withycombe. We'll need to rule a few things out. Do you notice anything specifically that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s the thing, Doctor. No. Not really. I thought maybe spicy food at first, but I eat spicy food all the time. And sometimes it happens when I’m just… sitting. Or walking. Or… I don’t know! That’s why I came. It's just… random. It's not like something makes it happen. Very confusing. I don't understand it, and my wife… she always knew things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this flushing accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else…? Let me think. Sometimes… maybe a little bit of a headache? Not a bad one, just… a pressure. And… sometimes I feel a little bit warm, all over, not just my face. Like a little feverish, but not really sick. I don't take my temperature. I don't have one. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: A little. So, flushing, occasional headache, and a feeling of warmth. Do you experience any palpitations, dizziness, or shortness of breath with these episodes, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Palpitations…? That means… my heart beating fast? No, no, not that I’ve noticed. My heart feels… normal. Dizziness… sometimes I feel a little unsteady when I stand up quickly, but I just hold onto something. That's old age, I think. And shortness of breath… no. I walk every day. Not fast, but I walk. I breathe just fine. Do you understand what I’m saying, Doctor? I’m trying to be very clear.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Withycombe, I understand. You're experiencing flushing episodes with occasional headache and warmth, no palpitations, dizziness only on quick standing, and no shortness of breath. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I've never really been sick. My wife always took care of everything. She always made the appointments, she always remembered what the doctors said. I just… went with her. She said I was healthy. I eat well. I walk. I don't drink much. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes. She said I had good blood pressure. I don’t know anything about diabetes. I just want to know why my face is red.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Never have. My wife… she always said I was too stubborn to take pills. She said I’d just get better on my own. And usually, I did. A little rest, a little walk… it always worked. This is… different. I don’t like feeling like something is wrong.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at the skin on your face. Just to get a baseline. If you’ll just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I hope it’s not too much trouble. I don’t like doctors much. My wife… she always did all the talking.
DOCTOR: It’s no trouble at all, Mr. Withycombe. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not concerning. Skin is warm to the touch, with diffuse redness across the cheeks and forehead. No rash or lesions noted. Alright. That's what I expected.
PATIENT: What did you expect, Doctor? Is it something serious? My wife always said I worried too much. I just want to know what's happening. It's frightening to feel different, and not know why.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be anything serious, Mr. Withycombe. It could be rosacea, a common skin condition that causes redness and flushing. Or it could be related to a slight elevation in blood pressure. However, given your lack of medical history, and the fact you’re uninsured, I would recommend a trial of over-the-counter treatments first. A gentle cleanser, and a sunscreen with a high SPF. Avoid anything that irritates your skin, and monitor your blood pressure at a pharmacy if possible.
PATIENT: Over-the-counter…? You mean… I have to buy something myself? My wife… she always had the doctor give her something. I don’t know where to buy those things. And I don’t have a blood pressure machine. Is there… nothing else you can do? I just want a simple answer. And maybe something to make my face stop being red.
DOCTOR: Mr. Withycombe, I understand you’re not accustomed to managing your own health. But given your circumstances, this is the most practical approach. I can write down a few recommendations for gentle cleansers and sunscreens. As for your blood pressure, many pharmacies have machines available for public use. If you continue to be concerned, I can provide a referral to a dermatologist, but be aware that will be an out-of-pocket expense. Do you have any allergies to any skincare products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. My wife… she always bought everything. I never paid attention. I don’t even know what a gentle cleanser is. Is that… a lotion? Or a soap? I’m sorry to be a bother. I just… I feel lost without my wife. She always knew what to do. And now… Just write whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’ll try.
DOCTOR: Here. This lists a few options available at most pharmacies. Follow the instructions carefully. And if your symptoms worsen, or you develop any other concerns, you know what to do. Any other questions, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that’s all. Thank you. I hope it helps. Just… thank you. .
DOCTOR: Right. .
