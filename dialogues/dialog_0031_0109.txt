DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now? Not all the time, but… it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in the back of your head that comes and goes for the past three days. Can you tell me a little more about that ache?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… hard to say. Not sharp, not like a… a pounding. Just… there. Feels like… pressure, maybe? And sometimes… it goes down my neck a little bit. Not much, but… yeah. It's worse when I… when I think too hard, maybe? Like trying to remember things.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a dull pressure in the back of your head, sometimes radiating down your neck, and it seems to worsen with mental exertion. That's helpful. Now, has anything specific triggered these headaches – any particular activity, food, or stressful event that you can recall happening around the time they started?
PATIENT: Trigger…? Let me think. Three days ago… ah! Old Man Hemmings. He came by the yard… wanting to talk about… about the trains. He always talks too long, that one! We used to work together, you see. And he was telling me about… about the old days. Real long story. I had to listen for a long time. Maybe that…? It tired me out, all that talking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a prolonged conversation with Mr. Hemmings three days ago, which you found tiring. That's a possible trigger. Now, besides the headache and neck discomfort, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… No fever, I don’t think. No… dizziness. I’m seeing okay. I… I feel a little tired, yes. But I’m always a little tired, at my age! No nausea, no… spots in my vision. Just the headache, and the tiredness. And maybe a little bit grumpy, but that’s just me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no dizziness, no changes in vision, just the headache, some fatigue, and a bit of grumpiness. That's good to know. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor, a long time ago… he said something about it. But he gave me some… some pills. I took them for a while, but they made me feel… funny. So I stopped. I don’t remember what he called it, exactly. And… no diabetes, no. Just… old age, I guess. Never been to the hospital for anything serious. Just… bumps and bruises when I was working on the trains.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of being told you had high blood pressure, but you discontinued medication due to side effects. We’ll need to address that later. And no other significant medical history. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm. Not that I remember. Maybe when I was a little boy? Something with my… my tonsils, maybe? But it was a long time ago. I don’t really recall. Working on the trains… that was the real surgery! Fixing those engines… that was hard work. No, no real surgeries, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant surgical history that you recall. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… my mother, she died when I was young. From… from sickness, I think. But the doctors back then… they didn’t tell you much. My father… he lived a long time. He worked on the coffee plantations. Strong man. I don’t… I don’t remember anyone else having… having sickness like this. Maybe some… some colds, sometimes. But nothing serious. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember much about their health, I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Brum. It’s common to not have detailed family medical history, especially when thinking back a long time. Now, could you tell me a little about your current medications?
PATIENT: Medications…? Just… the little white pill for my knee. It aches sometimes, you see. From all the working on the trains. And… sometimes I take something for my… for my stomach. It gets… upset sometimes. But that’s all. Nothing for my head, no. Doctor gave me the knee pill a few years back. I don’t remember what it’s called.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a medication for your knee pain, and occasionally something for your stomach. Do you know the names of those medications, or perhaps have the bottles with you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. Old Man Hemmings helps me with those things now. I give him the money, he gets them for me. I don't keep the bottles. Just take the pills when I need them. It's easier that way. I don't remember the names, and I don't want to bother him. He's a good man, Hemmings. Helps me out a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum, thank you for letting me know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No, I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with anything. I eat everything, pretty much. I like my coffee strong, and my tortillas warm. Never had a reaction to any pills, no. I’ve always been a strong man, you see. Don’t get sick easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke…? No, never. Tried it once when I was young, but didn’t like it. Makes you cough too much. And… alcohol? Sometimes a little beer with my lunch. Just one or two, on a good day. Nothing much, Doctor. Just to relax a little bit. Old man’s privilege, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, and occasional light alcohol use. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment to see if we can get a better understanding of what’s causing your headache. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just tell me what to do. I haven't been to a doctor in a long time, so I don’t know what to expect. But I’m willing to do whatever you need me to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds good there. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's a little hard, you see. My neck isn't as good as it used to be. Is that good? Am I doing it right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Brum, you’re doing just fine. Your eye movements are a little slow, but that could be due to age, as you mentioned. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but they are equal on both sides, which is good. Now, I’m going to gently press on different parts of your head and neck to see if that reproduces your headache pain. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right there. That hurts a little bit. Not sharp, like a… a muscle ache, maybe? It feels… tight. Like I’ve been carrying a heavy load. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Brum, that makes perfect sense. You have some tenderness in the upper back of your neck, and that's likely contributing to your headache pain. Based on what you've told me and the findings from the exam, it sounds like you are experiencing a tension headache, possibly with some muscle strain in your neck. The prolonged conversation with Mr. Hemmings likely exacerbated the muscle tension. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the sluggish reflexes, I want to be thorough. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions and get a better understanding of your overall health. I'll also recommend a brain scan just to be certain there's nothing else going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and a… scan? Is it… serious, Doctor? Is something bad wrong? I just have a headache… I don't want to worry my neighbor, Hemmings. He's been so good to me. I don't want to cause trouble.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, it's understandable to feel worried, but I want to assure you that we're taking all necessary precautions to ensure your well-being. The blood work and brain scan are simply routine tests to rule out any other potential causes of your headache and assess your overall health. It doesn't necessarily mean something serious is wrong. Given your age and slightly elevated blood pressure, it’s important to be thorough. The scan will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on in your brain. I’ll order the tests now and schedule them for you as soon as possible. We’ll review the results together when they’re available, and I'll explain everything in detail. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for your headache, and gentle stretching exercises for your neck. Does that sound alright, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. If that's what you think is best… then I trust you. Pain relievers… and stretching. I can do that. Hemmings can help me with the stretching, I think. Thank you, Doctor. For… for taking care of me. I appreciate it. When will I get the… the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. We'll get the blood work done today, and the results should be available within a few days – typically within 3-5 business days. The brain scan will need to be scheduled at a radiology center. We’ll have someone from my office contact you to arrange that appointment. Once the scan is completed, it will take another few days to get the results back. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, call you tomorrow to schedule the brain scan and answer any questions you may have. She's very knowledgeable and will guide you through the process. In the meantime, if your headache worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms like fever, dizziness, weakness, or vision changes, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Maria will call tomorrow… and she'll explain everything. I appreciate you taking the time… and being so patient with an old man like me. Thank you again, Doctor Rakosky. I'll see you… when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Maria will be in touch tomorrow. Take care of yourself, and remember to rest and stay hydrated. .
