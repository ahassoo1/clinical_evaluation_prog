DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Dr. Smetak. Nice to meet you too. It's… well, it's my stomach. It's been really bothering me lately. Like, a lot of… you know, going to the bathroom. A lot. And it’s not… good. I'm sorry, that's not very descriptive. I just… it's been going on for a while now. I think? It's hard to remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright, you don't need to apologize. It can be difficult to pinpoint when these things begin. “A lot of going to the bathroom” is a good start. Can you tell me a little more about how it's not good?
PATIENT: Okay… um, it’s just… really watery. And frequent. Like, I can’t really… leave the house for long without worrying. And sometimes it's… painful, a bit. Not, like, sharp pain, more cramping. I’ve been trying to just… eat bland things, you know? But it doesn’t really seem to help much. I think I might have mentioned this to someone before… about having trouble with food sometimes, but I don't remember who.
DOCTOR: Alright, watery, frequent, cramping pain… and you’ve tried bland foods with limited success. And you mentioned some previous difficulty with food… hmm. When you say difficulty with food, could you elaborate on that a bit?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, this is the hard part. It’s… vague. I think… maybe things upset my stomach sometimes? Like, bloating or… feeling sick after eating. Not always, but often enough that I’ve noticed it. I don’t know what foods specifically. And… honestly, it’s been a while since I really paid attention. I think my husband, Omar, has mentioned it a few times. He's better at remembering these things than me. I just… try to avoid anything that seems bad. It's all a bit of a blur, I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize at all, Jase. It’s very common for things to be unclear, especially when it comes to ongoing issues. It’s good you’re able to recall Omar has observed it too. So, intermittent stomach upset with bloating and nausea… We'll get to the bottom of it. Now, let’s talk about this current episode. How long has this specific bout of watery stools and cramping been going on?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. August… it’s the 2nd, right? I think it started maybe a week ago? Or a little longer? It's hard to say for sure. It started slowly, just a bit off, and then got worse over the last few days. I definitely noticed it was bad over the weekend. I’m just… really tired of being stuck near a bathroom, you know? It’s messing up… everything.
DOCTOR: A week or so, worsening over the past few days… understandable. Being tethered to a bathroom is definitely disruptive. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea and cramping?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really? I’ve been a little… more tired than usual, maybe? But I also haven’t been sleeping great, so I don’t know if that's connected. No fever, no blood, no… anything else obvious. Just… the stomach stuff. And the tiredness. Oh! And maybe a little bit of… gas? But I always have a bit of gas, so it's hard to say if it's more than usual. I’m probably not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Jase. It's good to rule things out. No fever, no blood, increased tiredness, and some gas… That gives us a better picture. Now, let’s briefly talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, I think I was told something about… inflammation? A few years ago? But I don’t remember exactly what it was called, or what they did about it. My family doctor at the time… she explained it, but it didn’t really stick. I’ve been generally healthy, I think. Just… the stomach stuff. Oh! And I have Medicare. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: A history of some inflammation, but details are unclear... and yes, Medicare is good to know, thank you. Now, how about any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. Maybe I had my tonsils out when I was a kid? But I barely remember it. Everything before… I don’t really remember much. I’m sorry. Omar might know more, he’s better at keeping track of these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant surgeries or hospitalizations recalled. And that’s alright about relying on Omar; it’s common to not remember details from childhood. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don't think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything that I can remember. I don't take any regular medications, just… sometimes over-the-counter stuff for headaches. And I haven’t changed my diet recently, or anything like that. Omar’s allergic to peanuts, but that’s not me! Is that relevant? I just… always make sure there aren’t peanuts around when he visits.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about Omar, thank you for mentioning it. We are focused on your medical history right now. No known allergies and no recent changes in medication or diet. Now, let’s quickly go over your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh… this is hard. My mum… she had some problems with her stomach too, I think? Like… irritable bowel or something? But I don't really know the details. She passed away a few years ago, so I never really asked. And my dad… he's healthy, as far as I know. He lives in Pakistan, so we don't see him very often. I don't know much about his medical history either. Sorry, I'm really not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: A history of stomach issues in your mother, details unclear... alright. You are not unhelpful at all, Jase. This is very common, many patients don't have detailed family histories readily available. Now, finally, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I’ve never smoked. I don’t drink alcohol, it doesn’t agree with me. And I definitely don't use any drugs. I work a regular job, sales, mostly. I try to eat healthy when I can, but it's hard with the stomach problems. I mostly just want to feel better, you know? Is this helpful? Are we getting somewhere?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jase. This is all very helpful. Thank you for being so open. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me - the watery stools for about a week, cramping pain, fatigue, some gas, a vague history of inflammation and stomach issues in your mother, and no other significant medical history – it sounds like we could be dealing with a few possibilities. It could be a viral or bacterial gastroenteritis, a flare-up of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or possibly something else. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and gently palpate it to check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, that’s alright. I’m… a little nervous, but I want to figure out what’s wrong. Just… please be gentle? My stomach’s been pretty sensitive lately.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jase. I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie back on the examination table, and I’ll begin. Okay… Your bowel sounds are a bit hyperactive, which is not surprising given your symptoms. And I’m noticing some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, mostly on the left side. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. No masses palpable. Overall, it’s not a dramatically concerning exam, but the tenderness does warrant some further investigation. I think it would be prudent to order a stool sample to rule out any infection. Also, a complete blood count to check for signs of inflammation. Would you be comfortable providing those samples?
PATIENT: Ouch, that’s a bit tender, yes. But… not too bad. Okay, yes, I’m happy to do those tests. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. A stool sample… and a blood test? Will those take long? And… will they be painful? I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The stool sample will be a small collection, and we'll provide you with detailed instructions on how to do that. It won't be painful at all. As for the blood test, yes, it will involve a needle, but it’s a quick prick, and the phlebotomist will be very gentle. We'll just need a small amount of blood. It should be over very quickly. While we're waiting for the results, I would recommend continuing the bland diet, and staying well hydrated. Avoid dairy, caffeine, and sugary drinks. And if the diarrhea becomes severe, or if you develop a fever, or notice blood in your stool, please contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay… no dairy, caffeine, sugar. Got it. I’ll try my best. Um… yes, actually, I do have a question. You said something about… Irritable Bowel Syndrome? What is that exactly? And… is that what you think I might have? It just… everything feels so uncertain.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Jase. Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, is a common condition that affects the large intestine. It’s not a single disease, but rather a group of intestinal symptoms that occur together. These symptoms can include abdominal pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation – or a mix of both. Now, it’s important to understand that IBS doesn’t cause changes in the bowel itself, and it’s not linked to any serious diseases like cancer. It’s thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including sensitivity in the gut, muscle contractions in the intestine, and possibly the gut microbiome. As for whether you have IBS, it's too early to say definitively. The tests we're ordering will help us rule out other possible causes. If those tests come back normal, then IBS becomes a more likely possibility. We would then look at your symptoms in more detail to confirm the diagnosis. It’s a process of elimination, really. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… so it's not… serious? And we need to rule out other things first? The gut microbiome… what’s that? And what does it have to do with my stomach? It just feels like… everything is a bit of a mystery.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It's not a serious disease, meaning it doesn’t damage your bowel or increase your risk of other health problems. But it can be very uncomfortable and disruptive to your life, which is why it’s important to get a diagnosis and manage your symptoms. Now, about the gut microbiome. Think of your gut as a complex ecosystem, filled with trillions of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms. This is your gut microbiome. And it plays a huge role in your overall health, including digestion, immune function, and even your mood. In the case of IBS, it’s thought that an imbalance in the gut microbiome can contribute to symptoms. Certain bacteria may become more dominant, leading to inflammation and digestive issues. We can look at ways to restore balance to your gut microbiome through diet and possibly probiotics, but we'll cross that bridge if and when we confirm an IBS diagnosis. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Okay… so it’s about getting the balance right? With the bacteria? That sounds… complicated. Um… I think I understand. For now, though, I just need to do the tests, right? And… how long will those take to come back? And what happens next? I just want to know what’s going on, you know? I'm tired of feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It can be complicated, but don’t worry, we’ll take it one step at a time. For now, focusing on the tests is the best approach. The stool sample should take about 3-5 business days to come back. The blood test results usually take a similar amount of time. Once we have those results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. At the follow-up, we'll review the results and discuss the next steps. If the tests come back normal, we’ll likely explore a diagnosis of IBS and discuss potential treatment options, such as dietary changes, stress management techniques, and possibly medication. If the tests do reveal another cause for your symptoms, we’ll adjust our approach accordingly. I understand your frustration. It’s never fun feeling unwell, and I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, for now. Thank you, Dr. Smetak. You've explained everything really well. I guess… I’ll just wait for the results. And try to… stay hydrated. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. It was my pleasure. And don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We're here to help. I wish you all the best, and please, don’t worry too much. We’ll figure this out together. Take care now.
