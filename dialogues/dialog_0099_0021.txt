DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Parascasndola, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Ricky Parascasndola. But everyone just calls me Ricky. It's a bit of a mouthful, that last name, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is rather…extensive. But formality is important, even if others don't appreciate it. Now, Ricky, let’s not waste time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Well, my foot’s been swellin' up. Mostly just this one, the left one. It started a few days ago, and it’s gettin' worse. Makes walkin' kinda rough, you know? It doesn’t hurt all the time, just when I put weight on it.
DOCTOR: "Swelling," you say. And when precisely did this swelling begin?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it was… Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. I was makin' coffee, and noticed it felt a little tighter in my shoe than usual. Didn't think much of it at first, figured I just had new socks on or somethin'. But by the afternoon, it was definitely bigger.
DOCTOR: And you haven’t experienced any trauma to the foot?
PATIENT: Trauma? Like… breakin’ somethin’? No, nothin’ like that. I haven’t tripped or dropped anything on it, or stepped on a nail, nothin’. Just… swelled up, plain as day. I’ve been tryin’ to stay off it as much as possible, but I gotta get to work, you know? I'm a loan clerk, so I'm sittin' most of the day, but still... it's not easy.
DOCTOR: And what, precisely, does your work entail?
PATIENT: Well, I sit at a desk, mostly. People come in wantin' loans – for cars, or fixin' their house, stuff like that. I go through their papers, check their credit, see if they can pay it back. Talk to 'em, ask questions, you know. It's a lot of lookin' at numbers and makin' sure things add up. It doesn't require a lot of walkin', but I do have to get up and go get files, and sometimes help people with the paperwork. Not too strenuous, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other symptoms accompanying this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever or anything. Not really any pain, like a sharp ache, just kinda… heavy, you know? And it's warm to the touch, I noticed. Not burnin' hot, but warmer than my other foot, for sure. And… sometimes it feels a little tingly, like when your foot falls asleep. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Tingly.” Right. And have you noticed any changes in skin color?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, I think so. It’s a little redder than usual, especially around the ankle. Not bright red, just… a bit flushed, I guess. It’s hard to tell for sure, 'cause I’m not one to stare at my feet all day, you know? But yeah, I'd say it’s a little redder than it should be.
DOCTOR: And you said you've been avoiding putting weight on it. Have you tried any other interventions?
PATIENT: Well, I put my foot up when I’m watchin’ TV. That helps a little. And I wrapped it with an elastic bandage, one of those ACE things. I think that takes some of the swellin’ down, but it’s only temporary. Honestly, I haven't really done much else. I wasn’t sure what to do, that’s why I came in. I don't have insurance, so I try not to bother doctors unless I really need to, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Let's have a look at this foot. Please, position yourself on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here we go…slowly, slowly. Hope I don't fall.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some edema – swelling, as you indicated – around the ankle and dorsum of the foot. Skin is slightly erythematous, as you mentioned. Palpation reveals tenderness… here, along the medial malleolus. Any sharp pain with this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that’s… yeah, that's kinda sore. Not like a stabbing pain, more like a deep ache when you press there. Like you poked a bruise, kinda. It’s definitely worse when you push on it like that, though. It's not somethin’ I'd notice just walkin' around, but yeah, pressin' there isn't pleasant.
DOCTOR: Pulse is present, though somewhat diminished compared to the opposite foot. Range of motion is… restricted, particularly with dorsiflexion. It’s possible this is a sprain, though without imaging, it's difficult to rule out other possibilities. Have you taken any medications for this?
PATIENT: No, haven’t taken nothin' yet. Like I said, I don't have insurance, so I try to avoid things like that if I can. Just been tryin' to rest it, and wrap it with the bandage. Maybe some ice now and then, but nothin’ regular. I was hopin' it would just go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the swelling, pain with palpation, restricted range of motion, and your lack of insurance, a conservative approach initially is reasonable. However, to rule out a fracture or other more serious pathology, I recommend an X-ray. It will cost you something, unfortunately. Are you prepared for that?
PATIENT: Ugh. See, that's what I figured. Money's kinda tight right now. How much are we talkin’ roughly? I mean, I can maybe swing a little, but I don’t want any surprises. I just wanna know if it’s somethin’ serious, you know? I gotta be able to get to work.
DOCTOR: The cost of a single X-ray here is approximately $150. Unfortunately, I do not have control over the pricing. However, I can provide you with a referral to a specialist who may have financial assistance programs available. It would be a podiatrist. They would be better equipped to diagnose and manage this condition long-term, frankly. And potentially explore less expensive imaging options. Would you like me to provide that referral?
PATIENT: $150… oof. Okay, let me think. A podiatrist, huh? That sounds… expensive too. But… if it'll get me a better answer, and maybe some help with the cost… yeah, okay. Give me the referral. I guess I don’t have much of a choice, do I? It's just...money's been tight, and I really need to keep workin'. What's the name of the podiatrist, and where are they located?
DOCTOR: Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s located at 14 Elm Street, about 30 minutes from here. The number is on the slip. She's… reasonably priced, for a specialist, and her office does offer a sliding scale for patients with limited income. Call and inquire about that. In the meantime, continue to rest the foot, elevate it whenever possible, and apply ice packs for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Avoid putting weight on it as much as possible. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. Rest, ice, keep it up, don’t walk on it. And call Dr. Sharma to see about the cost. Okay. I'll give her a call tomorrow. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate you helpin’ me out, even if it costs me a bit. .
DOCTOR: Very well. See to it promptly. And remember, delaying treatment can exacerbate the problem. Next.
