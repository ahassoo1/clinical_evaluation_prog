DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor, is it? Lanika, you said? Well, I don’t rightly remember making an appointment, but my daughter – Bernice, lovely girl, always fussin’ over me – she said I needed to come. Something about… not wanting things done? Honestly, at my age, things just are. What’s the point of pokin’ and proddin’? It won’t change nothin’.
DOCTOR: Well, Bernice is understandably concerned about your health, Ms. Gunasekara. Even if things feel… established, a check-up can help us ensure everything is as stable as possible, and catch anything that could become a problem. It's not necessarily about changing things, but about being informed. Now, let’s try to focus on why she thought you should be seen today. What specific concerns did she mention?
PATIENT: Specific concerns? Ugh, Bernice always exaggerates. She said somethin’ about my feet… always complainin’ about my feet. Said I wasn’t takin’ care of them. Honestly, I’ve been a podiatrist for fifty years, I think I know a thing or two about feet! She thinks I need… what does she call it… intervention? Sounds dreadful. I just want to be left alone, really. My feet ache, sure, but what 83-year-old’s don’t?
DOCTOR: Fifty years as a podiatrist… that’s quite a career, Ms. Gunasekara. It's understandable you feel confident in your self-assessment. However, even professionals can sometimes miss things when examining themselves. Intervention simply means looking closely and potentially offering some support. Now, tell me about the ache in your feet. Where exactly does it hurt?
PATIENT: Support? Bah. I’ve given support for fifty years, I don’t need it. And I told you, it aches all over. Honestly, it’s like… like old wood creakin’, you know? All the joints. The balls of my feet, the heels, sometimes up in the ankles. It’s just… age. It’s not a specific pain, it’s just… there. Bernice said I wasn’t wearin’ proper shoes. She’s always tellin’ me what to do.
DOCTOR: I understand it's a generalized ache, and that it’s frustrating to have someone question your expertise and self-care, Ms. Gunasekara. However, generalized aches can be indicative of underlying issues – arthritis, neuropathy, circulation problems, even vitamin deficiencies. Let's try to narrow it down. When is the pain worst?
PATIENT: Oh, vitamin deficiencies… now you’re just makin’ things up. I eat perfectly well! Bernice brings me soup, you know. Always tryin’ to fatten me up. When’s it worst… hmm. Probably… when I’ve been on my feet too long, I suppose. Though I haven’t been on my feet much lately. Mostly sittin’ and… watchin’ things. And at night, maybe? It kinda throbs, but then again, everything throbs at my age. Really, doctor, I just want to know why I'm here. What are you tryin' to find?
DOCTOR: We're here to assess the cause of your foot pain, Ms. Gunasekara, and rule out any serious conditions that might require treatment. While age certainly plays a role, it's important to investigate. You mentioned the pain is worse after being on your feet and at night. Is there any swelling or redness associated with the pain?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, not that I’ve noticed. Redness… maybe a little? But honestly, my skin is just… old. It’s kinda always reddish. It’s thin, you know? Like crepe paper. Everything's just… droopy. Look, doctor, I appreciate you askin’ and all, but I really don’t think there’s much to find. I’ve lived a long life, I’ve had a good career. A little foot ache isn’t gonna change that. Is there a way to just… skip the pokin’ and proddin’ and say it's just age?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Gunasekara, and I respect your long career in podiatry. However, even with your expertise, a thorough examination is crucial. Ignoring a potential problem could lead to complications down the line. For example, diminished circulation can cause significant issues, and neuropathy can become debilitating if left untreated. Before we proceed with a physical exam, let’s quickly review your medical history. Do you have any known conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, complications. Always with the complications. Honestly, it sounds like you’re tryin’ to scare me, doctor. Diabetes? No, never. I eat perfectly well, I told you. High blood pressure… maybe a little? Bernice keeps tryin’ to give me pills, but I don’t like takin’ pills. Arthritis… well, that’s just… old age, isn’t it? Everything creaks and pops. I suppose the doctor I saw… Dr. Abernathy, years ago… said somethin’ about it in my toes, maybe? But honestly, I barely remember. It was a long time ago, and he was a young man. Didn’t know nothin’.
DOCTOR: Dr. Abernathy… yes, I see a record from 2012 mentioning osteoarthritis in the first metatarsophalangeal joint, consistent with “hallux rigidus”. And I do see elevated blood pressure readings documented at that time as well. Ms. Gunasekara, while you have a long history with podiatry, it's important to acknowledge these findings, even if they were addressed years ago. They can inform our current assessment. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, even occasionally?
PATIENT: Oh, so you do find somethin’ after all. That young man wasn’t entirely useless, then. Hallux… what-now? Honestly, doctor, you’re losin’ me. I remember bein’ in pain, that’s all. As for medications… Well, Bernice gives me somethin’ for my water pills, I think? To get rid of the puffiness. And sometimes, when my hip flares up, I take somethin’ for the pain. But I don’t take it regularly, it’s just when it’s really bad. Honestly, doctor, it’s all a blur. I just want to be left alone. Is there a way to just… make this go away?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you are taking a diuretic for edema, and an analgesic as needed for hip pain. It’s understandable it’s all a bit of a blur, Ms. Gunasekara. Before we proceed, I want to be clear: I’m not trying to scare you, but it’s important to gather a complete picture. Hallux rigidus is a form of arthritis in the big toe, and, if left unmanaged, can lead to chronic pain and limited mobility. Now, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination of your feet and ankles. This will involve checking your circulation, range of motion, and looking for any signs of inflammation or deformity. It will be quick, and I’ll explain everything as I go. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: More pokin' and proddin'... Honestly, at my age, what difference does it make? Fine. Go ahead. But be gentle, alright? My skin is paper-thin. And don’t expect me to remember any fancy terms you use. Just tell me if it’s somethin’ serious, and if I need to… what do they call it… intervene? But I’m warnin’ you, doctor, I’m not promisin’ any cooperation.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. I'll be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything in plain language. First, let’s just take a look. I notice some mild edema on the dorsal side of your foot… that’s just a little puffiness. And your skin does appear somewhat thin and fragile, as you mentioned. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your arteries to check your circulation. This might feel like a light pressure. Okay, I’m feeling a… slightly diminished pulse in your dorsalis pedis artery. That’s not necessarily alarming, but it’s something we’ll keep an eye on. Now, let’s check the range of motion in your big toe… can you wiggle it for me?
PATIENT: Wiggle it? At my age, everything’s a struggle! There. Is that good enough? Honestly, it feels stiff, you know? Like somethin’ is… stuck. And don’t poke it! I don’t like bein’ poked. It’s undignified. And what did you say? Diminished… somethin’? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad,” Ms. Gunasekara, but it’s something we need to investigate further. I’m just gently assessing the range of motion in your first metatarsophalangeal joint—that’s the joint at the base of your big toe. I do notice some crepitus—that’s a grating sensation—when you move it, and a limited range of motion, consistent with osteoarthritis. Now, let’s take a look at your left foot. Do you experience pain in this foot as well?
PATIENT: Crepitus? Grating? You’re makin’ it sound dreadful, doctor! Honestly, my whole body creaks and groans, it's just old age, I tell ya! And yes, this foot hurts too. Not as much as the other one, maybe, but it aches. Especially when I stand for too long. Bernice keeps tellin’ me to get one of those… walkers. Ugh. I refuse. Just get it over with, alright? I have things to do, even at my age.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. I'm finishing up the physical exam now. As you've described, both feet exhibit similar findings—mild edema, diminished pulses, and limited range of motion with crepitus. This is consistent with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis in both first metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as some degree of peripheral artery disease—that’s the diminished pulses. Now, I want to be clear: this doesn’t necessarily mean you need a walker. However, we do need to address this to manage your pain and prevent further complications. I recommend we start with some conservative measures—custom orthotics to support your arches, appropriate footwear, and possibly some over-the-counter pain relievers. We can also discuss physical therapy to improve your range of motion and strengthen your foot muscles. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Orthotics? Custom… what-now? And physical therapy? I’m too old for all that fancy stuff, doctor! Honestly, I just want somethin’ to take the ache away. A pill, maybe? Bernice has some in her purse, I think. Is that all there is to it? Just a pill? I don’t want to be fussed over, I don’t want to walk funny, and I definitely don’t want to go to therapy! It's just… old age. Accept it!
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Gunasekara, and I respect your wishes. However, simply masking the pain with a pill isn’t a long-term solution, and it doesn’t address the underlying issue. While over-the-counter pain relievers can provide temporary relief, they can also have side effects, especially with prolonged use. Before we discuss medication options, I want to explain why I’m recommending these other treatments. Custom orthotics will help support your arches, reduce pressure on your joints, and improve your gait. Physical therapy will help strengthen your foot muscles, improve your range of motion, and prevent further deterioration. These measures, combined with appropriate footwear, can significantly improve your quality of life and prevent complications. Now, if you are absolutely opposed to these treatments, we can discuss a prescription pain reliever. However, I strongly recommend we consider these other options first. Would you be willing to at least consider a trial of custom orthotics?
PATIENT: A trial? Like a courtroom trial? Honestly, doctor, you and your fancy words! It sounds like a lot of fuss for… old feet. But… Bernice would have a fit if I didn’t at least try somethin’. She always says I’m stubborn. Fine. A trial. But if they’re uncomfortable, or I have to walk funny, or they don’t work, I’m throwin’ them away. And don’t expect me to be grateful. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. I will write you a prescription for custom orthotics. I’ll also provide you with a referral to a reputable orthotist in the area—they will take a mold of your feet and create orthotics specifically tailored to your needs. I’ll also give you a handout outlining appropriate footwear and exercises you can do at home to strengthen your foot muscles. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in six weeks to assess your progress. Now, are you currently taking any medications that I should be aware of before I finalize your prescription?
PATIENT: Let me think… like I said, Bernice gives me somethin’ for my water pills, sometimes. And somethin’ for my hip when it flares up. Oh! And I took one of her blood pressure pills last week, because I was feelin' a little dizzy. But that was just once. Honestly, doctor, I forget everything. She keeps track of all that stuff. Maybe you should ask her?
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s helpful to have that information. Since your daughter manages your medications, perhaps she can provide me with a more detailed list when she accompanies you to your follow-up appointment. For now, I’ll proceed with caution and avoid prescribing any medications that could interact with your existing regimen. Alright, here is the prescription for the custom orthotics and the referral to the orthotist. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Remember, consistency is key—wear the orthotics as directed, and follow the exercises I outlined in the handout. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Orthotist… is that like a dentist for feet? Honestly, doctor, all these fancy words are makin’ my head spin. No, I don't think so. Just… try not to give me too many pills. And tell that orthotist to be gentle, alright? My feet are old and delicate. I think that's all. Thank you… I guess. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go home and take a nap. This whole visit has worn me out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Gunasekara. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I will do my best to provide you with the care you need. We'll take things slowly and address any issues as they arise. And I'll make a note to ensure the orthotist is aware of your delicate feet. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. And please, get some rest. .
