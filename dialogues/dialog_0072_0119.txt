DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that’s what one comes to a doctor for, isn’t it? It's… a problem. A personal problem. And frankly, I don't understand why it’s happening at my age. It's… discharge. From… well, from him. My… companion. It’s quite unseemly, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. While it may feel embarrassing to discuss, it’s important that we address any health concerns, regardless of the topic. To clarify, Ms. Wartick, are you experiencing this discharge yourself, or is your… companion experiencing this?
PATIENT: Oh! Good heavens, Doctor! I am not experiencing it! Don't be absurd! It's him, naturally. I would never… Honestly, the questions one is asked these days. It's most improper. He's a… well, a gentleman friend. And it's his problem, not mine. Really, Doctor, I expected a bit more… discretion.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Wartick. I simply needed to establish that the patient in question is male to properly assess the situation. It's crucial to gather accurate information, and I assure you, my questions are strictly professional. Perhaps "patient" would have been a more appropriate term than "companion." Now, could you tell me more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… yellowish, sometimes greenish. And… odorous. Quite unpleasant, actually. He tries to be discreet, of course, but one notices. It’s been going on for… oh, I don’t know… a few weeks, maybe? Longer. He's not one to complain, you understand. A very stoic gentleman. But it's clearly bothering him, and frankly, me. It's simply not hygienic, is it? I've been using extra disinfectant wipes, but it's hardly a solution. Is it… is it a social disease? Don't tell me it is!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wartick. It's good that you're addressing this. The color and odor you describe are certainly suggestive of an infection. While it could be a sexually transmitted infection, it could also be something else entirely. We need to determine the cause before jumping to conclusions. Has your… friend experienced any pain, burning, or difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh, he doesn’t show pain, you understand. He's a very private person. But… now that you mention it, he has been going to the lavatory rather more frequently of late. And… he did wince slightly the other day when… well, when we were being intimate. A very small wince, mind you. Almost imperceptible. But a wince nonetheless. Honestly, it's all very distressing. Is it… is it serious, Doctor? Do you think he’ll… will he be alright?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, with the frequency, the odor, and now the discomfort, it's certainly concerning enough to warrant investigation. It's difficult to say definitively without an examination and likely some testing. I strongly recommend he be seen by a physician. I can certainly provide a referral to a urologist, who specializes in these types of conditions. It’s important to rule out any serious infection or underlying issue. To be frank, continuing without diagnosis and treatment could lead to complications. Do you have his consent for me to schedule an appointment for him?
PATIENT: An examination?! Oh, absolutely not! He would never allow such a thing! It’s… it's simply out of the question! He’s a very… modest man. And a private one, as I’ve said. I… I suppose I could tell him you suggest it, but I doubt he’ll be receptive. He prefers home remedies, you know. Teas and… and poultices. Is there nothing else? Perhaps a very strong antiseptic wash? Or some sort of… ointment? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t think he’ll go to a specialist. He's quite stubborn. This is all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand his reluctance, but I must emphasize that self-treatment may not be sufficient and could potentially worsen the condition. A proper diagnosis is crucial. While I respect his privacy, I cannot provide medical advice without examining the patient. It’s my professional responsibility to ensure he receives appropriate care. However, given his resistance, I can offer some general advice. Over-the-counter antibacterial washes may provide temporary relief, but they won't address the underlying cause. I can write a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic, but it's imperative that he completes the entire course, even if he feels better. But, again, this is not a substitute for a proper evaluation. I strongly advise you to encourage him to see a urologist. I can provide a list of reputable specialists in the area. If he refuses, I must document his refusal and the potential risks of foregoing treatment. Are you willing to allow me to document this in his chart?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is becoming quite a burden. Documentation, prescriptions… it's all so… official! Very well, you may document whatever you deem necessary. But I make no promises about convincing him to visit a specialist. He's a very independent man, you understand. I suppose a prescription wouldn't hurt, though. Perhaps it will appease him. But please, no further talk of examinations! It's simply out of the question. And please, don't write anything too… graphic. He’s a sensitive soul. What sort of antibiotic are you thinking of? Something mild, I should hope. This whole ordeal is quite stressful, you know. For both of us. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wartick. I've written a prescription for Ciprofloxacin. It's a broad-spectrum antibiotic that should address most common infections. I’ve also documented his refusal of a urological consultation and the potential risks associated with that decision. It's important that he completes the full ten-day course, even if his symptoms improve. I will also provide you with a pamphlet outlining common symptoms of urological infections and when to seek immediate medical attention. If his symptoms worsen, or if he develops a fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain, he must seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any further questions for me?
