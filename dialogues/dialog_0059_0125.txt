DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, good to meet you too. Look, I just… wanted to get tested for, you know… the HIV thing. It's just… a precaution, really. My wife and I… well, it’s a long story, but better safe than sorry, I always say. I figured I'd just get it checked.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Belan. It’s very responsible of you to be proactive about your health, and it's always better to be safe. Thank you for sharing that with me. Before we proceed with the testing, could you tell me a little more about what prompted this concern?
PATIENT: Concern? Look, it's not a concern, alright? It's just… a sensible thing to do. Honestly, I don’t even know why I’m explaining myself. We were… travelling. Lots of… different places. Met some people. That's it. It's not like I'm expecting anything, but my wife… she worries. And a happy wife… you know how it is. So, I’m here. Is that enough detail for you? It's just… a standard check, right? I don't need an inquisition.
DOCTOR: You’re right to want to be cautious, and I apologize if my questioning felt intrusive. It’s simply standard procedure to gather some background information to ensure we provide the most appropriate care. And, yes, a happy wife is certainly important! To clarify, when you say “different places,” are you referring to international travel, or travel within the country?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. International. Obviously international. Do I look like I'm flitting around Nebraska? We were in Southeast Asia, mostly. Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia… that sort of thing. It was a while ago, though. Last year, spring, maybe? Honestly, I don't keep meticulous records of my holidays. It's supposed to be relaxing, not a data-gathering exercise. I just want the test, Doctor. Is that really so difficult?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Belan, it’s not difficult at all. I apologize for pressing – I just want to be thorough. Southeast Asia is beautiful, but it does present certain health risks, so it's good to have that information. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you had any instances of unprotected sexual contact during your travels?
PATIENT: Unprotected…? Oh, now we’re getting somewhere. Look, I don’t appreciate being asked these things like I’m some… reckless individual. My personal life is hardly relevant to a simple HIV test. Honestly. We always use protection. Always. This is becoming quite… unpleasant. Are you a detective, or a doctor? I came here for a test, not a morality lecture. It's getting a bit personal, don't you think? I think I’m starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I sincerely apologize. My intention was not to imply anything negative or to make you feel uncomfortable. You are absolutely right – your personal life is confidential, and I should have phrased my questions more sensitively. I am a doctor, and my goal is to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes understanding your risk factors to ensure accurate testing and appropriate follow-up. To move forward, perhaps we can focus on the test itself. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Alright. That's better. Look, I appreciate the apology. It was… unnecessary, all of it. Risk factors… honestly. Fine. No, I haven’t been tested before. Never needed to be, really. Always been careful. But you know, with everything going around… better safe than sorry, right? So, just… get on with the test, please. What does it involve? Blood sample? I’m not good with needles, if you must know. Is it going to be painful? Don't tell me it's a long ordeal, I have things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Belan. I understand your hesitation about needles – many people feel the same way. The test does involve a blood sample, but it’s a very quick process. It’s usually just a small vial drawn from your arm. The discomfort is minimal – most people describe it as a quick pinch, and it's over very quickly. It will not be a long ordeal at all – just a few minutes for the blood draw, and then we send it off to the lab. Before we proceed, I would like to briefly explain the different types of HIV tests available. There's an antibody test, which detects the presence of antibodies your body makes to fight the virus, and then there’s a more advanced test called a fourth-generation test which detects both antibodies and the virus itself. The fourth-generation test can detect HIV sooner after infection. Would you prefer the fourth-generation test?
PATIENT: Look, I honestly haven't the faintest idea what you’re talking about. Antibodies, fourth-generation… It sounds like something out of a science fiction film. Just… give me the most accurate one. The quickest one, preferably. I don't need a lecture on immunology, Doctor. I just want to know if I'm okay. If there’s a quicker, better test, then that's the one I want. Otherwise, just… do whatever you normally do. I trust you're a professional, aren't you? Just… less talking, more testing, please. I'm starting to lose patience. And please, no more questions about my… personal life. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. I apologize again for the technical jargon – I will refrain from using it. The fourth-generation test is the most accurate and can detect HIV sooner than other tests. We will proceed with that one. To ensure your comfort, could you please confirm your date of birth for me?
PATIENT: Right. Good. Let's just get on with it then. March 12th, 1993. And please, be quick. I have a lunch appointment. Honestly, all this fuss over a simple test... it’s a bit much. And could you explain the results process? How long will it take? Will I need to come back? I haven’t got all day, you know. I run a business, it's not like I can just sit around waiting for lab results.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Belan. March 12th, 1993. Perfect. The lab usually takes approximately 3-5 business days to process the results. We will contact you by phone with the results as soon as they are available. If the results are negative, we will simply inform you of that. However, if the results are positive, we will need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and begin appropriate care. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Now, I'm going to insert the needle… you may feel a quick pinch. Try to relax your arm.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. I really don’t like needles. And hurry, please. This is… unpleasant. Honestly. Just… a quick pinch, you said? Don't linger, Doctor. This whole experience is rather… stressful. Is it done yet? I can feel my heart racing. It’s always something, isn’t it? I swear, medical appointments are the worst part of being alive.
DOCTOR: All done, Mr. Belan. You were very brave. It was very quick, as promised. Keep this bandage on for at least 15 minutes, and try to avoid heavy lifting with that arm for a few hours. We will contact you as soon as the results are available. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
