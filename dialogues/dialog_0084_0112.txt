DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been going to the bathroom rather frequently lately. It’s… disruptive, and I haven’t been sleeping well because of it. I’m not entirely sure why it started, or when exactly, just that it’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's not always easy talking about these things, so thank you for bringing it up. “Frequently” is a bit vague – could you give me a rough idea of how often you’re needing to go to the bathroom during the day, and also at night?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… During the day, probably every two or three hours, even if I haven’t had much to drink. It feels like I always need to go. And at night… oh dear. At least twice, sometimes three times. It’s really tiring, waking up so often. I… I don’t keep a strict count, if that helps? I just know it's more than usual. I'm sorry I can't be more precise.
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful to know. More than usual is a good starting point. And waking up multiple times a night definitely points to something we should look into. Besides the increased frequency, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really pain, exactly. There’s… a little discomfort sometimes, a sort of ache, but not sharp pain. And no burning, no. It's more just… an urge, a constant feeling of needing to go, even when I don’t really need to, I think. It’s… confusing. Is that making sense? I apologize, I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining it perfectly fine, Ms. MacVittie. Don’t apologize at all. So, no pain, just discomfort and a frequent urge. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, smell, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear. I was worried I wasn't being clear. Let me see… the color seems normal, I think. Perhaps a little lighter than usual, but I haven’t been drinking as much water, to try and… well, to try and reduce the frequency. And the smell… I don’t recall anything different, no. I suppose I haven’t been paying very close attention, to be honest. It’s… a bit embarrassing to think about, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not something people typically focus on. Okay, so normal color, maybe a little lighter due to decreased fluid intake, and no changes in smell. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower back pain along with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my back… well, I sometimes have a little ache in my lower back, but I thought that was just from… gardening, mostly. I do quite a bit of work in the garden. It’s not a constant pain, and it doesn’t really feel related to the… bathroom issue, if that makes sense. It comes and goes. I really do apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I wish I had more concrete information.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Ms. MacVittie. It’s good you differentiate that the back pain comes and goes and likely isn’t related. Alright. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, urinary tract infections, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… a good question. Let me think. I was divorced a few years ago, and I don’t recall my ex-husband ever mentioning anything… but I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a couple of years back, but that’s about it, I think. I don’t believe I’ve ever been diagnosed with anything else. I haven’t had many health problems, to be honest. I don't have insurance, so I haven’t seen a doctor regularly. I really can’t recall any specific diagnoses, Doctor. I'm so sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnoses that you recall, and a bout of the flu a couple of years ago. No worries about not having regular medical care; it's not uncommon. And we’ll work with what we have. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries or hospitalizations. I’ve been very fortunate, health-wise, until recently, it seems. I did twist my ankle quite badly when I was younger, playing volleyball, but that’s about it. It healed on its own, thankfully. No serious medical interventions, ever. I… I’m starting to feel a little silly listing off all these minor things, but I want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re not being silly at all. It’s good to have a complete picture. Alright, how about your family?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… a difficult question. My mother passed away several years ago, and I didn’t have a particularly close relationship with my father. I don’t… I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. I don’t recall them ever being seriously ill, but I wasn’t involved in their healthcare. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I feel rather inadequate, not being able to provide more information.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s not always possible to know your family’s medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat… well, I eat a little bit of everything. I’ve never had a reaction to any food or medication. I’ve tried a few different over-the-counter remedies for colds, and I’ve never had any problems. I really do wish I had more to offer, Doctor. I feel like I’m not being very useful. This is probably a very simple problem, and I’m just making it harder for you.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. MacVittie. And you haven’t made it harder for me at all. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I’ve always been quite healthy, as I mentioned, so I haven’t needed to take anything regularly. I sometimes take a pain reliever for a headache, but that’s about it. Just… standard ibuprofen, occasionally. Nothing prescribed, and nothing ongoing. I really do apologize for not being more informative, Doctor. I just… I don’t have a lot of medical knowledge.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen and check your reflexes, and I may need a urine sample. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… perfectly fine. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I apologize if this is a silly question, but… will the urine sample require a specific container? And is there a restroom nearby? I suppose I should have asked that earlier. I just… I get a little flustered in these situations.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. MacVittie. No need to apologize. Yes, we have a sterile collection cup in the restroom right down the hall. Just follow the instructions on the counter. And don't worry about being flustered, it's perfectly normal. Let me know when you’re finished, and we’ll proceed.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now let's see...
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I hope it's sufficient. I… I tried to follow the instructions as best as I could. I’m terribly sorry if I’ve done something incorrectly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. MacVittie. This is perfect. I'm going to quickly run this sample to the lab. It will just take a few minutes. I'll be right back.
PATIENT: I suppose I should have asked how long this might take. Perhaps I should have brought a book. Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. MacVittie. The urinalysis came back. It shows a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate a mild urinary tract infection, but it’s not definitive. Your glucose and ketone levels are normal, and there's no sign of blood in the urine. To be certain, I'd like to do a quick pelvic exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A… a pelvic exam? I… I haven’t had one of those in… well, in a very long time. I suppose it’s necessary, if you think it’s best. I… I’m a little nervous, Doctor, if I’m being honest. Is it… is it going to be uncomfortable? And how long will it take? I apologize for all the questions. I just… I’m not very familiar with these procedures.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be nervous, Ms. MacVittie. It's very common. A pelvic exam allows me to check your internal organs for any signs of infection or abnormalities. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. It will likely take around 10-15 minutes. We'll use a speculum and take a swab for further testing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, that’s… that’s alright. Ten to fifteen minutes, you said? And you’ll explain everything? I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. I… I suppose the sooner we get it over with, the better. Just… please be gentle. And… I apologize if I’m being difficult. I just… I don’t like medical procedures, if I’m being honest. I really do wish I had someone with me.
DOCTOR: You’re not being difficult at all, Ms. MacVittie. And I understand your apprehension. We’ll take things as slowly as you need to. I’ll explain everything step-by-step, and you can tell me if you need a break at any time. We’ll start by having you lie down on the exam table with your feet in the stirrups. I’ll then gently insert a speculum to visualize your cervix. It might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. We'll then collect a swab for a culture. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that sounds alright. I suppose I should… I should try to relax. I’m ready, Doctor. Whenever you are. I… I trust you. Just… please be gentle, as you said. This is… rather daunting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MacVittie. Just lie back and relax as much as you can. I'm going to start now. I'm just going to apply a little lubricant here. This might feel a little cool. Okay, and now gently inserting the speculum. Just take a few deep breaths. Everything looks normal so far. Now, I'm just going to collect a swab. This might cause a little discomfort, but it should be quick. Okay, all done. You can get dressed now. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: It… it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be, actually. A little uncomfortable, yes, but… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. You were very gentle, and you explained everything so well. What happens now? Do we need to wait for the results of the swab? And… what if it is an infection? What kind of treatment would that involve? I apologize for all the questions. I just… I’m anxious, as you can probably tell.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. I'm glad it wasn't as bad as you expected. You're absolutely right, we'll need to wait for the results of the swab. It usually takes about 24-48 hours. If it is an infection, it's usually treated with a course of antibiotics. The length of treatment will depend on the type of bacteria causing the infection. We’ll discuss the best course of action once we have the results. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to antibiotics that I know of. I haven't taken any in… well, I honestly can't remember. I suppose if I had been allergic, I would know. Drinking plenty of fluids… that sounds sensible. I’ll try to do that. So, 24-48 hours for the results… And then we’ll see if I need antibiotics? Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any over-the-counter remedies that might help with the discomfort? I apologize for being such a bother. I really do appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Ms. MacVittie. It’s my job to address your concerns. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, you can try taking over-the-counter cranberry juice or supplements. Some people find that helps with urinary discomfort, but it’s not scientifically proven. You can also try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen, if you’re experiencing any pain. The most important thing is to drink plenty of fluids and avoid anything that might irritate your bladder, like caffeine and alcohol. I’ll give you a prescription for a urine culture and provide you with some information about avoiding bladder irritants. If your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You’ve really put my mind at ease. The prescription and information about bladder irritants are very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel much better prepared now. I suppose I’ll just wait for the results and see what happens. Thank you again. I'll be sure to contact the clinic if anything changes. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
