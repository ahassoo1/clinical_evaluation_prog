DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My back… it’s been really bad. Worse than usual, I think. It's hard to even stand up straight.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when did you first start noticing this increased pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… a week ago? Slowly getting worse each day. At first it was just a little ache, but now… now it feels like someone is stabbing me. Especially when I try to bend over. I remember August 25th, I could still do some things, but not today.
DOCTOR: Alright, a week ago, starting as a mild ache and progressing to sharp pain with bending. And you mentioned August 25th – so it’s definitely been a pretty quick escalation. Can you pinpoint exactly where on your back the pain is the worst?
PATIENT: Right… here. It’s mostly on this side, but it kinda goes all across my lower back now. Sometimes I feel it going down my leg a little too, but not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, predominantly on the left side, with some radiating pain down the leg occasionally. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant. But it gets much worse when I move. Sitting is okay for a little bit, but standing or walking… oof. That's when the stabbing feeling really starts. And laying down doesn’t always help. Some nights it’s awful, some nights… a little better. But never gone.
DOCTOR: Alright, constant pain with exacerbation with movement, particularly standing and walking. Any numbness, tingling, or weakness in either leg, or your feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my left foot feels a little… cold. Not always. And maybe a little… tingly. But not really numb. It's hard to explain. Not like it's asleep or anything. Just… not as warm as the other one. I didn’t really think much of it, to be honest. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is good information, thank you. Okay, so some subjective coldness and occasional tingling in the left foot. Let's talk a little about your overall health history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. I have… cancer. They found it a few years ago. I've been getting treatments, but… it hasn’t gone away completely. That's why I'm seeing a doctor now, I guess. I don't know if the back pain has anything to do with that. It's in my bones, they said.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see your oncology history here. And yes, given your history of bone involvement, we absolutely need to consider that as a potential source of your back pain. Before we jump to conclusions, though, let's rule out other, more common causes. Have you had any injuries to your back recently, even a minor fall or twist?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I haven't fallen or hurt my back at all. I work at the factory, packing things, but it’s pretty simple work. Not too much heavy lifting. Mostly just… standing and bending, you know? Like I said, that's why my back always hurts a little. But this is different. Much worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent injury. And you mentioned standing and bending at work—that’s consistent with the pain pattern you’re describing. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. It’s a little hard to get up. Be careful, okay? It really hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to gently feel along your back. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. And I’m going to ask you to move around a little, just to see how much range of motion you have. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what’s your pain level right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… right now? Probably a… six. It's a steady ache, but not too bad if I don't move. But when you press on it… that's more like an eight. Right there. It feels really sore. And when I try to bend… ouch. Definitely a ten.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to palpation on the left lower back, pain level of six at rest, eight with palpation, and ten with bending. I also notice some muscle guarding on that side, and limited range of motion. Straight leg raise is negative bilaterally, which is good. Your reflexes are normal and sensation is intact. Given your history of cancer and the findings on the exam, I'm concerned about possible metastatic disease. However, a muscle strain or disc issue is still possible. I'd like to order some imaging—an X-ray and an MRI of your lumbar spine—to get a better look at what's going on. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? I… I don’t think so. I’ve had tests before, but I don't remember anything about dye. Let me think… I think they gave me something through an IV once, but I didn't have a reaction or anything. I’m not sure. Is that bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. We'll proceed cautiously then. It's good you haven’t had a reaction before, but we will still ask you a few questions before the scan to make sure. The MRI can be done without contrast, but it provides much more detail, and given your history, that detail is important. For now, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort. I'll also give you instructions on proper body mechanics and some gentle stretches you can do at home. I want you to follow up with me as soon as the imaging results are available. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. Medicine sounds good. My back is really bothering me. And the stretches… I can try. But I’m not very flexible, so don't give me anything too hard. And… how long will the tests take? And when will I get the results? I need to know what’s going on. Is it the cancer?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. The tests should take about 30-45 minutes each. The MRI usually takes longer than the X-ray. As for the results, it typically takes 24-48 hours for the radiologist to interpret them and send the report. I will call you as soon as I have them, and we'll discuss them together. We need to see what’s happening on the images before we can say anything definitive about whether or not it’s related to your cancer. It could be a separate issue, like a muscle strain or a disc problem. For now, focus on taking the medication as prescribed, trying the gentle stretches, and avoiding any activities that worsen your pain. I’m also going to give you a referral to an oncologist if you haven't seen one recently. It’s important to have your cancer care team involved. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A good plan. I need to see my oncologist anyway. It's been a while. Okay, medicine, stretches, see the doctor… and wait for the tests. That’s a lot. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I was really scared.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I understand it's a lot to process, and I want you to know I’m here to help in any way I can. My nurse will give you the prescriptions and the referral information on your way out. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if your pain worsens before your follow-up appointment. I have several other patients waiting, so I need to move things along. But we’ll get to the bottom of this, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, okay. Thank you again, Doctor. I will.
