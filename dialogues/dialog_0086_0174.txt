DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s… difficult to explain. I just feel… low. Very low. And I thought it best to get it checked, you know? Before it gets worse. I haven’t much time, if you don’t mind a quick visit.
DOCTOR: “Low,” you say. Right. Well, we all have our days, but it's good you're being proactive. “Not much time,”… that’s not ideal, but we’ll do what we can. When did you start feeling this way, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. It hasn’t been sudden, you see. Perhaps… six months ago? It started slowly, just a lack of… enthusiasm, I suppose. For my usual things. The water, the snow… even seeing my grandchildren. It's been building, I think. I really don't keep track of dates, if I'm honest. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Six months… progressive… alright. A gradual loss of interest is certainly something we need to explore. And don't worry about precise dates; a general timeframe is fine. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this lack of enthusiasm?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. My appetite hasn’t been the best, I suppose. I used to enjoy cooking, a good Nigerian stew, but now… it feels like a chore. And I sleep… too much, maybe? Or not enough. It varies. It’s… unsettling, really. I'm usually very regimented.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite, disrupted sleep… both common with these types of complaints. Are you experiencing any difficulty falling asleep, or more trouble staying asleep?
PATIENT: Staying asleep, mostly. I can get off to sleep alright, usually. But then I wake up. Several times a night. And I just… lie there. Thinking. Worrying. It's not nightmares, exactly. Just… my mind racing. And then I can't get back to sleep easily. It leaves me quite tired, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. Frequent awakenings, racing thoughts… And are these thoughts focused on anything specific, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Specific? Not really, no. Just… everything. Regrets, mostly, I think. Old mistakes. Things I should have done differently. And… worry about the grandchildren, naturally. Making sure they’re safe and happy. But it's not a focused worry, you see? Just… a general unease. It’s… exhausting, honestly. I feel like I'm chasing my own tail.
DOCTOR: Exhausting indeed. And have you noticed any changes in your energy levels during the day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. I used to be very active, you know? Ski patrol, lifeguarding… kept me very fit. Now… getting out of bed is a struggle. I feel sluggish, even after a full night’s – or fragmented night’s – sleep. I find myself just… sitting. Watching television. Which I never used to do. It's… disheartening. I feel so unlike myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, loss of interest, appetite changes, sleep disturbance, low energy… Have you experienced any weight loss recently, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Weight loss… A little, I suppose. Not much, but my clothes don’t fit quite the same. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, mind you. But yes, I think so. It's probably just the lack of appetite, to be honest. I used to have such a hearty appetite! Everything tasted so good. Now… not so much. Is this taking long, Doctor? I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: We're getting there. It's important to be thorough. Now, Ms. Derasmo, have you noticed any difficulty with concentration or memory?
PATIENT: Concentration… hmm. Well, I wouldn’t say difficulty, exactly. But I forget things more easily, perhaps. Little things. Where I put my glasses, mostly. Or the name of someone I just met. It's frustrating, to be honest. I used to have a very sharp mind. Very sharp indeed. But no, nothing major. Just… little lapses. And I try not to dwell on it. It's probably just old age, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Derasmo, before we proceed, I need to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my blood pressure checked regularly when I was working, but it was always fine. No diabetes, no heart trouble, thankfully. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know? I broke my arm skiing a few years back, but it healed properly. And I had the flu last winter, but everyone gets the flu, don't they? Nothing… serious. I’ve always been very healthy. Very healthy indeed. Are we nearly finished, Doctor? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We’ll get to the point. Have you ever been prescribed any medications for anything, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Just painkillers, occasionally, for the aches and pains. Nothing regular. And some antibiotics when I had a chest infection a few years back. But nothing long-term, no. I prefer to avoid medication if I can. It always makes me feel… sluggish. Are you writing all this down, Doctor? I’m not sure what all these questions are for, to be honest. I just feel… low. That’s all. It’s not something complicated, is it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Derasmo, I need to understand the full picture. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any. I eat everything. I’ve always had a strong stomach. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve lived a very healthy life. This is… unexpected. I’m not sure what’s causing all this. Are you suggesting something is seriously wrong? Because frankly, I don’t have time for a long illness. I have my grandchildren to see, you know. I really must be going now. I think I've answered all your questions.
DOCTOR: Just one moment, Ms. Derasmo. Please sit. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits?! Doctor, with all due respect, what on earth does my bowel have to do with feeling low? This is… quite inappropriate. I came here because I feel sad, not to discuss… that. Honestly, I think I’ve had enough. I'm leaving now. .
DOCTOR: Fine. Ms. Derasmo, based on what you’ve told me – and I use that term loosely – it could be a number of things. It sounds like a possible adjustment disorder, perhaps related to life changes and stress. However, given your age, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some basic blood work - a complete blood count, thyroid panel, and Vitamin D level. That’s all. Get this done at the lab down the hall. And honestly, if you start experiencing any suicidal thoughts, or feel like you can’t cope, go to the emergency room immediately. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
