DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach. It’s been acting up. I’ve had… a lot of diarrhea, lately. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… not stopping. I think it’s been a couple of weeks, maybe? It’s hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of weeks of diarrhea. That is a while. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Um… sure. It’s… pretty watery, most of the time. And it happens… a few times a day. Sometimes more if I eat something. I don’t… I don’t really know what sets it off, though. I try to be careful, but… it just happens. It’s really tiring, honestly. Having to keep running to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Okay, several times a day for a couple of weeks. And it doesn’t seem to be linked to anything specific you're eating?
PATIENT: Not that I’ve noticed, no. I mean, sometimes after really spicy food, maybe? But I’ve had spicy food before with no problem. And other times it just… happens, even if I’ve eaten something really plain. Like toast, you know? It’s just… random. I’m married, by the way, just in case that matters. I don’t know if it does.
DOCTOR: Right, thank you for letting me know. It’s good to have a complete picture. No, marital status isn't directly relevant here, but it’s good information to have overall. Let's get a little more detail about the diarrhea itself. Besides being watery, have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood or… mucus? Um… I don’t think so. It’s hard to tell, honestly. I try not to look too closely, you know? It’s just… unpleasant. But I don’t remember seeing anything like that. Definitely no blood, I don’t think. Maybe… maybe a little bit of white stuff sometimes? But I could be imagining things. It’s just… well, it’s diarrhea. Everything kind of looks the same, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult to tell. The white stuff you’re describing could be mucus. Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Um… I’ve been a bit tired, I guess. More tired than usual. And… my stomach hurts sometimes. Not all the time, but it gets cramps, you know? Like… really bad gas pains. And… I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot, so I’m a bit… dehydrated, probably? Is that a symptom? I'm on Medicare, by the way, just letting you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, stomach cramps, and you suspect some dehydration. Those all make sense with prolonged diarrhea. Now, have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No fever, no. Definitely no vomiting. And… I haven't really felt nauseous, no. Just… really uncomfortable. And tired. And… needing the bathroom. It's mostly just the diarrhea and the stomach cramps, really. It's just… dragging me down. I think. It's hard to remember everything clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a good question. I… I think so? My doctor… a long time ago… said something about my stomach. Something about… IBD? Or maybe celiac disease? Something like that. It was a while ago, and I don’t really remember all the details. I was younger, and… it was a lot to take in. I've been on Medicare for a bit now, so I've seen a few doctors. I think they did some tests, but I don’t remember what they were looking for. Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. I know it involved my stomach and… needing to be careful with what I eat. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible history of IBD or celiac disease. That's important information. Do you remember if you were officially diagnosed with either of those, or if it was just something a doctor discussed with you?
PATIENT: Um… I think… I think it was a possibility. They did a lot of tests, and… they said something about it being a possibility, but… I don't think they ever officially said I had it. I think they wanted to monitor it, but… then I moved, and… I just kind of forgot about it, to be honest. It was a long time ago. I was younger, and I didn’t really understand everything. I just know I’ve always had… stomach problems. And I try to be careful with what I eat. It’s hard to remember all the details. Maybe they have it in my records?
DOCTOR: Yes, let me take a look at your EHR. Okay, it looks like you had some testing done about seven years ago for possible celiac disease and Crohn’s disease, but the results were inconclusive. There’s a note that further testing was recommended, but it doesn’t appear it was ever completed. Okay, so past medical history is a bit unclear, but possible inflammatory bowel disease. Any past surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. Never had any surgeries. And… no family history of… anything like this, really. My family’s pretty healthy, actually. Well, mostly. My aunt has… something with her heart, I think. But nothing with her stomach. And I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol. Just… a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Does that matter? I’m married, by the way. Just in case. I feel like I keep saying that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, no significant family history, and you don't smoke or drink heavily. Good to know. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Well, just… vitamins, sometimes. A multivitamin, and… sometimes vitamin D, in the winter. But nothing prescribed by a doctor. And… that’s it, really. I try to stay healthy, so I don’t really take much medication. I'm on Medicare, so I've got a good plan.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And finally, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Never had any allergic reactions to anything. Food, medication… nothing. I’m pretty lucky, actually. I can eat pretty much anything. Except… maybe too much spice, sometimes? But that’s not an allergy, really. Just… my stomach doesn’t like it. And… I think that’s everything? I'm married, by the way. I keep feeling like I need to say that. I'm just trying to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, thank you. So, to summarize: you're a 20-year-old female presenting with a couple of weeks of watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, and tiredness. You have a possible history of inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease that was never fully investigated. You have no known allergies or current medications. Let me do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen and gently feel it to see if there’s any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. Sounds good. I’m just… tired, and my stomach hurts, so… if you need me to say something, just let me know. And… I'm married, by the way. Just… in case.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm not feeling any significant masses or enlargement. There's some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. Your bowel sounds are a little bit hyperactive, which isn’t surprising given the diarrhea. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Skin turgor is slightly decreased, which suggests mild dehydration. Based on this exam, and your history, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on. Given your past history, we need to investigate the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease further. I’m going to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, inflammatory markers, and celiac panel. We may also need to collect a stool sample to rule out infection. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. Blood tests and… a stool sample? That doesn’t sound too bad. Will the blood tests tell us if it’s… the IBD thing? And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m married, by the way. I feel bad just repeating that, but… I just want you to have all the information.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will give us some clues, yes. They can help us look for signs of inflammation and rule out other possible causes. The celiac panel will specifically test for antibodies related to celiac disease. It usually takes a few days to get the results back from the lab. In the meantime, I want you to focus on staying hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids – water, broth, electrolyte solutions. And try to eat bland, easy-to-digest foods, like toast, rice, and bananas. If you can, try to keep a food diary to see if you can identify any triggers. I'll also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist. They are the specialists in digestive health, and will be able to perform further testing, such as a colonoscopy or endoscopy, if needed. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Stay hydrated, bland food, food diary, and… see a specialist. A gastroenterologist. Okay. That sounds… a lot. But I guess it’s better to figure out what’s going on. Will the specialist… do the colonoscopy thing right away? I’ve heard… things. And… is there anything else I should be doing? I'm married, by the way. Just in case.
DOCTOR: No, the gastroenterologist won’t necessarily do a colonoscopy right away. They will review your blood test results, your medical history, and your symptoms, and then discuss the best course of action with you. A colonoscopy is an invasive procedure, so it's usually reserved for cases where further investigation is needed. For now, focus on the hydration and bland diet. Try not to stress too much about the colonoscopy at this point. We'll cross that bridge if and when we need to. As for other things, if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious infection or inflammation. Here are the lab orders and the gastroenterologist referral. I’ve also printed out some information about inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Thank you. For everything. You explained it all really well. And… you didn’t make me feel silly about repeating that I’m married. I guess I’ll just… try to stay hydrated and eat toast. And wait for the results. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I understand it’s a lot to take in, but we’ll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And try not to worry too much – we’re here to help. Have a good day, and I’ll see you back if needed.
