DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovec. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this cough. Been… a while now, I reckon. Just a dry tickle mostly. Not much to it, but it is persistent. Feels like it’s been hanging on forever, truthfully. I don’t rightly remember when it started, though. My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A cough, alright. And you said it’s been going on for… a while. Difficult to pinpoint when it started, you mentioned. Is it worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… I think it bothers me more at night. When I’m lyin’ down. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes, that little cough. Not terrible, but enough to wake me up. I usually just sit up for a bit, and it calms down. But it always comes back, eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse when lying down. Does anything else seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Well… dust, maybe? I used to work on cars, you see. Body work mostly. A lot of sanding, grinding… always dust around. Could be that. But I haven’t done that work in… oh, goodness, a long time. It’s hard to say for certain. I don't rightly remember all the details anymore. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Dust exposure… I see. And you're currently not exposed to much dust?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mostly stay inside these days. My daughter, bless her heart, she looks after me. Keeps things clean. I just… cough, regardless. It’s just… there. I don't go poking around in the garage much anymore, not like I used to. Too old for that kind of work, I suppose. And too forgetful to remember what I was even doing in there, half the time!
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, I get a little… short of breath sometimes. Not a lot, mind you. Just when I walk up the stairs. Or if I’m trying to do something… strenuous. Which isn’t much these days! But I wouldn’t say it’s bad. Just… noticeable. I feel my age, I suppose. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Well, feeling your age isn't typically a symptom, Mr. Pavlovec. But the shortness of breath is worth noting. Does it come with any wheezing or chest pain?
PATIENT: Wheezing… no, not that I recall. And no chest pain, thank goodness. Just… like my lungs are a little tired. Like I haven't got the puff I used to. It’s a small cough, see? Not a big, rattling one. Just… persistent. It's more annoying than anything, truthfully. And it worries my daughter, and I don’t want to worry her.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you’ve had this cough, and the shortness of breath, for… quite some time. Let's do a quick listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Just to get a baseline. Could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Sit up, you say? No problem, Doctor. Whatever you need. It's alright, I'm not afraid of a little listenin'. It's just… this cough, it's been with me so long, I sometimes forget it's even there, until someone asks about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is acceptable, but on the lower end. I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lobes, and slightly diminished breath sounds overall. I’d like to check your pulse oximetry again after you walk a short distance. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Allergies… hmm. That's a good question, Doctor. I don't… I don't rightly remember. I haven't taken much in the way of medicine lately. Used to take something for my arthritis, a long time ago, but I can't recall the name of it. And I don't think I had any problems with it. But my memory… it's not what it used to be. Perhaps my daughter would know? She keeps track of all that sort of thing. I just… try to stay comfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll note the uncertainty regarding allergies. And we will ask your daughter when she comes in. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Well, back in my younger days, yes. A pack a day, maybe. When I was workin’ on those cars, and with friends… But I quit a long time ago. Oh, goodness, must be forty, fifty years now. A long time. It was bad for me, I knew it. I stopped when my daughter was born. Didn’t want her breathin’ that in. I’m glad I did, though. Still got this cough, though. Doesn’t seem to want to go away, even after all this time.
DOCTOR: Alright, former smoker, quit 50 years ago. And you have no known drug allergies. Now, have you had a flu shot or pneumonia vaccine recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, now that’s a question. I don't rightly know, Doctor. I think… maybe last year? My daughter usually handles all that. She’s very good about keepin’ me up to date on those things. She worries about me, you see. She says I need to protect myself. I try to remember, but… it all gets mixed up in my head these days. Perhaps it was the year before? I truly can't recall. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I see a note from last fall indicating you received the pneumonia vaccine, but no record of a flu shot. Now, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, my… now you’re askin’. I had somethin’… somethin’ with my heart, I think. A long time ago. But they fixed it. At least, that’s what they told me. And… maybe high blood pressure? I used to take a pill for it. But I stopped takin’ it a while back. Doctor said… said it wasn't botherin’ me much. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a blur. My mind just doesn’t hold onto things like it used to. I wish I could give you a straight answer. Is my daughter here yet? She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of a cardiac condition, discontinued blood pressure medication. And we’ll get clarification from your daughter. We'll need to get a chest X-ray to rule out anything serious. Also, I'm going to prescribe you an inhaler to help with your breathing. It’s a bronchodilator – it'll open up your airways. Do you have any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing? Hmm… No, not really. I eat my soup just fine. And my daughter makes me nice, soft noodles. Never had any trouble gettin' food down. I've always been able to eat, thankfully. Just this cough that won't go away, you see? And gettin' a little… tired, sometimes. But swallowing… no, that’s not a problem. I’m thankful for that, at least. It would be awful if I couldn't enjoy my meals.
DOCTOR: Alright, no trouble swallowing. We'll get that X-ray ordered and get you set up with the inhaler. And we’ll speak to your daughter when she arrives to get a more complete history. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. I’m just… glad to be gettin' it checked out. I trust your judgement. I just hope this inhaler helps. And I really do appreciate you takin' the time to listen to an old man like me. My memory isn’t what it used to be, and I’m sure I’ve left things out. I'm lookin' forward to seein' my daughter. She'll be able to fill in all the blanks.
DOCTOR: Very well. A nurse will be in shortly to get you set up for the X-ray. We'll discuss the results once they are available. .
PATIENT: .
