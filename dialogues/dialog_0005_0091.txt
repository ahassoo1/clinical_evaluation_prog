DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, things not really good, you see. I been feeling… very thirsty lately. All the time thirsty. And hungry too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don't seem right.
DOCTOR: Alright, thirsty and hungry, even after eating. Okay. And how long have you been feeling this way, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe about a month now? It start slow, just a little more thirsty than usual. But the last week or so, it really bad. I does have to drink so much water, and still feeling dry. And the hunger… always wanting something to eat. Even if I just finish. It strange.
DOCTOR: A month, gradually worsening. Alright. And have you noticed any other changes along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Well… now that you ask… I does pee a lot more than before. I thought it was just the water I drinking, but maybe it more than that? I having to get up in the night too, which I never used to do. Does that make sense? It just… more pee, all the time. And I does feel a little tired, but I does work hard, so I thought it was from that.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urination, especially at night, and some fatigue. Those are all things we need to look at. Now, Ms. Zicarelli, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Ask whatever you need to ask. I just want to know what going on with me. I does worry sometimes, you know? I never been sick like this before.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll figure it out. Have you had any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm… not really, Doctor. Everything seem the same. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I always need my glasses, you know? I been wearing them for years. I don't think it worse than usual. But I haven't change the prescription in a while, maybe that it?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And what about any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, Doctor. I don't think so. If anything, I might have gain a little. I does like my food, you know? And with the hunger, I does eat plenty. I haven't been weighing myself though, so I can't say for sure. But I haven't notice getting smaller.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well, not really, Doctor. I does get a little high blood pressure sometimes, the doctor tell me. But I does try to watch my salt. And my knees does bother me, but that just old age, I think! Nothing serious, really. I never been in the hospital for anything, if that what you asking. I does try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension, managed with diet, and some knee pain. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had a surgery. Not one. I does try to avoid them if I could! I does hear stories, you know? Always something could go wrong. I prefer just to deal with things if I could, instead of letting someone cut me open. You understand?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. My mother, she had diabetes, the doctor tell me. And my father, he had heart problems. But that was a long time ago, you know? I don’t really know much about it, to be honest. They both gone now. I have a sister, but we not close. I don't talk to her much. She live far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of diabetes in your mother and heart problems in your father. That’s important information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides anything for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just sometimes a little something for my knees when they really bothering me. But it over-the-counter, you know? Nothing the doctor give me. Just something I get at the pharmacy. And I don’t take it all the time, just when I need to. That’s all. Really. I try to avoid taking too much pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything. I does eat everything, you know? I love my food too much to worry about allergies! I eat all the doubles and roti I could get my hands on! I never had any trouble with anything. That’s a blessing, really. But thank you for asking.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Zicarelli. Thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me – the increased thirst and urination, the fatigue, and the family history of diabetes – I think we need to do a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’d like to start with a blood sugar test, a urine test, and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. Anything to find out what wrong. I just want to feel better, you know? I does worry so much. Blood sugar and urine… whatever you need to do. Just tell me what I have to do. I trust you to help me.
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad to hear that. The blood sugar test is just a simple prick of the finger. The urine test will require a sample - I'll have the nurse show you where the restroom is and provide you with a cup. The blood draw for the metabolic panel will be done by the phlebotomist down the hall. It will take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you started with the urine sample.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you so much. I does appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I been worrying myself sick, you know? Hopefully, it nothing serious. I just want to go back to feeling like myself. I'll go and do what you say, and wait for the results. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Zicarelli. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Try not to worry too much. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
