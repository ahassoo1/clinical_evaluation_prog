DOCTOR: Hi Lilliana, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… it’s my joints, mostly. They get real stiff in the mornings, you know? Makes getting going a bit hard. I don’t really… remember much else about it, to be honest. Just the stiffness.
DOCTOR: Okay, joint stiffness in the mornings. That's a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about where exactly you're feeling this stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, um… everywhere, I think? My fingers, definitely. And my knees… maybe my hips too? It's hard to say exactly. They all kinda ache together. Not a sharp pain, just… stiff. Like they need oiling, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. “Needing oiling” is a good way to put it! And is this stiffness worse at any other times of the day besides the morning?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I don’t think. It’s definitely the worst first thing. After I get moving a bit, it eases up. It’s not… gone, exactly, but it’s not nearly as bad. I just… take my time getting ready, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it improves with activity. And how long has this been going on, Lilliana?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a hard one. A while now, definitely. Months, at least. Maybe longer? I… I don’t keep good track of things. It just kinda… slowly got worse. Not a sudden thing, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset over months. That’s helpful. Now, would you say this stiffness is affecting your ability to do things – like everyday activities, housework, or hobbies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little. I like to garden, but bending over is harder now. And… well, my grandkids, they like to play, but it’s… harder to get up and down off the floor with them. Not that I can’t do it, just… takes more effort.
DOCTOR: I see. Gardening and playing with your grandkids – that’s important. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in any of your joints?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. Maybe a little? It’s hard to tell. I’m a bit… well, I get a bit puffy sometimes, generally. I don’t know if that’s the same thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can take a look. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your joints, like a sprain or fracture?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I think I twisted my ankle years ago, when I was younger. A long, long time ago. Nothing serious, I don’t think. And maybe I bumped my knee a few times, gardening. But nothing that needed a doctor, you know? Just little things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter, for anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Just… sometimes a little something for my headaches, if they get bad. But that's it. Nothing regularly. I try to avoid pills if I can, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't think so. I get a bit sniffly in the spring, with all the flowers, but I don't think that's a proper allergy. And I haven't had any trouble with pills before, as far as I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had aches and pains, I think. But everyone gets those, right? And my father… he was healthy as a horse, as far as I know. I don’t really… we didn’t talk much about health, back then. It wasn't something we focused on.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We don’t need a detailed history if it’s not readily available. Now, before we move on, can you tell me a bit about what you do in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, well… I mostly look after my grandkids when their parents are working. Just the usual – playing, reading, making snacks. I like to keep busy. And I try to get out in the garden when I can, weather permitting. It keeps me moving, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, very active with the grandkids and gardening. Wonderful. Now, before I examine your joints, I’m going to ask you a few quick questions about other areas of your body. This is just to get a more complete picture. Have you been experiencing any fatigue, or unusual tiredness lately?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. A little bit. But I just thought it was because I was busy. Keeping up with those grandkids is tiring work!
DOCTOR: Okay, understandable. Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. Nothing like that. I sleep pretty soundly, usually. Maybe a bit warm sometimes, but that’s just the blankets.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, um… a little bit, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. I like my food, you know? And it’s been hard to get out much with the weather. Not a lot, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, have you noticed any skin rashes, or changes in your eyes or mouth?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I’ve seen. My eyes are getting a little… tired, maybe? But that's just getting old, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for answering all those questions, Lilliana. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to take a quick look at your joints. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just feeling around your joints now. I notice some mild tenderness in your finger joints, particularly on the sides closest to your knuckles. There’s a slight limitation in your range of motion, but nothing dramatic. No significant swelling or redness at this point. Now, can you bend your fingers all the way?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Like this? It feels a little… stiff, there. Not painful, exactly, just… tight. And it’s harder to do it than it used to be, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And how about your wrists?
PATIENT: Oh, these are alright, I think. A little stiff, like everything else, but not bad. It’s just… getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, now let’s take a look at your knees and hips. I notice some mild discomfort when you bend your knees, and a slight limitation in your range of motion. No significant swelling or redness at this point. Your hips feel a little tight, but no acute pain. I'm going to listen to your knees now, just to rule anything else out. Okay, all sounds clear. Now, I'd like to order some blood tests and possibly an X-ray of your hands and knees. These will help us get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests and X-rays? That sounds… serious. But if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. Whatever you need. I just… hope it’s nothing too awful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Lilliana. It’s better to be thorough and find out exactly what’s going on. The blood tests will help us look for any signs of inflammation or autoimmune conditions, and the X-rays will help us assess the condition of your joints. I'm going to write you a referral to the lab for the blood work, and a request for the X-rays. The lab should be able to draw the blood right away, and you can usually get the X-rays done the same day or the next day. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to stay active, as much as you can without causing significant pain. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help manage any discomfort. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, ibuprofen… yes, I think I’ve used that before. Okay, good. And staying active… I'll try. It’s just harder now, you know? Will… will I know when to come back? Once the tests are done?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Once the lab results and X-ray reports are available, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. We’ll discuss the results and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. Typically, it takes a few days for the results to come back, so expect a call within a week. If you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – like severe pain, swelling, or fever – please don’t hesitate to contact the office right away. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. It’s good to know what’s going on, even if it’s a bit scary.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’ll get to the bottom of this together. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here are the referrals, and a sheet with some information about managing joint pain. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
