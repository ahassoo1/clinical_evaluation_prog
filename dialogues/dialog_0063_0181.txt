DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. Please, tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, as the paperwork indicates, I requested a general wellness panel. I just turned seventy-four, you see, and my wife, Elena, insisted I get a thorough check-up. She’s very… proactive about these things. I feel quite well, generally, but one can never be too careful, no? I thought it best to have a baseline established, should anything… change.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, preventative care is… advisable, I suppose. Though frankly, at your age, a great deal is already… established. Baseline, as you say. Very good. Let's proceed efficiently. Do you have any specific concerns besides simply wanting a “thorough check-up”?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not specifically. No aches, no pains, no… unusual tiredness. My appetite is good, and I sleep well – perhaps a bit too well sometimes, Elena says I snore. But truthfully, I feel rather robust for my age. I still do a good deal of work, you know. Construction isn't easy, but I enjoy it. I suppose I’m just… wanting reassurance, if you understand. A confirmation that everything is functioning as it should.
DOCTOR: Construction work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. For… well, nearly fifty years now. Mostly framing, some roofing when needed. It keeps me active, you see. And honestly, I find it… satisfying. Building something tangible. My hands are… accustomed to the work, even if they ache a bit at the end of the day. Nothing debilitating, mind you. Just… the normal wear and tear of a life spent working with them. I used to be faster, of course. But I can still manage a good day’s work. Elena worries, naturally. She says I should be relaxing, enjoying my retirement. But I find I am more relaxed when I am working. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… common for people to define themselves by their occupation. Though it rarely impacts one’s physiological health directly. Now, let's move past your vocational pursuits and address more relevant matters. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of, Doctor. I've eaten… everything, throughout my life, traveling as I have. Elena has a slight sensitivity to certain pollens, but I myself have never had a reaction to anything. No medications, either, beyond a mild pain reliever occasionally for a strained muscle. Nothing regular, I assure you. I pride myself on being a rather… resilient constitution. Though, as I said, one can never be too careful. It’s good to be thorough, no?
DOCTOR: Resilience is… noted. And you take no regular medication whatsoever?
PATIENT: Absolutely none, Doctor. Not even vitamins. Elena tries to get me to take a multivitamin, but I find them… unnecessary. I believe in a good, balanced diet – plenty of fruits, vegetables, fish. We eat very well. Elena is an excellent cook, a tradition passed down through her family. She insists on fresh ingredients, everything made from scratch. I suppose that’s why I’ve remained so… healthy for so long. A good diet, hard work, and a positive outlook. Those are my secrets, Doctor. Perhaps a bit of good luck as well.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination then. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. And try to relax, Mr. Mombrun.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I shall endeavor to relax. Though I confess, I am not particularly fond of medical establishments. Too many… reminders of fragility, perhaps. But I trust your expertise, Doctor. Please proceed at your leisure.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… slightly elevated. 148 over 92. Not alarming, but requires monitoring. Heart rate is regular, 76 beats per minute. Respiration is normal. Now, let me listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again…
PATIENT: As you wish, Doctor. My father, you know, he was a fisherman in Venezuela. Spent his entire life on the water. Strong lungs, he had. Although, he did develop a bit of a cough in his later years. Nothing serious, just… the dampness, I believe. But a strong pair of lungs are essential for a life well-lived, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please keep your arm relaxed. Normal response. And now the other side. Also normal. Now, I will need to briefly palpate your abdomen. No tenderness noted. Now, please sit up. I need to auscultate your heart sounds.
PATIENT: As you wish, Doctor. My wife, Elena, always said I have a strong heart. Not just figuratively, you understand. She said it was the rhythm, the steadiness. She’s very observant, my Elena. A natural healer, she is, although she never formally trained. She knows instinctively what is needed. Proceed at your leisure, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: There's a… slight murmur. Inconsistent, but present. We will need to investigate that further. Now, stand up slowly. I will check your gait. Please walk a few steps forward and then backward.
PATIENT: As you wish, Doctor. My knees occasionally ache after a long day’s work, but nothing debilitating. Just… the wear and tear of a life spent on my feet, you understand. I used to be quite a dancer, you know. When I was younger, back in Venezuela. Salsa, mostly. Very energetic. But those days are long gone.
DOCTOR: Very well. That will be sufficient for now. Your weight is 90 kilograms, and your height is 193 centimeters. Body Mass Index is… within acceptable range. Now, I'd like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid profile. And an EKG, to further assess the murmur. We’ll also schedule a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. As my wife would say, “better safe than sorry.” I trust your judgment implicitly. An EKG and a chest X-ray, you say? Very well. I shall cooperate fully. Will these require a separate appointment, or can they be done today? I have a bit of flexibility in my schedule, fortunately. I have a crew waiting for me back at the construction site, but they are accustomed to my… occasional absences.
DOCTOR: The EKG and chest X-ray can be done today. The lab technician will draw your blood now. And then you’ll proceed to radiology. It will take approximately two hours, Mr. Mombrun. I’ll review the results and contact you with a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Two hours, you say? That is… acceptable. No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. I trust your expertise implicitly, as I mentioned before. Elena will be pleased to hear we are being so thorough. She always insists on getting to the root of any potential problem. Very well then. Lead the way, Doctor. I am ready to proceed with the blood work and the… radiology, as you call it. I trust everything is straightforward? No special preparation required?
DOCTOR: No special preparation is required. The lab technician will explain the procedure. Follow their instructions carefully. And try not to exert yourself before your appointment. The technician is just down the hall, first door on the left. I will see you at your follow-up appointment. And please, do try to relax, Mr. Mombrun.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavor to relax. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate your thoroughness. And I’m certain Elena will be relieved to hear everything is being taken care of. .
