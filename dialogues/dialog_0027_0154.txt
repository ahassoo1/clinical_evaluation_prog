DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. Yes, good morning. It’s… something with my waterworks, I think. Keeps coming back. It’s… unpleasant. I don’t remember much about why it happens, just that it… does. Frequently.
DOCTOR: Okay, "something with your waterworks" – frequent urination, you said?
PATIENT: Not exactly urination, Doctor. More… a burning feeling. And… discomfort. It comes and goes, but mostly comes. I’m sorry, it’s hard to explain. It feels like… an irritation. Is that clear? I do apologize for being vague. My memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: No, no apology needed at all. It sounds like you’re experiencing some discomfort and a burning sensation, something to do with passing urine. That's helpful. Could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… difficult. A long time, I think. Months, surely. Maybe longer? I honestly can’t say for certain. It flares up, then calms down, then… flares up again. It’s very… cyclical. I remember my ex-husband saying something about it, years ago. He wasn’t very helpful, though. Is that useful information? I really wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, months, coming and going. That gives us something to work with. And thank you for mentioning your ex-husband – even a negative detail can sometimes be helpful. Have you noticed anything specifically that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Let me think. I… I think… drinking coffee makes it worse. Definitely coffee. And… maybe spicy food? Yes, spicy food. That doesn't agree with me, generally. As for better… lying down, perhaps? When I’m resting it feels less… urgent. Though it still… bothers me. It's a constant annoyance, really. I try not to drink much water, thinking it would help, but then I get… thirsty. It’s a bit of a dilemma.
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee and spicy food seem to aggravate it, and resting provides some relief. You've mentioned trying to limit water intake, but experiencing thirst as a result. I see. Now, aside from the burning and discomfort, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Let me see. Sometimes… I feel a little tired. But I'm 66, Doctor, so that could be anything. And… occasionally a bit of a lower back ache. Not severe, just… a dull throbbing. And… … I have to get up several times during the night to… well, you know. To use the bathroom. It’s very disruptive. Is that what you mean by symptoms? I’m really not sure what else there would be. I don’t have a fever, if that’s what you’re thinking. Or chills. Or anything… dramatic.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, lower back discomfort, and waking up frequently at night. Those are all important things to know. And no fever or chills, good. Now, could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… complicated. I had my tonsils out as a child, I believe. And… … I broke my arm once, falling off a bicycle. And… I had a gallbladder removed, many years ago. But other than that… I can’t really recall. I’ve never been a particularly healthy person, but I haven’t had any… serious illnesses. I don't think. I went to a different doctor before, but I can’t remember his name. Or where his office was. I apologize. My mind is just… a blank. I wasn’t married for very long. That’s probably irrelevant.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Claudene. It's okay if you don't remember everything. Let me just see if we have any records on file… Ah, here we are. It looks like you had your gallbladder removed in 1998, as you said. And some notes about high blood pressure, diagnosed in 2010. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a relief you found something! Yes, high blood pressure. I do take a pill for that… … here it is. A little white pill. I take one every morning. I… don't remember the name of it. I just know the nurse at the pharmacy reminds me. It's a very… routine thing. Is that important, Doctor? I’m sorry for being so… unhelpful. I really wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Claudene. We’ll figure this out together. … It looks like you’re taking Lisinopril, 10mg, once daily. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a… reaction to anything. Not like a rash, or swelling, or anything dramatic. I can eat shellfish. I enjoy a good paella. And I’m not allergic to cats. I used to have a cat, a lovely tabby named… Catalina, I think. Is that helpful? I’m really trying to recall, but my mind is… a bit fuzzy. I don’t think I've ever been truly sick, other than… this waterworks problem, of course. And the gallbladder. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, one final question for now, Claudene. Would you mind if I performed a brief physical examination?
