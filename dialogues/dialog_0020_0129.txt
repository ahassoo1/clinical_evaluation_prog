DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly, I haven't got all day. It's this… stool. Black, you know? Like tar. And I take those pain pills – the NSAIDs, whatever they’re called – all the time for my arthritis. Been taking 'em for years. I just figured it was that, but my Harold said I should get it checked. He worries too much, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Black, tarry stools are definitely something we want to look into, even if it could be related to the pain pills. And it’s good Harold is encouraging you to come in – it’s always good to have someone looking out for you. You mentioned taking NSAIDs for arthritis… can you tell me which ones, and how much you typically take each day?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, I don't remember the name of them. Little white pills. I get 'em from Harold, he handles all that. He gets 'em mailed, a big bottle. As for how much… usually two in the morning, two at night. Sometimes more if my knees are really bothering me. I don't bother with counting, really. It’s not like I'm a scientist, is it? Just trying to get through the day.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember the exact name or dosage. We can figure it out. Harold will be a good source of information, then. Okay, besides the stool changes and the pain pills, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I'm a bit tired, maybe. But who isn't tired at my age? And my stomach's been a bit…off. Not really sick, just…not right. And a little weaker than usual, I suppose. But I just thought that was getting old. Honestly, doc, I don't go around paying attention to every little ache and pain. Life's too short.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're telling me about these things, even if they seem minor. “Not right” is a good way to describe it. Has the weakness been sudden, or has it been developing gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It's not like I woke up one morning unable to walk. Just…things take a bit more effort. Getting out of the chair, going up the steps…that sort of thing. And I've lost a little weight, maybe? Harold keeps telling me I need to eat more, but I have a good appetite. It just doesn't seem to stick, you know? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like an old nag. Can we just get this sorted out and be done with it? I have a bingo game tonight.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. And don't worry, we'll do our best to get this sorted out as quickly as possible so you can enjoy your bingo game. The gradual weakness and unintentional weight loss are things we need to investigate a little further, though. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Get it over with. Just don't poke around too much. I bruise easily, you know. And I really don't like having strangers mess with me. Hurry up, please. This is taking up my whole morning.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be very careful. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table, if you can. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. Okay, a little tenderness here and there, but nothing alarming. Do you typically experience pain in those areas?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a bit of…discomfort sometimes. Old age, probably. I get aches and pains all over. I haven’t been paying attention to where. It comes and goes. Honestly, doc, you’re just poking around for things that aren’t there. Are you sure this is necessary? I bet it’s just the pills. I’m telling you, those pills… Harold should just let me take less, but he worries about my arthritis. He’s a good man, but… sometimes he overthinks things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Dawnetta. And it's possible it is related to the pills. However, with the black stool, gradual weakness, and weight loss, it's important to rule out other possibilities, just to be safe. Alright. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool test to check for blood. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, for goodness sake. More poking and prodding? And a stool test? You want a sample of that? Honestly, doc, this is getting ridiculous. Look, I'm an old woman. I'm probably just getting old. Can't I just go home and take a nap? I really don’t see the point of all this fuss. I suppose…if Harold insists, I’ll do the tests. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. Just get it over with. Where do I go to do these tests? And how long will it take? I have that bingo game, remember?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. I wouldn't recommend these tests if I didn't think they were important, and I’ll be as quick as possible. There's a lab just down the hall. The phlebotomist there will draw a small sample of blood. The stool test will require a collection sample – the lab will give you instructions and a collection kit. It should only take about 30 minutes for the blood draw, and the lab can explain the details of the stool collection. It may take a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, let’s discuss your pain medication. It would be ideal if Harold could come in with you for a follow-up appointment so we can discuss the dosage and potential alternatives. Would that be possible?
PATIENT: Oh, Harold can come. He likes being involved in everything. Fine. Whatever. Just tell me when. I’m not promising anything about changing my pills, though. They help me, you know? I can barely get out of bed without them. He worries too much, honestly. This is all such a hassle. Can I at least have a glass of water before I go to this…lab? My mouth feels dry just thinking about it. .
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. Let me get a nurse to bring you a glass of water. And yes, we can certainly discuss your pain medication at the follow-up, and Harold's input is very valuable. The nurse will be right with you. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take good care of you. .
