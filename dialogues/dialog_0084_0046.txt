DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, I’ve been having some… pressure on my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… difficult to describe exactly. It just feels full, even after I’ve just gone to the bathroom. And sometimes, it feels like I need to go very urgently, even if there isn’t much in there, if that makes sense? It doesn't hurt, exactly, more… uncomfortable and a little worrying.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. So, feeling of fullness even after voiding, and a sense of urgency. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, roughly two months now? It wasn’t constant at first, just every now and then. But it’s become more frequent over the last few weeks, and that’s what prompted me to schedule an appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, two months, started gradually and getting worse. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I don’t think so. The color seems normal, as far as I can tell. And I haven’t noticed any unusual odor. I will pay closer attention, though, now that you mention it. It’s easy to not really notice, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, it is. And have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and no pain anywhere. Just this… pressure. I haven't felt unwell in any other way, really. It's just been this ongoing discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning at all. That hasn’t been an issue, thankfully. It's purely this pressure and the feeling of needing to go constantly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’m generally quite healthy, thankfully. I had a bout of bronchitis a couple of years ago, but that was it. Otherwise, I haven’t had any serious illnesses or surgeries. My husband says I’m annoyingly healthy. I do have Medicare, as I mentioned to the receptionist.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No significant medical history. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any regular medications. Just occasional ibuprofen for headaches, if needed, but that's it. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I prefer natural remedies when possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat everything, and I haven’t had any problems with insect bites or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any bladder or urinary issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t recall anyone specifically talking about bladder problems. My mother had high blood pressure, and my grandfather had diabetes, but nothing related to the urinary system, as far as I know. I could ask my aunt, she's very good at remembering family medical history. Would that be helpful?
DOCTOR: That could be helpful, yes. But for now, let's proceed. Okay. And finally, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I lead a pretty quiet life, to be honest. Mostly work and spending time with my husband.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I'll do a quick neurological check. It’s pretty standard for this type of complaint. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Please proceed. I understand it’s standard procedure, and I trust your judgement. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm listening to your abdomen now. Deep breaths, please. Sounds normal so far. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation in your lower extremities. Just relax your legs. Reflexes are normal, and sensation appears intact. No obvious tenderness to palpation. Now, I’m just going to do a quick external examination. This is just to rule out anything obvious. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. No significant findings there either. Everything seems normal on the physical exam.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. I was a little worried it might be something more serious. I appreciate you taking the time to do a thorough examination. So, what does this all mean, Doctor? What do you think is causing this pressure?
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it’s unlikely to be anything serious. However, the persistent pressure and urgency are still concerning and need to be investigated further. It could be a number of things – a urinary tract infection, even if you don’t have the typical symptoms, overactive bladder, or potentially something related to bladder function. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. That will help us determine if your bladder is emptying completely. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. A urinalysis and the post-void residual volume test sound fine. When can I expect those results, Doctor? And will I need to schedule another appointment to discuss them?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The lab can usually get the urinalysis results back within a day or two. The post-void residual volume test we can do right here in the office today. We’ll have you urinate, and then a quick scan will measure how much is left. We should have those results immediately. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today, just to discuss the results and formulate a plan. If anything changes or worsens before then – fever, pain, blood in your urine – please call the office immediately. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A week from today for a follow-up is good. And I will definitely call if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor Voytek. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. Would you like me to go to the restroom now for the post-void residual volume test?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. The nurse will be right in to assist you. She’ll explain the process and get you settled. We’ll get those results quickly, and then we can discuss them next week. Don't hesitate to ask her any questions you have.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and patience. I will. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I hope you have a good day as well.
