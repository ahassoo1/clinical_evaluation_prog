DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. My… breathing. It is making a whistling sound. Like this… I take a slightly deeper breath, demonstrating a wheeze. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: I see. A whistling sound with your breathing, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Especially when I walk. Or if I try to do something quick. It’s not always there, but… it makes me tired. I used to be very strong, you know. I was an athletic trainer for many years. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this has been a change for you, and it's understandably concerning. So, the whistling is more noticeable with activity, and it’s causing some fatigue. Has this been a sudden change, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Maybe… six months ago? It was very small then. I thought it was just… getting old. But it is getting worse. And I do not like it. It feels… tight in my chest sometimes too. Not always, but when the whistling is very bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradually worsening over about six months, with some tightness in your chest when the whistling is more pronounced. And you mentioned it affects you with activity. Have you noticed any coughing associated with this?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A little. Not a big cough. Just… a tickle. And I have to clear my throat. More in the mornings, I think. It’s not a bad cough, like a sickness cough. Just… annoying. I do not smoke, if that matters. Never have.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. And the cough is more of a tickle, mainly in the mornings. Alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder out many years ago. Maybe… twenty years? And my blood pressure is a little high, the doctor told me. I take a pill for that, every morning. It is… a white pill. I think. I forget the name. And I had a bad fall last year, broke my wrist. But that is healed now, mostly. It gets a little stiff sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gallbladder removal about twenty years ago, high blood pressure managed with a pill – we'll try to figure out the name of that later, no worries – and a wrist fracture last year that's mostly healed. Do you remember any other surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. Nothing else. I have always been very healthy, until… this breathing. And the blood pressure, of course. But I always walked a lot. And I ate good food. Well, mostly good food. My daughter always tells me I eat too much sugar! I chuckle softly. But I try to be good now. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Alright, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has had problems with their lungs, like asthma or emphysema?
PATIENT: Hmm… That is a good question. My mother, she had some trouble breathing when she got very old. But I do not know what it was. The doctor did not say. And my brother, he smoked his whole life. He died young, from something else. Not his lungs. I don't think so. No one else, not that I remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Just the white pill for my blood pressure. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis in my hands. It is a small pink pill. When they are very sore. Not every day, just when they hurt. I get it from the pharmacy. I do not remember the name of that one either, sorry. I have so many pills! I let out a small sigh.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Many people find it difficult to keep track. We’ll get it sorted out. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. The doctor has given me medicines before, for different things. And I have never had a bad reaction. I eat all kinds of food. Well, almost all kinds. I do not like spicy food, but that is not an allergy! I chuckle. I do not think I am allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, Margret, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. I hope you can find out what is wrong with my breathing. It worries me, you know. I want to be able to walk again, without getting so tired. I take a deep breath. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Margret. We'll do our best. If you could just sit here on the table for me, that would be great. Okay. I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs, particularly on the right side. Your oxygen levels are a little low, at 92%, but not critically so. I also notice you're using a few extra muscles to breathe. It sounds like something is narrowing your airways, making it harder to get air in and out. This is consistent with what you’ve been describing.
PATIENT: Narrowing my airways? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Is it my lungs? I have never had trouble breathing before, until recently. This is very frightening. I clasp my hands together in my lap, looking anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Margret. It is concerning when something changes with your breathing. “Narrowing of the airways” simply means that the passages that carry air to your lungs are a bit constricted, making it harder for air to flow. Several things could be causing this. The most common possibilities are asthma, even if you've never had it diagnosed before, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is sometimes related to smoking, although it can occur in people who haven’t smoked. It could also be a respiratory infection, though you don’t have the typical symptoms of a cold or flu. We need to do a few more tests to figure out exactly what’s going on. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and rule out any other possibilities. I would also like to do a simple breathing test, called spirometry, where you blow into a tube to measure how much air you can get in and out of your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray and a breathing test… yes, that is alright. I want to know what is wrong. I do not want to just sit here and worry. My daughter always says I should take care of myself. She would be very relieved to know I am getting this checked out. What will the tests tell you, Doctor? And… will they hurt? I look at the doctor with apprehension.
DOCTOR: That’s the right approach, Margret. It’s always best to get things checked out. The chest X-ray will give us a picture of your lungs, so we can see if there's any inflammation, fluid buildup, or other problems. The breathing test, spirometry, will measure how much air you can blow in and out of your lungs, and how quickly you can do it. This will help us determine if your airways are narrowed, and if so, how severe it is. Neither of these tests should hurt. The X-ray is just a quick image, and you’ll stand still for a few moments. The breathing test involves breathing in and out through a mouthpiece, and a technician will guide you through it. It might be a little tiring, but it shouldn't be painful. I’ll have the nurse come in to explain the tests in more detail and schedule them for you. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your breathing, or if you feel any chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Chest X-ray and a breathing test. And go to the emergency room if it gets worse. My daughter will be very happy I am doing this. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. I offer a small, grateful smile. I will wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. We’re here to help. And you’re doing the right thing by getting this checked out. I'll let the nurse know to come in shortly. Please don’t hesitate to ask if anything else comes to mind.
