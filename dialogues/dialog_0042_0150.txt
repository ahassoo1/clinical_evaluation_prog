DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I’m not here to chat, Doctor. I want to have a baby. A perfectly healthy baby. And frankly, at my age, I’d like to get this process moving. I don’t want any…complications. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Ms. Shteynberg. That's a very reasonable goal, and we will certainly do everything we can to help make that happen. Planning for a healthy pregnancy, especially as you mentioned your age, is very important. First, let's gather some information. To start, have you been trying to conceive for a while now, or is this a more recent decision?
PATIENT: Trying? Doctor, I haven’t been…actively trying in the way you’re probably thinking. This is…a considered decision. I’ve divorced a…problematic man, and I’ve decided I want a child now. Before it’s…too late. It’s not like I’ve been waiting around for a sign. I simply decided. And I expect a smooth process. Is that…understandable?
DOCTOR: Absolutely understandable, Ms. Shteynberg. A very decisive approach, and completely valid. It's wonderful you're taking charge of this. Since this is a planned pregnancy, and to ensure everything goes as smoothly as possible, I'd like to get a complete medical history. We'll cover a few things, if you don't mind. Let's start with your past medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid issues, or anything else you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, please. Do I look like I have high blood pressure? I maintain a very strict diet and exercise regime. And diabetes? Absolutely not. I have excellent self-discipline. I had a…minor issue with my gallbladder years ago, removed it, that's all. Otherwise, perfectly healthy. Divorces are stressful, not physically damaging, you know. Is this really necessary? I’ve had yearly check-ups, I assure you.
DOCTOR: It is good to hear you prioritize your health, Ms. Shteynberg. And it’s excellent that you’ve had regular check-ups. Knowing about the gallbladder removal is helpful, thank you. Just to be thorough, and to get a complete picture for your pregnancy planning, could you tell me about any past surgeries you’ve had, besides the gallbladder?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is rather tedious. Let me see…the gallbladder, obviously. And…a very minor cosmetic procedure on my nose, decades ago. A slight refinement. It’s hardly relevant. Really. It was done in Hungary, by a very reputable doctor. I won’t bore you with the details. It was before I…met my ex-husband. Is that sufficient? I have a busy schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Ms. Shteynberg. Thank you. Knowing about both procedures is helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, family. A complicated subject. My mother…she had some…nerves. Anxious tendencies. My grandmother, on my father’s side, had…arthritis. Badly. And I believe my great-uncle had something with his heart, but it was a long time ago. No cancers that I’m aware of. Frankly, Doctor, my family wasn’t particularly…robust. Is that what you wanted to know? They mostly drank and complained. It’s not a particularly useful medical history, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Shteynberg. It is helpful to have that information, even if it doesn't seem directly relevant. Knowing about the anxious tendencies and arthritis is good to note. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Are you serious right now? Do I look like someone who would partake in such…vulgar habits? I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I drink sparkling water with lemon. Occasionally, a small glass of Hungarian wine with dinner – a very good vintage, of course. And smoking? Absolutely not. It ruins the skin, you know. And recreational drugs? Good heavens, no. I have standards. Is this some sort of…test?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Shteynberg. Just gathering a complete picture of your health. Thank you for clarifying. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. The standard kind. And occasionally, an iron supplement, when I feel…sluggish. That’s it. Nothing more. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. And I am very careful about what I put into my body. I don’t need to be pumped full of…chemicals. Really, Doctor, I think we’ve covered everything relevant. Can we move on to…tests now? I’d like to get this process started.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. It sounds like you are very conscientious about your health, which is excellent. Before we discuss testing, I’d like to quickly confirm your allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I live a refined life. I don't just eat anything. I am not prone to…reactions. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to dust, but that’s hardly relevant. And no, I don’t have any serious allergies. Really. Are we going to spend the entire afternoon on trivialities? I want to discuss the chances of success, and what steps we need to take. The sooner the better.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. It sounds like you have no significant allergies. Now, to discuss the next steps. Given your age and desire to conceive, I recommend a few initial tests to assess your overall health and fertility. We'll want to do a comprehensive blood panel to check your hormone levels, thyroid function, and general organ function. We'll also want to do a urine analysis. I'd also recommend a transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate your uterus and ovaries. And, if you are comfortable with it, we can do an antral follicle count to assess your ovarian reserve. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Fine. The blood tests…I suppose. But not if they require an excessive amount of blood. I faint easily. And what about…the chances? What is the likelihood of success, realistically? I don’t want to be wasting my time and energy on a fruitless endeavor. Be honest, Doctor. I’m not interested in false hope. And how quickly can we get started? I have a social calendar to maintain, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. Honesty is paramount. The likelihood of success at your age does depend on several factors, including your overall health, ovarian reserve, and the presence of any underlying conditions. While fertility naturally declines with age, many women in their 50s successfully conceive with assisted reproductive technologies, if needed. The initial tests will give us a clearer picture of your individual situation and help us determine the best course of action. Regarding the blood work, we only need a standard amount – about two vials. We can certainly take precautions to ensure you feel comfortable. As for starting, we can schedule the blood tests and ultrasound for tomorrow morning at the lab down the hall. Once we have the results, which typically take 3-5 business days, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Tomorrow morning, then. But I expect prompt results. And I want a direct line to you, Doctor. No assistants, no gatekeepers. I want to speak to you directly. This is important to me. And if the results are…unsatisfactory, I expect you to be frank about it. No sugarcoating. I have a very busy life, and I don’t have time for…delays. Is that understood? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a luncheon appointment. Let’s get this scheduling done.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understood, Ms. Shteynberg. I will personally review your results and will be happy to discuss them with you directly. I will also ensure you have my direct contact information. I will have my assistant schedule your blood work and ultrasound for tomorrow morning and will send you the appointment confirmation immediately. Let me just confirm your date of birth to ensure we have everything correct…
