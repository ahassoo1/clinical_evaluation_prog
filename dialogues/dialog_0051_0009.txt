DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…Alcorta, actually. Delano Alcorta. Yes, well, I’ve been having some trouble with my vision. It’s…difficult to explain, precisely. It’s not a sudden thing, you understand. More…a gradual fading, I suppose. It's just becoming increasingly inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. “Gradual fading” is a good way to put it. And thank you for clarifying your name—my apologies. Let's try to pinpoint this a little better. When did you first notice this change in your vision?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I couldn’t give you a specific date. It’s been…months, certainly. Possibly even longer. I don’t concern myself with such trivial details unless absolutely necessary. I suppose…last fall, perhaps? Around the time of the pecan harvest, if that helps narrow it down. Though I do recall noticing it was a bit harder to read the fine print on those forms they make you sign for everything these days. A nuisance, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, last fall… around the pecan harvest. And difficulty with small print. That gives us a starting point. Has the fading been consistent, or has it come and gone?
PATIENT: Consistent, Doctor. Definitely consistent. It’s not as if I have good days and bad days, or anything so…dramatic. It simply…is. It’s a slow, steady decline. I suspect it’s probably just age, though I find the idea somewhat…irritating. My father had excellent eyesight well into his nineties. I find it hard to believe I’m already exhibiting these…weaknesses.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. It's never easy to feel changes like this. And family history is certainly important. Just to get a clearer picture, can you describe how your vision is fading?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s not as if everything is simply…darkening, if that makes sense. It's more…blurred. Things lack…definition. Edges aren't sharp. It’s rather like looking through a slightly dirty window, perhaps? Or maybe an old photograph. It's difficult to articulate, as I said before. I’m not a particularly…visual person, you see. I rely far more on logic and reasoning than on…pictures.
DOCTOR: “Blurred vision, lacking definition, like looking through a dirty window.” That’s very helpful, Mr. Alcorta. Do you notice it affects your distance vision, your near vision, or both?
PATIENT: Both, I believe. Though the near vision is…more problematic. Reading, as I mentioned, is becoming increasingly difficult. Distance is…adequate, though I wouldn’t trust myself to shoot a deer, if that's what you’re asking. I haven't any interest in hunting, mind you. It's simply a matter of principle. I prefer to observe, not…interfere.
DOCTOR: I understand. Both distance and near vision affected. Okay. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this vision change?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? I…don’t believe so. No flashes of light, no floaters, no pain, no…double vision. Just the gradual blurring. Though, now that you mention it, I have been rather…fatigued lately. But I attribute that to the general state of the world, frankly. So much unnecessary…complexity. And I haven’t been sleeping particularly well. Though again, I hardly think that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and some difficulty sleeping. It’s good you mentioned that, even if you don’t think it’s directly related. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing of any consequence. I’ve always been a remarkably…robust individual. A bit of arthritis in my hands, perhaps, as one gets older. But nothing requiring medication or…special attention. I’ve always believed in letting the body heal itself, rather than interfering with…pharmaceuticals. They simply mask the symptoms, you see, rather than addressing the root cause.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference, Mr. Alcorta. And it's good to hear you've generally been healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve always taken meticulous care of myself. Avoided unnecessary risks, adhered to a sensible diet, and…maintained a generally peaceful existence. Surgery is…a rather barbaric practice, frankly. I’ve always considered it a last resort. A rather…indignified one, at that. I have no desire to have anything…cut into me.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any eye conditions, such as glaucoma or macular degeneration, that run in your family?
PATIENT: My mother suffered from cataracts, I believe, in her later years. A rather…common affliction, as I understand it. My father, as I mentioned, had excellent eyesight. And my grandparents…well, I confess, I didn't pay much attention to their ailments. One doesn’t dwell on such things, you see. It’s far more productive to focus on…the future, rather than the past. And frankly, my family wasn’t particularly forthcoming about such…personal matters. It was considered rather impolite to inquire.
DOCTOR: Cataracts in your mother. That's helpful to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. I find the practice…repugnant. A senseless and self-destructive habit. I've always been a proponent of…moderation and self-discipline. And I've always found the smell…distressing. No, I've never so much as touched a cigarette in my life. It’s a rather…foolish pursuit, frankly. And rather…unsophisticated.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol consumption, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: I partake occasionally, Doctor. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Or a small brandy on a particularly…cold evening. But I assure you, I do not indulge to excess. Moderation, as I've said. I find that a clear head is…essential for rational thought. Excessive alcohol consumption leads to…imprudence and poor decision-making. No, I maintain a…discreet and civilized approach to such matters. It's a matter of…refinement, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, as I stated previously. I avoid pharmaceuticals whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, when available. And no, I have no known allergies. I’ve always been…remarkably resilient. A robust constitution, you see. I find that most medications simply…mask the symptoms, rather than addressing the underlying problem. I prefer to let the body heal itself, whenever possible. And I avoid…unnecessary chemicals, whenever possible. It’s a matter of…principle, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you don’t mind. We’ll check your vision, look at your eyes with an ophthalmoscope, and check your blood pressure. It shouldn’t take long. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An examination… I suppose it’s unavoidable. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of…instruments being directed at my eyes. However, if it’s necessary to ascertain the cause of this…fading, then proceed. But please, be…gentle. And explain everything you’re doing beforehand. I dislike surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. I’ll explain everything as I go, and we’ll take it slow. First, let's check your visual acuity. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Well, this is…already proving to be rather challenging. Are you certain this chart is properly illuminated? The letters seem…faded. And rather…small. I can make out…an ‘F’? Perhaps a ‘P’? It’s…difficult to say with certainty. This is…most unsatisfactory. Are you certain this is the correct chart for someone of my…age and experience?
DOCTOR: You’re right to question it, Mr. Alcorta. Let's move a little closer. And we can try each eye individually. Close your right eye, please, and tell me what you see on this line. Just read the letters you can identify. No need to guess.
PATIENT: This…is not improving. I can barely discern…shapes. Vague, blurry shapes. Perhaps…a ‘C’? Or is that an ‘O’? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not entirely certain. It’s…frustrating, to say the least. And rather…demeaning. I’m accustomed to…precision, not ambiguity. I believe I can make out…the very first letter. A definite ‘A’. But beyond that…it’s all a…blur. This is…most concerning. Is this…normal?
DOCTOR: Okay. And now let's try the left eye. Cover your left eye and read the letters on the chart with your right eye. Same procedure. Take your time. Alright. So, both eyes are significantly reduced in their ability to see. Now, I'm going to use an instrument called an ophthalmoscope to look inside your eyes. It's just a light, and it won't hurt. I’ll be looking at your retina and optic nerve. It will be close to your eye, but please, try to stay still. Do you feel comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An instrument… close to my eye. I confess, the prospect is…unsettling. However, if it’s necessary to determine the cause of this…affliction, then proceed. But please, be exceedingly careful. And perhaps…a brief explanation of what you’re looking for? I prefer to understand the…rationale behind these…procedures. And if I feel any discomfort, I expect you to…stop immediately. This is…a matter of principle, you understand. My comfort is…paramount.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I completely understand your concerns. I'm looking at the back of your eye, the retina, to see if there are any signs of damage or disease. I'm also looking at the optic nerve, which sends signals from your eye to your brain, to see if it appears healthy. I'll be very gentle, and I'll explain what I see as I go. Alright. I've completed the examination. I'm seeing some mild clouding of the lenses, which is consistent with the early stages of cataracts. The optic nerves appear healthy, thankfully, but there is some mild pallor to the retina. The pallor is not particularly alarming at this stage, but warrants further investigation. Your pupils react normally to light and your extraocular movements are normal. I will document these findings, and order a visual field test and a referral to an ophthalmologist.
PATIENT: Cataracts… Mild clouding of the lenses. I suspected as much, frankly. A rather…common affliction, as you said. And “mild pallor to the retina”? I confess, I’m not entirely familiar with the…implications of such a diagnosis. Is this…serious? Will I be rendered…blind? And a “visual field test”? An ophthalmologist? This is…escalating rapidly. I trust this won’t involve…unnecessary expenses? I’m quite particular about…financial matters, you see. And I dislike being subjected to…unforeseen complications. This is…most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Alcorta. Let's address them one at a time. The cataracts are, as you said, common. They develop slowly, and at this stage, they’re unlikely to cause significant vision loss. We can monitor them and discuss options if and when they begin to interfere with your daily life, such as surgery. The mild pallor of the retina is a bit more concerning, though not necessarily alarming. It can indicate reduced blood flow to the optic nerve, which could potentially lead to vision loss over time. That’s why I’m recommending a visual field test, which will assess your peripheral vision. And the referral to an ophthalmologist will allow for a more comprehensive examination and further investigation. I realize this is escalating rapidly, and I apologize for that. However, it's important to rule out any potential underlying issues. I will provide you with a referral and assist with finding an ophthalmologist who participates in cost-effective care. We'll do our best to minimize any unforeseen expenses. I want to be clear: this does not mean you are going blind. It simply means we need to investigate further to understand what's causing the pallor and ensure we address it promptly. Does that alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: "Promptly," you say. And "cost-effective care." Those are…reassuring terms, I suppose. Though I remain skeptical. I dislike unnecessary interventions, as I've stated repeatedly. And the prospect of being subjected to…further examinations fills me with…trepidation. Very well. I suppose I have no choice but to proceed with these…tests. But I expect a detailed explanation of each procedure beforehand. And I will require a comprehensive estimate of all associated expenses. And I trust this ophthalmologist is…competent? I have no desire to be subjected to…amateurish procedures. I trust you understand my…reservations. I am a man of…principle, you see. And I dislike being subjected to…unforeseen complications and unnecessary expenses. Proceed with these tests, but do so with…utmost care and attention to detail. And keep me informed of your…progress. This is…paramount.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Alcorta. I assure you, I will proceed with the utmost care and attention to detail. I will personally ensure you receive a detailed explanation of each procedure, and I will provide you with a comprehensive cost estimate. I’ll be recommending Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly regarded ophthalmologist with extensive experience. I trust her expertise implicitly. I will also provide you with a referral order for the visual field test and Dr. Vance’s contact information. You can schedule appointments at your convenience. Before you leave, I want to reiterate: this is a precautionary measure. We are simply gathering more information to ensure your vision is preserved. I will be available to answer any questions you may have along the way. Do you have any questions for me right now before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers the…immediate concerns. Though I may have further inquiries once I’ve had an opportunity to…peruse the documentation. And I shall, of course, expect a prompt response to any…subsequent queries. Very well. I believe that concludes our…consultation. I trust you’ll handle this matter with…utmost diligence and attention to detail. And please, ensure Dr. Vance is…punctual. I have no patience for…delays. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I will ensure Dr. Vance is informed of your preference for punctuality. It was a pleasure meeting you, and please, don't hesitate to contact my office with any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to discussing the results with you.
