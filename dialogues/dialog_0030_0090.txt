DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be quite honest, it's a bit… complicated. I’m here for a check-up before a surgery I'm hoping to have. A cosmetic one, that is. My… my husband and I had discussed it for quite some time, and… well, it feels like the right time now, if that makes sense. Though, truthfully, my memory isn't what it used to be, so details are… hazy.
DOCTOR: I see. A pre-operative evaluation for a cosmetic surgery. That's perfectly alright. It’s common for patients to feel a little anxious before a procedure, and memory lapses can certainly happen with stress. To start, could you tell me what type of surgery you are considering?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… that’s a good question. It was… facial reconstruction, I believe? Mostly around the… the cheeks and jawline. Honestly, Doctor, I wish I could recall more specifics. My husband, bless his heart, he handled most of the arrangements. It was… a long time ago, and things are rather… blurred. We met with a specialist, of course, but I don’t remember their name, or the exact details of the procedure. Is that… alright? I feel terrible for not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. It’s not uncommon to feel overwhelmed with details, especially when preparing for something like this. We can certainly work through it. Let's focus on what you are experiencing now and what concerns you have. Before we delve into the specifics of the surgery itself, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. My overall health… well, I generally feel quite well. I work outdoors a lot, landscaping and groundskeeping. It keeps me active, I suppose. I don’t have any major illnesses, that I’m aware of. I do get tired easily sometimes, but I attribute that to the physical labor. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant. And… oh, I had a bout of the flu last winter, but nothing serious. I’m not on any regular medication, and I don’t have any allergies that I know of. Does that sound… sufficient?
DOCTOR: That’s a good start, Mackenzi. Working outdoors is excellent for overall health. No known allergies or current medications – that’s helpful to know. And yes, your insurance information is relevant. Let me ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason, or had any significant surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. I believe I was hospitalized once, when I was quite young, for a bad case of pneumonia. But that was… decades ago. And… My husband… he passed away last year. I was in the hospital then, briefly, of course. Just for a few days. It wasn’t a surgery, though. Just… grief and exhaustion. Other than that… I don’t recall any major surgeries. I had my tonsils out as a child, I think. Is that significant? I really wish I had a better memory for these things. It's frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mackenzi, and I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. Grief can certainly affect memory and well-being. It's perfectly alright that you don’t recall every detail. We're just trying to gather a complete picture of your health history. Tonsillectomy as a child isn’t something to worry about at this point. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family history… that's… difficult. My mother passed away when I was young, and I didn't know my father very well. I do recall my grandmother on my mother's side… she had heart problems, I believe. And an aunt, on my husband's side, had breast cancer, but that was many years ago. Beyond that… I'm afraid I don't have much information. We weren’t a close family, and medical history wasn’t something that was discussed openly. I truly apologize for being so vague. It’s just… so much feels lost in the past. Is it alright if we move on to something else? Perhaps discussing the surgery itself?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly alright. Family history can be difficult to track, and it's completely understandable that you don't have all the details. We can absolutely move on to discussing the planned surgery. Since you've mentioned you're preparing for facial reconstruction, could you tell me what prompted you to consider this procedure?
PATIENT: It… it was something my husband and I talked about for a long time. I had… an accident, several years ago. A fall. It caused… some damage to my face. Mostly around the cheeks and jawline. It wasn't terribly severe, but it left… scars. And… a feeling of… incompleteness. My husband felt strongly that I deserved to feel beautiful again, and he wanted me to be happy. It was… his dream for me, as much as it was mine. After he passed… it felt like the right time to finally follow through with it. To honor his memory, and… to try and regain some semblance of… wholeness. It sounds silly, doesn't it? But it felt important.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Mackenzi. It sounds like a very thoughtful and meaningful decision, and a lovely way to honor your husband's memory. It's perfectly natural to want to feel complete and confident, and to pursue something that was important to both of you. To help me assess your suitability for surgery, could you describe the scars you mentioned?
PATIENT: They’re… mostly on this side. And along the jawline, on both sides. They aren't terribly prominent, but they're… noticeable. And the texture is different from the surrounding skin. They’re a bit… rough, and sometimes they feel… tight. It doesn’t cause me pain, but it’s… a constant reminder. I’ve tried creams and lotions, but nothing seems to make a significant difference. I suppose I just… hoped the surgery could help smooth them out, and… restore a more natural appearance. Is that possible? I truly don't know much about the process itself.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mackenzi. Scars on the left cheek and along the jawline, with altered texture. We can definitely assess whether surgical intervention could improve their appearance and texture. Before we discuss potential surgical options, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. This will allow me to get a closer look at the scars and assess the surrounding tissues. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’ll do my best to remain still. I’m a bit nervous, but I trust your expertise. I just… I want to be sure I’m making the right decision, and that the surgery is… feasible. And safe, of course. That’s the most important thing.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll start by examining your skin, noting the location, size, and characteristics of the scars. I'm noting some areas of slightly raised, fibrotic tissue. The skin texture is indeed altered in these areas, feeling somewhat rough to the touch. There is some decreased elasticity compared to the surrounding skin. Neurological function appears intact. I'm not detecting any significant tenderness or pain upon palpation. Overall, the scars are consistent with those resulting from a traumatic injury. They appear stable, and there's no evidence of active infection or inflammation. However, the altered texture and decreased elasticity may require more advanced surgical techniques to achieve optimal results.
PATIENT: That feels… a bit tight, yes. That's where I usually feel discomfort. So… advanced techniques? What does that entail? And… what are my options? I’m a bit worried about complications, to be honest. I’ve heard stories… and I don’t want to risk making things worse. Is surgery even the best course of action, in my case? Perhaps there are other treatments I haven't considered?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mackenzi, and I want to assure you that your safety and well-being are my top priorities. When I mentioned advanced techniques, I was referring to procedures such as staged excisions, fat grafting, or laser resurfacing, which can help improve the texture and appearance of the scars. Staged excisions involve removing the scar in stages, allowing for better wound healing and minimizing the risk of distortion. Fat grafting can help restore volume and improve the smoothness of the skin. Laser resurfacing can help stimulate collagen production and reduce the appearance of scar tissue. Before recommending any specific procedure, I'd like to discuss the potential risks and benefits of each option in detail. The risks associated with surgery include infection, bleeding, scarring, and asymmetry. However, these risks are generally low when performed by an experienced surgeon. As for whether surgery is the best course of action, that depends on your individual goals and expectations. We can also explore non-surgical options, such as steroid injections or micro-needling, although these may not provide as dramatic results as surgery. To help me determine the best approach for you, I'd like to order a few baseline tests, including a complete blood count and a coagulation panel, to assess your overall health and ensure you're a good candidate for surgery. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Staged excisions… fat grafting… laser resurfacing… it all sounds rather… complicated. And a bit daunting, to be honest. Infection and scarring… those are definitely things I'm worried about. Perhaps… perhaps starting with the less invasive options would be best? The steroid injections or micro-needling? Just to see if they might provide some improvement? I’m not sure I’m ready for a major surgery just yet. And… the tests sound reasonable. Yes, please, let's start with the baseline tests. That would help me feel… more informed.
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent approach, Mackenzi. Starting with less invasive options is often a good way to assess your response and determine whether more aggressive treatment is necessary. Steroid injections can help reduce inflammation and flatten raised scars, while micro-needling can stimulate collagen production and improve skin texture. We can start with a series of injections or micro-needling sessions and monitor your progress closely. If you’re not satisfied with the results, we can then discuss other options, such as surgery. I’ll order the baseline tests now, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to review the results and develop a personalized treatment plan. The tests will include a complete blood count and a coagulation panel, which will help us assess your overall health and ensure you're a good candidate for any potential procedures. In the meantime, I recommend that you avoid any harsh skincare products or procedures that could irritate your skin. Also, it’s important to protect your skin from the sun by wearing sunscreen and avoiding prolonged exposure. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly, Doctor. It’s a lot to take in, but I feel… somewhat reassured. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently. And for offering the less invasive options first. Just one thing… how long will it take to get the test results? And… when would we schedule the follow-up appointment? I just want to have a general idea of the timeline. I do have… some commitments, and I need to plan accordingly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mackenzi. It's perfectly understandable to want to have a clear timeline. The test results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once they’re available, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Typically, I like to schedule follow-up appointments within a week of receiving the test results so we can discuss them in detail and develop a personalized treatment plan. Does that timeline work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Within a week is fine. Thank you again for your time and patience. And for listening to my concerns. I truly appreciate your… compassionate approach. I feel… more hopeful now, than I did before. I suppose I'll wait for my nurse to contact me. And… I'll try to be patient. Have a good day, Doctor Quicksey. And thank you once again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day as well, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
