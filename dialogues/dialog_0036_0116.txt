DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It's... pleasant to meet you as well. Well, it’s these legs of mine. They just… ache. Mostly at night, you see. It wakes me up sometimes. A right bother, it is. I don’t recall when it started, exactly. Seems like a long time now.
DOCTOR: Okay, aching legs, worse at night… I understand. It’s good you’re telling me about this. To help me get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the ache?
PATIENT: Oh, my. A little more… Well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like a broken bone. More like… a tightening. A squeezing. It starts in the calf, I believe, and sometimes goes up higher. It’s hard to explain. It just… feels wrong. And it won’t go away easily, you see. I have to… well, I just wiggle my foot a lot. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense – a tightening, squeezing sensation that starts in your calf and sometimes goes higher, and wiggling your foot helps. Thank you for describing it so well. And how long does this aching typically last when it happens?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question, Doctor. Sometimes it's just a few minutes, and then it fades. Other times… well, it can last a good portion of the night. I used to get up and walk around a bit, but at my age… that's not so easy anymore. I mostly just try to ignore it, but it’s… wearing. It doesn't happen every night, thankfully. Perhaps every other night? Or three nights a week? It’s all a bit of a blur, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not consistent, and can last minutes to hours, and it’s definitely more bothersome some nights than others. You mentioned walking helps a little, but it's becoming harder to get up and move around. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet along with the aching?
PATIENT: Swelling… Oh, now, that's a good question. I haven't really looked closely, to be honest. My eyesight isn't what it used to be. I do feel… a bit heavy sometimes, if that makes sense? Like my legs are weighed down. But I couldn't say if that's swelling, or just… old age. I don't usually wear shoes inside, so I suppose I wouldn't notice if my feet were a little bigger than usual. I'm sorry, I don't think I can be much help on that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. “Feeling heavy” is a useful observation. We can take a look at your legs and feet to check for swelling during the exam. Now, thinking about other things, have you had any injuries to your legs recently, like a fall or a bump?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Injuries… Let me see. Now, I did stumble a few months back, in the garden. Nothing serious, mind you. Just a little trip over a root. I didn’t fall hard, but I did brace myself with my left leg. It was a bit sore for a day or two, but I didn't think much of it. That was… hmm. Probably March, I suppose? It doesn't feel like that’s related, but I’m trying to remember everything I can. I'm always a bit clumsy, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a stumble in the garden in March, bracing with your left leg, and some soreness afterwards. That’s good to know. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Now that's a hard one, Doctor. I've seen a few doctors in my time, you see. I remember… something about my blood pressure being a little high, years ago. They put me on a pill for a while, but I stopped taking it. It didn't seem to make much difference. And my heart… well, it beats, doesn’t it? I haven't been told anything serious. I did have a touch of the flu last winter, but everyone gets that, don't they? I'm afraid my memory isn’t what it once was. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. You’ve mentioned slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, and a bout of the flu last winter. We can look through any records you might have to clarify things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me see… I don't think so. I used to get a bit of a rash from poison ivy when I was a girl, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t encountered anything recently that bothered me. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. I eat most things, and haven’t had any trouble with medicines. Though, like I said, I don’t take many these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I don't believe in all those pills, you see. I take a little bit of cod liver oil sometimes, for my joints. But that's about it. And, well, sometimes I take a little bit of aspirin for a headache, but not very often. I prefer to just rest when I have a headache. It’s better to let nature take its course, don’t you think? I don’t like filling my body with things it doesn’t need.
DOCTOR: I understand. Just cod liver oil occasionally, and aspirin for headaches when needed. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother lived to be quite old, nearly ninety. She had a bit of arthritis, like me, but otherwise she was quite healthy. My father… he passed away when I was young, I’m afraid. I don’t recall him having any particular ailments. I had a brother, but he moved away a long time ago and we don’t keep in touch. I don’t know much about his health. It wasn't something we talked about much, you see. We were always a bit… distant. I’m sorry I can’t be of more help. It’s all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. Your mother lived to ninety and had some arthritis, and your father passed away when you were young. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were terrible for you, and I listened to her. No, I’ve never smoked, and I don’t care for people who do. It smells dreadful, you see. I always preferred fresh air. I used to spend a lot of time outdoors when I was younger, gardening and walking. I don't get out as much these days, but I still enjoy a bit of sunshine when I can.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Never smoked, and enjoy getting fresh air when possible. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I might have a little glass of sherry now and then, on special occasions. Perhaps at Christmas, or a birthday. But it’s not a regular thing, you see. Just a little sip to celebrate. I don’t care much for it, to be honest. It doesn't agree with me. I prefer a nice cup of tea, any day. I've always been a tea drinker, you see. It's much better for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of sherry occasionally, but generally prefer tea. Now, just one last question before we move on to the exam. Could you tell me a little bit about what your typical day is like?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. A typical day… Well, I usually wake up around seven or eight, depending on how I’m feeling. I have a little bit of breakfast – toast and tea, usually. Then I might do a little bit of tidying around the house. I like to keep things neat and orderly, you see. I read a bit, and listen to the radio. I don't go out much these days, but I enjoy a bit of company when I have it. My neighbour sometimes comes over for a chat. And in the evening, I like to watch a bit of television. It's not very exciting, but it passes the time. And, of course, I go to bed early. I'm not a night owl, you see. I’m quite a simple person, really. A quiet life suits me just fine. And I try to go to bed before it gets too late.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bilstein. That gives me a really good picture of your daily life. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulses, and take a look at your legs and feet. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, please. My bones aren't what they used to be, you see. And do let me know if you see anything… alarming. I’m a bit of a worrier, you see. But go ahead. I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now… sounds regular, but a little bit of a murmur. It’s not necessarily anything to be concerned about at your age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Lungs sound clear. Pulses are a little bit weak in your ankles, but not critically so. Now, let's take a look at your legs… I do notice some slight swelling in both ankles, and your skin is a little bit discolored, a brownish tinge. And when I gently press on your calves, it’s slightly tender. Do you feel that tenderness when I do that?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… interesting. Well, yes, I do feel a little bit of tenderness when you press there. It’s not a sharp pain, mind you, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. I hadn’t really noticed the swelling before, but now that you mention it… I suppose I do feel a little bit heavy sometimes. And the color… well, I’ve always had rather pale skin, you see. I’m not sure about the brownish tinge. Perhaps it’s just the light? I’m not very good at noticing these things anymore. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m a bit anxious now.
DOCTOR: It’s good you noticed the tenderness. The swelling and discoloration, along with the tenderness and the aching you described, are suggestive of venous insufficiency. That means the valves in your veins aren’t working as efficiently as they should, causing blood to pool in your legs. It’s not usually a serious emergency, but it can cause discomfort and, if left untreated, can lead to other problems like skin ulcers. Do you understand what I’m saying?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Valves… veins… pooling blood… It sounds rather frightening, Doctor. I’m afraid I don’t understand all the medical terms, you see. I'm just an old woman. So, what does that mean for me? Will I be in pain all the time? Will I have to go to the hospital? Will it get worse? You’re using such… complicated words. I just want to know if it’s something I need to worry about. Perhaps you could explain it in simpler terms? I’m a bit confused, you see. And, of course, I am a little bit worried now.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask for a simpler explanation, and it’s perfectly understandable to be worried. I apologize for using medical jargon. Think of your veins like pipes that carry blood back to your heart. Inside those pipes are little one-way valves that keep the blood flowing in the right direction. With age, those valves can weaken and become leaky, causing blood to pool in your legs, especially when you’re standing or sitting for long periods. That pooling blood causes swelling, aching, and the discoloration you’re noticing. It’s not usually an emergency, and you likely won’t be in pain all the time. But it can become uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can lead to sores on your skin. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's much better, Doctor. The pipes… the valves… I can understand that. So, it’s not like a broken bone, or something suddenly wrong? It’s just… wear and tear, you see? And you say it’s not an emergency. That’s a relief. But what can we do about it? Can it be fixed? Do I need to take pills? Or have an operation? I'm a bit anxious about operations, you see. I just want to be comfortable, and not worry about it all the time.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It’s not a sudden problem, and it’s not like a broken bone. It’s more like the pipes wearing out over time, as you said. And no, it’s not usually an emergency. We have several options to help manage it and keep you comfortable. Pills aren’t usually the first step. Instead, we often recommend compression stockings. They help squeeze your legs and improve blood flow, reducing swelling and aching. Lifestyle changes, like elevating your legs when you’re resting and regular gentle exercise, are also very helpful. Surgery is rarely needed, and we wouldn't consider that unless your symptoms were severe and other treatments weren’t working. It's good to know all options, but it is not where we will start. Would you be willing to try compression stockings?
PATIENT: Oh, stockings, you say? Like… the ones ladies used to wear? I haven’t worn stockings in years, you see. I’m not sure I could manage them myself. And will they be… comfortable? I don’t like things that are too tight, you see. But if they will help, I suppose I could try. What sort of exercise do you recommend? I can't go running around, you know. I'm a bit slow these days. And how long will I have to wear them for? I don't want to be tied up with stockings all the time. But, yes, I’m willing to try. If you think it will help. I just want to be comfortable, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, similar to the ones ladies used to wear, but these are medical grade and designed specifically for venous insufficiency. They're not as constricting as fashion stockings, and we can get the right size and compression level to ensure they're comfortable. We can start with a lower compression and see how you tolerate them. And I can show you, or have a nurse show you, how to put them on properly. As for exercise, nothing strenuous at all! Simple things like walking for 10-15 minutes a day, ankle rotations, and calf raises can make a big difference. Even just elevating your legs for 30 minutes a few times a day while you’re resting is helpful. We'll start with wearing the stockings during the day, and we can adjust the length of time as needed. It's not about being tied up, it’s about managing your symptoms and improving your quality of life. I'm going to write you a prescription for compression stockings, and I'll give you a handout with instructions on how to put them on and some simple exercises. I’d like to see you back in a month to see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. A month is good. And the handout will be helpful, you see. I do forget things easily these days. And I’ll try my best to do the exercises. And I’ll wear the stockings, as you suggest. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. It’s good to know there are things we can do. I appreciate your patience with an old woman like me. I do get a bit confused easily, you see. But, yes, I’ll see you in a month. Thank you again. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. It’s my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. As for things to avoid, try to avoid prolonged standing or sitting for long periods without moving around. If you do have to stand or sit for a long time, take breaks to walk around and elevate your legs. Also, avoid crossing your legs for extended periods, as this can restrict blood flow. And finally, be sure to keep your skin moisturized, as dry skin can be more prone to irritation. Other than that, just continue with your normal routine and focus on making those small lifestyle changes. Here's your prescription and the handout. I'll also have the nurse stop by to schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, moisturized skin. Yes, that’s a good idea. My skin is rather dry these days, you see. And I will try to remember to keep my legs uncrossed. That’s helpful. I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your kindness. You’ve put my mind at ease. Thank you again. I believe that is all, Doctor. I will see you in a month. And thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember to take things one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in a month.
