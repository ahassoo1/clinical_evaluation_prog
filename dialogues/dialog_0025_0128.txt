DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… my joints, I think. They get really stiff in the mornings. It's just… hard to get going, you know? Like an old door that needs oil. I don't really remember when it started, exactly. Just… a while now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. "A while now" isn't terribly helpful, Lilliana, but I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint these things. So, this stiffness… is it in all your joints, or are some worse than others?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It's mostly my hands and knees, I think. My hands are the worst. Makes it hard to… well, to do things. Picking things up, that sort of thing. Knees too, when I get up from a chair. Not all the time, but often enough to be annoying. I don’t know… is that helpful? I'm not good with remembering details.
DOCTOR: Okay, hands and knees primarily. And it’s worse in the mornings, you said. Does anything relieve the stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Moving around helps. Just… walking a bit, doing little things. It doesn’t go away completely, but it gets better. And… warm water. A warm shower, or sometimes I just hold my hands under the tap. Does that make sense? I don't know if that's a cure or anything, just what I do.
DOCTOR: Warm water providing some relief… alright. Now, Lilliana, have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Redness… I don’t think so. Sometimes my hands feel a little… puffy, maybe? But I don't really see any redness. It's hard to tell, you know? I'm not really good at looking at my own hands. My daughter used to tell me things, but… she doesn't live close anymore. I'm sorry, I’m rambling. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: It's alright. Rambling is perfectly acceptable. "Puffy" is… a start. Have you had any pain associated with this stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, pain sometimes. Not always, but when it's really stiff, it hurts a bit to move them. It's not… a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, you know? Like… old bones complaining. Not terrible, but enough to notice. I just try to ignore it, mostly. I don't want to bother anyone with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Dull ache associated with the stiffness… Have you ever injured those joints?
PATIENT: Injured… let me think… Oh, goodness. I fell a few years ago, in the garden. Tripped over a rose bush. Landed on my hands, I think. But I don’t remember being really hurt. My neighbor helped me up, and I just… rubbed them for a bit. It didn't seem that bad at the time. I don't know if that has anything to do with this, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A fall a few years ago… and you didn’t seek medical attention for it, correct?
PATIENT: No, no, I didn't. I just… brushed myself off. Old woman things, you know? I didn’t want to bother the doctor with something silly. It didn't seem broken or anything. Just… scraped up. And honestly, I forget things so easily, I probably didn't even tell anyone about it. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. Let's move on. Have you noticed any other symptoms – fatigue, fever, any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Fatigue… yes, I get tired easily. But I'm an old woman! Who doesn't get tired? I don't know if that's related. Fever… not that I know of. And my appetite… well, it comes and goes. I don't really eat as much as I used to. But that's probably just because… well, because I'm alone a lot. It’s hard to cook for one, you know? Is that what you're asking? I'm sorry, I get confused.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this has been going on for “a while.” Can you give me even a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A rough estimate… hmm. Maybe… five years? Or maybe less? It’s hard to say, honestly. It sort of… crept up on me, you know? It didn't happen all at once. I started noticing it more and more, and then… well, here I am. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more precise. My daughter always said I had a terrible memory. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Can you come with me to the exam table?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Lead the way, Doctor. I'm not very steady on my feet, so please be patient. I'll try my best to cooperate. Is it cold in there? I always feel a little chilly.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly fine. Just sit here, and I'll take a look at your hands and knees. Please tell me if anything is painful. Alright. Can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Here goes… Ooh, that's a little uncomfortable, actually. It feels… stiff. Like I haven't used them in a while. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m noting some crepitus and mild tenderness on the MCP and PIP joints bilaterally. And I'm feeling some slight swelling in both wrists. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Ooh, that’s a little stiff too. And… …there's a little click when I bend that one. It doesn't hurt bad, just… feels funny. Like something is rubbing together. Is that normal? I'm sorry, I'm probably being a bother.
DOCTOR: I'm noting some crepitus and mild tenderness on both knees, with a limited range of motion. No effusion noted. Alright. Based on your history and the physical exam, it’s possible you’re experiencing early-stage osteoarthritis. However, to rule out other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, we’ll need some blood work. I'm going to order a complete blood count, ESR, CRP, and a rheumatoid factor test. I'll also order X-rays of your hands and knees. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work and X-rays… that sounds… serious. Is it bad? I don’t like needles, you know. And I don’t want to spend a lot of money if I can avoid it. Is that what you mean? I'm sorry, I'm just a little worried. What are we looking for exactly?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad,” Lilliana. It’s just standard procedure to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The blood work will help us rule out inflammatory conditions. The X-rays will show us the condition of the cartilage in your joints. As for the cost… I understand your concern. We can discuss options if the cost is prohibitive, and I'll write a script for some over-the-counter pain relief in the meantime. I’m ordering the tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They will take a small sample of your blood. It shouldn’t take long. After the tests, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That… sounds a little better, knowing there are options. And a script for something to help with the pain would be wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. I guess… I can go do the blood work. Just a small sample, you said? I'm not very good with needles, but… I'll try. Where exactly is the lab? Down the hall… which way? I'm terrible with directions.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a small sample. And it’s just down that hallway, to the left. You'll see a sign for the lab. The staff there are very good, and they’ll take good care of you. After the blood work, come back and we can schedule your follow-up appointment. And I'll have the nurse prepare a script for some ibuprofen. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Fourney. You've been very patient with me. I'm just… a little worried, you know? It's just… getting old isn't very easy. But I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I'll go do the blood work now. And thank you again for the script. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Let the nurse know if you have any difficulties.
