DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day to sit here and explain everything. It's this tiredness, see? Just dragging. And...well, it's embarrassing, but I've been...eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to worry me, I guess. My neighbor kept telling me to come in. She thinks I'm anemic or something. I don't even know what that is, but it sounded serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. I understand you're feeling tired and are concerned about eating dirt. It’s good that your neighbor encouraged you to come in. We’ll figure out what’s going on. Let's start with the tiredness. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to tell? I'm tired! All the time. It's not like a regular tired, you know? It's…deep. Like my bones are tired. And it doesn’t matter how much I sleep, it doesn't help. I used to be able to get right up and go, garden all day, clean the house...now? Now I just want to sit. Which is ridiculous. I don’t like sitting.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very frustrating, especially if you’re someone who’s used to being active. “Deep tiredness” is a good way to describe it. And it's not relieved by sleep, which is concerning. When did you first start noticing this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… a while. Maybe six months? It started slowly, just feeling a bit more sluggish than usual. Then it just…worsened. I thought it was just getting old, honestly. You get to my age, you expect things to fall apart. But then I started with…this other thing. The dirt eating, I mean. That’s when I figured something wasn't right. Before the tiredness, I felt…fine, for an old lady.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, a gradual onset of tiredness, and then the dirt eating started more recently. That’s helpful to know. Can you tell me a bit more about why you've been eating dirt?
PATIENT: Why?! Like I choose to eat dirt? It’s not like I’m craving chocolate, you know? It’s just…a feeling. An emptiness. And the dirt…it feels good going down. I know it sounds crazy, but it does. It's like something I need. I find it in the garden, mostly. Red clay, if I can find it. Don’t tell anyone, please. This is embarrassing enough.
DOCTOR: I understand this is very difficult to talk about, Candis, and I assure you, I won’t judge. It's good you’re being honest with me. It's important to understand why you're experiencing this urge, and we’ll try to figure that out together. You mentioned red clay specifically. How often would you say you’re eating dirt, and about how much at a time?
PATIENT: Oh, not that often. Maybe three or four times a week? It’s not a huge amount. A spoonful, maybe? Sometimes less. It’s hard to say. I don’t measure it! I just…take a little when the feeling comes on. It’s not like I’m shoveling it into my mouth. Don't make me sound like a wild woman. Really, it’s a small amount. I'm not sick, am I?
DOCTOR: Okay, so three or four times a week, about a spoonful at a time. And you're concerned about being sick. It’s good you’re thinking about that, and we will investigate. This behavior, what you’re describing, is called pica—an urge to eat things that aren’t food. It can sometimes be a sign of a nutritional deficiency. Now, let’s talk about your general diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, diet. Honestly? Not great, probably. I mostly eat what’s easy. Canned soup, toast…sometimes I'll make a sandwich if I'm feeling ambitious. I don't really have an appetite anymore, you see? Everything just tastes…blah. I used to love cooking, but now it's just a chore. I drink a lot of tea, if that counts for anything. And that dirt, unfortunately. Don’t judge me. It’s not like I’m a gourmet eater, never have been.
DOCTOR: I’m not judging you at all, Candis. It’s helpful to know what you’re typically eating. A limited appetite and eating mostly canned foods can certainly contribute to nutritional deficiencies. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and the dirt eating?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. My hands get cold a lot. Even in the summer. And my skin feels dry, always. I chalked it up to getting older, but… maybe it’s something else? Oh, and I get headaches sometimes, but those could be from the weather. I don’t know. I'm probably just falling apart. Is this going to cost me a fortune? I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold hands, dry skin, and headaches. Those are all things we should look into. It's good you’re remembering those. And you're right to be concerned about the cost. We'll do what we can to keep things reasonable. Let me take a look at your chart, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Get it over with. Just don’t poke around too much. I'm a delicate flower, you know? And try to be quick. I have things to do. This is taking up my whole morning already. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. I’m just tired and eat a little dirt. People do stranger things.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candis. We’ll take it as quickly and gently as possible. I just need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your hands and skin. It won’t take long. If you could just sit here for me, we'll get started. First, let's check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Hurry up, then. Just get it over with. This is ridiculous. I’ve lived a long life without doctors poking and prodding. But if you must, get on with it. And don't expect me to be pleasant about it. I told you, I'm a delicate flower.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little on the low side, 108/68. That could be contributing to the tiredness. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. Lungs are clear. Your hands are quite dry, and your nailbeds look a little pale. I also noticed some slight cracking on your fingertips. This could be from the dryness or something else. Your abdomen is soft, but I’m not feeling any obvious abnormalities. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. I'm going to order some blood tests. These will help us look for any nutritional deficiencies, like iron or vitamin B12, and check your thyroid function. We'll also check a complete blood count to see if you have anemia, which could explain the tiredness and pale nailbeds. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood tests. Of course. Just what I needed. Fine, do whatever you think is necessary. But don’t poke me too much. And don’t tell me it’s going to be a long wait for the results. I don’t have all day, you know. And how much is this going to cost? Seriously, tell me now before I faint. I’m not made of money.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ve ordered the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will take you over shortly. The cost will be around $150-$200, depending on what the lab charges. We can discuss payment options with the billing department if needed. The nurse will also give you instructions on how to prepare for the tests. It’s usually just a simple blood draw. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and come up with a plan to get you feeling better. Do you have any questions for me right now?
