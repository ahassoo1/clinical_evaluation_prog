DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Uh… right. My ear. It feels… full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? It’s been bothering me for… a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Time gets away from me these days.
DOCTOR: A full feeling in the ear. And you say it’s been going on for “a while.” Can you be a little more specific about how long?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Before… before Martha… passed. Yes, definitely before then. Maybe… six months? Or was it eight? It’s difficult to say. Things haven't been… clear since. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… muffled. And annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Six to eight months. Alright. And has this muffled hearing been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go… I think it’s more constant, yeah. But sometimes it’s worse than others. Like… when it’s windy. Or if I'm tired. Does that make sense? It’s just… always there, a bit. Not gone completely, ever. I don't really notice it until I try to really listen to something. Then I remember it's there.
DOCTOR: So, a constant muffled hearing that worsens with wind or fatigue. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, any dizziness, or any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Ringing… no, I don’t think so. Maybe a little… sometimes, very faintly. It’s hard to tell. The farm is noisy enough as it is. Dizziness… no, not really. And like I said, no pain. Just… this feeling. It’s a bit of a nuisance, to be honest. I just want it gone, really. I need to hear properly for the work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look. I’m going to use an otoscope to examine your ear canal and eardrum. Please just remain still. I'll need you to tilt your head slightly… this way.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Tilt my head… like this? Just… be quick, if you would. It’s a bit unsettling having things poked around in there. I never was good with doctors.
DOCTOR: I see some cerumen—earwax—present. It’s quite impacted. It could be contributing to the muffled hearing. The eardrum itself appears intact, but difficult to visualize fully with this blockage. I'm going to attempt to irrigate your ear to remove the wax. Do you have any known perforations or tubes in either ear?
PATIENT: Perforations…? Tubes…? I… I honestly don’t know. Never had any trouble with my ears before this. I just… farm. I get dirty. I don't go to doctors much. Never had anything done to them, if that makes sense. No, I’m pretty sure I’ve never had anything like that. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed cautiously then. I’m going to warm some saline solution. This might feel a little strange—a slight pressure. If you experience any pain, dizziness, or discomfort, please let me know immediately. I'm going to use this syringe to gently flush the ear canal. Just relax, and try to keep your head still.
PATIENT: Okay… relax. Right. Just… get it over with quickly, please. This is making me anxious. It's been a long morning already. A little pressure is fine, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It's… stubborn. A fair amount of wax is coming out, but there’s still a significant blockage. We can repeat the irrigation, but it doesn’t seem to be yielding much improvement. Given the amount of impacted wax and the lack of response to initial irrigation, I recommend a referral to an audiologist for professional cerumen removal. They have specialized tools that can safely and effectively remove the wax. Do you have a preferred audiologist, or would you like me to provide a list of providers?
PATIENT: An… audiologist? More appointments? Look, Doctor, honestly… I just want my hearing back. Is that really necessary? I mean, can’t you just… get it out? I have work to do. I don't have time for lots of specialists and waiting around. A list would be fine, I suppose. But… is it going to take long?
DOCTOR: Mr. Guerrerolopez, I understand your frustration. However, attempting to remove a stubborn cerumen impaction forcefully without proper tools can damage your eardrum. I am not willing to risk your hearing for the sake of convenience. Here is a list of local audiologists. It will likely take a week or two to get an appointment. They will assess the blockage and remove it safely. It is the appropriate course of action, and frankly, the only safe one at this point. Do you have any further questions, or shall we proceed with scheduling this referral?
PATIENT: … Fine. Fine, an audiologist. A week or two… Just what I needed. No. No further questions. Just… schedule the referral, if you would. I suppose there’s nothing else for it, then. Hopefully they can actually do something.
DOCTOR: Alright. Referral is scheduled. The office will contact you to set up an appointment. I will document my findings and the recommendation for cerumen removal. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
