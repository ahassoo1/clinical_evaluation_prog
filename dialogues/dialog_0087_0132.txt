DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Pleasure’s all yours, I suppose. Look, it’s this heat, see? Can't stand it anymore. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, no problem. Painting, mostly. Now? One hour and I'm sweating like a dog and feelin’ faint. It’s ridiculous. Never had this problem before.
DOCTOR: I understand. You're experiencing difficulty tolerating the heat, with symptoms of sweating and feeling faint after about an hour of activity, specifically painting outdoors. And this is a new development for you, correct?
PATIENT: Correct. Brand new. I’m 62 years old, not some delicate flower! I’ve spent my life building things, fixing things, out in all sorts of weather. Now suddenly I gotta stop every hour and find shade? Makes no sense. I don't understand what's changed. It's… inconvenient, to say the least. It's costing me money, really.
DOCTOR: I see. And you mentioned this is impacting your work and income. That’s certainly frustrating. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe what “feeling faint” feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I'm about to pass out, not usually. More like… dizzy. Lightheaded. Everything kinda swims a bit. And I get these awful headaches right behind my eyes. Like someone’s tightened a belt around my head. And then the sweating, of course. Just drenched. Not a pretty sight, I can tell ya. It's not like a normal work sweat, it's… different. Cold and clammy. And then I just have to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dizziness, lightheadedness, headache specifically behind your eyes, and a cold, clammy sweat are the primary symptoms. Do you notice anything that makes these symptoms better or worse, other than stopping your work?
PATIENT: Hmm. Worse… well, obviously being in the sun. And it’s worse if I’m doing anything strenuous. Lifting heavy things, climbing ladders... that speeds it up. Better... drinking water helps a little, but not much. Sitting in the shade is the main thing. And a cool cloth on my neck. But honestly, it doesn’t last long. I used to be able to drink a bottle of water and keep going all day. Now I'm constantly sipping, and it barely makes a difference. It’s… unsettling. I don’t like feeling this weak.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Coby. It sounds quite disruptive, and it’s reasonable to be unsettled by a sudden change in your ability to tolerate physical activity. Let's go through some other questions to get a clearer picture. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yeah. Doctor told me a few years back. I take a pill for it, every morning. Small orange one. Can't remember the name, honestly. Never bothered me much before. Diabetes? No. Heart problems? Nope. Always been strong as an ox, until now. That’s it, really. Just the blood pressure. And I take a multivitamin, just to be safe. Don’t see why that would matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of hypertension, managed with an orange pill each morning, and you also take a multivitamin. Do you recall the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, I really don't. I just ask my wife to refill it when it gets low. She handles all that stuff. I know it's small and orange, and I take one every morning with breakfast. That's all I know. Honestly, I'm a practical man. I fix things, I build things. I don't bother with names and details like that. As long as it works, that's all that matters. Now, is this heat problem related to the pill, maybe? Is that what you're getting at?
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Mr. Coby. Some medications can affect your body's ability to regulate temperature. We'll certainly look into that. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the heat sensitivity – things like nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, or a rapid heartbeat?
PATIENT: No, not really. No nausea, no vomiting. Maybe a little bit of muscle cramping, but that's just from working hard, I figured. Nothing unusual. And my heartbeat feels… normal, I guess. I can feel it, obviously, but it’s not racing or anything. Just… tired, overall. Like my body's working too hard, even when I'm not doing much. It’s… frustrating. I used to be able to push myself all day. Now, I feel worn out after an hour in the sun. It’s not right. I'm tellin' ya, somethin's changed. And I want to know what it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. No nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps beyond expected exertion, and no rapid heartbeat. So, you're primarily experiencing fatigue and heat sensitivity with dizziness. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, or anything else that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… my father had a weak heart, I think. He didn't take care of himself, smoked too much, drank too much. Died when he was in his sixties. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had arthritis, bad knees. That's about it, really. No strokes, no kidney problems that I know of. A lot of us were builders, carpenters, worked with our hands. Strong people, mostly. But my father… his heart was always weak. Maybe I got that from him? But I always thought I was stronger than him. This… this doesn’t make sense. It’s unsettling. I need to get back to work. I have bills to pay.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart weakness in your father, and arthritis in your mother. And I understand your concern about getting back to work. Now, one last set of questions, and then I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. Never had a problem with anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose in the spring, but that’s just the pollen. Nothing serious. No reactions to any medications, never needed an EpiPen or anything like that. I eat everything. I’m a practical man, I don't fuss over food or anything. Just give me a good meal, and I’m happy. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like you're askin' about things that don't matter. I told you, I'm fine. Just can't handle the heat like I used to. What's the point of all these questions if you're not gonna do anything about it? Are you gonna give me a pill, or what?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Coby. I apologize if the questions seem extensive, but they help me build a complete picture of your health and ensure I’m making the best possible assessment. I assure you, we will work towards a solution. And yes, depending on what we find, medication could be part of that solution. But first, I'd like to do a quick physical exam—just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do. And make it quick, alright? I'm not one for sittin’ around all day. Blood pressure is probably fine, I take my pill every morning, remember? But go ahead, listen to your heart and lungs. Just don’t expect to find anything. I'm a strong man. Always have been. This heat is just… unusual. That's all. And make sure your hands are clean.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I always wash my hands before and after examining patients. If you could please sit back and relax, I'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 148 over 92. It's good you're taking medication, but it seems we may need to adjust the dosage. Your heart sounds… regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s not alarming, but it’s something we should investigate further. Your lungs are clear, but you have a slightly rapid respiratory rate. Your pulse is also a bit fast, around 88 beats per minute. It’s a little weaker than I'd expect for someone your age and activity level. Alright, Mr. Coby. I've completed the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've found, I believe we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I recommend a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart rhythm. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Look, I'm a practical man, not a science experiment! I told you I'm fine, just can't handle the heat. What are these tests gonna show? That I'm old? That my heart is weak? I already know that! But… fine. If you insist. Just get it over with quickly. And explain to me, in plain English, what these tests are for. No medical jargon, alright? I don’t understand half of what you doctors say. And how long is this gonna take? I got work to do, bills to pay. This is costing me money, you know. And what if these tests do show something bad? What then? Am I gonna need surgery? Am I gonna be stuck in a hospital bed for weeks? Just tell me straight, alright? I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and concerns, Mr. Coby. I assure you, these tests are not meant to overwhelm you or imply anything drastic. They're simply tools to help me understand why you're experiencing these symptoms and ensure we’re providing you with the best possible care. The complete blood count will check for any signs of infection or anemia, which can cause fatigue. The metabolic panel checks your kidney function and electrolyte levels, as those can affect your ability to regulate temperature. And the EKG is a simple, painless test that records your heart’s electrical activity. It will help me determine if there are any irregularities in your heart rhythm. The tests themselves shouldn’t take long – about 30 minutes to draw the blood and 10 minutes for the EKG. The results will take a few days to come back. As for what happens if the tests do show something concerning… it’s too early to say. It could be something minor that’s easily treatable with medication. It could require further investigation, but that doesn’t automatically mean surgery or a long hospital stay. We’ll discuss all the options thoroughly once we have the results and create a plan that’s right for you. I understand this is costing you time and money, and I apologize for that. But I believe these tests are important to rule out any serious underlying conditions and ensure your well-being. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Fine. Thirty minutes, ten minutes… alright. But you promise, no surprises? And no medical jargon. And you promise to explain everything in plain English, alright? I don’t like being confused. And… what about the heat? Can I still work? Should I just stay inside until we get these test results? I got a job to finish, bills to pay. I can't just sit around all day. And one more thing… my wife, she's a bit worried. Can she come with me when we discuss the results? She handles all the details, remember? She's better at understanding doctorspeak than I am. Alright. Let's get this over with. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: I promise, Mr. Coby, no surprises. And I will absolutely explain everything in plain English, as clearly as possible. I understand your frustration and want to ensure you feel informed every step of the way. Regarding the heat, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity in direct sunlight until we have the test results. Staying indoors in a cool environment is the best course of action for now. I know you have work to finish, and we'll do everything we can to get you back to it as soon as possible. And yes, absolutely, your wife is more than welcome to join us when we discuss the results. It’s always helpful to have another person present to help with understanding and decision-making. Let’s start with the blood draw. The lab is just down the hall. I'll have the nurse draw the blood, and then we’ll move on to the EKG after that. I'll explain each step as we go. Do you have any allergies to latex or bandages?
PATIENT: No latex allergy. And I don't like needles. Just so you know. But… alright. Let’s get it over with. Down the hall, you said? Just get it over with quickly, alright? And no surprises. And… tell me one thing. You think it’s my heart? That’s what you think, right? My father… his heart was always weak. Just tell me straight. I can handle it. I'm a practical man, remember? But… just tell me. It’s what I’m worried about.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, it’s too early to say definitively if it’s your heart. Your father’s history is something we need to consider, but we haven't gathered enough information yet to draw any conclusions. That's why we're running these tests - to rule out any potential causes and get a clear picture of what's going on. I understand your worry, and it's good you're being proactive about your health. But it could be a number of things, and jumping to conclusions won't help. Let's focus on getting the tests done and then discussing the results thoroughly. The lab is just down the hall on your right. The nurse, Sarah, is excellent and will make you as comfortable as possible. She'll explain everything as she goes. Would you like me to walk you there?
PATIENT: Fine. Walk me there. Just get it over with. And tell Sarah to be quick, alright? I don't like needles. And tell her not to use any medical jargon. Plain English, remember? And… tell me one more thing. If it is my heart… what happens then? What are the options? Just give me a quick overview. I need to be prepared. And… tell my wife. She’s probably worried sick. Just tell her I’m getting some tests done. No need to alarm her yet. Let’s go. The sooner this is over, the better. And… thanks. For walkin’ me there. I appreciate it. I’m just… not good with doctors and needles and all that stuff. Practical man, remember? I build things. I fix things. I don't do… this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Coby. I completely understand. It's okay to not be comfortable with this. And I'm here to guide you through it every step of the way. I'll let Sarah know to be quick and use plain English. And I'll let her know you're a bit anxious about the procedure. Regarding your question about options if it is your heart… it depends on the specific issue. It could range from medication to manage the condition to lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise. In some cases, more advanced procedures might be necessary, but we won't discuss those until we have the test results and a clear diagnosis. I'll also let your wife know you're getting tests done and that I'll keep her updated. Here we are. Sarah, are you available?
PATIENT: Sarah: "Hi, Dr. Soodeen! Hello, sir. What brings you in today?"
DOCTOR: Dr. Soodeen: "Sarah, this is Mr. Coby. He's here to get some blood work and an EKG done. He's a bit anxious about needles, so if you could be extra gentle and explain everything clearly, I'd appreciate it. He's also hoping to avoid any medical jargon." Dr. Soodeen: "Sarah is excellent, Mr. Coby. She'll take good care of you. I'll be right outside if you need anything at all." Dr. Soodeen: "Just let me know if you have any questions, and we'll get this taken care of quickly."
PATIENT: Mr. Coby: "Alright. Just get it over with. And be quick. I got things to do. And… no surprises. Plain English, remember? This is gonna hurt, isn't it?" Mr. Coby: "Just… get it over with."
DOCTOR: Sarah: “Absolutely, sir. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. It will be a little pinch, but it’s over very quickly. I'll explain each step as I go, and I promise to use plain English. We're just taking a small amount of blood to run some tests. It helps us understand what's going on and make sure you're healthy. Sarah: “Here's a little bit of cold, but it's just to prepare the area. Now, I’m just going to find a vein, and then you’ll feel a quick pinch. Deep breaths. You’re doing great.” Sarah: “Okay, here we go. Just a quick pinch…” Sarah: “Almost done… just a few more seconds…” Sarah: “All done! See?
PATIENT: Mr. Coby: "Ouch. That... that wasn't pleasant." Mr. Coby: "Is it done? Really done? It feels… weird." Mr. Coby: "Alright. What now? Do I need a bandage? I got things to do, you know. No time for bleeding all over everything."
DOCTOR: Sarah: "Yes, sir, it’s all done! And you're right, that wasn’t the most pleasant experience, but you handled it like a champ. Here's a bandage to keep it clean and prevent any bleeding. You can keep it on for a few hours. Just a little pressure is all it needs. Sarah: "You might feel a little bit tender for a bit, but that should go away quickly. Now, we just need to do a quick EKG, and then you're all set. It's a painless test where we put some stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. Sarah: “We have a comfortable chair over there. Would you like me to help you get settled?
PATIENT: Mr. Coby: “Alright. EKG, you say? No needles, I hope? I've had enough of those for one day. Stickers, huh? Sounds… less unpleasant. Mr. Coby: “Fine. Let’s get it over with. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it. And be quick. I got things to do, you know. Bills to pay. Mr. Coby: “Just tell me where to sit and where to put these stickers. And make sure they don’t hurt. I’m a practical man, not a science experiment.”
DOCTOR: Sarah: “Absolutely, sir. No needles involved at all with the EKG. It’s completely painless. Just some stickers, and they don’t hurt a bit. Here, have a seat. Sarah: “We just need to attach these small stickers to your chest, arms, and legs. They’ll measure your heart’s electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. I'll clean the area first to make sure they stick properly. Sarah: “Here we go… just a little cold. Now, I’ll place the stickers here… and here… Sarah: “All done! Now, just relax and try to breathe normally. I'll start the machine now. Sarah: “Just a few more moments… everything looks good so far. You're doing great!
PATIENT: Mr. Coby: “This feels… strange. Like I'm hooked up to some kind of machine. Is this thing safe? I don't want to get zapped or anything. Mr. Coby: “And how long is this going to take? I got things to do, you know. Bills to pay. I can't sit here all day. Mr. Coby: "What are you looking at? What does that thing show? Is my heart okay? Just tell me straight."
DOCTOR: Sarah: "Everything is perfectly safe, sir. This machine doesn’t zap anyone. It just records your heart’s electrical activity. The lines you see on the screen are a normal representation of your heartbeat. Sarah: "We’re looking for any irregularities in the rhythm or any signs of stress. So far, everything looks good, but we need to record a few more seconds to get a complete picture. Sarah: “Just a few more moments… everything is looking stable. Okay, that’s enough. We’ll have the results in a few minutes. Sarah: “All done! You can get dressed now. The doctor will be with you shortly to discuss the results.” Sarah: “You did great, sir. Everything went smoothly.”
PATIENT: Mr. Coby: “Finally. That was… unpleasant. But at least it’s over. So, everything looks good, you say? No heart problems? Mr. Coby: “What exactly does 'stable' mean? Is that good? Bad? Just tell me straight. I don't want any surprises. Mr. Coby: “And how long until the doctor gets here? I got things to do, you know. Bills to pay. I can't sit here all day."
DOCTOR: Sarah: “'Stable' means everything is normal, sir. Your heart is beating at a regular pace and there are no signs of any problems. That’s very good news. It’s like a steady engine – everything is running smoothly. Sarah: “The doctor should be with you in just a few minutes to discuss the results in more detail. She’ll explain everything clearly and answer any questions you have. Sarah: “In the meantime, you can relax and take a few deep breaths. You did a great job today, and I’m sure everything will be okay. I’ll let the doctor know you’re ready.
PATIENT: Mr. Coby: "Alright. Steady engine, huh? That's good. But what caused all this? Why couldn't I handle the heat? I’ve been working in the sun my whole life. Mr. Coby: “Just hope she’s got some answers. And hope she doesn’t tell me I need surgery. I got things to do, you know. Bills to pay.” "Practical man, not a science experiment.”
DOCTOR: Dr. Soodeen: "Good morning, Mr. Coby. I'm Dr. Soodeen. Sarah let me know you’re ready to discuss the results. How are you feeling?
