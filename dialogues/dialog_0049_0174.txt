DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s…difficult to explain. I suppose I’ve just been feeling very low. It's been going on for a bit now, and my daughter insisted I come speak with someone. I do hope this won’t take too long; I have commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: “Feeling low,” alright. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…around April, I believe. Yes, April. After the ski season ended. Usually, I feel quite invigorated after a good season, ready for gardening and such. But this year…not so much. Just a general…heaviness. Is that clear enough? I’m not very good at putting feelings into words, you see.
DOCTOR: April…so approximately three and a half months. “Heaviness”...Can you describe that heaviness a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, three and a half months. Specific…difficult. It’s not like a physical pain, Doctor. More like…a weight on my chest, constantly. And a lack of…joy, I suppose. Things I used to enjoy…gardening, visiting my grandchildren…they just don’t hold the same appeal. I find myself wanting to be alone a great deal, which is unusual for me. I always loved company. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: A loss of interest in activities you previously enjoyed, and a sense of isolation… alright. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, both, actually. My sleep has been…fitful. I wake up several times during the night, and I haven't been sleeping through. And my appetite…well, it comes and goes. Some days I can barely eat a thing. Other days, I feel I must force myself to eat something, otherwise, I feel even weaker. It’s a bit of a bother, really. Is this…normal?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a… relative term. These are certainly symptoms we need to explore further. Are you experiencing any difficulty concentrating, or have you noticed any changes in your memory?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. My concentration…it’s terrible. I used to be able to read for hours, but now I find my mind wandering after just a few pages. And my memory…well, let’s just say my daughter has to remind me of things constantly. Small things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what day it is… nothing major, I don't think. Though, it’s…concerning. I used to have a very sharp mind, you see. Is this…serious, Doctor? I do hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: We need to rule out a number of possibilities. Let's do a brief physical exam, and then I'll order some lab work. It's standard procedure, Ms. Derasmo. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath…
PATIENT: Alright, very well. A physical exam sounds sensible. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Please, proceed. I hope it won't take too long, Doctor. I truly do have commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, rate is 78 and strong. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Breathing is normal. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious abnormalities in the ears. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Alright, that all sounds… satisfactory, I suppose. Reflexes… very well. Please, proceed with the reflexes. I do hope this doesn’t involve any… strenuous activity. My knees aren't what they used to be, you know, after years of ski patrol work.
DOCTOR: Patellar and Achilles reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Gait is steady, though slightly slow. No significant abnormalities noted. Now, I'm going to order some blood work: a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a Vitamin D level. We'll also do a B12 level. That should give us a good starting point. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds… reasonable. Blood work, very well. Though I must confess, I dislike needles immensely. But if it’s necessary, I suppose I can endure it. When will I receive the results, Doctor? And will I need to schedule another appointment? I really do hope I can get this sorted quickly. I have a luncheon with my book club next week, and I wouldn’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 2-3 business days. The phlebotomist will contact you to schedule the blood draw. I’d like to see you again in one week to discuss the results and formulate a plan. If anything changes before then – any worsening of symptoms, new symptoms, anything at all – please contact the office immediately. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Derasmo. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies... let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. My daughter always says I’m remarkably resilient. I suppose she’s right about some things. But truly, no allergies that I know of. Is there anything else, Doctor? I really must be going soon, as I have a rather important engagement.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. I take a daily multivitamin, and sometimes, when my joints are particularly achy, I take ibuprofen. But that’s it, really. Just the multivitamin and the occasional ibuprofen. Nothing else, I assure you. I try to keep things as natural as possible, you see. I believe in the power of a good diet and a bit of exercise, even at my age. Is that alright, Doctor? Or is there something else I should be disclosing?
DOCTOR: Multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Alright. Now, let's quickly review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, nothing like that. Never been diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. A bit of arthritis in my knees, as I mentioned, but that’s just part of getting older, I suppose. My mother always said I inherited my good health from her. She lived to be 95, you know. Hopefully, I’ll be just as fortunate. Is there anything else, Doctor? I’m truly starting to feel a bit anxious about being late.
DOCTOR: Alright. No chronic conditions. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh, yes. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, perhaps seven or eight years old. And… I had a knee replacement about ten years ago. Just the one knee, thankfully. Other than that, nothing. No other surgeries, as far as I can recall. My daughter might remember more details, but I try not to dwell on such things. Is that alright, Doctor? Or is there something specific you’re looking for? I do have that luncheon next week, you see…
DOCTOR: Appendectomy as a child, and a knee replacement ten years ago. Good. Now, thinking about your family… is there any history of mental illness – depression, anxiety, or other psychiatric conditions – in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a… difficult question. Well, my aunt Matilda… she was always a bit… eccentric, shall we say? My mother used to say she had “a delicate constitution.” I believe she spent some time in an institution later in life, but we didn't discuss it much. And my cousin Cecil… he struggled with alcohol for many years. Other than that… I don’t believe so. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. It wasn't something we talked about openly, you see. Is that alright, Doctor? Or is there something specific you're looking for? I do apologize for being vague. It’s just… a sensitive topic.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of eccentric aunt and cousin with alcohol struggles. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, I'm divorced. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t have any children. I used to be very active in the local gardening club, but I’ve been less involved lately, as I haven't had the energy. I have a close relationship with my daughter, and I see my grandchildren whenever I can. I enjoy reading, and I used to travel quite a bit, but that’s become more difficult in recent years. I try to stay active and engaged, but it's been… challenging lately. Is that sufficient, Doctor? Or is there something else you’d like to know? I do apologize for rambling. It’s just… I’m not used to discussing these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Divorced, close relationship with daughter and grandchildren, enjoys reading, previously active in gardening club. Now, one last question. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps once or twice a week. And recreational drugs? Never! I've always believed in living a healthy and responsible lifestyle. My mother would be horrified if I even considered such things! Is that alright, Doctor? I do hope I've answered all your questions sufficiently. I really must be going soon. My luncheon…
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Thank you for your patience and thoroughness. So, to summarize, you've been feeling low for approximately three and a half months, with associated symptoms of sleep disturbance, appetite changes, loss of interest in activities, and difficulty concentrating. You have a history of an appendectomy and a knee replacement, and a family history of eccentric aunt and cousin with alcohol struggles. You don't smoke, drink excessively, or use drugs. We'll run those blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. In the meantime, I’m going to ask you to complete a brief questionnaire, a PHQ-9, to screen for depression. It’s just a series of questions, and it will help me get a better understanding of your mood. If, at any point, you feel overwhelmed or have thoughts of harming yourself, please contact the office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Now, do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A questionnaire… Well, I suppose that's to be expected. Thank you, Doctor. That’s… comprehensive. Just one question, if you don't mind. How long will it take to receive the results of the blood tests? And will I need to schedule another appointment to discuss them? I do have that luncheon next week, you see…and I wouldn't want to miss it. It's rather important, as my book club is discussing a rather controversial novel, and I've promised to lead the discussion. I do hope this won't take too long.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 2-3 business days. The phlebotomist will contact you to schedule the blood draw. And yes, I’d like to see you again in one week to discuss the results and formulate a plan. If anything changes before then – any worsening of symptoms, new symptoms, anything at all – please contact the office immediately. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will escort you to the lab. Thank you for your time, Ms. Derasmo.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your time. I do hope this all doesn't take too long. And please, do make sure the nurse understands that I have commitments next week. I wouldn't want to be delayed. Good day to you, Doctor. .
