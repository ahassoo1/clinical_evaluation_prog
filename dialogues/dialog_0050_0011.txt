DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day. Just need a paper signed, that’s all. Something about... a little fixin' up. The young lady at the place said I needed your okay first. Don’t rightly remember what it's for, truthfully. Been busy. Just want it done and over with.
DOCTOR: A “paper signed,” you say. And this is related to a… “little fixin’ up”?
PATIENT: That's right. A cosmetic thing. She said somethin' about… makin' me look better. A procedure, I think they called it. Honestly, Doctor, I got better things to worry about than rememberin' every little detail. Just need the form. Is that so hard? I work with towers, you know. Dangerous work. Don't have time for paperwork.
DOCTOR: While I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Honcoop, signing off on a medical procedure without a proper understanding of its nature and potential risks is…unacceptable. It's my professional responsibility to ensure your safety. Could you perhaps recall where this procedure is taking place?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, with all due respect, you're makin' a mountain out of a molehill. It's just a little somethin’ to…tighten things up. Some place in town, I reckon. A new place. Shiny buildin’. That's all I know. They got good advertisin’. I saw it on the television. Not my forte, rememberin’ names and places. I fix antennas for a livin’, not run a social club. Just sign the paper! It's gettin’ late.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let me see if I can locate this establishment. Do you recall anything specific about the advertising?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. There was… a pretty lady. Young. And… somethin' about lookin' younger, I suppose. They showed people before and after. That's about it. Real smooth talkin’ folks on the TV. Promised results. Honestly, Doctor, I ain’t one for lookin’ at pictures. I got work to do. Seems simple enough. Just want to get this over with. It ain’t like I'm askin’ for a new heart.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I've located a business matching your description – "Revitalize Aesthetics." They’ve received several complaints regarding unlicensed practitioners and… questionable practices. Are you certain this is the establishment you are referring to?
PATIENT: Complaints? Now hold on a minute. Unlicensed? That young lady seemed very professional. She had a nice uniform. Listen, Doctor, I don’t like the sound of this. Maybe I don’t need this procedure after all. But I already paid them a deposit! A good bit of money too. You're tellin' me I lost my money? This is ridiculous. I need that paper signed, and I need it now, so I can talk to these people and get my money back. Understand? It's about principle!
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration. However, signing a medical form for a procedure at an establishment with these concerns would be irresponsible. It would be a disservice to your health, and frankly, could have legal ramifications for both of us. I cannot, and will not, authorize a procedure at a facility with such a questionable record. Perhaps we can focus on getting your deposit refunded. Do you have any documentation of the payment?
PATIENT: You're tellin' me about irresponsible? I’m a hardworking man, Doctor! I spend my days climbin' towers, dealin' with dangerous equipment! I trusted these people! And you're sittin' here, tellin' me I can't get a little touch-up because of some complaints? I got insurance, y’know! Well, I thought I did. Somewhere around here… But nevermind that! This is preposterous! I'm leavin'. You're no help at all! .
