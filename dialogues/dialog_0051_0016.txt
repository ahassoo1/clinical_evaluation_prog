DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s about my patient, Mrs. Henderson. She's been on warfarin for… oh, it's been a while now, since her stroke. She's been bruising. A lot. It's… concerning. I mean, I know what these things usually mean, but I need a second opinion, I suppose. Though frankly, I'm not sure what you could tell me I don't already know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s always good to have another set of eyes on things, especially with medications like warfarin. It's good you’re being thorough. And don’t worry, I'm happy to review her case with you. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… everywhere, really. Small things, mostly. Bumps into furniture, that sort of thing. But they bruise… easily. And they stay bruised for a long time. Longer than they should. She's a very delicate woman, Mrs. Henderson. Always has been. She’s… careful. It’s not like she’s going around getting into fights, you know? I just… I don’t want anything bad to happen. It’s been… difficult since her husband passed. She’s very anxious.
DOCTOR: I see. So, bruising with minor trauma, and it’s prolonged. And you’ve noticed this is more recent, or perhaps more pronounced since her husband’s passing, given her increased anxiety?
PATIENT: Pronounced, yes. Definitely. Look, I've been practicing medicine longer than you've been alive, Doctor. I know what anxiety can do to someone. But there's more to it than that. It’s the warfarin, I suspect. But I’ve checked her levels, and they're… within range. That’s what’s so frustrating. Perfectly within range! It just doesn’t make sense. Perhaps you can explain it. Though, honestly, I doubt it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your experience, Mr. Farson. It’s true, sometimes things don’t fit neatly into the expected ranges, and that's when it's important to look a little closer. Just to be thorough, and to help me get a complete picture, could you tell me what her most recent INR was, and when it was checked?
PATIENT: Honestly. You're going to ask me for the number? I just told you I checked it. It was… 2.1. Last week. Yes, last Tuesday, I believe. Look, I have a very busy practice, Doctor. I don’t have time to recite every detail of every patient’s chart. That’s what the nurses are for. But fine, 2.1. Is that satisfactory? Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. It’s a waste of my valuable time.
DOCTOR: 2.1, last Tuesday. Thank you. And you mentioned she's been on warfarin since her stroke. Do you recall roughly how long ago that was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was… seven years ago. Yes, seven years last April. It was a fairly significant stroke, you know. Left her with some weakness on her left side. We started her on warfarin immediately, of course. Standard procedure. And she’s been on it ever since. Though I will say, she’s a very… particular patient. Doesn’t always follow instructions perfectly. A bit of a worrier, always questioning things. Which, frankly, is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Seven years. And you mentioned she doesn't always follow instructions perfectly. Could you give me an example of that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly with her diet. She'll insist on having grapefruit, despite my repeated warnings. And she's… forgetful, sometimes. Missing doses, then taking double the next day to compensate. Small things, really. But they add up, you know? I've explained it to her countless times. The importance of consistency. But she just… doesn't seem to grasp it. It’s like talking to a wall sometimes. Honestly, she’s a perfectly intelligent woman, but she just doesn’t listen. It’s incredibly frustrating. I suspect that’s contributing to the bruising. But… the INR is still within range. That’s what’s so baffling.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, inconsistent diet, including grapefruit, and occasional self-adjustment of doses. That can certainly contribute to fluctuations, even if the INR is currently within range. To get a more complete picture, are you aware of any other medications she's taking, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. She takes… a multivitamin, I believe. And something for her arthritis, ibuprofen, sometimes. But nothing regularly, really. She tries to avoid medication as much as possible, which I commend her for, but it makes managing things… difficult. And she’s started taking some herbal tea, something for “relaxation,” her daughter suggested it. I didn't ask her what was in it, frankly. I don’t put much stock in those things. Probably just colored water. Honestly, she’s a very… independent woman. Doesn’t like to be told what to do. It's a constant battle. Does it really matter what kind of tea she's drinking? I mean, it's just tea!
DOCTOR: It’s good to know about the herbal tea, even if it seems unlikely to be the cause. Some herbal supplements can interact with warfarin. Now, to move forward, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, just to rule out any other potential causes for the bruising. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? I've examined her myself for years, Doctor. I think I have a pretty good idea of what’s going on. But… fine. If you insist. Though I doubt you'll find anything I haven't already seen. But go ahead. Just don't take too long. I have patients waiting, you know. Valuable time is being wasted here. Honestly, I’m starting to think this was a mistake.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's always good to have a fresh set of eyes, and I’ll be as quick as possible. I'd like to check her skin for any signs of other issues, listen to her heart and lungs, and briefly assess her neurological function. First, let’s take a look at the bruising. Could you point out the areas where you’ve noticed it most recently?
PATIENT: Everywhere, I told you. But mostly on her arms, her legs… and she had a particularly nasty one on her hip a few days ago. Bumps into things, you know? She’s… delicate. There. And there. Honestly, it’s all rather obvious. I’m a physician, Doctor, not blind. If you need me to point out every single bruise, I suggest you find another profession. It’s rather insulting, frankly. Just look. It’s everywhere. Really, I don’t see the point of this exercise. It’s a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see the bruising is quite diffuse, with varying degrees of discoloration. There doesn't appear to be any significant tenderness to palpation, and I don’t feel any masses. Skin turgor appears normal. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No focal neurological deficits noted. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable, with no obvious signs of other underlying causes for the bruising.
PATIENT: Well, I could have told you that. Honestly. You've confirmed what I already knew. I've been examining her for years, Doctor. I know her condition intimately. This whole exercise has been… pointless. Truly. I fail to see what value this has added. Perhaps you could suggest something now, instead of simply confirming the obvious? Or are you just going to continue wasting my time? I have patients waiting, you know. Important patients. Not just sitting around bruising themselves.
DOCTOR: You are right to point out that the exam didn’t reveal anything new. Given the diffuse bruising, consistent with minor trauma, her history of warfarin use, inconsistent diet, occasional missed doses, and the use of herbal tea, it’s likely that the bruising is related to fluctuations in her INR, despite it being within range currently. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes, even if they seem unlikely. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess her overall health and rule out any underlying bleeding disorders or other issues. Additionally, I would recommend a PT/INR repeat in one week to monitor her warfarin levels more closely. Given her anxiety and the potential for medication non-adherence, I'd also like to refer her to a pharmacist for medication counseling, to ensure she understands the importance of consistency and proper dosage. What do you think of that plan?
PATIENT: More tests? A pharmacist? Honestly. It's all so… unnecessary. I've already told you, she's a worrier. A pharmacist isn't going to magically fix that. And I doubt a blood test will reveal anything useful. But… fine. If it will make you feel better, go ahead. Order your tests. But I still maintain that this is a waste of time and resources. A waste, I tell you. Though I suppose it's better than you just sitting here doing nothing. But frankly, I could be seeing patients. Important patients. This whole situation is… frustrating. Honestly, it is. Order your tests and let's get this over with. I have a practice to run, you know. A very busy practice. And I'm wasting precious time here. So, yes. Order the tests. Get it done. And let's hope something useful comes of it. Though I highly doubt it. Highly.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ve ordered a CBC and CMP, and I’ll schedule a repeat PT/INR for one week. I’m also submitting a referral to a pharmacist for medication counseling. I'll have the results sent to you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor her for any signs of excessive bleeding, such as nosebleeds, gum bleeding, or blood in the urine or stool. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think you've wasted enough of my time already. I've told you everything you need to know. I expect the results to be… unremarkable. And frankly, I doubt a pharmacist will make any difference. But fine. Thank you for… your time. Though I’m not sure what value it added. Honestly. I have patients waiting. Important patients. This has been… a waste. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, if you think of anything else, please don’t hesitate to contact me. And thank you for bringing Mrs. Henderson to my attention. Have a good day, Doctor. .
