DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. My name is Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Sieh, you say? Well, it’s… it’s this tiredness. Just awful tiredness. Comes on suddenly, and knocks me right flat. And the young man at the lab said something about… numbers being off. Something about my muscles? I don’t rightly remember. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. My husband, Pem, he's the one who made the appointment. He worries so.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Tiredness that comes on suddenly is definitely something we want to investigate. And you mentioned the lab results – something about your muscles?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Something about…creatine? Creatinine? Something like that. It’s a mouthful. Honestly, those young people talk so fast, and I don't catch half of it. It sounded important, though. And Pem said it had something to do with my… well, I do a bit of diving, you see. Commercial diving. Not much these days, but… I used to be quite good at it. Perhaps it’s something to do with that? Though I haven’t been in the water for… oh, a good while now.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving – that’s interesting! And it could be related, yes. Creatinine is a waste product in your blood, filtered by your kidneys. Elevated levels can sometimes be linked to muscle issues, and your diving history is relevant. Let me just pull up your lab results here… Ah, yes. Your creatinine is slightly elevated, as you mentioned. It’s not dramatically high, but enough to warrant some further investigation. Before we go further, can you tell me a little bit about when this tiredness started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… That’s a tricky one. It comes and goes, you see. But… I suppose… maybe three, four months ago? It was just a little bit at first. I thought it was just getting old, honestly. But then it got worse. Much worse. Like someone flipped a switch. Now it just… happens. I try to keep busy, you know? Little chores around the house, gardening… but then wham. Just completely wiped out. It usually lasts a day or two, and then I feel alright again… for a little while. But it’s unsettling, dear. Very unsettling. Pem keeps saying I need to slow down, but… what else is there to do?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating to have this come and go, and to feel wiped out so suddenly. It's good you're staying active, but we definitely need to figure out what's causing this tiredness. Okay, so tiredness onset about three to four months ago, intermittent, lasting a day or two at a time. Have you noticed anything else happening when you feel tired?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Anything else… Well, my muscles ache a bit. Not all the time, but when I’m really tired, they feel… sore. Like I’ve been doing a lot of heavy lifting, even when I haven’t. And sometimes… sometimes my urine is darker than usual. A funny color. Pem noticed it first, actually. He always notices these things. He’s very observant. But no… that’s about it, I think. I haven’t been running a fever or anything like that. Just tired and sore. And that funny urine color sometimes. It’s all very… peculiar.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches with the tiredness and darker urine sometimes – that’s helpful information. Darker urine can be a sign of dehydration, but it can also indicate other things we need to investigate. Let me just check your records… I see you have a history of well-controlled hypertension, managed with medication. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh yes, the blood pressure. It's a nuisance, but Dr. Sharma keeps it under control. Just the usual pills, you know? And… well, years ago, when I was first learning to dive, I had a bit of an accident. Nothing serious, thankfully. A bit of decompression sickness, they called it. But it was a long time ago. Fully recovered, they said. And that’s about it, dear. I’ve always been a healthy woman, despite the blood pressure. Active, strong… well, was strong, anyway. This tiredness is just so unlike me. It’s worrying. Pem is beside himself, I tell you. He keeps fussing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of well-controlled hypertension and a past episode of decompression sickness. That’s important to know, especially given your diving background. Decompression sickness can sometimes have long-term effects. Now, before we do a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… There’s the lisinopril, for the blood pressure. Dr. Sharma said to take one every morning. And… oh, yes, I take a calcium supplement. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you know? I think it's calcium citrate. And… that's it, dear. Just the two pills. I’m usually very good about remembering, but… well, sometimes I forget. Don't tell Pem, though! He worries enough as it is. I take them with breakfast, usually. Unless I’m… tired, of course. Then everything goes out the window.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ardelle. It's very common to have a little trouble remembering sometimes. Lisinopril for blood pressure and calcium supplement. Good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. Whatever you think is best. Go right ahead. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just… be gentle, alright? My old bones aren't as sturdy as they used to be. And please, don't tell me anything too alarming! I get so anxious, you know? Pem will have a fit.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I'll explain everything as we go along. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/85, but not dramatically so. Heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I’m noting some mild swelling in your ankles, which could be related to the blood pressure or simply from being on your feet. Your muscle strength is a bit diminished in your legs, especially when you resist my pull. Not significantly, but noticeable. Alright, Ardelle. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I think we need to do some further testing to figure out what’s causing your tiredness.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Testing? What kind of testing? I don’t like the sound of that. Will it be painful? And will Pem have to come with me? He worries so much, and I don't want to upset him. I'm not afraid of a little discomfort, but... I do have a bit of a phobia about needles, you see. It’s silly, I know, but… my sister once fainted when she got a shot, and I’ve been nervous ever since. And diminished muscle strength? That doesn’t sound good at all. Is it something serious? Please, don’t tell me it’s my diving… I loved that work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ardelle, and I’ll do everything I can to make you comfortable. The testing I’m thinking of is just some blood work and a urine analysis – routine tests, nothing too invasive. The blood work will help us assess your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any underlying infections or inflammation. The urine analysis will give us more information about your kidneys as well. I know you have a phobia about needles, and we can definitely take things slow and find a comfortable position. We can also use a numbing cream to minimize any discomfort. And Pem is welcome to come with you for support, if that would make you feel better. But if you prefer, you can come on your own. Regarding the diminished muscle strength, it’s too early to say definitively what’s causing it. It could be related to your past diving history, but it could also be due to a number of other factors, such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or even just age-related muscle loss. The blood work will help us narrow down the possibilities. I want to be thorough and get to the bottom of this so we can get you feeling better. Would you be comfortable scheduling those tests today?
