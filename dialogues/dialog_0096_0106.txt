DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. I’m Dr. Burlingham. Now, you're 89 years young, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Eighty-nine. Though sometimes I feel a good deal older, especially with this foot. It’s been a bother, you know. A real bother. And frankly, I expect a quick fix. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: A “quick fix,” you say. Well, we’ll see about that. Now, tell me about this foot. When did it start bothering you, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Exactly? Now, don’t ask me for exactly. It’s been… well, it’s been a while. Months, certainly. Maybe longer. I suppose it started small, just a little sore spot. I didn’t think much of it at first. Old age, you know? Things ache. But it’s gotten worse, of course. Much worse. And it smells. Dreadful smell. I have to be careful who visits.
DOCTOR: Months, alright. And it’s gotten worse… and has an odor. Hmm. Can you describe the pain, Louine?
PATIENT: It’s…throbbing. A deep, constant throbbing. And it feels…hot. Like a fire is burning inside my foot. Especially at night. Keeps me awake, it does. And if anything brushes against it… oh, the agony! It’s just…unbearable sometimes. You wouldn’t believe. Though I suppose you would believe, seeing as you’re the doctor. But really, it’s quite awful. It’s interfering with my…well, with everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, throbbing, heat, and quite sensitive to touch. And it’s interfering with… everything, you said. Are you able to walk on it at all, Louine?
PATIENT: Walk? Heavens no. Not properly. I can hobble a bit, with a cane. But it’s…precarious. I mostly stay put, to be honest. I used to enjoy gardening, you know. Beautiful hibiscus. But now… now I just sit. It’s a shame. A real shame. I depend on my daughter for most things these days. She brings me groceries and…well, everything. It’s humiliating, at my age, to be so helpless.
DOCTOR: Right. Limited walking, requiring a cane, and dependence on your daughter. And you’ve noticed this impacting your usual activities… gardening, specifically. Now, Louine, have you noticed any redness, swelling, or any discharge coming from the foot?
PATIENT: Discharge? Oh…yes. There is…something. It’s…unpleasant. Yellowish, I think. And the skin around it is…well, it’s not its usual color, that’s for sure. Red and inflamed. And puffy. Quite puffy. Honestly, it looks a fright. My daughter says I shouldn’t look at it, but of course, I do. One has to know what one is dealing with, doesn't one? Though it’s not a pretty sight, I can tell you that. It’s… worrying. Very worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Redness, swelling, yellowish discharge… Yes, this is concerning. Now, I'm going to need to take a look at it myself, Louine. I’ll need you to remove your shoe and sock. We need to see the extent of the problem, and I'll need to assess it properly. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Really? Now? I hadn’t expected… well, I hadn’t expected to have to… expose it. It’s rather…unseemly, isn’t it? I suppose I must, if you insist. But please be gentle. And don't make a face. I can tell when people are disgusted. It’s very rude, you know. My daughter will be furious if I come home upset. It’s bad enough having to show you…
DOCTOR: Of course, Louine. I assure you, I am a professional. And I will be as gentle as possible. It’s simply a necessary step to determine what’s going on and get you the right treatment. Just… take your time. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's as awful as you likely imagined. Don't say I didn't warn you. Honestly, it’s a wonder I can even stand, it hurts so much. And it smells. I can smell it even now. You'll need a strong disinfectant after this, I can tell you that. Don’t dilly-dally now, get on with it. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Yes, there’s significant inflammation and a rather deep ulcer present. And as you say, there is an odor. This looks like a possible infection, Louine. We’re going to need to run some tests to confirm, including a culture to identify the bacteria causing it. I'm going to order a blood test as well to check for signs of systemic infection. I will also need to document the size and depth of the ulcer for tracking purposes. It measures approximately 3 centimeters in diameter and appears to be about 1 centimeter deep. Do you have any known allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Antibiotics? Oh dear. I haven’t taken anything… strong… in years. Let me think… My daughter handles all the medications. She’s very careful. I think I had a reaction to penicillin when I was a girl… a rash, I believe. But it was a long time ago. She'll know for sure. She keeps a very detailed record. Honestly, I don’t trust my memory these days. It’s gone to pot, you know. Completely gone to pot. But I'm sure she'll have it written down somewhere. She’s very organized, that girl. A good daughter. Though she does fuss too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible penicillin allergy – we’ll make a note of that and avoid it for now. We will send the culture to the lab and get back to you with the results as soon as possible. In the meantime, I'm going to order a course of oral antibiotics, something broad-spectrum to cover a range of possibilities. We’ll start with that and adjust it once we have the culture results. I'm also going to recommend a wound care specialist. They can provide more specialized treatment for the ulcer, including debridement and advanced dressings. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: A wound care…what did you call it? Specialist? More doctors? Honestly, it’s getting to be a parade of people poking and prodding. Well, I suppose I have no choice, do I? If it will help this…this mess…heal, I’ll agree. But tell them to be gentle. And don’t let them keep me waiting for hours. I haven’t got the patience for endless waiting rooms. And make sure they coordinate with my daughter. She handles all the appointments. Honestly, I can barely keep track of my own name these days. Is that understood? Coordination with my daughter. It’s vital.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Coordination with your daughter is paramount. I will personally ensure that the referral information is sent to her with clear instructions regarding scheduling and follow-up. We’ll also provide her with a copy of my findings and the lab results. Now, Louine, it’s important that you keep the wound clean and dry, and that you avoid putting any weight on the foot as much as possible. We'll also need to monitor for any signs of worsening infection, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, or fever. Do you have a thermometer at home?
PATIENT: A thermometer? Heavens no. What would I need a thermometer for? I leave that sort of thing to my daughter. She’s the one with all the…the gadgets. She checks my temperature if she thinks I’m feeling poorly. But I haven't had a fever in years. Honestly, I'm more concerned about this…this smell. It’s simply dreadful. It’s ruining my life. Is there anything I can do about the smell? Some sort of ointment, perhaps? Or a spray? Anything? It’s embarrassing, you know. Dreadfully embarrassing. I can’t have visitors with this…this stench hanging in the air. Worry about the doctors and the appointments later. First, fix the smell. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Louine. We will address the smell. The antibiotics should help to reduce the infection, which will in turn lessen the odor. I can also prescribe a topical antiseptic solution to help control the bacteria and deodorize the wound. We can also discuss some gentle foot hygiene practices to help keep the area clean. It’s important to remember that the smell is a symptom of the infection, and addressing the underlying cause is the most effective way to resolve it. Here is the prescription for the antiseptic solution. Take this to your pharmacy and follow the instructions carefully. Now, I'm going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to assess your progress and review the lab results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: One week? I suppose that’s as good as anything. Though I expect to be feeling much better by then. This is a nuisance, you know. A real nuisance. Very well. One week. Tell my daughter. She’ll handle it. Now, can I go? I'm rather tired of being poked and prodded. And frankly, the smell is making me nauseous. I need some fresh air. And a strong cup of tea. And a daughter who understands the importance of a clean-smelling home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Louine. You may go. I’ve sent the referral to the wound care specialist and the prescriptions to your pharmacy. My office will contact your daughter to schedule the follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before your appointment. And I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: .
