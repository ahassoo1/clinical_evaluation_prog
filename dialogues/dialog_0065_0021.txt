DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascondola. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's my foot, see? It’s been swelling up for, oh, maybe a week now. Not real bad at first, just a little puffy, but it's gotten worse each day. It hurts when I walk on it too.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yep, about a week. Started kinda slow, like after a long day, you know? Just felt a bit achy and a little bigger. I didn't think much of it then, figured I just been on my feet too long at work. But then it just kept swelling, and now… well, now it's definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: And what kind of work do you do, Mr. Parascondola?
PATIENT: I work at the bank. Loan stuff, mostly. Interviewing people, checking paperwork… lots of sitting, but also a good bit of walking around the office, getting files, helping folks at the counters. It keeps me moving, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly when I put weight on it, like walking. When I'm sitting with it up, it doesn't hurt too bad, just feels… full, kinda heavy. But as soon as I try to stand or walk, that's when the ache really kicks in. It's a sharp pain, not a dull one.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in the color or temperature of your foot?
PATIENT: No, not really. It looks pretty much the same, I think. Maybe a little reddish, but I'm not sure if that's just from the swelling. And it doesn’t feel any warmer or colder than my other foot, no.
DOCTOR: Have you had any injuries to that foot recently?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. I haven't twisted it or dropped anything on it, nothing like that. I definitely didn't feel anything happen. It just…started swelling. I’m usually pretty careful, you know? I try not to bump into things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know? Nothing major. And no, my family doesn't have a history of anything like diabetes or circulation problems.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I try to stay away from pills if I can help it. Just a little bit of ibuprofen now and then for a headache, but that's it. Not regularly, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at your foot. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here we go. Just let me know if I need to adjust or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so there’s tenderness right here, along the outside of your ankle. And I can feel some swelling around the malleolus. Your skin temperature is normal, and I don’t see any open wounds or signs of infection. Does that hurt?
PATIENT: Yes, that does. A little bit sharp, right where you're touching. Not terrible, but definitely noticeable. It feels… tight, like something is pulling. And yeah, it's worse when you move it that way. Right there. That's where it mostly hurts.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Based on what I’m feeling, it’s possible you have a sprain. However, to rule out a fracture, I'd like to order an X-ray of your foot. We need to be certain. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A sprain? Okay. And an X-ray… yeah, that makes sense. If you need to be sure, then sure, let’s do an X-ray. I understand. Just tell me what I need to do. Is it going to be painful?
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself shouldn't be painful, Mr. Parascondola. It just involves standing still for a few moments while the machine takes a picture of your foot. The technician will position your foot and ensure you’re comfortable. Now, do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? No, I don’t think so. Never had anything like that before, to be honest. I’ve never had an X-ray before either, so I don't know what that is. I’m not allergic to anything that I know of, but I've never had any reactions to anything, not even bug bites. Is that something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: No, it's unlikely you’ll need contrast dye for a foot X-ray. I just ask as a standard precaution. Alright, the technician will come in shortly to take the X-ray. After we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, try to avoid putting any weight on your foot as much as possible. Do you understand the importance of that?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. No putting weight on it. That's… hard, with my job, but I'll try. I'll really try. Is there anything else I should be doing right now? Anything to help it, maybe?
DOCTOR: For now, RICE – Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Rest means avoiding weight-bearing activities, which you've already agreed to. Ice the area for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Compression can be achieved with a bandage, but don’t wrap it too tightly. And elevation means keeping your foot raised above your heart as much as possible. However, without the X-ray results, I cannot give you a definitive diagnosis or treatment plan. We need to rule out a fracture first. Do you have any questions for me before they come in?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Rest, ice, bandage, and keep it up. And wait for the picture. Okay. Just one thing… how long does the picture take? And will it be a long wait to find out what it shows? I need to get back to work tomorrow, you see. It’s… complicated.
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself will only take a few minutes, Mr. Parascondola. As for the results, it depends on how busy the radiologist is, but typically we have them within a few hours. However, I cannot guarantee that. I understand you need to get back to work, but we need to prioritize your health. If it is a fracture, forcing yourself to work could cause further damage. Let's focus on getting the results first, and then we can discuss a plan that balances your health and work obligations. Do you have any other concerns I should address while we wait?
PATIENT: Okay, okay, you're right. Health first. I get it. No, I don't think so. Just... worried, I guess. Never been hurt like this before. If it is broken… what happens then? Do I need a cast? Or… surgery?
DOCTOR: If it is a fracture, the treatment will depend on the severity and location of the break. Simple fractures may only require a cast or walking boot for several weeks to allow the bone to heal. More complex fractures may require surgery to realign the bone and stabilize it with pins, screws, or plates. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. It could be a sprain, which typically heals with rest, ice, compression, and elevation. We need to see the X-ray results before we can determine the best course of treatment. Here's the technician now. They'll explain the procedure to you. Do you have any questions for me before they begin?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm okay. Just… try not to worry, right? Thank you, Doctor. Let's get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see what the X-ray reveals.
