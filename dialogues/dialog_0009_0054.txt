DOCTOR: Good morning, Rayshon. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… I got cough. Long time already. And… tired a lot. Also, my nose… always block, then runny. Happens often. I think sinus, people tell me. But I don’t really know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A long-standing cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion – that certainly sounds bothersome. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. First, when you say “long time,” roughly how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time… maybe… six months? Or more? I’m not good with dates, sorry. It’s been… a while since I felt really good. I just keep getting better, then worse, then better again. It's… annoying.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, no need to apologize at all. Six months or more is helpful to know. And that pattern of getting better then worse is good information too. Could you describe the cough for me?
PATIENT: It’s… wet cough. Lots of phlegm. Sometimes yellow, sometimes clear. Mostly in the morning is bad. Then… okay a little bit during the day. But at night… when I lie down… worse again. I need to clear my throat a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, a productive cough – meaning you're bringing up phlegm – that’s more noticeable in the mornings and worsens when lying down. That’s helpful. And the color changes in the phlegm are also something we’ll keep in mind. Now, about that fatigue… Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Just… tired all the time. Even after sleep. Like… heavy. I work, fix tires… it’s hard now. Used to be okay. Now… I need to rest more during the day. Can’t play with my kids so much. It's… sad.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue that doesn't improve with sleep and interferes with your daily activities – and especially with spending time with your children – is definitely something we need to address. And you mentioned nasal congestion. Is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Sometimes okay, sometimes very block. Then runny. Always worse when the weather change, I think. Also, sometimes I got headache with the block nose. Not very bad headache, but… annoying. Like pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent nasal congestion, worse with weather changes, and occasional headaches that feel like pressure. That’s good to know. Now, let’s go through some general health questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else you're aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… I don’t think so. Never try anything that make me sick. My wife always remember what I can and can’t eat. She take care of that. I’m not sure. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you’re in good hands with your wife looking after that. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t like take medicine if not really need. I try rest, drink water… that’s it. Sometimes my wife give me cough syrup, but… not often.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Good to know. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past… medical… uh… I don’t really go to doctor much. I had fever when I was kid, I think. And… broken arm once when I was young. But… nothing serious. I’m okay, usually. Just this cough now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant past medical history that you’re aware of. And a broken arm when you were younger. That's helpful. Now, do you have any family history of medical conditions – like heart disease, diabetes, asthma, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… uh… my father… he got high blood pressure. And my mother… she got… arthritis, I think. Her joints always hurt. My sister… she okay. I don’t know… nobody really talk about sickness much in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of hypertension in your father and arthritis in your mother. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No! No smoke. Never try. My wife no like. It’s bad for health.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes… beer with friends. Not much. Maybe one or two on weekend. Not every weekend. I’m not big drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional social drinking – one or two beers on the weekends. That's good to know. And finally, what do you do for work?
PATIENT: I fix tires. Change tires. In the shop. It’s… hard work. I do it long time. But now… the cough make it harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, you work as a tire mechanic. And you’ve noticed the cough is making your job more difficult. Alright, Rayshon. That gives me a good overview of things. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your lungs and check your sinuses. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay. Whatever you need, Doctor. I want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I'm going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths in and out through your mouth. Okay. I'm hearing some wheezing and rhonchi in your lungs, which suggests some inflammation in the airways. Now, I'm going to palpate your sinuses to check for tenderness. And I notice some tenderness over your maxillary sinuses. Finally, I’ll take your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Your temperature is slightly elevated, and your blood pressure is a little bit on the higher side, but nothing too concerning at the moment. Okay, everything seems to indicate that you may have bronchitis with a possible sinus infection. However, I’d like to order some tests to confirm this and rule out other possibilities. Would you be okay with a chest X-ray and a blood test to check for infection?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Blood test…? I… don’t like needles. But… if you think it’s important… okay. I want to know what’s wrong. But… will it hurt? And… how much will it cost? I don’t have insurance…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Rayshon. It’s perfectly reasonable to be worried about needles and the cost of tests. The chest X-ray is painless – you'll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. As for the blood test, it's a quick pinch, and it's usually over very quickly. We can also use a smaller needle if that makes you more comfortable. Regarding the cost, let me check with the billing department to see what the estimated charges would be without insurance. We also have a social worker who can help you explore financial assistance options if needed. I can have them speak with you after the exam. In the meantime, I'll write an order for the chest X-ray and blood test. The lab and radiology departments are right down the hall. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Social worker sound good. I need help with cost. Chest X-ray… okay. Blood test… quick pinch, you say? I hope so. Can I still go to work after this? I need to work… money is tight.
DOCTOR: Yes, you should be able to go to work after the tests. There are no restrictions, unless the tests reveal something that requires you to stay home. However, I would recommend taking it easy and avoiding strenuous activity until we have the results. I’ll write these orders for you, and the staff will guide you to the lab and radiology departments. Please let them know if you're anxious about the blood draw. They're very good at making patients comfortable. Once you’ve completed the tests, please come back to the examination room, and we can discuss the results and a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions before you head off?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s not too bad. I will go now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshon. I hope so too. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions while you're waiting. The staff will take good care of you. I'll be here when you get back. .
