DOCTOR: Alright, Evann Buoniconte, 35 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Havird. It’s…rather difficult to explain, truthfully. I understand you assist with…planning for the future, regarding medical care? I was advised to come speak with you about…a form. An advance directive, I believe it was called? Or perhaps a POLST form… I’m terribly sorry, the details are…fuzzy. I just want to be prepared, should something…unforeseen occur.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. Advance care planning. Honestly, people worry far too much about these things when they’re perfectly healthy. It’s…a bit dramatic, if you ask me. But, alright. POLST is usually for people with serious illnesses already, so probably an advance directive is what you’re after. It’s essentially just saying what you want done if you can’t speak for yourself. It’s good you're thinking ahead, I suppose. Let's start with the basics. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: That's…very kind of you to explain. I truly apologize for taking up your time with this. And no, not that I am aware of. I…I don't have a regular physician, if that makes sense. I tend to avoid doctors when possible. It's…a long story. I've always been…quite healthy, all things considered. Although, I was divorced a few years ago, and I suppose that was…stressful. Does emotional distress count as a medical condition? I feel terribly foolish even asking.
DOCTOR: Divorce…well, life happens. Emotional distress isn't something we typically treat with medication, though. It's…not a physical ailment. Though, chronic stress can lead to things, eventually. But we're here to discuss planning for serious medical events, not the aftermath of a bad marriage. Alright. No regular physician, no diagnosed conditions. Have you been hospitalized for anything, ever?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even as a child, if I recall correctly. I…had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Chickenpox, measles…but nothing requiring a hospital stay. My mother always preferred home remedies. She was…very resourceful. I'm afraid my memory isn’t what it once was. It’s quite frustrating, actually. I'll start remembering something, then the details simply…fade. Is that normal? Perhaps I should see someone about that, too. Though, then I’d need to remember to schedule an appointment… it’s a vicious cycle. I apologize for rambling.
DOCTOR: Alright, no hospitalizations, childhood illnesses… fine. Look, we're trying to get through this. The fact that you’re a bit forgetful isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm. Everyone forgets things occasionally. If it was seriously impacting your life, you’d probably know. Let’s move on. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: That…that's a good question. I honestly… I don't believe so. I haven't taken any medication regularly in…years, if ever. Perhaps a pain reliever for a headache, occasionally. But nothing prescribed, and certainly nothing long-term. I don’t recall ever having an allergic reaction to anything. But then again… I may not remember if I did. It’s… terribly frustrating, this. Is it possible to have an allergy without knowing it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's possible, technically. But unlikely if you’ve never had a reaction. Look, let's not dwell on hypotheticals. We’re trying to establish what is, not what might be. Okay. No known allergies. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never. My mother…she always discouraged it, strongly. And the smell…I find it quite unpleasant. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I wouldn’t consider myself a…drinker. Perhaps one or two glasses a week, at most. I apologize if that's relevant. I simply wish I could be of more assistance. I feel as though I’m…stumbling around in the dark. Is there something I should have prepared beforehand? A list, perhaps?
DOCTOR: One or two glasses a week isn’t a concern. You’re not an alcoholic, if that's what you’re worried about. And no, you didn't need to prepare anything. It's not a test. We’re just…gathering information. Alright. One last thing for now. Any family history of…serious illness?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that’s…difficult. My parents both passed away several years ago. My mother…she had heart problems, I believe. And my father… he suffered from… I believe it was a form of dementia, towards the end. But it was a long time ago, and I wasn’t particularly close to either of them, if I’m honest. I have a brother, but we haven’t spoken in…years. I don't know anything about his health. I apologize. I truly am a terrible source of information. Is this…is this going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart problems and dementia in your family. Not ideal, but not necessarily a guarantee you’ll experience the same. It’s just…information. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse… the usual. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. A physical exam… yes, I suppose that makes sense. I do hope I’m not taking up too much of your time, Doctor Havird. I feel…rather inadequate, frankly. I simply want to ensure…everything is in order. Where would you like me to begin?
DOCTOR: Step on the scale first, please. And then we’ll take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Just the basics. 123 pounds… That’s… quite low for your height.
PATIENT: Oh? Is it? I’ve always been…slender, I suppose. I don’t eat particularly poorly, though I do tend to…forget to eat sometimes. It’s rather silly, I know. I get so caught up in my work, I simply lose track of time. Is there cause for concern? Perhaps I should be eating more? I feel rather foolish admitting this, but I often have to remind myself to drink water as well.
DOCTOR: 110 over 60. A bit on the low side, but not alarmingly so. And yes, you are underweight for your height of 183 centimeters. Being underweight can weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to illness. And forgetting to eat…yes, that's not ideal. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Your heart rate is a bit fast, though. 90 beats per minute.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A fast heart rate? Is that… serious? I confess, I’m starting to feel rather anxious. Could it be…the stress? I haven't been sleeping particularly well lately. I often find myself working late into the night, and then I have difficulty…switching off my mind. Is that enough to cause my heart to race? I apologize for being such a…difficult patient. I seem to be nothing but problems. Should I be concerned?
DOCTOR: A fast heart rate can be caused by stress and lack of sleep. But we need to rule out other possibilities. It could be something simple, like dehydration. Or it could be something more…concerning. Let's do a few blood tests to check your thyroid function, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. Just to get a baseline and make sure everything is normal. And I’m going to recommend you see a therapist to address your stress and sleep issues. It's not a sign of weakness, you know. It’s simply…taking care of yourself.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood tests… and a therapist. Very well. I…I suppose that makes sense. I haven't considered therapy before, but…perhaps it’s time. I do tend to…bottle things up, I suppose. It’s a rather…old-fashioned habit. What sort of blood tests will be required? And…where would you recommend I find a suitable therapist? I haven’t the faintest idea where to begin. I feel rather…lost, frankly. Is this… a sign of something serious, Doctor Havird? Please, be honest with me.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily a sign of anything serious, but it's important to investigate. The blood tests will just give us a snapshot of your overall health and rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. We’ll check your thyroid, your electrolytes, your blood cell count…the usual. It’s a standard workup. As for a therapist… Here. I have a list of qualified therapists in the area. Look for someone who specializes in stress management and anxiety. It’s best to find someone you feel comfortable with, so don’t be afraid to try a few different ones before settling on someone. Honestly, the biggest issue right now is your weight and your sleep. Once you address those, I suspect many of your other symptoms will improve. Are you prepared to commit to making some lifestyle changes?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… yes. I suppose I am. It’s just… difficult. I’ve always been… rather set in my ways. But if it’s for the best… I’ll try. I truly will. I understand the importance of addressing my weight and my sleep. And I will do my best to find a therapist who is… a good fit. Will the blood tests require fasting? And…how long will it take to receive the results? I confess, I’m rather anxious about the waiting period. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for 12 hours before the blood tests. No food or sugary drinks, just water. And it typically takes about a week to get the results back. I'll have the nurse call you when they're available. Look, you’re healthy, relatively speaking. You’re underweight, you’re stressed, and your heart rate is a bit fast. It’s not a crisis. Just make some changes, see a therapist, and get the blood tests done. The nurse will schedule your bloodwork on your way out. Do you have any other questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No… I don’t believe so. Just… thank you, Doctor Havird. I appreciate your time and… your honesty. I suppose I’ll…see the nurse then. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes… get on with it. .
