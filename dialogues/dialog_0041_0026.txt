DOCTOR: Hi Ardelle, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just so tired all the time. It’s not like the normal tired you get at my age, you understand. It’s… deeper. And the young man at the front desk said something about my blood work… something being high? I don’t rightly recall what he said, though. Honestly, these young people mumble so.
DOCTOR: Yes, I saw that note about the blood work. It's perfectly alright if you don't recall details—we can go over everything together. “Deeper” tiredness is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… that’s a difficult one. Seems like it's been creeping up on me for… well, a few months now, I suppose. Maybe since last winter? It’s hard to say. My husband, Tenzin, he’s the one who noticed it first, really. Said I wasn't keeping up with my garden like I used to. And I do love my garden. It's very important to me. Everything’s just… a struggle now, getting things done.
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual onset is common. And it's good that Tenzin noticed—sometimes others are more aware of changes in us. So, it's been a few months, and it’s affecting your energy levels with things like gardening. Aside from the tiredness and difficulty with your garden, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, my muscles ache a bit, now and then. Not all the time, you understand. Just… a dull ache. And sometimes I feel a bit weak, like I can barely lift a pot. I used to be quite strong, you know. I did a lot of… well, a lot of work when I was younger. Commercial diving isn’t for the faint of heart. Though that was a long time ago, of course.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving! That is a physically demanding job. Okay, so muscle aches and weakness alongside the tiredness. Have you noticed anything else at all?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now that you mention it… my urine has been a bit… dark, lately. Like… a very dark tea color. I thought it was just because I wasn’t drinking enough, but I’ve been trying to drink more water, and it hasn't really helped. And I get a bit winded now when I climb the stairs. Only a few stairs, mind you, but still. It's not like it used to be. Everything is just… harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark urine and getting winded with stairs. That’s helpful information. Have you had any fever, chills, night sweats, or any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. I haven’t felt a fever in… well, goodness, I can’t even remember the last time I had a fever. Chills, no. Though sometimes I feel a bit cold, but that’s just the air conditioning, I think. Weight… I don’t rightly know about my weight. Tenzin watches that, mostly. He’ll tell me if I’m getting too heavy, but he hasn't said anything recently. And my appetite… it’s a bit smaller, maybe. But I still enjoy my food. Just don’t eat as much of it as I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, no chills, stable weight, slightly decreased appetite. And you mentioned the tiredness has been gradual, affecting your gardening and overall energy. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better picture of what's going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's necessary. I’ve always been a bit of a nervous patient, you see. All these doctors poking and prodding… But if you think it's best. Just be gentle, please. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take it slow and gentle. I’ll be as careful as possible. Alright, take a nice, deep breath for me… and again… Good. Heart sounds are a little distant, but no murmurs or irregularities that I detect right now. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt… much. Just a bit tender, right here. It’s been feeling like that for a bit now, I suppose. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, if you press on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel some tenderness there. It’s mild, but present. No masses or organomegaly that I can detect. I’m also going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that can be normal at your age. Your skin appears slightly pale. Okay, Ardelle, thanks for letting me do that. So, based on what you've told me and the exam, you've got gradual onset of fatigue, muscle aches, dark urine, and some tenderness in your upper right abdomen. Your skin is a bit pale, and your reflexes are diminished. These symptoms could be due to a number of things, but given your age and the tenderness in your abdomen, I’m concerned about the possibility of a liver issue or anemia. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count, liver function tests, and a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A liver issue? That doesn't sound good at all. I haven’t done anything to harm my liver, I assure you. I don’t drink, and I don't take any of those… those strong medicines. But if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, I suppose. Blood tests… alright. But please, explain the results to me carefully. I don't understand much of that medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take it one step at a time, and I promise to explain everything in plain language. It doesn't necessarily mean it is a liver issue, Ardelle. These tests will just help us rule things out and get to the bottom of what’s causing your fatigue and other symptoms. We'll check your blood cell counts to see if you might be anemic, and the liver function tests will tell us if your liver is working properly. I'll also order a urinalysis to look at your urine more closely. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I had a bit of a rash when I was a little girl, after eating some berries, but that was a long time ago. And my skin gets a bit itchy sometimes, but that’s just the dry air, I think. Tenzin puts lotion on it for me. No, I don’t think I have any real allergies. And I haven't changed any medicines recently. Just the usual lotion and a bit of pain reliever for my arthritis now and then. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or recent medication changes. Good. Alright, Ardelle, I’m going to write up these lab orders for you. The front desk will schedule you for blood work. It shouldn't take long. Once the results are back—usually a few days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or jaundice , please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Jaundice? Oh dear, that sounds terrible. No, I haven't noticed any yellowing of my skin, thankfully. No, I don't think I have any questions right now, Doctor. Just… please, try to find out what's wrong with me. I just want to feel like myself again. I miss my garden. And Tenzin worries so much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ardelle. And we will. That’s exactly what we’re going to do. We'll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully get you back to enjoying your garden with Tenzin. Here are the lab orders. The front desk will help you schedule the appointment. They can also answer any questions you might have about insurance or costs. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment. It was nice meeting you, Ardelle.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I hope… I hope it's nothing serious.
