DOCTOR: Bula! And welcome to the clinic, Triana. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s been… a mess. Just constantly running to the bathroom. They've given me stuff for it, pills and… liquids, but nothing’s working. It's been going on for weeks now. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That sounds really frustrating, constantly dealing with that. Weeks is a long time to be uncomfortable. To help me figure out what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not going to go into detail. It’s… diarrhea, okay? Lots of it. And it’s not like a normal upset stomach thing. It's… forceful. And it wakes me up at night. I've tried everything the pharmacy suggested. I just need something that actually works, and frankly, I don’t have time to keep explaining this to everyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely understand your frustration and I appreciate you telling me what’s going on. It sounds really disruptive to your life, especially waking you up at night. “Forceful” is a good way to describe it – that gives me some helpful information. To get a better picture, could you tell me roughly how often you're going to the bathroom in a day?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You need to know exactly? Fine. It’s… at least ten times a day. Maybe more. I stopped counting after a while, to be honest. It's pretty constant, especially after I eat. And it's not just after meals, sometimes it's just… randomly. Is that what you needed to know? Because I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, ten times a day is a lot, and the fact that it's happening even when you haven't eaten is important. And no, I don't need to know exactly, just a general idea helps me understand what’s going on. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever, nausea, or vomiting along with this?
PATIENT: Blood? No. I would have noticed that, wouldn’t I? Look, I'm not some… delicate flower. I know my own body. No blood. No throwing up. Just… the running. And a lot of it. I’m starting to feel really weak, though. That’s new. But honestly, probably just from not being able to keep anything in. I really need to get this sorted, I have a deadline.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know there’s no blood or vomiting. And feeling weak is definitely concerning – that suggests you might be getting dehydrated. Let's talk about your past medical history for a minute. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: Digestive issues? No. Look, I’m a painter. I work with lead-based paints sometimes, even with all the precautions. I get headaches, maybe a little dizziness from the fumes, but nothing… stomach-related. My husband… well, my late husband, he had some problems, but that was years ago, and it wasn’t anything like this. Honestly, I don’t see what that has to do with anything. I just want this to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. The history of lead paint exposure is important, so thank you for mentioning that, even if it doesn’t seem directly related right now. And I'm very sorry to hear about your late husband. To clarify, when you say "precautions," what exactly do you do to protect yourself from the lead fumes?
PATIENT: Look, I wear a mask, okay? A good one. And I ventilate the space. I'm not stupid. I know lead is bad. I've been painting for twenty years. It’s just… I’m careful. I’m always careful. I don’t need a lecture about safety protocols, alright? This isn’t helping me feel any better, it’s just making me stressed. Can we please just focus on fixing this?
DOCTOR: Okay, I apologize if my questions felt like a lecture – that wasn’t my intention at all. I just want to be thorough. It’s good to hear you’re taking precautions with the lead paint. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any medications you're currently taking, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. And I haven’t been taking anything regularly. I took something the pharmacist gave me for this, some… pink liquid, and a couple of pills. But they didn’t do anything. I stopped taking them after a few days. Honestly, I'm starting to think this is a waste of my time. I should have just stayed home and tried to sleep it off.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to confirm, you don't recall the name of the pink liquid or the pills?
PATIENT: No, I don’t! They were… generic, I think. The pharmacist just said "take these for diarrhea.” I didn’t bother to write it down, I didn’t think I'd need to. They didn’t work! I just want something that does work, is that too much to ask? I have a commission due next week, and I can't exactly paint while running to the bathroom every five minutes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. It's good to know you haven't been taking anything regularly. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. That's just to listen to your abdomen, check for any tenderness, and make sure there aren't any other obvious issues. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. But if it involves anything… invasive, I’m walking out. I’m not comfortable with… things. I just want this to stop, and I want to go home. And I really don't have time for a long exam.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. This will be a very quick and non-invasive exam – just listening with my stethoscope and gently feeling your abdomen. Nothing more, I promise. If you could lie down on the exam table, that would be great. Okay, I'm listening now. Your abdomen sounds… active, which isn't surprising given what you're experiencing. There’s some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, but nothing too concerning. I don’t feel any masses or anything like that. Your abdomen is also a bit… dehydrated. And I see here your weight is 52kg with a height of 164cm. That is a bit on the lower side, which could be contributing to your feeling weak. Now, given your symptoms and the exam findings, I'd like to order some blood work and a stool sample to help rule out any infections or other underlying causes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood work? A stool sample?! Seriously? This is ridiculous! I came in here with diarrhea, not to have my insides examined. Look, I appreciate you… listening, I guess, but I’m not doing any of that. I’m perfectly capable of deciding what my body needs, and I think I just need to rest and drink some fluids. I’m not comfortable with all these tests. I’m leaving. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your discomfort, and I respect your decision. However, given the duration of your symptoms, the frequency of your bowel movements, and the potential for dehydration, I am concerned that there could be a more serious underlying cause. Without further testing, it's difficult to determine the exact cause, and it could potentially worsen. I strongly advise you to reconsider the blood work and stool sample. If you are hesitant to do those here, I can provide you with referrals to a gastroenterologist who may be able to further evaluate you. If you experience any fever, severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’m happy to discuss your concerns further, and I want to make sure you receive the best possible care. Would you like me to write down the referrals for you?
