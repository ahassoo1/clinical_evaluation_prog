DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise; my schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s about my blood, you see. I need to know what type it is. It’s just… things are a bit fuzzy these days, and I can’t quite recall if I ever had it checked. Important, though, I think. Something about needing to know… for emergencies.
DOCTOR: Blood type, you say. Yes, well, it is useful information, though hardly an emergency in and of itself. I suppose we can indulge that. Have you ever required a blood transfusion, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: A transfusion… Oh dear. Let me think… I’ve had a few… scrapes and bumps, naturally. Being a rigger, you get into a bit of everything. But a transfusion? No, I don’t believe so. Not that I remember, anyway. Everything before… well, before my husband passed… it's all a bit… jumbled.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no known transfusions. And you say you've never had a formal blood type determination?
PATIENT: No, that's right. Never had it written down, at least. My mother always said I had good blood… strong, you know? But that doesn’t tell you the type, does it? She was a very practical woman, my mother. Didn't bother much with… formalities.
DOCTOR: Well, regardless. We’ll need to obtain a sample. It's a simple procedure. Nurse will be in shortly to draw blood. Do you have any known allergies to latex or other materials used in blood draws?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm. Let me see. I used to get a bit of a rash from… certain soaps, perhaps? But nothing serious. Latex… I don’t think so. I wore gloves for years, working… but they weren’t… fancy gloves. Just the regular kind. Are those the kind that cause problems? I really wouldn’t know.
DOCTOR: Right. “Possible sensitivity to some soaps.” We will use non-latex gloves as a precaution. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Let me think… Well, the doctor gave me something for my knees, a few years back. Little white pills. But I think I stopped taking them… they didn’t seem to do much, honestly. And… sometimes I take a little something for my nerves, when they bother me. But just when I need to. Not every day. It’s… a friend of a friend brought it, you see. I don't even remember the name.
DOCTOR: A medication from… a friend of a friend. Right. Do you happen to know the dosage of either of these medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no. I just take one of the white pills when my knees ache, and… a little sip of the other one when I’m feeling particularly… unsettled. It's a small bottle, blue, I think. And the friend… well, she’s very good with… herbal remedies, you see. It wasn’t from a proper pharmacy, not at all. I don’t usually keep track of those things. My husband always handled the medicine.
DOCTOR: Unidentified medications. Excellent. Alright, Mrs. Nini. We’ll proceed with the blood draw. After the results are back, we can discuss them further. Is there a family history of any blood disorders that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Blood disorders… Hmm. My grandfather, on my mother’s side, he was… not a healthy man. Always pale, you see. And tired. But what kind of sick he was… nobody ever said. Things were different then, you know? They didn't talk about those things so openly. And my sister… she had… problems with her iron, I think. Always felt weak. But beyond that… not that I recall.
DOCTOR: Very well. So, potential family history of anemia and… unspecified illness. I believe that covers the basics for now. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw the blood sample. Please remain seated and avoid strenuous activity afterward. We will contact you with the results. Do you have any other concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For taking the time. It’s a relief to finally get this sorted, you see. It’s just been… nagging at me. I tend to worry, you know. Old habits, I suppose. And… tell me, Doctor… will this be painful? The blood draw, I mean. I’m not very good with needles.
DOCTOR: It will be a small prick, Mrs. Nini. A minor discomfort, hardly worth mentioning. The nurse is very experienced. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I trust you’ll be alright.
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. A small prick. I suppose it won’t be so bad then. Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day now. I'll just… sit here and wait.
