DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't really do small talk. It's the army, right? I need the okay from you for the exam. My boy wants me to sign up, thinks it'll be good for me. I'm 51, not some spring chicken, but I'm still strong, you know? Stronger than most these youngsters. Just need the paper signed so I can get on with it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "getting the okay" involves a thorough medical evaluation, Mr. Hartness. It’s not simply a formality. The military has very specific requirements, and frankly, at 51, there are things we need to rule out. It’s for your own safety, as well as ensuring you can handle the demands of service. Before we even think about paperwork, I need to understand your current health status. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? No. What for? When I'm sick, I rest. When I’m not, I work. Simple as that. I haven’t needed a doctor in… well, a long time. Maybe when I broke my wrist when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. Look, I feel fine. Strong as an ox, I tell ya. What kind of questions are these? This is just a check-up, right? Not some interrogation?
DOCTOR: It's not an interrogation, Mr. Hartness, but it is a necessary part of the process. The military isn't about simply feeling strong; it's about being physically and mentally capable of rigorous training and potential deployment. A history of even seemingly minor issues can be relevant. Let’s start with the basics, then. Any chronic conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. None of that fancy stuff. High… what was it? Pressure? No. Sugar? No. Old man stuff? Absolutely not. I work with engines all day, you know? Heavy lifting, greasy hands… keeps me in shape. I eat meat, proper food. Not these… what do you call them… salads. And I definitely don’t sit around worrying about my… condition. It's all good, honestly. What's next? Can we just get this over with? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about past surgeries, then. Have you ever had any operations or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Like I said, the wrist when I was a kid. Fell out of a tree. Broke it good. They set it, put a cast on. That’s it. And… hmm. There was that time I cut my hand pretty bad on a piece of metal, but I just wrapped it up myself. Didn't bother with a hospital. Waste of time. A bit of disinfectant and a bandage, good as new. You think a little cut will stop me from signing up? It healed perfectly. Honestly, I'm tougher than most doctors I've met.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What do you mean? Like… who married who? I don't keep track of that sort of thing. My father was a strong man, worked the land. He lived a long life, though he did cough a bit at the end. My mother… she was alright. I suppose she had aches and pains like all old people do. Look, I’m not a genealogist, okay? I’m here because the army needs a medical form, not to write a novel about my ancestors. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll move on. Let's talk about your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Are you serious? No. Never have. Bad for the lungs, you know? Can't be running around building engines if you're coughing your lungs up. I like a beer with my dinner sometimes. A couple. Nothing crazy. Helps me relax after a long day. But smoking? Absolutely not. I keep myself healthy. Really. I do. What's next? I can smell oil and grease better than most, so I need my lungs in tip-top shape. It’s important for my work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Look, I avoid all that stuff if I can. Pills make me feel sluggish. If I get a headache, I rest. If I get a cold, I drink tea. Never had a bad reaction to anything, because I don't take anything. I'm a practical man. Real food, real rest, real work. That's what keeps me going. Do I need to list every flower I might be allergic to? It's a ridiculous question. Now, can we get to the actual exam? I'm starting to think you're just trying to waste my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, this is the exam. A proper medical evaluation isn't just about a physical check-up; it’s about understanding your overall health, including your history and lifestyle. It’s essential for determining whether you are physically fit enough to handle the demands of military service. Now, let’s get to the physical part. Please step onto the scale. And then we'll take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. But understand, I need accurate information from you. This isn’t a game.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Scale it is. But don't be surprised if it's a little off. I've been working hard, building things, putting on muscle. It's probably more than what those little numbers say. Just get it over with, alright? I haven't got all day. And if you ask me about my family history again, I'm walking out. Understand? Understand?
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a little elevated, and I'm hearing a murmur. Also, your breathing sounds a bit restricted. Let’s move on to a basic neurological exam… Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Elevated? Restricted? What are you talking about? I feel fine! I just walked here, didn't I? Strong as an ox, I tell ya! A little murmur? Everyone gets a little murmur when they get older. It’s just… the engine, you know? All that noise. I build engines! It probably vibrates my whole body. And my breathing? I've got strong lungs, I told you! All that oil and grease... it builds character! Follow your finger? Yes, yes, I can see perfectly fine. What's this all about? Are you trying to find something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll do a quick check of your range of motion. Can you touch your toes?
PATIENT: Touch my toes? Look, I haven’t got the flexibility of a gymnast, alright? I work with metal, not muscles. It’s…practical work. Building things, fixing things, heavy lifting. You want me to bend like a pretzel? It's ridiculous! I'm a strong man, not a dancer! Now, are we getting anywhere with this? Because honestly, I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting my time. If I can't sign up because I can't touch my toes, there's something seriously wrong with this whole system.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, based on this preliminary examination, and frankly, your reluctance to provide a full and accurate medical history, I have several concerns. Your blood pressure is significantly elevated, your breathing is restricted, your reflexes are diminished, and your grip strength is weaker than expected. Your range of motion is also limited. These findings, coupled with your…dismissive attitude towards your health, lead me to believe that you are not currently fit for military service. More importantly, attempting service in your current condition could be detrimental to your health. I strongly recommend a full cardiac workup, including an EKG and chest X-ray, as well as a pulmonary function test. I will also need a complete blood panel to assess your overall health. I can provide you with a referral to a cardiologist and pulmonologist. I’m not going to sign off on this medical form today. It would be irresponsible, and frankly, unethical.
PATIENT: Are you serious? You're telling me, after all this, that I'm unfit? Because I can't touch my toes and my blood pressure is a little high? I’ve been working hard my whole life! Building things! I’m stronger than most men half my age! And you're going to deny me this because of a few numbers and a little…murmur? This is…this is outrageous! I need that form signed! My boy is counting on me! He thinks this will give him a sense of purpose! You're ruining everything! I don't need a "cardiac workup" or a "pulmonary function test"! I just need a doctor to sign a piece of paper! You're…you're just making things difficult! Look, I've wasted enough time here. Forget the tests. Forget the referrals. Just sign the darn form! I'm a strong, capable man! I can handle it! It’s my life! I’ll take the risk! Just sign it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, I am not going to compromise my professional ethics. Signing off on a medical form knowing that you have underlying health conditions that could be exacerbated by military service would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. It is not simply about your desire to join the military; it is about ensuring your safety and well-being. I understand you are frustrated, and I appreciate your strong will. However, my responsibility as a physician is to prioritize your health, not to fulfill your wishes at the expense of your safety. I have documented my concerns in your chart, and I strongly urge you to reconsider my recommendation for a full cardiac and pulmonary workup. I can provide you with the contact information for several specialists in the area. But I will not sign the form today. And I strongly advise against attempting to circumvent this process. It would be a disservice to yourself, and potentially, to others. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: …You're unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. You think you know better than me about my own body? After all these years, you think a few minutes with a stethoscope qualifies you to decide what I can and can't do? Fine. You won't sign it? Fine. I'll find another doctor. One who understands what it means to be a strong, capable man. One who isn't afraid to take a little risk. One who doesn’t spend all day worrying about…murmurs. Don't expect to hear from me again. You've wasted my time, and you've insulted my intelligence. You'll regret this. You just wait and see. .
