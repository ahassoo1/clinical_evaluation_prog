DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Minatra, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor Gorga. I received a letter regarding the results of a… a test I had done on my insides. The gastrointestinal one, I believe it was called. It mentioned something wasn’t quite right, and I wanted to discuss it with you, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Right, right. The gastrointestinal test… yes. Let me pull up those results here… vaguely remember seeing something come across my desk. Hmm. Okay. And you said you received a letter… do you recall what specifically the letter said was… not quite right?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… it used the phrase “abnormal findings.” That was the part that concerned me, naturally. It didn't go into detail, which is why I am here. I am not one to self-diagnose, and frankly, I didn’t understand much of the phrasing in the letter at all. It spoke of… polyps, I think? And something about needing further investigation. It was all rather… technical.
DOCTOR: "Abnormal findings," yes. Polyps… okay. That’s… not necessarily a huge cause for alarm, but definitely something we need to look into. Just to be clear, were you experiencing any symptoms at all that prompted the test in the first place?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. To be perfectly honest, no, not really. I hadn’t noticed anything out of the ordinary. My regular physician, Doctor Ramirez, suggested it as part of my yearly check-up. She said, given my age, it was simply a precaution. I was a bit surprised when the results came back… unusual. I feel quite well, generally. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no specific symptoms prompted it, it was a routine screening… good to know. And you said Dr. Ramirez suggested it due to your age?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. She explained that as we get older, certain things become more… common. She didn't elaborate, and I didn't press her. I trust Doctor Ramirez implicitly, you see. She’s been my physician for… oh, goodness, nearly twenty years now. She simply stated it was a preventative measure, and I agreed. It was only the letter afterward that caused me any concern.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Preventative… okay. Well, polyps are growths, sometimes harmless, sometimes… not. The test likely was a colonoscopy, or perhaps a sigmoidoscopy?
PATIENT: I believe it was the colonoscopy. Yes, that sounds right. It involved… a camera, and they asked me to… well, you know. It wasn’t entirely unpleasant, but I was rather nervous beforehand. I remember being told I would be sedated. As for the other test you mentioned, the sigmoidoscopy… I don’t recall having that one, no. I only had the one procedure, as far as I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, colonoscopy… good. That gives us a better picture. Now, the report indicates a few small polyps were found. We classify them, usually, by size and… appearance. Do you have any family history of colon cancer, Mrs. Minatra?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we don’t speak of such things very often. It wasn’t considered polite, you see. But… I do recall my aunt, my mother’s sister, being quite ill when she was older. She lived in Oaxaca, and the doctors there… well, their methods were rather different than what we have here. I believe she had some sort of… stomach ailment. She passed away quite young, relatively speaking, perhaps in her late fifties. I don’t know if it was cancer specifically, though. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t discuss the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, aunt with a stomach ailment… that’s helpful to know, even if we don't have a definitive diagnosis. It's good you remembered that. Now, just to be thorough, have you experienced any of the following: changes in your bowel habits, blood in your stool, unexplained weight loss, or persistent abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Let me see… changes in bowel habits, no, not really. I’ve always been… regular, thankfully. Blood in my stool, no, I haven’t noticed anything like that. Unexplained weight loss… well, I have lost a little weight recently, but I attributed that to the warmer weather. I haven’t been eating as much. And persistent abdominal pain… no, not at all. I occasionally have a little indigestion, but nothing that would cause me concern. Honestly, Doctor, I feel quite well. That’s why I was so surprised by the letter. Perhaps it was a false alarm?
DOCTOR: It's good you feel well, Mrs. Minatra. And it's possible the findings are not significant. However, we do take these things seriously. The next step, based on the report, is a follow-up colonoscopy. This allows us to remove the polyps, if necessary, and send them to a lab for testing. This is called a biopsy, and it helps us determine if they are cancerous or precancerous. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A follow-up colonoscopy… yes, I understand. So, they would remove these… growths, and then examine them? That sounds… a bit more involved than the first one. Is it painful? And how long would I need to recover? I do have a small garden I enjoy tending, and I wouldn’t want to be incapacitated for too long. I also hadn't anticipated needing another procedure so soon. Is this common, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is more involved, yes, but generally not painful. You'll be sedated, just like the first time, so you won’t feel a thing. There may be some mild cramping or bloating afterward, but it usually subsides within a day or two. You should be able to return to your normal activities, including gardening, within a few days, as long as you take it easy. As for whether it's common… unfortunately, it is. Polyps are fairly common, especially as we get older, and sometimes they need to be removed and examined to rule out anything serious. It’s a preventative measure, really. We're being cautious. Would you like me to explain the biopsy process in a little more detail?
PATIENT: That does sound… manageable, thankfully. Sedated, you say? That is good to know. And preventative… I suppose that is best. Yes, if you wouldn't mind explaining the biopsy process, that would be very helpful. I confess, I don't understand much of the medical jargon. What exactly are they looking for, and how long does it take to get the results? I worry about waiting, you see. My mind tends to wander…
DOCTOR: Certainly. A biopsy is when they take a small sample of the polyp and send it to a lab. There, a pathologist – a doctor who specializes in examining tissues – looks at it under a microscope. They're looking for cancerous cells, or cells that could become cancerous. The results usually take about a week to come back. I understand your worry about waiting, it’s perfectly normal. We'll call you as soon as we have them. And if anything urgent comes up, we'll contact you immediately. It’s a fairly routine procedure, and we'll be with you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: A week… yes, I can manage a week. And a pathologist… that’s good to know it’s a specialist looking at it. No, I believe that answers my questions for now, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve put my mind at ease considerably. When would we schedule this… follow-up colonoscopy? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? I remember having to… cleanse myself thoroughly before the first one. Is that still required?
DOCTOR: I'm glad I could help. Yes, you will need to prepare for the colonoscopy just as you did before. The bowel preparation is essential to ensure a clear view. We'll give you detailed instructions when we schedule the appointment. It involves a special diet and a laxative solution you'll drink the day before. It's not the most pleasant part, admittedly, but it’s necessary. Let me see… my nurse, Maria, can schedule you for next week, perhaps Wednesday or Thursday?
PATIENT: Wednesday would be preferable, I think. That gives me a little time to… prepare myself mentally, and to purchase any necessary supplies. And I shall speak with Maria about the preparations, and the…laxative solution. Thank you, Doctor Gorga. I appreciate your patience and your clear explanations. I feel much more confident now, knowing what to expect. I am in your capable hands.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have Maria come in and get you scheduled. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions at all between now and then. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Minatra. We'll take good care of you. Maria! Could you please come in here for a moment?
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I feel reassured knowing I'm in good hands. I look forward to speaking with Maria.
