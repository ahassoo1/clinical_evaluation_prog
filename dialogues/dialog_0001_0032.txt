DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, good to see… well, to meet you. I'm Dr. Pehrson. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes, the doctor. Pehrson, you say? A fine name. Well, it’s… it’s a rather delicate matter, you see. A… a leakage. Down there. It’s been… present for some time now, I suppose. Not comfortable at all. I haven’t bothered my wife with it, naturally. A gentleman doesn't discuss such things.
DOCTOR: A “leakage,” you say. Right. And how long is “some time now”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it slips away, doesn't it? Let me think. Perhaps… a month? Maybe two? It's difficult to say precisely. I’ve been occupied with the farm, you understand. The combine needed servicing, then the irrigation system… always something. It simply… came to my attention recently that it hadn't resolved itself.
DOCTOR: A month or two. Okay. And is this constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant… no, not constant. It ebbs and flows, you might say. More noticeable after… exertion. Or, well, after using the facilities. It's not a torrent, thankfully. Just… a dampness. An unpleasant dampness. Really, it’s quite undignified for a man of my years.
DOCTOR: Right, “unpleasant dampness” after exertion and…use of the facilities. Any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not pain, precisely. A discomfort, perhaps. A stinging, occasionally. It’s not debilitating, mind you. I’ve endured worse fixing a broken tractor in December, I assure you. But it’s… irritating. It draws attention to itself, if you catch my drift. A gentleman prefers not to be reminded of such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so discomfort, occasional stinging. Any fever, chills, or changes in your urine – color, smell, frequency?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven't been feverish. Though my wife does say I’m a bit warm-blooded. She's always saying something. Chills… no. The weather’s been quite mild, thankfully. As for the urine… well, it looks like urine. What color is urine supposed to be, exactly? I don’t pay much attention to such things. It smells… like urine, I presume. I haven't noticed any… unusual scents. Honestly, doctor, I’m a mechanic, not a chemist.
DOCTOR: Right, no fever, chills, or changes in urine. Okay. Have you had any recent injuries or surgeries in that area?
PATIENT: Injuries? Surgeries? Good heavens, no! I’m a practical man, doctor, I fix things, I don't need fixing. Though I did once get a splinter in my hand, years ago. But that was hardly in… that area. No, no injuries, no surgeries. I take pride in my physical well-being, despite my age. A sturdy constitution, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmm. Let me see... My wife insists I take a multivitamin, for my “energy levels,” she says. And I occasionally take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I believe. Nothing else. I don't hold with all these modern pills. Give me a good wrench and some elbow grease any day.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? Now that’s a tricky question. I recall a rash once, years ago, after eating some… shellfish, perhaps? But it could have been the sun. And dust… I sneeze a bit around dust. But I live on a farm, doctor! One expects a bit of dust. Truly, I haven't a serious allergy to anything. I’m a robust man, as I’ve said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Let's have a quick look. If you don’t mind. Just a brief exam, okay?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Well. I… hadn’t expected that. Is it absolutely necessary? It's rather… personal, you see. And I haven’t… prepared myself, shall we say. Is there no other way? Perhaps a… questionnaire? Or a detailed description?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, I'm a doctor. I need to see what’s going on to give you any kind of answer. It will be quick and professional. If you'd prefer to reschedule, we can. But I can’t diagnose a “leakage” over a questionnaire.
PATIENT: Reschedule…? Oh dear. Well… when you put it that way. I suppose I haven't much choice, have I? It's just… undignified. Very undignified. Very well. But do be quick, doctor. And… gentle, if you please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please, lie down on the table. I’ll need to examine the area. I’ll keep it as brief as possible. Just relax.
PATIENT: Very well. It's a bit cold, isn't it? And I’m not accustomed to… lying down. Still… for the sake of proper diagnosis. Do hurry, doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Hmm. Slight tenderness upon palpation of the prostate. No obvious lesions or masses. Urthra appears normal. You have some mild skin irritation in the perineal area, likely from friction. Okay. That's all. Get dressed, please. It’s likely prostatitis – inflammation of the prostate. The leakage is likely related to that, along with the irritation. It's not uncommon at your age.
PATIENT: Prostatitis…? Inflammation? Is it… serious? Will I need… surgery? And what is to be done about this… leakage? It’s simply unacceptable!
DOCTOR: No, not serious serious. It's usually treatable with antibiotics. Surgery is rarely necessary. The leakage should improve as the inflammation goes down. I’ll prescribe you a course of Ciprofloxacin. Take it for ten days, as directed. And drink plenty of fluids. As for preventing it… well, you’re 83, Mr. Krok. These things happen. Here. This prescription. And try to avoid straining. Any questions?
PATIENT: Ciprofloxacin…? Is that… safe? My wife reads all sorts of things about these modern medications. Side effects, you know. And… straining? What do you mean, straining? I run a farm, doctor! A man strains on a farm! This is all very unsatisfactory, you know. Very unsatisfactory indeed.
DOCTOR: It's a standard antibiotic, Mr. Krok. Side effects are rare, but if you experience any severe abdominal pain or diarrhea, stop taking it and contact me. As for straining… yes, I understand you run a farm. Just… take it easy. Don't overexert yourself. Do you have any other questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Very well. I shall… attempt this course of medication. But I hold you personally responsible if I experience any… undesirable effects. And if this… leakage persists, I expect a full refund. Good day, doctor. .
DOCTOR: Unbelievable. Have a good day, sir.
