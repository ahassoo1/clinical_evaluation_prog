DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It's nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Chagaris, you say? Yes… well, it’s this… problem. Down there. It keeps… happening. Again and again. I don’t rightly remember when it started, exactly. Just that it’s… unpleasant. I’m hoping you can fix it, quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I understand. “Down there” can be a sensitive area, and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention. When you say “happening again and again,” could you describe exactly what that means?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… it feels like burning, when I… go to the bathroom. And… a little pain. It’s not terrible, but… it’s bothersome. Very bothersome. And I have to go so often. I don’t remember how long this time… maybe a week? It’s all a bit of a blur, truthfully. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and desire for a quick resolution, Ms. Wease. Burning with urination and frequent trips to the bathroom are certainly bothersome symptoms. It sounds like we need to investigate the cause. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me if you've noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I don’t think so. I haven’t looked, if that makes sense. I try not to. And my back… well, my back always aches a bit. Old age, you know. It’s hard to say if it’s different pain, or just the usual. I really don’t keep track of these things, Doctor. It all feels the same after a while. Are we getting somewhere?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. It’s common for aches and pains to overlap, especially with age. Not looking for blood in the urine is perfectly alright – we can certainly check for that. Let’s try to narrow things down. Besides the burning and frequent urination, have you experienced any fever, chills, or nausea?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… let me think. No, not that I recall. I haven’t felt sick, exactly. Just… irritated. Down there. I haven’t been sick to my stomach, either. No, no fever, no chills. Just the… burning. And the constant need to go. Is this… is this something serious? I’ve had a few of these… episodes over the years. It never seemed to last long before.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease. It’s good to know you haven’t experienced fever, chills, or nausea. Recurrent episodes are important to mention. Given the burning with urination, frequent trips to the bathroom, and the history of similar occurrences, the most likely possibility we need to investigate is a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, because this has happened multiple times, we should rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies, and are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. As for medications… no, nothing regularly. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off it. I occasionally take a pain reliever for my back, but that's it. Just… the usual kind you buy at the store. Is that important? I really don't keep track of these things, you see. It all blurs together.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Wease. No known allergies and only occasional over-the-counter pain relievers is good information. Since this has been happening recurrently, and to rule out other causes, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination and collect a urine sample for testing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical examination? Well… I suppose so. If you must. I’m not fond of doctors poking around, but if it’ll get to the bottom of this quickly, then alright. A urine sample… yes, I can manage that. Though, I’ll need to go to the… facilities first. Where are they? And will this take much longer? I have… appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I completely understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to make the examination as quick and comfortable as possible. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. Take your time. When you’re ready, please collect a midstream urine sample in the cup provided – the nurse will explain if you're unsure how to do that. After that, we can proceed with the examination. It will involve a quick listen to your abdomen and a brief external examination. It shouldn't take too much longer once we have the sample.
PATIENT: Alright. Down the hall… yes. And a midstream sample… I think I remember what that means. Hopefully. Honestly, Doctor, I’m just eager to get this sorted out. All this… talking about it is rather unpleasant. I’ll go now, and try to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask the nurse if you need any assistance with the sample collection. I’ll be here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Here. I think I did it correctly. It was a bit awkward, to be honest. I’m not as nimble as I used to be. Can we get this over with now, please? I’m really not enjoying this.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wease. And no worries at all – it can be a little awkward, and you did just fine. Now, if you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope and briefly palpate your lower abdomen. I'll also check your back quickly. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Alright. But be gentle, please. My back is quite sensitive, you know. And I don't particularly like being poked and prodded. Just get it over with quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, taking some deep breaths for me… Good. Your abdomen sounds normal – no unusual sounds. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. A little bit there. Not terribly painful, but… uncomfortable. It feels a bit… tender. It’s always been a bit sensitive, though. Maybe it’s just my age. Is that bad? Please don’t press too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know, Ms. Wease. That tenderness is good to note. And how about here, in your lower back?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! That’s definitely sensitive. It’s always been sore, but… it feels a bit more tender today. Perhaps I slept in a funny position. Please be careful, Doctor. It’s quite painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Ms. Wease. I understand. Alright. That’s all for the physical examination. It seems there is some tenderness in your lower abdomen and lower back, which could be related to your symptoms, but we need to wait for the urine sample results to be certain. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood pressure and pulse, and then we’ll wait for the lab results. It should be fairly quick – usually around 10-15 minutes.
PATIENT: Ten to fifteen minutes… Very well. I suppose I can wait. As long as it doesn’t take much longer. I have… things to do, you know. What are you looking for in the urine sample, exactly? Is it something serious? Please be honest with me, Doctor. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I understand your concern and will be as honest as possible. We’re primarily looking for the presence of bacteria, white blood cells, and red blood cells in the urine sample. Bacteria would indicate an infection – a urinary tract infection, or UTI, as we discussed. White blood cells suggest your body is fighting an infection, and red blood cells would indicate blood in the urine. While a UTI is often easily treated with antibiotics, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, especially since you’ve experienced similar episodes before. We also want to ensure there isn't anything else going on, like kidney stones or other underlying issues. The most likely scenario is a UTI, but we need the results to confirm. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Kidney stones…? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound pleasant at all. No, I don’t think so. Just… will I need any… shots? Or surgery? I really don’t like either of those things. And how long will I be sick if it is an infection? I have a bridge club meeting next week, and I can’t miss that.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions, Ms. Wease. Kidney stones are less likely, but it's important to consider all possibilities. Regarding shots and surgery, it's highly unlikely you’ll need either of those things at this point. If it is a UTI, it’s usually treated with a course of oral antibiotics – pills you take by mouth. As for how long you’d be sick, if it is a UTI, you should start feeling better within a day or two of starting the antibiotics. The full course typically lasts around three to seven days, and it’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better sooner, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. You should be able to attend your bridge club meeting next week, as long as you start feeling better and don’t have any lingering symptoms. The nurse should be with you shortly to check your blood pressure and pulse. We’ll have the results of the urine sample within 10-15 minutes, and then we can discuss a plan of action. Would you like me to get you a glass of water while we wait?
PATIENT: Water… yes, that would be nice, thank you. I just want this over with, Doctor. I really do. It’s… unsettling, all this talk of infections and stones. Hopefully, it’s just a simple infection, and a few pills will fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Wease. It’s perfectly natural to feel unsettled. We’ll get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible, and hopefully, it will be as simple as a course of antibiotics. Nurse, could you please come in and check Ms. Wease’s blood pressure and pulse?
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. I suppose I’ll just sit here and wait. It’s… quite drafty in here, isn’t it? Hopefully, it won’t be too much longer.
DOCTOR: I'll be just a moment, Ms. Wease. I'll check on the lab results shortly. Just try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright… just hurry up then, please. It’s… awkward, you know, being poked and prodded. I just want this over with. Hopefully, the doctor has good news.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. The results are back. It appears you do have a urinary tract infection, as we suspected. Luckily, it’s a relatively straightforward case, and easily treatable with antibiotics.
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness! An infection… that’s all? I was so worried about stones, or something worse. So, pills then? How many? And will they make me sick? I really can’t afford to be ill.
DOCTOR: Yes, pills it is, Ms. Wease. I’m prescribing you a seven-day course of Nitrofurantoin, 100mg twice a day with food. Nitrofurantoin is generally well-tolerated, but some people experience mild side effects like nausea or diarrhea. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can help minimize these side effects. If you experience any severe side effects, like a rash or difficulty breathing, please contact me immediately. Make sure to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better sooner, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. I also recommend drinking cranberry juice, which can help prevent future infections, but don’t rely on it as a substitute for antibiotics. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Seven days… twice a day… with food… yes, I can manage that. Cranberry juice… alright, I do enjoy a glass of cranberry juice. No rash… no difficulty breathing… alright, good. Will I be contagious? I have a bridge club meeting next week, and I don’t want to get anyone else sick. And can I drink alcohol while I’m taking these pills? My friends and I usually have a glass of wine with our bridge…
DOCTOR: Those are both excellent questions, Ms. Wease. Regarding contagiousness, UTIs are not typically contagious. You can absolutely attend your bridge club meeting without worrying about spreading the infection. As for alcohol, it’s best to avoid drinking alcohol while taking Nitrofurantoin. Alcohol can interact with the medication and potentially worsen side effects. It’s also important to stay hydrated, and alcohol can be dehydrating. I recommend abstaining from alcohol for the duration of your treatment. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. No alcohol… alright, I can manage that for a week. No bridge is worth getting sick. And I won’t have to worry about spreading anything at the meeting. Thank you, Doctor Chagaris. You’ve been very helpful. I feel much better now. I appreciate your patience and explanations. I think I’ll be on my way now, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wease. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms or have any further questions. Get well soon, and enjoy your bridge club meeting next week! .
