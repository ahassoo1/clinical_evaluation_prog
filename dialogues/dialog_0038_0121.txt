DOCTOR: Good morning, Andrew. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit. Don’t like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand. That can be really uncomfortable. Can you tell me a bit more about when this dryness started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Not sure exactly. Maybe a few weeks now? Hard to keep track, you know. Old age. It's just… always feels gritty, like sand. Especially when I’m outside workin’.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, it’s easy to lose track of these things. And yes, that gritty feeling is a very common description. You mentioned working outside – what kind of work do you do, Andrew?
PATIENT: Cement. I work with cement. Concrete. Been doin' it a long time. Masons, they call it. Lots of dust. Sun too. It’s hard work.
DOCTOR: Right, masonry work. Lots of exposure to dust and sun – that definitely could be contributing to the dryness. Do you usually wear any eye protection when you're working with cement?
PATIENT: Eye protection? Sometimes. Not always. I got some glasses, but they get scratched up real quick. And they fog up. It's a pain. Mostly I just try to blink a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Not having proper eye protection and the glasses fogging up… that makes sense. Besides the grit and dryness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… not really. Just… tired, sometimes. But I'm always tired. Old age, like I said. Maybe a little blurry vision when it's real bad, but that could be just my regular glasses needin’ an update.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant other symptoms besides the tiredness and occasional blurry vision. Let’s take a closer look at your eyes. I'm going to do a quick exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Quick is good. I got things to do, you know. Not tryin' to be rude, just… busy. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. This won’t take long. I'm just going to shine a light into your eyes and have you look in different directions. And I'll check the surface of your eyes for any irritation. Okay, your pupils react to light, though a little slowly. And your eyes move in all directions, but it takes a little effort. Your conjunctiva looks a little dry, but nothing majorly concerning at first glance. Do you currently use any eye drops or any other medications at all?
PATIENT: Eye drops? No. Never used 'em. Don't take much medicine, really. Just a little something for my arthritis sometimes. But that's it. Not important right now. It's my hands that bother me, not my eyes. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no eye drops, just something for arthritis. Good to know. And I understand your hands are more of a concern, but we want to address the eye dryness too, just in case it gets worse. I see here you’re uninsured. That’s alright, we can work with that. It just means we'll need to be mindful of cost-effective options. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, it sounds like you likely have dry eye disease, possibly exacerbated by your work environment. It’s common with exposure to dust and sun. Does that sound right to you?
PATIENT: Dry… eye disease? Sounds serious. Dust and sun, you say? That makes sense. I am always out in it. Never thought it was a disease, though. Just… old age. Can it be fixed? I don't wanna go blind.
DOCTOR: It sounds serious because it’s a medical term, but it’s very common, especially as we get older, and often manageable. It's rarely causes blindness. Think of it like this: your eyes aren't making enough lubrication, and the dust and sun are making it worse. We can definitely try to help. The good news is, there are several things we can do. We can start with artificial tears – eye drops that add moisture. I recommend using preservative-free drops, as the preservatives can sometimes cause irritation. We can also talk about ways to protect your eyes at work, like wearing goggles or sunglasses. I'm going to write you a prescription for some artificial tears to start. I also want to recommend you try to wear some tight-fitting goggles when you're working with cement, if possible, to shield your eyes from the dust. We can also discuss a more intensive treatment, like a prescription eye drop to help your eyes produce more tears, if the artificial tears aren’t enough. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Artificial tears… okay. And goggles. Yeah, I can try the goggles. Preservative-free, you say? I’ll remember that. Sounds… reasonable. I don’t want no fancy stuff, just somethin’ to make it stop feelin’ like sand. And as long as it don’t cost too much. Is that all? I got an appointment with the dentist later.
DOCTOR: That's exactly what we're aiming for – to get rid of that gritty feeling. I'll write the prescription for preservative-free artificial tears, and I’ll include a note about the importance of eye protection. This pamphlet has some additional tips and information about managing dry eye. And yes, that’s all for today. We can always follow up in a few weeks to see how the artificial tears are working, and discuss other options if needed. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that's it. Just the drops and the goggles. And don't cost too much, right? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I gotta go now. Dentist waitin'. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Andrew. I’ve written the prescription with cost-effectiveness in mind. You can always ask the pharmacist for the most affordable option. And no worries about the dentist appointment! Get to that, and take care of yourself. It was a pleasure meeting you. If you have any concerns or questions, don’t hesitate to call the clinic.
