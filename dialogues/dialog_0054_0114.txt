DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. I have trouble when I lie flat. It feels like I can’t quite get enough air. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked. I’d like to be quick, if you don’t mind. I have things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. It’s good you came in to get it checked. Trouble breathing is always worth looking into. So, when you say “a little while,” can you give me a sense of how long you’ve been noticing this difficulty when lying flat?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… perhaps three, maybe four months now? It didn't start suddenly, you see. It was gradual. At first, I just noticed I preferred a couple of pillows. Then it got to where a couple wasn’t enough. Now, it’s… well, now it’s quite noticeable. I mostly sleep in my recliner, to be honest. It’s easier that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset over three to four months, progressing to the point where you’re more comfortable in a recliner. That’s helpful to know. Besides sleeping, are you noticing any difficulty breathing with other activities?
PATIENT: Not really. Walking is fine. I do a little gardening, and that’s no trouble at all. I get a little winded sometimes, but that’s just from the work, I think. It’s only when I’m lying down. And it’s not a cough, or a wheeze, or anything like that. Just… shortness of breath. It feels like something is pressing on my chest, maybe? Though I can’t be sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s specifically positional – only when lying flat – and isn't accompanied by cough or wheezing. You describe a sensation of pressure in your chest, which is good to note. Now, let's do a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, which is just an old age thing, I suppose. Nothing serious. Oh! And I was married for forty years, but we divorced ten years ago. Does that count? I have Medicare, if that’s what you mean. I don’t have any other doctors, not regularly. Just the eye doctor every year, and the dentist.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the gallbladder and arthritis. And thank you for sharing about your marriage – that doesn’t directly impact your medical care, but I appreciate you being open. Medicare is helpful to have noted. So, no other ongoing medical conditions besides those?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing else. I used to smoke, a long time ago. Maybe twenty cigarettes a day, for a good twenty years. But I quit… oh, goodness… thirty years ago, at least. I haven't touched one since. And I don't drink, never have. I eat pretty healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables from my garden. I try to stay active, as you know. It's just this breathing. It's worrisome, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of smoking, but you quit thirty years ago – that's excellent. No alcohol use, and you maintain a healthy diet and activity level. That gives us a good foundation. Now, let’s talk about family history. Are there any heart or lung problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father... well, he didn't take care of himself. He smoked and drank, and he passed away young, from a heart attack, I think. That was a long time ago, though. I don't know much about my grandparents, to be honest. They didn't live very long, and we weren't close. Is that helpful? I'm not much for remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Maribeth. A family history of high blood pressure and a father who passed away from a heart attack at a young age – that’s important information. Okay, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s quickly go through allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. No allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully. And as for medications… well, just a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, mostly. Over the counter. And sometimes, when I have a cold, I’ll take something for that. But that’s it. Nothing regularly. I prefer to avoid pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs and do a quick examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Let’s get it over with. I do wish we could hurry this along a bit. I have some tomatoes that need canning this afternoon, and they won’t keep forever. I appreciate you seeing me, Doctor. But time is of the essence, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Maribeth. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. And again… In… and out. Your heart sounds are regular, and I don’t detect any murmurs. However, I do notice some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. And there's a slight wheeze when you exhale. Your chest feels clear to palpation. Now, I'm going to listen to your back as well. Can you lean forward slightly?
PATIENT: Yes, I can lean forward. Diminished breath sounds, you say? What does that mean? Is it serious? I do get a little… congested sometimes, especially when the weather changes. But it usually clears up on its own. I don't want a lot of tests, Doctor. I'm not good with hospitals and machines and all that. Just tell me what's wrong, and what I can do about it. I have things to do, you know. Canning doesn’t wait for anyone.
DOCTOR: The diminished breath sounds, along with the slight wheeze, can suggest some narrowing of the airways. It could be due to a number of things, including past smoking, congestion, or something else. Your chest resonance is normal. I understand your concerns about tests, Maribeth, and we’ll try to minimize them. However, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. It's a quick, non-invasive procedure, and it will help us rule out any underlying conditions, like pneumonia or fluid buildup in the lungs. It’s really the best next step to figure out why you're having trouble breathing. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… honestly. I was hoping to avoid all of that. But… if you think it’s necessary. Is it absolutely essential? I really don’t like being exposed to all that radiation. And it takes time, doesn’t it? I suppose I can try to fit it in, but it will mean delaying the canning. I had a beautiful crop this year. Very well. If you insist. But please, make it as quick as possible. And tell me exactly what I need to do. I get nervous in these places, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Maribeth, and I wouldn't recommend it if it wasn't important. The X-ray will give us valuable information and help us determine the best course of action. It's a very quick procedure – just a few seconds – and the radiation exposure is minimal. I'll have the order sent to the radiology department, and they'll contact you to schedule an appointment. It's usually a walk-in service, so you shouldn't have a long wait. They will explain the procedure to you in detail, but essentially, you’ll stand or sit in front of a machine, and they’ll take a picture of your chest. In the meantime, while we’re waiting for the X-ray results, I recommend you continue to avoid lying flat as much as possible. If you have any worsening symptoms – increased shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, or cough – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… get it over with. I need to get home. I’ve already wasted a good part of the afternoon. Tell me when I’ll get the results. And if it’s something serious… well, I don’t want a lot of fuss. I’m an old woman, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life. Thank you for seeing me. I appreciate it. But I really must be going. Canning waits for no one, you know. .
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Maribeth. The radiology department will contact you directly to schedule the X-ray, and they'll let you know when the results are available. We'll review them together as soon as they come in. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Thank you for coming in today. I hope you have a productive canning season. .
