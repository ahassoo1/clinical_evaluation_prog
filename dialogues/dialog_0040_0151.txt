DOCTOR: Right, Teretha Uzarski. 63. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Osga, is it? Yes, well, it’s my hands, mostly. They’ve been… tingling. Like pins and needles, you know? It's been going on for a little while now. Not awful, but… annoying. I just want to know what’s causing it, if you can figure it out.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tingling, you say. “A little while now…” Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… Well, let me think. It started… maybe three months ago? Around May, I guess. It comes and goes. Some days it’s hardly there, and other days… well, like this morning, it was pretty noticeable while I was sorting the mail. It’s both hands, but the left one feels it more, usually. Does that make sense? I don't keep track of dates very well, sorry.
DOCTOR: Three months… right. And it's worse in the left hand. Any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It's just… uncomfortable. Like when your foot falls asleep, but in my hands. No sharp pain, no aching, just… that tingling. And sometimes, my fingers feel a little clumsy, like I can’t quite grip things right. Not often, though. It’s mostly the tingling. I just worry about it, you know? Being a mail carrier, I need my hands.
DOCTOR: A mail carrier, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Been doing it for… oh, goodness, almost 30 years now. Out on the route, rain or shine. It keeps me busy, anyway. After my husband… well, it’s something to do. But like I said, I need my hands for it! It's a lot of sorting, and delivering, and holding keys…you get the picture. Is that…is that important? Does it have something to do with the tingling?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, repetitive motions can sometimes cause issues. Let’s have a look at your hands. Just…extend your arms, palms up. And try to relax, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Palms up. Relax… easier said than done when you're worried, but I'll try. Is it something bad, Doctor? I hope it's not something that will make me stop working. I really don't want to stop working.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Reflexes seem…normal. Some slight…tenderness along the carpal tunnel on both sides, but it’s not significant. Grip strength appears adequate. Do you have any history of diabetes or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Diabetes… no, not that I know of. My husband, he had a little trouble with his blood sugar towards the end, but not me. And thyroid… I don't think so. I had my gallbladder out years ago, and some trouble with my knees, but nothing else major. The doctor always checked my blood pressure when I went in for check-ups. Would that have shown something? I go to Dr. Henderson, he's a good man. I just haven't seen him in a while, things have been busy. .
DOCTOR: Blood pressure wouldn’t necessarily show those things. Alright. It could be carpal tunnel syndrome. It’s common with repetitive hand use. We can try some bracing and exercises first. If that doesn’t help, we can discuss further testing. I’ll write you a prescription for wrist braces to wear at night.
