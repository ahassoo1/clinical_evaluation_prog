DOCTOR: Hello Tierney, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be quite frank, I came in because I’d like to get tested for HIV. I just… I want to know my status, for peace of mind, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very sensible, Tierney. Knowing your status is important. And you’re very welcome here. It takes courage to come in and ask for these kinds of tests, so thank you for coming in. Before we proceed with the testing, could you tell me a little bit about what’s prompted this desire to get tested now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. Well… it’s a bit difficult to talk about, to be honest. My husband and I… we haven’t been entirely faithful to each other over the years. It’s been a long marriage, and things… happened. I just want to be sure. For both of us. It’s been weighing on my mind, and I think it’s better to know, one way or the other.
DOCTOR: I understand, Tierney. That's a very honest answer, and you're right to want to address this. It's good you're taking this step for your peace of mind, and for your husband’s as well. To give you the most accurate information, I'm going to ask a few questions, if that’s alright. This will help me understand your risk factors a little better. We'll start with some general health history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Ask away. Let me see… I do have a bit of high blood pressure, I was diagnosed about five years ago. I take medication for it, usually keeps it under control. Other than that, I’m fairly healthy, I think. I’ve always been quite active, even now. I enjoy gardening, mostly. And walking. Nothing serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the high blood pressure and that you’re generally active—that's wonderful. And that you're on medication for it. Do you know what medication you're taking for your blood pressure, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Let me think… it's Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. My husband reminds me, mostly, as my memory isn’t what it used to be. But I’ve been taking it regularly, as prescribed.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Tierney. And don’t worry about the memory lapses, it happens to all of us! Lisinopril is a common medication, and 20 milligrams is a standard dose. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, maybe seven or eight years old. And I was in the hospital for a few days when I gave birth to my son, but that was… oh, goodness, over forty years ago now. Other than that, no major surgeries or hospital stays, thankfully. Just the usual things, colds, flu, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and delivery, that's good to know. Now, just to be thorough, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I've never had a reaction to anything. My husband jokes that I can eat anything and everything, but I haven’t really tested that theory. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing… nothing like that, ever. I think I’d remember something like that, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You absolutely would. No known allergies is good. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: No, just the Lisinopril. I used to take something for my joints, years ago, but I stopped taking that a while back. It didn’t seem to be helping much, and my husband was worried about the side effects. So, just the blood pressure medication now. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Just Lisinopril. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a bit of a complicated question, Doctor. My mother… she had high blood pressure, like me. And she died of a stroke, I think it was. My father, he had diabetes, and he lost a leg because of it. And my brother… he had some kind of cancer, lung cancer, I believe, but he passed away quite a few years ago now. My son is healthy, thankfully. As far as I know, anyway. It’s not a very cheerful history, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Tierney. It's helpful to know, and I understand it's not a cheerful history. It sounds like there's a family predisposition to some health issues. Knowing this helps us to be more attentive to potential risks. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle… do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I've never smoked a day in my life. My husband used to smoke, years ago, but he gave it up a long time ago. I always hated the smell of it. And I always encouraged him to quit, which thankfully he did. It's a nasty habit, really.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Tierney. Avoiding smoking is very important for your health, and good on your husband for quitting. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just occasionally, Doctor. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a small sherry on special occasions. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I wouldn’t say I’m a drinker, not at all. My husband enjoys a beer now and then, but he doesn’t overdo it either. We both prefer a nice cup of tea, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That sounds very sensible, Tierney. Moderate alcohol consumption is generally fine. Now, I’m going to ask a bit about your current situation, if you don't mind. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, not recently, Doctor. I had a little cold a couple of months ago, but it was very mild and didn't last long. Nothing serious at all. Just a sniffle and a sore throat. I took some over-the-counter medication and it cleared up quickly. I'm generally quite healthy, as I said before. I haven't been feeling unwell at all, which is why I'm a little surprised at myself for wanting to get tested, really. It's just… a precaution.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Tierney. It’s always good to be proactive about your health, even if you’re feeling well. And it sounds like you’ve been quite diligent about taking care of yourself. Now, before we proceed with the testing, I just want to ask one more question. Have you had any unprotected sex recently?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question to answer, Doctor. As I mentioned before, my husband and I… haven’t always been faithful to each other. It’s been… complicated. There have been instances, yes. It’s not something we’re proud of, and it’s caused a lot of pain, but… it’s the truth. It’s one of the reasons I wanted to get tested, to be honest. To know where we stand, and to protect each other.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your honesty, Tierney. It takes courage to share that, and I appreciate it. Knowing this helps me to understand your risk factors and provide you with the best possible care. Okay, given your history, getting tested for HIV is a very sensible decision. We'll also test for other sexually transmitted infections, just to be thorough. The test itself is a simple blood draw. I’ll explain the procedure, and then we can proceed. Do you have any questions for me before we go ahead?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. A blood draw is… well, it’s not pleasant, but I can manage. I’m just… a little nervous, I suppose. But I’m glad I came. And I appreciate your kindness and understanding. You’ve made me feel much more comfortable. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Tierney. You're very welcome. I understand your nervousness, and I’ll do everything I can to make the process as comfortable as possible. Okay, let’s go ahead. I’ll have my nurse come in and draw your blood. It will only take a few minutes. And remember, testing positive doesn't define you, and there are treatments available if needed. But regardless of the results, we'll be here to support you every step of the way.
