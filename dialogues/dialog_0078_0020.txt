DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It's good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is Solero, yes? It is nice to meet you too. I am here for… the talk on the computer. The telehealth, you call it. My back… it is not so good lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, Solero is correct. And it’s very nice to meet you as well. You mentioned a telehealth appointment and back pain. So, this pain… when did it start, and what’s it like?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It started… maybe three months ago? Slowly, you know? Not a big pain at first. Now… it is more. It is… a dull ache, mostly. When I bend over, or lift things… then it is sharp. Like a little… zing. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Ms. Benites. A dull ache that sharpens with bending or lifting – that gives me a good starting point. And where exactly on your back are you feeling this pain?
PATIENT: It is… low. Here. Not in the middle, more to the side. The left side, I think. It is hard to tell exactly. It feels… wide, you know? Not just one spot.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, mostly on the left side, and a somewhat widespread ache. Has anything specific made it worse – any particular activities, or did it just start gradually?
PATIENT: Hmm… I work with cars, you know? Mechanic. Lots of bending, lifting… heavy parts. I think that is it. I try to be careful, but… sometimes you just have to lift. And I used to garden, but not so much this year. Maybe that too? Not moving so much. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: That certainly sounds like it could be contributing factors, Ms. Benites. Lifting heavy objects at work and a decrease in activity can both play a role in back pain. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain at all and ten being the worst pain you've ever felt, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. Right now? It is not so bad. Maybe… a four? When I sit for too long, it gets worse. But right now, just sitting here… four. Sometimes it goes to a six or seven when I am working. Then it is very hard to stand up straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, a four currently, increasing to six or seven with activity. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiating…? You mean… going down? Sometimes… a little tingling in my foot. The left foot, like the back. Not much pain, just… a funny feeling. Like pins and needles, you know? But not always.
DOCTOR: Yes, “radiating” means going down your leg. That tingling sensation in your left foot is good information. Now, have you experienced any weakness in your legs, or any difficulty with bladder or bowel control?
PATIENT: Weakness… no. I can walk okay. I can climb stairs. Bowel… no problems there. Bladder… no. Everything is… normal. I hope that is not a silly question to ask? It feels… personal.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Benites. Those are very important questions to ask when evaluating back pain, and you’re right to ask if they feel personal – it’s important we cover everything. Okay. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I had… high blood pressure, a long time ago. But the doctor said it is okay now, with the pills. And… my hip. I had a replacement, maybe ten years ago? That is all, I think. Nothing else. Oh! And I have Medicare. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, your Medicare is important, thank you for letting me know. And the high blood pressure, managed with medication, and the hip replacement are very helpful to know. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes, for the pain. When it is very bad. The doctor gave me something… a white pill. I don't remember the name. It helps, but I try not to take it too much. It makes me… sleepy. And a little… confused.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a medication for pain, as needed, a white pill that makes you sleepy and confused. We'll try to figure out exactly what that is later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I eat everything. I work outside, with the cars, so I am around… everything. Pollen, dust… never had a problem. I think I am a strong person. Not much bothers me.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Benites. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had arthritis, in her hands. Very bad. She could not… knit anymore. And my father… he had a bad back too, when he was older. He worked on a farm. Lots of lifting. That is all I remember, really. We didn’t talk about it much. They are… gone now, both of them.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your parents, Ms. Benites. Family history of arthritis and back problems is helpful to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Could you please lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Is this okay? I am not very flexible anymore.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, that's perfectly alright. Just let me know if anything is uncomfortable. Okay, I'm just feeling along your spine here. Does this hurt anywhere specifically?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! Right there. That is… tender. It is not a sharp pain, but… it is not good. It is… achy. And a little… warm? Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the left side of your lower back. And you feel warmth there as well. Alright, now could you please gently bend forward towards your knees?
PATIENT: Ooh… that is… hard. It hurts. I can’t go very far. It feels… tight. Like something is… stuck. And I can feel the pain going down my leg a little now. Not bad, but… there. Is that okay? I don't want to push it too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion and some pain radiating down your leg with forward bending. That’s helpful information. Alright, Ms. Benites, could you stand up for me and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Okay… I am walking. It is… not so easy. It feels… strange. Like I am… careful. I don’t want to fall. Is that okay? I am not walking very straight, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see a slight antalgic gait - you're favoring your left side when you walk, which is understandable given the pain. Alright, Ms. Benites, thank you. Now, based on everything you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing lower back pain, likely a muscle strain or sprain, possibly aggravated by your work and decreased activity. The tingling in your leg is something we need to monitor. It could be related to irritation of a nerve. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A strain…? Like… pulled a muscle? Is it… serious? Will I need… surgery? I need to work, you know? I can’t be down for long. And the tingling… is that the nerve, yes? Is it dangerous? I am a little scared.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Benites. Most likely, it is a muscle strain, and thankfully, most strains don't require surgery. The vast majority of people improve with conservative treatment – things like rest, physical therapy, and pain management. We'll start with that. The tingling is what we call radiculopathy - meaning nerve irritation. It’s not necessarily dangerous, but we want to keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn't worsen. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any fractures or other structural problems. Then, I’d like to start you on a course of physical therapy. And we’ll discuss some medication options for pain relief. How does that sound?
PATIENT: X-ray… okay. That is… good to check. Physical therapy… I don’t know. I am not very good at… exercises. But I will try. And medicine… not too much, please? I don’t want to be sleepy. So… no surgery? For now? That is… good. I am very relieved. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's right, Ms. Benites, for now, surgery is not indicated. We'll try the less invasive options first, and see how you respond. We can start with a mild pain reliever, like ibuprofen or naproxen, and if that isn't enough, we can explore other options. And the physical therapist will work with you to create a program tailored to your needs and abilities. It’s all about finding what works for you. Now, let's get that X-ray ordered. We can do it right here in the clinic, and then we’ll schedule an appointment with physical therapy. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that is… okay. X-ray, then therapy. And not too much medicine. Thank you, Doctor Solero. You have been very… kind. I am a little scared about the X-ray, but… I will do it. Just let me know when.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. It’s perfectly normal to be a little scared about the X-ray, but it's a quick and painless procedure. Alright, I’ll have the technician come in to get you set up. It should only take a few minutes. After that, my nurse will schedule your physical therapy appointment and discuss the pain medication options with you. Do you have any work restrictions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Work restrictions… hmm. I need to lift things, you know? Cars… parts. But… maybe I can take it easier? Avoid the heavy stuff? I don't know. My boss… he is not very understanding. Maybe just… shorter days? If that is possible. I don't want to lose my job.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Benites. We can write a note for your employer recommending light duty work, avoiding heavy lifting, and potentially shorter days for a week or two while you recover. We can also discuss what accommodations might be reasonable given your condition. The goal is to get you back to work safely and sustainably. Would you like me to prepare a work note specifying those recommendations?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. A note… saying light duty, no heavy lifting. That would be good. Thank you, Doctor. You are very… kind. I appreciate it. I am a little less scared now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. Here’s the work note. My nurse will review everything with you before you leave, including the X-ray results when they become available and information about managing your pain. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that is… all. Thank you, Doctor Solero. You have been very helpful. I will see you… when the X-ray is ready? .
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. We’ll have my nurse contact you when the X-ray results are available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Ms. Benites, and please try to get some rest.
