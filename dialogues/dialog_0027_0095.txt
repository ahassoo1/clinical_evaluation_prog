DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I wish I didn't have to be here. It’s…well, it’s rather obvious, isn’t it? I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear. And half my face feels like it's drooping. It’s quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does sound concerning. Not being able to hear and facial drooping… hmm. Okay. To get a better understanding, can you tell me exactly when you first noticed this?
PATIENT: This morning. I told you. Around…let me see…7:15, I suppose. I was making my tea and realized I couldn’t hear the kettle. Then when I looked in the mirror…well, you can see it. Really, is this going to take long? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re busy, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. It's important to figure out what's going on, though. 7:15 this morning… and this happened suddenly?
PATIENT: Yes, suddenly. I didn’t bump my head or anything. I just…woke up like this. It's not like it gradually got worse, if that's what you're implying. Honestly, I don’t appreciate being asked such…basic questions. It's rather insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem basic, Stephane. It's standard procedure to rule out certain possibilities. Sudden onset is important information, you're right. Okay. And have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Really? I have half a face paralyzed and can’t hear! What more do you want? Let me think... No, no dizziness, no headache. Just…this mess. And a terrible waste of my time, frankly. I do hope you know what you’re doing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. I want to check your reflexes and do a quick neurological assessment. Then we can discuss next steps. It's important to assess the extent of this quickly. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. But I warn you, I'm not very patient. And I really don’t want anything poked or prodded unnecessarily. I have a very low tolerance for discomfort, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let me just take a look in your ears… then we’ll do a few quick tests of your facial movement and strength. Okay?
PATIENT: Honestly, I doubt it's my ears. I clean them regularly. But do what you must. Just…be quick about it. And try not to make a mess. I dislike feeling things in my ears. It's rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ears look clear, no obvious signs of infection or blockage. Now, I'm going to ask you to smile for me. And then, try to close your eyes tightly. Hmm. Alright. And can you raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It’s…not exactly easy, you know. This side……won’t cooperate. I told you, it’s drooping. Is this going to require some sort of…invasive procedure? I really don’t do well with needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension. It appears there is weakness on the left side of your face. This is consistent with what we call Bell’s Palsy, though we need to rule out other possibilities. I want to check your blood pressure and pulse, and then we’ll discuss some imaging to get a clearer picture. It's important to rule out anything more serious like a stroke. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Stroke? Are you implying I’ve had a stroke? I feel perfectly fine, apart from the obvious! I'm a radiologist, I know my body. Imaging? Fine. But I'm warning you, if this is just going to be a lot of fuss over nothing, I'll be very displeased. And I have a very important conference next week. I can’t afford to be laid up. Just…get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Stephane. As a physician, it's my responsibility to investigate all possibilities, and rule out anything serious. We'll proceed as quickly and efficiently as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse, then we can discuss the imaging options. It will likely be a CT scan or MRI.
PATIENT: Fine. But I expect a full explanation of the risks, and a very quick turnaround time. I don't have all day to sit around waiting for results. And don't tell me it will be 'routine'. I'm a professional, I understand medical jargon. Just be direct.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within normal limits. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, regarding the imaging, a CT scan would be quick and readily available. It's good for ruling out stroke or other structural issues. There is a small amount of radiation involved, though it's a standard dose. An MRI is more detailed, but takes longer and may not be as readily available. It doesn't involve radiation. Given your conference, a CT scan may be the most practical option. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… I vaguely recall a reaction once, years ago. A slight rash. Nothing serious. But I don't particularly want anything injected into me. Honestly, this is all becoming rather inconvenient. Just… do the CT scan, I suppose. The sooner this is over, the better. But if I experience any adverse effects, I expect immediate attention. And a full refund, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll proceed with the CT scan, and we will take extra precautions due to your previous reaction. We’ll have emergency medication available, and I’ll monitor you closely afterwards. I'll order it now, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule the scan. It should be within the next hour or two. While we wait, I'll also start documenting my findings so far - sudden onset facial weakness, difficulty closing left eye, decreased muscle tone on the left side of the face, normal blood pressure and pulse… Do you have any known allergies apart from the previous reaction to contrast dye?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Honestly, you're asking a lot of questions. Is there anything else you need to know? Perhaps my favorite color? This is ridiculous. Just get the scan ordered, please. I have more important things to worry about than documenting my 'findings'. And I do hope this won't interfere with my tee time tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Alright, the CT scan is ordered, and I’ve noted your concerns about your tee time. The radiology department will contact you shortly. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a course of oral steroids to reduce inflammation. It may help speed up recovery, even before we have the results of the scan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Steroids? Really? Are you sure that's necessary? I don't take medication unless absolutely unavoidable. What are the side effects? Honestly, this is becoming increasingly concerning. I'm a radiologist, I understand the risks of prolonged steroid use. Are there any alternatives? I really would prefer to avoid them if possible. Just tell me what the scan will show. Is it something terrible?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Stephane. The steroids are often prescribed in cases of suspected Bell's Palsy, even before a definitive diagnosis, as they can reduce inflammation around the facial nerve. The typical side effects are mild – increased appetite, temporary fluid retention, and possible mood changes. The risks of long-term use are minimal with a short course like the one I’m prescribing. The scan will help us rule out other, more serious causes of your facial weakness, like a stroke, tumor, or infection. It’s unlikely to be anything terrible, but it’s important to be thorough. We need to know the cause to ensure you get the appropriate treatment. Is there a family history of neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological conditions? No. Not that I recall. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… well, he was a lawyer, so he had stress. That’s hardly a neurological condition. Honestly, this is all very frustrating. I'm a radiologist, I can practically diagnose myself. I just want to know when I can expect the results of this scan, and whether it will interfere with my tee time tomorrow. And I expect a detailed report, not just vague medical jargon. Now, are we finished here? I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright. The radiology department should contact you within the hour to schedule the scan. They’ll be able to give you a more precise timeframe for the results. Given your conference and tee time, I’ll ask them to expedite the report as much as possible. I’ll also personally review it and will contact you directly with the findings, explained in detail. I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your expertise. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Just…get the scan done quickly. And don’t waste my time with unnecessary procedures. I’ll expect a call with the results as soon as they’re available. And frankly, I expect a discount on the bill. This has been… highly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll do our best to accommodate your needs. Have a good day, Stephane. And we’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. .
