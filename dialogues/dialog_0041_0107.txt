DOCTOR: Hi Philipp, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my heart, it feels… funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but it happens. It’s… hard to explain. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month?
DOCTOR: Okay, "flapping" is a good way to describe it. And about a month, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer. Not every day, though. Some days I don’t feel it at all. And it doesn’t last long when it does happen. Just… a few seconds, maybe? I don't know exactly. It's… not painful, just… weird.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a few seconds at a time, and it's not painful, just a strange sensation. Does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. I haven't noticed anything. I work, you know, with the machines… the chemical stuff. It happens at work sometimes, and at home when I’m relaxing. So… I don’t think it’s anything I do. My wife hasn’t noticed me doing anything different when it starts.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn't seem linked to activity or a specific situation. And your wife hasn’t observed any patterns either. Do you feel anything else when this happens?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe a little… tired after, but I always feel a little tired. It’s hard to say if it’s from the heart thing or just… life. I don’t get dizzy or anything. No chest pain, just the flapping. It's… kind of scary when it happens, but it goes away.
DOCTOR: Alright, no dizziness or chest pain, just the sensation and maybe a little fatigue afterward. I understand it can be unsettling. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health, if you don't mind. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m usually healthy. I work hard, I eat okay… nothing special. No doctor visits for a long time. Just… the usual colds sometimes. My wife always tells me I need to go to the doctor more. She's probably right. I don't have insurance, so… I try to stay away if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, usually healthy, no chronic conditions. I understand your concern about insurance. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital. Nothing like that. Just… bumps and bruises from work sometimes. Nothing serious. I’m a careful worker. Most of the time. My wife says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family who has had heart problems, or any similar symptoms to what you’re describing?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had… something with his heart when he was old. I don’t remember exactly what. He lived in Yemen, so… it was hard to get good doctors. He just… got slow, and then he passed away. Not from the heart, my wife thinks it was something else. No one else, I don't think. My mother was healthy, and my brothers are okay. They live far away, so I don't know much about their health.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father had some heart issues when he was older, but details are limited. And your mother and brothers seem healthy. Let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. And I don’t drink alcohol. It’s not allowed in my religion, really. And no drugs, no. I just drink tea, lots of tea. And coffee sometimes, when I’m working late. My wife makes very strong coffee! She likes to keep me awake.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs, just tea and coffee. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Nothing. I try to avoid them if I can. I take vitamins sometimes, when I remember, but that’s it. Just… the usual. My wife buys them, but I forget to take them half the time. She says I’m hopeless.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me, Philipp. And another one… Good. Hmm. Your heart rate is a little fast, around 90 beats per minute. And I hear a slight irregularity, a little uneven rhythm. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated. Your pulse is a bit weak, but regular otherwise. No swelling in your legs. Okay. It sounds like we need to investigate this a little further.
PATIENT: Okay… irregular, you said? That sounds… bad? My wife is going to be worried. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I hope it’s not something… expensive to fix.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Philipp, but it's definitely something we need to look into. An irregular rhythm can have many causes, some are very benign and some require treatment. We need to figure out why it's happening. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG. It's a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't hurt, and it takes just a few minutes. We should also do some blood work to check your thyroid levels and rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. An EKG and blood work… I can do that. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. But… how much will it cost? I really don’t have much money. And I don't have insurance, like I said. I hope it's not too expensive. My wife works very hard, and… we’re just trying to get by.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Philipp. It’s important to me that you get the care you need. Let me see what the costs are for the EKG and blood work at this clinic. Okay, the EKG will be around $150, and the blood work will be about $200. I can also see if there are any local programs that can help with the cost, or if we can work out a payment plan. In the meantime, I also want to be thorough. Given your symptoms and the irregularity, I think it would be best to rule out anything serious. Would you be open to a referral to a cardiologist for a more in-depth evaluation?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… that sounds… expensive. Is it really necessary, Doctor? Can’t we just do the tests first? I'm worried about the cost. My wife… she's already stressed about things. I don't want to make things worse. Maybe we can see what the tests say first, and then decide about the cardiologist?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and I understand your concern. Let's do the EKG and blood work first. That will give us a lot of valuable information. I'll get the orders printed for you now. And I promise, we'll discuss the results thoroughly before making any decisions about a referral. If the tests show something concerning, then a cardiologist consultation would be the most prudent course of action, but we can definitely hold off for now. Here are the orders. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you right away. Do you have any questions about where to go or how to prepare for the tests?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Down the hall… I can find it. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything, and not just… ordering expensive tests right away. I'll go do the tests now. And then… we'll see what happens. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Philipp. I'm glad I could help. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions while you're at the lab. We'll talk again soon. Stop by the nurses station when you are done, and they can schedule a follow up appointment with me to discuss the results.
PATIENT: Okay, I will. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll see you soon.
