DOCTOR: Hi Airam, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. It’s… something about learning, right? My husband said I should come. He said I need… information. I don’t really remember what information. Just… general stuff, I think? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It can be a little overwhelming to remember everything. It sounds like your husband is concerned about some changes he's noticed, and wants to make sure you're doing okay. We can definitely figure things out together. I see here you’re 33 years old. And just to confirm, is your name Airam Fontanazza?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Thirty-three… feels older, honestly. And yes, Fontanazza. It’s a… complicated name. People always get it wrong. But yes, that’s right. What kind of changes did my husband say? He doesn’t tell me anything directly, you know. Just… sighs a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for family members to notice things before we do ourselves, or to have a hard time explaining what they've seen. And it's totally normal to feel a little… off sometimes. So, let's start with you. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've been experiencing lately?
PATIENT: Experiencing? Like… what kind of things? I work. Sheet metal. It’s… loud. And dusty. I come home, I eat, I sleep. Sometimes I forget where I put my glasses. Is that what you mean? It's not like anything big has happened. Honestly, I think my husband just worries too much. He always has.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Forgetting where you put your glasses happens to everyone! But we want to make sure there isn’t anything else going on. Let's try to get a bit more specific. When you say you work, eat, and sleep… have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy levels? I’m always tired. But, like… work tired. Sheet metal is hard work. It’s not like I’m supposed to be bouncing off the walls, right? I drink a lot of coffee. Does that count? My husband says I drink too much coffee. He says everything I do is “too much.”
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistently tired, even after a full night's sleep, and relying on coffee to get through the day. That’s good information. And it sounds like your husband is noticing a pattern as well. Have you noticed any changes in your memory besides misplacing your glasses?
PATIENT: Memory… Sometimes… I forget what I was saying mid-sentence. Or… names. Like, I know I know them, but they just… disappear. It's embarrassing. It happens more now, I think. My husband gets annoyed when I ask him to repeat things. He says I just asked him five minutes ago. He's very good with names, always has been. It’s probably nothing. Just getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some difficulty with recalling recent conversations or names. That’s definitely something we should explore a little further. It's good that you're noticing these things, and it's completely normal to be concerned. Let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Mood… I get… frustrated. A lot. Especially at work. Everything takes so long, and people don’t listen. My husband says I’m “short-tempered.” He says I used to be more… patient. I don’t know. Appetite? I eat. I don’t really pay attention. Whatever’s quickest. Usually something fried. I like fried things. Is this important? It sounds like you're trying to find something wrong with me.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound like I’m trying to find something wrong with you at all, Airam. I'm simply trying to get a complete picture of what you’re experiencing so we can figure out what’s going on and if any support would be helpful. And yes, changes in mood and appetite can be important clues. Okay. Let’s switch gears a bit. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. I mean, I get headaches sometimes. Stress headaches, probably. From work. And… my back hurts. Lifting metal all day. My husband keeps telling me I should see a chiropractor, but… I don’t like doctors. Never have, never will. Is this going to be a long appointment? I have to get home and make dinner. My husband likes it on time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so headaches and back pain related to your work. That’s good to know. And I understand your hesitation about doctors; a lot of people feel that way. We’ll try to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I’m… too scared. My mother always said hospitals are full of germs. And… bad luck. No, never had surgery. Not even… tonsils or anything. I’ve been very lucky, I think. Aside from the headaches and the back pain, of course. This is making me anxious. Can we just… skip this part?
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s good to know. And I completely understand that this is making you anxious, Airam. We can definitely slow down or skip parts if you're not comfortable. It’s your appointment, and I want you to feel safe and respected. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Like… touching me? No. No, I don’t think so. I really don’t like being touched. My husband will be upset if I’m late, and this is making me very uncomfortable. Can’t you just… tell me what’s wrong without all this? Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. I completely respect your boundaries, and I understand that you're uncomfortable. We absolutely do not need to do a physical exam if you don't want to. It is a little more difficult to get a complete picture without one, but we can certainly proceed without it. To help me understand what's going on, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had memory problems, or any neurological conditions like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease?
PATIENT: Family history… Not that I know of. My mother didn’t talk about things. She was… difficult. My father, he died young. From… working too hard, I think. He was a fisherman. We didn’t really have family gatherings or anything. No one talked about illnesses. It's probably nothing. Just… getting old. Like you said. It's just… frustrating. Can I go home now? My husband is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited knowledge of family medical history. That’s alright; we can still work with that. It sounds like you're feeling very stressed and frustrated, and that’s completely understandable. Given your concerns about memory changes, fatigue, irritability, and your discomfort with a physical exam, I think it would be best to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical causes for these symptoms. This will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We can also discuss some lifestyle changes that might help manage your stress and improve your energy levels. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Needles? I don’t like needles. At all. My husband says I faint at the sight of them. I don’t know… Can’t you just give me something for the headaches? Or… some pills to help me sleep? I really don’t want to do any tests. This is too much. Please? Can we just skip the tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. It sounds like you're feeling very overwhelmed right now, and I completely understand your anxiety about needles and tests. We absolutely do not have to do anything you’re not comfortable with. Given your strong aversion to needles, and your anxiety about this process, I’m going to respect your wishes and we won’t do any blood tests at this time. However, it's important to address your concerns. Since we aren't able to rule out any underlying medical conditions with testing, I would recommend a referral to a neurologist. They are specialists in the brain and nervous system and can further evaluate your memory concerns and recommend appropriate treatment. Would you be open to a referral to a neurologist?
PATIENT: A… neurologist? Is that another doctor? More appointments? My husband will be furious. He says I see too many doctors already. I don’t know… I really just want to go home. I’m tired. And anxious. And I don’t want to see another doctor. Is there… anything else I can do? Like… a pill? For the headaches and the forgetting? Just something to make it stop? Please? Can we just try a pill first? Before another appointment? .
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed and just want some relief. I respect your wishes and we can explore medication options for your headaches and memory concerns. However, I do want to be very clear: Without knowing the underlying cause of your symptoms, it’s difficult to prescribe the most appropriate medication. And, it's important to note that medication often addresses symptoms only and doesn’t resolve the underlying issue. Given your reluctance to see a specialist at this time, I can prescribe a mild medication to help with your headaches. We can also discuss some non-medication strategies, like stress reduction techniques and improving your sleep hygiene, to help manage your overall well-being. Would you like to try that approach?
