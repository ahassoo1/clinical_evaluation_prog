DOCTOR: Hi Courtnye, welcome. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s… well, I’ve been bruising a lot easier lately. Like, just bumping into stuff and getting these big purple marks. It’s kinda worrying me, ‘cause I’m already on blood thinners, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising easily, and you’re already on blood thinners – that is something we should look into. Just to be clear, when you say “lately,” how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably about six weeks ago, I’d say? Maybe a little longer. It wasn’t instant, it just kinda… gradually got worse. At first I thought I was just being clumsy, but it’s happening too often now.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, gradually worsening… alright. And are these bruises in usual spots – like your arms and legs – or are you noticing them in places you wouldn’t normally expect?
PATIENT: Mostly my arms, actually. And my hands. I bumped my hand on the counter the other day, nothing hard, and got a bruise the size of my palm. That’s when I really started to worry. I haven’t noticed any on my legs, though. Not yet, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, arms and hands, no leg bruising so far. And you said you’re already on blood thinners – can you tell me which one, and what it’s for?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s… Warfarin, I think? Yes, Warfarin. And it's for… atrial fibrillation. AFib, the doctor calls it. Keeps the blood clots away, you know? Been on it for… about five years now, I guess. It’s been mostly fine, until recently.
DOCTOR: Five years of Warfarin for AFib, and now increased bruising… Right. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… Hmm. Not really. I haven’t felt extra tired, or anything like that. No nosebleeds, no bleeding gums, nothing like that. Just the bruises. And they seem to last longer than they used to. Like, a normal bump used to give me a bruise for a few days, now it's a week or more.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other bleeding symptoms, just the increased bruising and longer duration. Have you had your INR checked recently?
PATIENT: INR? Oh, you mean the blood test? Yes! I had it done… let me see… about two weeks ago. It was… within range, the doctor said. She didn’t say anything was wrong, but that was before I started bruising like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, INR was within range two weeks ago, but bruising has increased since then. Do you remember what your INR number was at that time?
PATIENT: Ugh, numbers… I’m terrible with numbers. No, I don’t remember. She just said it was good, you know? Like, within the normal range for me. I don’t usually ask for the actual number, I just trust what she tells me. Sorry! Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It’s perfectly fine to trust your doctor, and you don’t need to remember specific numbers. We just want to get a full picture. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Can I take a look at your arms and hands, and maybe do a quick check of your other vitals?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the bruising you mentioned. There's some variability in color, which suggests they are at different stages, as you’d expect. I don’t feel any significant swelling or tenderness with palpation, which is good. Your pulses are strong and regular in all extremities. Blood pressure is 130/80, and your heart rate is 72. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear.
PATIENT: Okay. That… sounds good, I guess? Is anything… wrong? What do you think is causing this? I’m kinda worried.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Courtnye. The physical exam didn't reveal anything immediately concerning, but the increased bruising with a stable INR is something we need to investigate further. There are a few possibilities. It could be a temporary fluctuation in your INR we didn’t catch, even within the ‘normal’ range for you. It could be something else affecting your clotting, or rarely, it could indicate another underlying condition. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count to check your platelet count and look for any signs of infection, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to evaluate your liver and kidney function. We’ll also repeat your INR just to be sure. Do you have any known allergies to blood draw?
PATIENT: No allergies to blood draws, thankfully. That sounds… good. Whatever tests you think are best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good you don’t have any allergies. And it's perfectly normal to be concerned, Courtnye. While it could be something serious, it’s also likely to be something relatively minor. We’re just being thorough. I’ll get the lab orders sent over now. The phlebotomist will call you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause injury and let me know immediately if you notice any new or unusual bleeding, like nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your stool or urine, or any severe headaches. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. I will definitely be careful, and I'll let you know right away if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. That’s what I’m here for. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
