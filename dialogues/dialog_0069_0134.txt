DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well... it's been a bit of a bother, really. I just... I don't seem to be able to keep much food down these days. And I get full so quickly. It's... unsettling. I don't remember when it started exactly, just… gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. That is unsettling, and I'm glad you came in to get it checked out. So, you're experiencing difficulty keeping food down, and a feeling of fullness very quickly. And this has been happening gradually, without a clear start date?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Gradually. It’s like… even a small plate will do it. And it's not like I'm eating anything rich or heavy, mind you. Just… regular food. Soup, a little bit of chicken... things like that. It just... doesn’t stay down. I used to have a good appetite, always did. It's just… different now. I don’t rightly know what brought it on.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when the food doesn't stay down, are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the nausea. Most of the time, anyway. Not every time, but most of the time. And… a little bit of queasiness even when I'm not trying to eat. Vomiting… not a lot, thankfully. Just… sometimes, if I push it too far. And… no, no real pain, no. Just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. It makes me tired, too. Losing my appetite… and then feeling sick… it drains you, you know?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Ms. Kelder. That sounds very unpleasant. Let’s try to get a bit more detail. When you say "a little bit of chicken," about how much would you typically eat before feeling full?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard question. It used to be... a normal portion, I suppose. What a normal person would eat. But now? Even… a few forkfuls. Maybe three or four bites, and I just… feel full. Bloated, almost. And then the nausea starts creeping in. It’s just… not normal. I haven’t changed what I eat, or how I eat, but something has changed. I just can’t put my finger on it. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we'll work through it together. Three or four bites being enough to make you feel full is definitely a change, and concerning. And you haven’t noticed any weight loss along with this?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. Now, that’s a good question. I suppose… a little bit. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t actually stepped on the scale in… oh, I don’t know how long. Maybe a couple of months? I tend to avoid it, to be honest. Numbers never did much good for me. But yes, I suspect I’ve lost a bit. Not a lot, but… noticeable, maybe? I’m not as strong as I used to be, either. I used to do a lot of gardening, but even that tires me out now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. Weight loss, decreased strength, early satiety with small portions, nausea… all of that is important information. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Medical history… Now that’s a rabbit hole, isn’t it? Let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. Must be… thirty years ago now? And arthritis, of course. It’s in my hands, mostly. And… well, I was diagnosed with cancer a few years back. Lung cancer, they said. I had treatment. Chemotherapy, radiation… it was… a difficult time. I'm in remission now, as far as they know. But I haven’t been feeling quite right since then, to be honest. But maybe that’s just me getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Kelder. Gallbladder removal, arthritis, and a history of lung cancer in remission – that’s all very important. The fact that these symptoms started after your cancer treatment is particularly relevant. Do you recall when exactly after your treatment did you start noticing these changes with your appetite and nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's... difficult. It wasn’t right away, not immediately after the treatments finished. It was… gradual, like everything else. Maybe… six months? Eight months after? It's hard to say for sure. Everything feels like a blur, to be honest. The treatments were… rough. And then the recovery… it was a long road. I was just starting to feel like myself again when… well, when these new problems started. It’s just… one thing after another, it seems. I don't remember the specifics. It's all... fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. We'll take our time. It sounds like these symptoms began several months after you completed your cancer treatment. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about your medications. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A few. Let me see… I take something for my arthritis, a little white pill. And… something for my blood pressure, I believe. A pink one. And… oh, yes, a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said my levels were low. And… well, that’s about it, I think. I have a list somewhere, but I can never seem to find it when I need it. It’s usually in the kitchen, but… well, you know how it is. Everything gets misplaced. I think those are all of them. I hope so. I don't want to forget anything important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. So, you're taking medication for your arthritis, blood pressure, and a vitamin D supplement. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as cancer, digestive problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a long story. My mother… she had diabetes. And my father… well, he had heart problems. And… several of my aunts and uncles had cancer, different kinds. Lung cancer, mostly. It seems to run in the family, unfortunately. On my Cherokee side, my grandmother… she had trouble with her stomach. Always complaining about indigestion. And my great-uncle… he had something with his intestines, but I don't remember the details. It was a long time ago. We didn't talk about these things much back then. It was… considered private. But yes, there's a lot of sickness in my family, I’m afraid. It's probably why I'm here today.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder, that's very helpful to know. History of diabetes, heart problems, and cancer in your family, along with digestive issues… it gives us a broader picture. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I want to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I used to. Years ago. I quit about… twenty years ago, I think. It was… a difficult habit to break. I started when I was young, foolishly. But I stopped, thankfully. It was the best thing I ever did for my health. My husband… he smoked too, but he passed away a long time ago. He couldn't quit, poor man. It's a terrible thing, smoking. I haven’t touched a cigarette since I quit. I'm proud of that, I am. It's one thing I did right, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. Good for you for quitting, that was a very wise decision. And I’m sorry to hear about your husband. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit now and then. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Nothing heavy. I don’t drink every day, not at all. It’s mostly… a social thing, really. When I have company. I used to drink more, years ago, but I cut back. It wasn’t doing me any good. It just makes me feel a bit tired, if I have too much. I mostly drink water now, to be honest. It’s better for me, you see. I try to take care of myself, as much as I can. Being old isn't easy, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. Light alcohol consumption, occasionally. And finally, are there any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... allergies... No, not that I know of. I’ve never had any trouble with food allergies, or anything like that. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a reaction to any medications, either. Sometimes I get a bit of a rash if I use certain soaps, but that’s about it. Nothing serious, mind you. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but I haven't been stung in years. I think I outgrew it. No, I don’t have any allergies, as far as I know. I’m pretty lucky, that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder, that’s very good to know. No known allergies. Thank you for answering all those questions so thoroughly. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I suppose it’s necessary, isn’t it? I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, if you would. My old bones aren't what they used to be. And… well, just try not to poke too much. It makes me nervous, you see. But yes, go ahead. Do what you need to do. I’m ready, I think.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kelder, I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a little fast, but otherwise sounds regular. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. Hmmm… I notice some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, on the right side. Not significant pain, but some discomfort when I press. And it feels… slightly distended. Is this normal for you?
PATIENT: Oh, the distended part... yes, I think so. It's been feeling a bit… puffed up, lately. Like I have too much air in me. I just figured it was the food not settling right. It's uncomfortable, but I didn’t think it was anything serious. And the tenderness… yes, I have noticed that too. It's not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. It comes and goes, mostly after I try to eat something. It’s been getting worse, gradually, like everything else. I didn’t think it was worth mentioning, to be honest. It’s just… old age, I figured. But… maybe I was wrong. Is it something to worry about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned it, Ms. Kelder. It's important to investigate changes, even if they seem minor. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. It’s a bit wobbly, isn’t it? I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be. The arthritis, you see. It makes my legs ache. And… I get a bit dizzy sometimes. Just a little bit. But I can walk, I suppose. It's just… not as easy as it used to be. And I have to be careful not to fall. I don't want to break anything. It's just… old age, Doctor. It's a slow decline, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Kelder, some instability is expected. Okay, thank you for that. Based on the physical exam and your history, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. Your symptoms – early satiety, nausea, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and distention – could indicate a number of things, including issues with your stomach or intestines. Given your history of lung cancer and treatment, we also need to consider the possibility of recurrence or treatment-related complications. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health and rule out any infections or other underlying conditions. The CT scan will allow us to visualize your internal organs and identify any abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests and scans... it sounds serious, doesn’t it? But… yes, alright. Do what you think is necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… I hope it’s not anything too bad. I’m tired, you see. Tired of being sick. But… yes, go ahead with the tests. Let’s find out what’s going on. And… please, tell me everything, Doctor. Even if it’s not good news. I’d rather know, than wonder. Just… be gentle with me, alright? This is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kelder, I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. I understand this is overwhelming, and I will explain everything to you in detail. We’ll take things one step at a time. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast. The contrast helps us see things more clearly. The lab work can be done today, and we can schedule the CT scan for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a medication to help with the nausea. It’s called prochlorperazine, and it should help alleviate some of your discomfort. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. I also want you to try eating smaller, more frequent meals, and avoid any foods that seem to worsen your symptoms. Stay hydrated, and get as much rest as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, smaller meals... I suppose I can try that. Prochlorper… whatever you said... is it safe, Doctor? I worry about side effects, you see. I’ve had enough of those already. And… what if the scan shows something bad? I just… I don't know if I have the strength for another fight. And... how long will it take to get the results? I hate waiting, you know. It just makes the anxiety worse. Just… tell me everything, Doctor. Be honest with me. Even if it’s not what I want to hear.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, those are very valid concerns. Prochlorperazine is generally well-tolerated, but like all medications, it can have side effects. The most common ones are drowsiness, dizziness, and dry mouth. We’ll start with a low dose, and if you experience any bothersome side effects, we can adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication. It's important to take it as prescribed, and not drive or operate heavy machinery if you feel drowsy. As for the scan results, it’s difficult to say exactly how long it will take. I’ll expedite the orders, but it typically takes 24-48 hours for the radiologist to review the images and send me the report. I promise to contact you as soon as I have the results. I understand your anxiety about a potential serious diagnosis, and I want to assure you that we’ll face whatever comes together. I won’t sugarcoat anything, but I also won’t jump to conclusions until we have all the information. It’s important to remember that a scan showing an abnormality doesn’t necessarily mean it’s cancer or something immediately life-threatening. It could be a number of other things. We’ll take it one step at a time, Ms. Kelder. First, we’ll get the scan results. Then, we’ll discuss them thoroughly, and develop a plan that’s right for you. Do you have any questions about the medication, the scan, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very well, Doctor. It’s just… a lot to take in. Smaller meals, prochlorperazine… the scan… waiting… I suppose I should go home and rest, then. And try not to worry. Easier said than done, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for being so kind. It means a lot. Will someone call me to schedule the scan? And… what if I have any questions before then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. I’m glad I could help, even if it’s just to listen. And yes, our scheduling department will call you within 24 hours to arrange the CT scan. They'll be happy to answer any questions you have about the procedure. And if you have any questions before then, or if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. My nurse, Sarah, is excellent, and she can address your concerns or connect you with me directly. The number is 555-1212. Here’s a printed summary of our discussion, including the medication information and instructions. Please take care of yourself, Ms. Kelder. And remember, we’re here for you. Don’t hesitate to reach out. We will get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You're a good man. I… I think I'll be alright. Just… a little tired. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. Get some rest. Take care. .
