DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Melvenia Tippens, pleased to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it's these forms. I need 'em notarized, I think? And verified, maybe. Something about my health... I just want to get it all sorted quickly if we can. I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Tippens. I can certainly review these forms with you and provide any necessary verification or documentation. It appears these are related to your health insurance application, is that correct?
PATIENT: Insurance application... yes, that sounds right. Honestly, I haven’t been able to get insured for… well, a long time. It’s a whole mess, and these forms are supposed to help. I mostly just need someone official to say what's what, you know? I don’t even know what they need me to verify, exactly. It's all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Insurance applications can be quite complex. Let’s take this one step at a time. It looks like they are requesting information regarding your medical history – past illnesses, surgeries, medications, allergies… things of that nature. To best assist you, I would like to confirm some of this information myself. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds sensible. Go ahead, ask what you need to. I'll do my best to remember. It’s been a few years since I really had to think about all that… but I suppose I can manage. Just try to be quick, if you wouldn’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Tippens. I will be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh dear... chronic conditions. Let me see... Arthritis, yes. In my hands, mostly. Gets pretty bad in the cold. And… I think the doctor said something about my blood pressure being a little high a few years back, but it wasn't anything serious, I don’t think. He gave me a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. It made me feel… fuzzy. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Ms. Tippens. Both the arthritis and the elevated blood pressure are important to document. The fact that you discontinued the blood pressure medication is also relevant. Could you recall the name of that medication, if possible?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names… they just don't stick with me anymore. It was a little white pill… no, maybe it was a little pink one? I really can’t recall the name. I just remember the doctor telling me what to take, and I went to the pharmacy and got it. Honestly, I don’t even remember why I stopped taking it. It just didn't seem to be doing much, and I felt a bit strange on it. I’m sorry I can’t be more help with the name.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Tippens. We can often clarify details with your pharmacy records if necessary. Let’s move on to past surgeries. Have you ever had any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Maybe… forty years ago? It was a really bad pain, I remember that. And… I think I had my appendix out when I was a little girl, but that was so long ago, I barely remember it. That’s all I can think of right now. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Tippens. Knowing the dates of those procedures, even approximate, is useful. Do you recall any complications from either of those surgeries?
PATIENT: Complications… hmmm. The gallbladder one… no, not that I recall. I was in the hospital for a few days, but everything seemed alright. The appendix… well, I was just a little girl. My mother did most of the dealing with the doctors, I think. I mostly just remember being very, very sick and then feeling much better afterwards. I don’t think there were any complications, but honestly, I wouldn’t really know. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tippens. Now, let’s discuss any current medications you are taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements. Are you currently taking anything regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. I take a little something for my arthritis, when it's bad. It’s just an over-the-counter thing, you know, one of those pain relievers. Ibuprofen, I think? And… sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me I was a little low on it. That’s about it, really. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tippens. That’s helpful. Finally, let’s discuss any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors, such as pollen or dust?
PATIENT: Allergies… Oh, goodness. I think I’m a little bit allergic to dust, maybe? Makes me sneeze a lot. And… I get a little itchy sometimes when I eat strawberries, but it's not bad bad, just a little bit. Nothing serious enough to go to the hospital or anything. I don’t think I’m allergic to any medications, though. Never had any trouble with those.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tippens. That completes my review of your medical history. Thank you for providing me with this information. Now, to ensure I have a complete picture, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination… Well, I suppose it's necessary. But please be quick about it, Doctor. I really do need to get going. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Tippens. I will be as efficient as possible. I will start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is currently 148/92 mmHg, and your pulse is 78 beats per minute, regular. I will now listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, and lung sounds are clear bilaterally. I will now check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Finally, I will palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated.
PATIENT: Well? Is everything alright? Is there anything wrong? I told you, my arthritis is acting up, but that's nothing new. Just tell me what all this means, and if you can just get on with notarizing those forms…
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, your physical examination was largely unremarkable. Your heart and lungs sound clear, your reflexes are normal, and your abdomen is soft. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, at 148/92 mmHg, but this is not necessarily cause for immediate concern, especially given your history. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and your previous report of taking medication for hypertension, I recommend we follow up with a more comprehensive blood pressure monitoring plan. We can schedule regular check-ups here at the clinic, or I can provide you with a home blood pressure monitor to track your levels. Regarding your arthritis, I can document that as a chronic condition on the forms as well. To address your request for notarizing the forms, I can certainly sign and verify the medical information we have discussed today. However, I want to be clear that this verification is based on the information you have provided to me. It's essential that all information on the forms is accurate and truthful. Do you have any questions about this process?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More appointments? I really don’t have time for all that. Home blood pressure monitor… sounds complicated. I just want to get these forms signed so I can be done with it. Alright, fine. Just sign them. As long as it gets everything approved, I don’t care what you write. And please, just hurry. I have a hair appointment later.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Tippens. Here you are. I have documented your history of arthritis and hypertension, your past surgeries and medications, and the results of today’s physical examination. I strongly encourage you to consider following up with a more comprehensive blood pressure monitoring plan, but ultimately, the decision is yours. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s it. Just… thank you. I appreciate you signing them, Doctor. Now if you’ll excuse me, I really need to get going. Oh, and… how much do I owe you? Just tell me a number. I don’t want to get into a long discussion about insurance or billing. I just want to pay and go.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Tippens. Given your current uninsured status, the cost for today’s consultation is $75. You can pay at the front desk. Please, take care and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. .
PATIENT: Seventy-five dollars… alright. Here you go. Thank you. And… goodbye to you too, Doctor. .
