DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Smetak, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s… it’s a thing. A problem, really. Down there. I don't usually talk about these things, you know. It's embarrassing. But it's…leaking. A little bit. Been happening for a bit now. Not a lot, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. These things are often difficult to discuss, and you’ve done the right thing by coming in. Don't worry, it’s quite common, and we'll figure it out. When you say “leaking”, could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like a flood, Doctor. More like… a drip. A little bit of… stuff. Yellowish, I think? Maybe. It's hard to see properly. And sometimes it smells a bit funny. Not bad bad, but… not fresh, you know? I’ve been trying to keep it clean, but it’s…awkward. Honestly, I don't know what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a yellowish discharge with a slightly unusual odor. Thank you for describing it so clearly. It sounds like it could be a few different things. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me when you first noticed this happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice? Hmm… that’s a hard one. Everything’s a bit of a blur these days. Maybe… a week? Two weeks, perhaps? I’ve been so busy with my paintings, I haven't been paying much attention to… things. It just sort of… appeared one morning. I thought maybe it was something I ate!
DOCTOR: Alright, so approximately one to two weeks. And it came on gradually, you said?
PATIENT: Gradually… yes, I suppose so. It wasn’t a big surprise, you know? Just… started happening. I don't get sick much, so I didn’t think much of it at first. I figured it would go away. But it hasn't. That's why I finally came. It’s just… I don’t like things being off, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Now, Ms. Genard, have you experienced any other symptoms along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, I’ve been a little tired lately, but I’m always tired! Old age, you know? And… hmm… maybe a little bit of… burning. When I… when I go to the bathroom. Not all the time, but sometimes. It’s not terrible, just… uncomfortable. I thought it was the coffee. Strong coffee, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some fatigue and occasional burning with urination. And you suspect the coffee might be contributing to the burning sensation. Now, Ms. Genard, I'm going to ask some more general questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Oh, pain… no, not really. My back always aches a little, but that’s just getting old, I tell ya. And my tummy… no, no pain there. Maybe a little gassy sometimes, but everyone gets that! No, no pain, Doctor. Definitely not. I'm lucky, I don't get much pain.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh, dear. You’re asking a lot of personal questions, Doctor! Well… no. Not really. Everything’s… pretty normal, if you must know. Maybe a little bit slower than it used to be, but what isn’t these days? Honestly, I don't pay much attention to those things. I eat, it goes… that's about it.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm being too intrusive, Ms. Genard. These questions are simply to help me get a complete picture of your health. Just trying to rule things out. Now, Ms. Genard, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness gracious! Really, Doctor? You don't need to know everything! I'm a seventy-three year old woman! What would you even do with that information? Honestly! That's a very impolite question, if you ask me. I... I'm single, if that's what you're getting at. But that's all you need to know.
DOCTOR: Oh, Ms. Genard, I am so sorry. That was completely inappropriate of me to ask, and I apologize profusely. It was a lapse in judgment, and I should have phrased that differently, or not asked at all. Please forgive me. I’m just trying to understand all aspects of your health, but I completely understand your discomfort and I won’t ask anything further on that topic. Now, let’s get back to the symptoms you are comfortable discussing. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Well! That's… better. Thank you. I appreciate the apology. It’s… a little shocking, you know? Old ladies still have dignity! Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I used to get a little itchy when I took penicillin, a long, long time ago. But I haven’t taken that in decades. Mostly, I just take a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. But nothing else, really. I try to avoid doctors and medicine as much as possible. It doesn't usually do much good anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, a penicillin allergy and medication for arthritis as needed. Now, Ms. Genard, would you mind if I conducted a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh dear… What does that involve? I don't like being poked and prodded. Is it going to be… unpleasant? I'm not sure I like the sound of this at all. Will it take long?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Genard. It will be a fairly routine exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll need to take a look at the area you’ve been concerned about. It’s important to get a closer look so I can figure out what’s going on. It shouldn’t be unpleasant, but please let me know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a few minutes, you say? And you promise it won't be too awful? Well… alright. But be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle. And no surprises, please! I hate surprises. I’ll just… close my eyes and try not to think about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Genard. I will be as gentle as possible, and I’ll explain everything before I do it. No surprises, I promise. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright, alright… Here I am. Don't poke too hard! And don't laugh, either. Old ladies are sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Genard. Just breathe normally. In and out… everything sounds clear. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from just being here. Now, I’m going to listen to your back, if that's alright. Deep breath in… and out… again. Everything sounds clear here as well. Now, I'm going to need to examine the area you've been concerned about. I'm going to put on some gloves first. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Gloves… yes, alright. That makes sense. I suppose. Just… be quick about it, Doctor. The longer you poke around, the more nervous I'll get. And don't make a face! I don't want to know what you're thinking. Honestly, I wish I hadn't come at all. It’s all very… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Genard. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I promise to maintain your dignity throughout the examination. I'll explain everything before I do it. I’m just going to gently take a look at the external area. I'll let you know if I see anything concerning. I do see some mild redness and slight swelling, Ms. Genard. There is a yellowish discharge, as you described. I don’t see any obvious signs of injury or infection, but we’ll need to run some tests to determine the exact cause.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, dear. Not more poking and prodding, I hope? What kind of tests? Will they hurt? I really don't like tests. Honestly, I just want to go home and paint. This is all very upsetting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Genard. We'll just need a simple urine sample to start, and possibly a swab to analyze the discharge. The urine sample is painless – you'll just need to provide a small amount in a cup. The swab might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. It will only take a few seconds. These tests will help us determine if it's a simple infection, a yeast infection, or something else. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A cup? And a… a swab? Oh, goodness. This is worse than I thought. Alright, alright. A cup I can manage, I suppose. But the swab… really? Is it absolutely necessary? I don’t like the sound of that at all. But… I suppose if you really need it. Just be very, very quick. And gentle! Remember, old ladies are sensitive!
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Genard, the swab will help us identify the exact cause of the infection. It is important to determine the right treatment plan. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, I promise. Here’s a cup for the urine sample. I’ll give you a few moments of privacy, and then we can proceed with the swab. There’s a restroom just down the hall. Please let me know when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Let's just get this over with. The sooner I’m home, the better. Don’t expect much, though. I haven't had much to drink this morning. I'll just… go to the restroom now. And don't peek! Honestly, the indignity of it all!
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Genard. There's no rush. I’ll be right here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Alright, here. It wasn’t much, but it’s all I had. Now… about that swab. Can we please just get it over with? I’m starting to feel very uncomfortable. And don't tell me what you're looking for! I don't want to know!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Genard. I’ll send this off to the lab right away. Now, about the swab. Just lie back on the examination table again, please. It will only take a few seconds. I will gently insert a small swab into your vagina to collect a sample. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll be as quick as possible. Just let me know if you feel any sharp pain, and I'll stop immediately. There we go. All done. It was very quick, wasn't it?
PATIENT: Ugh. That was… unpleasant. I told you I didn't like it! But… it's over now, thankfully. Just get it over with, please. I just want to go home. Do you need anything else? Any more poking or prodding? I'm starting to feel very faint.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Genard, that was all I needed. You’ve been very patient, and I appreciate it. We’ll send these samples to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding anything that might irritate the area. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… Well, when will I know what's wrong? And… what if it's something terrible? I don't want anything serious. I just want it to go away! And… will it hurt? Honestly, I'm a nervous wreck now. Just tell me it's not anything too bad, Doctor. That’s all I want to know.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be anxious, Ms. Genard. Most of the time, these types of symptoms are caused by a simple infection or yeast infection, which are easily treated with medication. The lab results should be back within three to five business days. As soon as I have them, I will call you right away to discuss the findings and treatment options. I want to emphasize that it's unlikely to be anything serious. However, we need to get the results to be sure. If it is something more complex, we will discuss all your options and create a treatment plan that’s right for you. We'll face it together, if that's necessary. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, severe pain, or unusual bleeding, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Fever… pain… bleeding… Oh, dear. You're scaring me now, Doctor! I just want to go home and paint! I don't want to think about fevers and bleeding. No, no more questions. Just… call me when you have the results, please. And don't tell me anything bad! Honestly, I think I'm going to be sick. Can I go now? I just want to lie down.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. You've been very brave today. I completely understand your anxiety, and I apologize if I've frightened you. I didn’t mean to cause any unnecessary worry. Here, let me help you. You can go home now and rest. I will call you as soon as the results are back, and we’ll discuss them together. And I promise to be as gentle and reassuring as possible. Here’s a little information on general vaginal health, just in case. Is there anything else I can do for you before you go?
PATIENT: No, thank you. Just… let me go home. I need to lie down and forget about all this. Honestly, it's been a terrible day. Thank you… I think. Just… call me with the results, please. And… don't make me come back here if it’s nothing serious. I hate doctors. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. I will call you as soon as I have the results. And I promise, if it’s something minor, you won’t have to come back. You take care now. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
