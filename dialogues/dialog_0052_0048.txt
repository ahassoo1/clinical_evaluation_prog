DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely, and I’m a family medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Shely, you say? Well, it's these… episodes. Can't rightly put my finger on it, but my wife, Srey, she's been worried. I get… lost, I suppose. Not lost lost, like wandering around, but… things don't make sense for a bit. It's bothersome, really. I’ve always been sharp as a tack.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. “Episodes” of feeling…disoriented or like things don’t quite make sense. And it's concerning that this is a change for you, especially given your usual mental clarity. That's perfectly valid to bring to medical attention. To help me understand what’s happening, could you tell me more about these episodes?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a blackout, you understand? I'm aware things are off. Like… yesterday, I was fixing a tile in the bathroom, been doing tile work for forty years, easy work for me. But I couldn't remember where I put the grout float. Simple thing! Right on the workbench, of course, but for a few minutes… just gone. Srey says I asked her the same question three times. Three times! And I was… irritated. I knew I’d put it somewhere sensible. It's… frustrating, to say the least.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s not a loss of consciousness, but rather difficulty with recall and a sense of confusion, even while being aware of what’s happening. And the repetition of questions is notable, as is your feeling of frustration. It sounds quite distressing, Mr. Lason. Can you recall how long these episodes typically last?
PATIENT: Not long, thankfully. A few minutes, maybe five at the most. It's not like I'm out for hours or anything. But enough to make Srey worry and… well, it makes me worry, even if I don't like admitting it. I’ve always been the practical one, always looking after things. It’s… undignified, to be forgetting such simple things. And it’s been happening more lately, that's what bothers me. Maybe once a month a few months back, now it's… hard to say, maybe a week or so apart? I don’t keep track of these things, you understand. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Lason. It's perfectly reasonable not to keep a detailed log. The increase in frequency is definitely something we need to investigate. It’s good that they are relatively short in duration, but the change in pattern is important. Now, aside from the memory lapses, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No dizziness, no headaches. My vision’s been a little blurry lately, but I put that down to getting older. I’ve always needed reading glasses, it’s just… worse, perhaps. And I've been a bit more tired than usual, but who isn’t these days? Srey says I've been more… quiet. I wouldn't say that. I'm just… observing. It’s difficult to explain. No stumbling or anything like that. Definitely no weakness. I still do all my tile work, you know. Can’t imagine not doing it. It keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed information, Mr. Lason. No dizziness, headaches, weakness, or changes in gait are reassuring. The blurry vision and increased fatigue are worth noting. "Quiet" and the increased frequency of the episodes are also important pieces of the puzzle. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a little pill for it every day. Been doing that for… oh, must be fifteen years now. And my knees ache something awful, especially in the winter. The doctor gave me something for that too, but I don't take it unless it's really bad. I prefer to just push through, you understand? No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. Always been a healthy man, despite what Srey says. And I have Medicare, of course. Should cover everything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. History of hypertension, managed with medication, and osteoarthritis in the knees. Good to know you are currently taking medication for your blood pressure. The Medicare coverage is helpful as well. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the prostate, years ago. Back in '98, I think it was. Nothing too serious. Recovered fine, never bothered me since. And I've had a few teeth pulled, of course. But that's hardly a surgery, is it? Nothing else. Never broken a bone, never been in a hospital for anything major. Always been careful, you understand. A practical man takes care of himself.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. History of prostate surgery in 1998. I appreciate you letting me know. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a difficult one. My mother, she had… well, she got very forgetful in her later years. Srey says it was dementia, but we never really got a proper diagnosis. She was in Cambodia, you understand, and things are different there. My father, he died young, heart trouble. My brother, he's still alive, but he's got high blood pressure, just like me. And my sister, she’s had arthritis, bad knees like mine. But that's about it, I think. Nothing major, really. It's just… old age, you understand. Things happen when you get older.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. A family history of dementia in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and hypertension and arthritis in siblings. This information is helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I have a little beer with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive. Just one. Maybe two if it’s a hot day. And recreational drugs? Don't be ridiculous. I'm a practical man, you understand. I have work to do. Don't need anything to cloud my judgement. I eat reasonably well, mostly Cambodian food, Srey makes it. Rice, fish, vegetables… nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. So, minimal alcohol consumption, no smoking or recreational drug use, and a healthy diet. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Srey gives me penicillin sometimes for a cold, and I’ve never had a reaction. I eat peanuts, shellfish, everything. Never had any trouble. I’m a pretty robust man, you understand. Not much bothers me. I've lived a long life, you know. And a practical one. I think that helps. So, no allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. Is that all the questions? I've got work to get back to.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. No known allergies. And yes, that completes my initial questioning. Based on what you’ve told me – the episodes of confusion with short duration, the increasing frequency, the family history of dementia, and your overall health – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to changes in blood pressure, although you’re currently medicated, or it could be an early sign of cognitive decline. The blurry vision and fatigue also warrant investigation. To get a clearer picture, I would like to perform a brief physical and neurological exam, and I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmm. Blood work, you say? Always a bother. And a physical exam… I'm not a fan of poking and prodding. But... if you think it’s necessary. Srey’s been worried, and… well, I suppose it's best to be sure. Just try not to take too much blood, alright? And be quick about it. I have tile to lay, you understand. A man's gotta work. Do whatever you think is best, Doctor. But quickly, please. And explain everything thoroughly afterwards. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns and will be as efficient and gentle as possible. I’ll explain each step as we go, and we won’t take any more blood than absolutely necessary. First, I’d like to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll perform a brief neurological exam to assess your memory, balance, coordination, and reflexes. If you could please sit up straight and relax, we’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright. Blood pressure first, you say? Very well. Just be gentle with that cuff. Srey says my veins are a bit fragile these days. And don’t squeeze too tight, alright? I need my hands for work, you understand. A practical man needs his hands. Just get it over with quickly, Doctor. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get back to laying tile.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I will be very careful. I’m trained to ensure proper technique to avoid any discomfort or injury. Your blood pressure is 148/86. That’s slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. It’s good we’re already monitoring it with medication. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Good. Your lungs are clear as well, with normal breath sounds. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Arms extended. Just be quick about it, Doctor. I haven't done this sort of thing in years. I’m a practical man, not a patient. My hands are what I need, remember? Are you sure this is necessary? Srey is getting anxious. And I have tile to lay. A lot of tile.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Not a cause for immediate concern. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. Don't worry, they’re not difficult. First, could you please tell me the current date?
PATIENT: The current date? Hmm. It's... August. Definitely August. August... let me think. Srey reads the calendar. She keeps track of these things. August… the second. Yes. August 2nd. 2025, I suppose. Is that correct? Is that good enough? I have tile to lay, you know. I don’t have time for dates. A practical man remembers what’s important, and dates aren't usually it.
DOCTOR: Yes, August 2nd, 2025 is correct. Good. Now, could you please repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? What sort of words? And what for? This is all very… unnecessary. A practical man relies on his hands, not his memory for random words. But... fine. Three words. Go on. I’ll try. But don’t expect miracles. My mind is on tile. Always on tile.
DOCTOR: Okay. Please listen carefully: apple, table, pencil. Now, I’m going to ask you a few other questions, and then I’ll ask you to repeat those three words. Don’t try to remember them right now, just answer the questions. First, where are we right now?
PATIENT: Where are we? That's... the doctor's office, of course. Srey made the appointment. A clean office. Too clean, if you ask me. A practical man doesn't spend much time in clean offices. Too much fuss. Are we done with the questions yet? My mind is wandering. Tile. Always tile. A good, solid, practical thing. Not like… random words.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct. We are in the doctor's office. Now, can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: The President? That’s… a difficult question. A practical man doesn’t concern himself with politics. Names… they all blur together. Is it… Biden? Is that the name? I think Srey watches the news. She probably knows. But I… I focus on tile. Always on tile. Is this important? Will this help me lay tile? I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, Biden is correct. Now, could you please repeat those three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Three words… Hmm. Let me think. There was an… apple. And a… table. And… something else. It’s on the tip of my tongue. Table… apple… and… I can’t remember. It's gone. Completely gone. This is ridiculous. I have tile to lay, you understand? A practical man has more important things to remember than random words. I told you! It’s a waste of time. A complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lason. Based on the physical exam and your responses to the questions, particularly the difficulty recalling the three words, there is some evidence of cognitive impairment. However, this could be due to several factors, including stress, medication side effects, or early stages of dementia. To further investigate this, I would like to order a comprehensive blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions, as we discussed. I also recommend a brain imaging scan, such as an MRI, to assess the structure and function of your brain. Finally, I'd like to refer you to a neurologist for a more detailed cognitive evaluation. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: More tests? A brain scan? A… neurologist? This is getting ridiculous. I came in here because Srey worried about forgetting where I put a grout float, and now you want to poke around in my brain? I told you, I’m a practical man. I need to lay tile, not spend my days in hospitals and getting scanned. Is this absolutely necessary, Doctor? Are you saying I'm… losing my mind? Because that’s what it sounds like. I don’t like this. Not one bit. What will these tests even do? And will they interfere with my work? Because if they do, I’m not interested. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. Best tile setter in the county. Can’t have that ruined by… tests. Tell me, honestly, Doctor. Is this really worth it? Or can we just… forget about it? Maybe I just need a good rest. And Srey to stop worrying so much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason, and I want to assure you I am not trying to alarm you. The purpose of these tests is not to diagnose you with anything definitively, but rather to gather more information so we can determine the cause of your memory lapses and ensure you receive the appropriate care. It's true that forgetting where you put a grout float is not a major concern in itself, but the combination of that, the increased frequency of these episodes, and some difficulty recalling simple information suggests that further investigation is warranted. The blood tests will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your cognitive changes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. The brain scan will allow us to assess the structure of your brain and identify any areas that may be affected. The neurologist is a specialist in cognitive disorders and can perform a more detailed evaluation to assess your memory, attention, and other cognitive functions. They can then provide a more accurate diagnosis and recommend the appropriate treatment plan, if necessary. I understand your concern about interfering with your work, and we will do everything we can to minimize any disruption. The blood tests are relatively quick and painless, and the brain scan typically takes less than an hour. We can schedule these tests at a time that is convenient for you. Ultimately, the decision is yours, Mr. Lason. However, I strongly recommend proceeding with these tests so we can get a clearer picture of what’s going on and ensure you receive the best possible care. Would you like me to explain any of these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. You've worn me down. But if this interferes with my work… you’ll be hearing from my lawyer. I have deadlines, you understand? Important deadlines. Explain these tests, then. But quickly. I don’t have all day. What exactly will they do? And how long will it take? And will I be able to… think straight afterwards? I need to lay tile, not sit around in a fog. And no surprises, Doctor. I want everything explained upfront. No hidden costs, no unexpected procedures. Understand? A practical man likes to be prepared. Now, get on with it. Tell me about these tests. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I completely understand your concerns, and I assure you, there will be no surprises. I'll explain everything upfront. First, the blood tests. These are relatively straightforward. A phlebotomist will draw a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm. The blood will then be sent to a lab for analysis. They will be checking for things like vitamin B12 and D levels, thyroid function, blood sugar, and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your cognitive changes. The entire process typically takes about 30-45 minutes, including the waiting time. You will be able to go home immediately afterwards and resume your normal activities. Next, the brain scan, specifically an MRI . This is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It’s important to remove any metal objects, such as jewelry, hearing aids, or dentures, before the scan. The scan itself typically takes about 45-60 minutes. It's relatively quiet, but some people find it claustrophobic. We can provide headphones to listen to music or a mild sedative if you're feeling anxious. The MRI will allow us to assess the structure of your brain and identify any areas that may be affected. Finally, the neurologist consultation. This will involve a detailed assessment of your cognitive function, including your memory, attention, language skills, and problem-solving abilities. The neurologist will ask you a series of questions and may administer some simple tests. The consultation typically takes about an hour. They will then review your medical history, blood test results, and brain scan images to provide a diagnosis and recommend a treatment plan, if necessary. All of these tests are relatively safe and non-invasive. However, as with any medical procedure, there are some minor risks involved. For example, the blood tests may cause some slight bruising or discomfort at the injection site. The MRI may cause some temporary discomfort if you're claustrophobic. I can provide you with more detailed information about each of these tests, including the risks and benefits, if you'd like. I can also schedule these tests at a time that is convenient for you. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: A sedative? You think I'll need a sedative? This is getting worse and worse. Claustrophobic… I've never been claustrophobic in my life. I build things, you understand? Small spaces don't bother me. Alright. Fine. Schedule the tests. But not all at once. I can't be out of commission for a week. And make sure the neurologist understands I'm a busy man. I don't have time for long-winded consultations and pointless questions. And… can Srey come with me to the neurologist appointment? I'd like her there for support. She's the one who worried about this in the first place. And one more thing. What if… what if the tests show something bad? What if I'm… losing my mind? Will you be honest with me, Doctor? No sugarcoating. A practical man needs to know the truth, even if it's unpleasant. And… can you recommend a good lawyer? Just in case.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you, I will be completely honest with you throughout this process. No sugarcoating, as you say. We can definitely schedule the tests separately, to minimize disruption to your work. I'll start with the blood tests, and we can schedule the MRI and neurologist appointment for a later date. Srey is more than welcome to accompany you to the neurologist appointment. Having a support person there can be very helpful. As for the possibility of the tests showing something concerning, it’s important to remember that we don’t know anything for certain yet. If the tests do reveal any abnormalities, I will explain the findings to you in detail and discuss the available treatment options. We will work together to develop a plan that is best suited to your needs. And I can refer you to a specialist if necessary. As for a lawyer, I have a list of reputable legal professionals in the area. I can provide you with a few names and contact numbers. However, I recommend researching several options before making a decision. I’m going to have my nurse schedule the blood tests for you. Would tomorrow morning work?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… fine. Get it over with. The sooner this is done, the better. Just… make sure they’re quick. I have tile to lay, you understand? A lot of tile. And tell them to be gentle. My veins are fragile. And… make sure they explain everything afterwards. I don’t want any surprises. Alright. That’s all. Let’s get this over with. I have work to do. Tell Srey to expect me home late. I'm going to need a strong drink. And Doctor… thank you. I suppose. For… being honest. And for not making me feel like a complete fool.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lason. I understand this is a stressful situation, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. My nurse will contact you shortly to confirm the appointment details. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns.
