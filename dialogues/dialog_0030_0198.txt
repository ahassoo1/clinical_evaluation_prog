DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’d like to learn more about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I hear it can be really helpful, and I’m hoping it could help me feel a little more… grounded, I suppose. I've been a signal and track repairer for a long time, and it can be stressful, you know? Sometimes things just...pile up.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sugino. It’s very insightful of you to recognize that you’d like to explore mindfulness and meditation as tools for managing stress. It’s excellent that you’re proactively seeking ways to improve your well-being, especially given the demanding nature of your profession. Before we delve into that specifically, as your family physician, I’d like to get a fuller picture of your overall health. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your medical history, any current symptoms you may be experiencing, and a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely, please do. Ask away. I don't mind at all. I’m pretty open, and like I said, I want to get to the bottom of feeling a little more… settled. I usually have a good memory for details, so hopefully I can answer everything clearly.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, nothing diagnosed, not officially. I had a bit of a scare about my blood pressure maybe five years ago – it was a little high during a routine check-up, but it went back down after I cut back on salt and started walking more regularly. The doctor said it wasn't anything to worry about then, and it's been fine ever since. Aside from that, just the usual bumps and bruises from work, I suppose. Nothing serious. I've always been pretty healthy, thankfully. Do you want me to list any surgeries or hospital stays, even minor ones?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the blood pressure scare and that it resolved with lifestyle changes. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. And yes, please, if you could list any surgeries or hospital stays, even if they seem minor, it would be helpful. Also, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Okay, let’s see… surgeries… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, that’s about it. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle, but that was a long, long time ago. No hospital stays beyond the recovery from the wrist, though – it was just an outpatient thing. As for medications… not regularly, no. I take ibuprofen occasionally for aches and pains, especially after a long day at work. Sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a nighttime cold medicine with a little bit of antihistamine in it, but that's very rare, maybe twice a year. I don't really believe in taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it. And no supplements, not currently. Do you want to know about allergies?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No tonsils, a childhood broken wrist, occasional ibuprofen, and very infrequent nighttime cold medicine. Good to know. And yes, please, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Alright. Well, I think I'm allergic to bee stings – I got stung as a child and had a pretty bad reaction, all swollen up and itchy. I haven’t been stung since, thankfully. Aside from that… I don’t really have any known allergies. I can eat pretty much anything, which is good! I don’t have any food allergies, no hay fever, no reactions to animals… I'm pretty lucky, really. Do you want to know about family history? My mother had high blood pressure later in life, and my father had some heart trouble, but nothing too serious that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, bee sting allergy, no other known allergies, mother with hypertension, and father with some heart trouble. That's good information. Now, just to get a better understanding of your overall lifestyle, could you tell me a little bit about your work and any hobbies or activities you enjoy outside of work?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned earlier, I’m a signal and track repairer. It’s… physical work, a lot of being outdoors, often in all kinds of weather. It can be quite demanding, and I'm on my feet most of the day. It's also very detail-oriented – you have to be precise, because mistakes can be… well, serious. Outside of work… I enjoy gardening, mostly vegetables. It’s relaxing, being outdoors and getting my hands dirty. I also like to read, mostly historical novels. And I try to walk when I can, although it's sometimes difficult to find the time. I used to do more, but work has been especially busy lately. I also like to cook – I grow a lot of my own ingredients, so it's nice to use them. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture. Physically demanding work, detail-oriented, outdoors, gardening, reading, and cooking. It sounds like you’re a very active person despite the demands of your job. Now, before we move on to discussing mindfulness and meditation specifically, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That’s perfectly alright. I understand that’s standard procedure. Just let me know what you’d like me to do, and I’ll cooperate fully. I don’t mind at all. I've always been a believer in preventative care, so I’m happy to get a check-up.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just step over to the examination table, that would be great. I'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. After that, I'll feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. It shouldn’t take long. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please take a seat and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Certainly. Here you go. I hope my blood pressure isn’t too high today! All this talking… it sometimes makes me a little nervous. But I'm trying to stay calm.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It’s common to feel a little anxious during medical exams. It’s good you’re aware of it. Okay… your blood pressure is 138 over 82. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not significantly. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. I try to do deep breathing exercises when I'm stressed, but it doesn’t always work. It’s harder than it looks! I'm happy to give it a proper try though, if you have any suggestions. Is everything sounding okay so far? I remember my grandmother always saying it was important to listen to the heart carefully... but I don't know what I'm supposed to be listening for exactly.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, meaning I don’t hear any wheezing, crackles, or other abnormal sounds. That's very good. You’re doing great. Now I’m going to take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax your jaw for me. Ears are clear bilaterally. Throat is clear, no signs of infection or inflammation. Everything looks good so far. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Okay. No pain, so far. Just a little bit of… gurgling, I think. I had a pretty big lunch today, so it’s probably just my stomach. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… rumbling. I hope that doesn't sound alarming. Should I have skipped lunch? I know I should be drinking more water too. I always forget.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly normal. A little bit of rumbling after lunch is nothing to worry about. And don't worry about skipping lunch – it's more important to stay nourished. Now I’m just going to check your reflexes in your knees and ankles. Could you please bend your knees and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Ready when you are. I always wondered how they test reflexes. Is it like when they hit your knee with that little hammer? I've seen that in movies. I hope you don't have to do that! I'm not very good with surprises.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry, I don’t need to use the hammer. I’m just going to gently tap on your tendons with my reflex hammer. It shouldn't be painful, just a quick tap. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Everything appears to be within normal limits. So, overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Your vital signs are slightly elevated, but nothing concerning. Everything else looks good. Now, let’s talk about your stress and explore whether mindfulness and meditation might be helpful for you. Before we do, do you have any questions about the physical exam?
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring to hear. No, I don't think I have any questions about the exam itself. You were very gentle and explained everything clearly. It’s good to know I’m generally healthy. Yes, let’s talk about mindfulness. I've read a little about it, but I'm not sure where to start. I'm a bit of a skeptic, honestly. It sounds… difficult. Like trying to empty your mind, which seems impossible. And I'm not very good at sitting still. Is it going to involve a lot of chanting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly valid concern, Ms. Sugino. Many people have similar questions and skepticism. Mindfulness doesn’t necessarily involve emptying your mind – that’s a common misconception. It’s more about paying attention to the present moment without judgment – noticing your thoughts, feelings, and sensations without getting carried away by them. And no, it doesn’t necessarily involve chanting or any specific religious practice. There are many different techniques, and we can find one that suits your preferences. For example, we could start with a simple breathing exercise, a guided meditation, or a body scan. It’s also perfectly normal to find it difficult to sit still, especially at first. We can start with just a few minutes each day and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. It’s about progress, not perfection. What are your initial thoughts?
PATIENT: That sounds… less intimidating, actually. Paying attention to the present moment, without judgment… I think I could maybe try that. I do find myself worrying a lot about the future, or dwelling on the past. So maybe focusing on the “now” would be helpful. A breathing exercise sounds like a good place to start. I suppose I could try that while I'm gardening, or even while I’m waiting in traffic. Are there any resources you recommend? Any good apps or websites? I'm a bit of a tech person, so I’m happy to use technology to help me. And… what would a successful practice look like? How often should I be doing it, and for how long? I don't want to put too much pressure on myself, but I also want to make sure I’m doing it correctly.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Sugino. I’m glad to hear you’re open to trying it. There are many fantastic resources available. For apps, I often recommend Headspace or Calm – they both have guided meditations for beginners. Insight Timer is also a good option, with a wide variety of free meditations. There are also plenty of helpful websites, like UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center ) and Mindful.org ). As for how often and for how long… start small. Even 5-10 minutes a day can make a difference. You could try a simple breathing exercise – focusing on the sensation of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. Or a guided meditation, focusing on your body scan, or noticing sounds around you. The key is to find a time and place where you won’t be interrupted. Don’t worry about doing it "correctly." There’s no right or wrong way. It’s about the process, not the outcome. Your mind will wander, and that’s perfectly normal. Just gently redirect your attention back to your breath or the present moment. We can also discuss your progress at your next appointment, and I can provide additional guidance if needed. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds like a very reasonable approach. Starting small, not worrying about perfection, and checking in with you later… that feels much less daunting. I’ll download one of those apps tonight and try to incorporate it into my routine. Maybe while I’m gardening, like you suggested. It's a pretty peaceful activity anyway. Thank you, Dr. Quicksey. You’ve been very helpful, and you’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I think I’m ready to give it a try. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I'm glad I could help. Remember, be patient with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'm here to support you on your journey to well-being. I’ll make a note of our discussion in your chart. I'll see you at your next appointment. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your gardening! .
