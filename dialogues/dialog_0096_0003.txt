DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, good morning. Have a seat, please. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, can we just get this over with? It's a tremor, alright? My hand shakes. Been happening for… well, I don't rightly know how long. Long enough. It's annoying, that's what it is. Mostly when I'm trying to eat. Makes a mess, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to be… brisk. A tremor, you say?
PATIENT: Brisk? I'm being efficient! Time is precious, you know. I haven't got all day to sit here and… and explain things. It shakes. My hand. When I try to bring food to my mouth. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Baide, that’s a start. But “shakes” can mean a lot of things. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go… mostly when I'm eating. Sometimes if I'm trying to write, but not so much anymore. I don't write much these days. Used to, you know. Directed a lot of pictures. But that was… a long time ago. It's not constant, no. Mostly just when I try to do something. Makes me look like a fool.
DOCTOR: Directed pictures, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, movies. Pictures, films… whatever you call 'em. Big ones, too. Back in the… well, never you mind when. Point is, I was a producer, a director. Had some talent. Not that anyone appreciates it these days. Everything's garbage now.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s focus on the tremor for now. Has anything changed about it recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… I don’t know. Maybe it's a little… worse? Hard to say. I don’t pay much attention to these things. It's just… irritating. Makes it difficult to enjoy a good meal, that's all. And I like a good meal.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything else been going on?
PATIENT: Anything else? What do you mean? I’m eighty years old! What doesn’t ache? My knees, mostly. And my back. But that’s just… old age. I’m not complaining. Just… things wear out, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. But aside from the aches and pains, have you noticed any changes in your memory, your balance, your sleep?
PATIENT: Memory… well, things aren't as sharp as they used to be, naturally. I forget names. Faces. Dates. What was I saying? Oh, right. Balance… I haven't fallen or anything, but I'm a little more… careful. And sleep? Eh, it comes and goes. Wake up a lot. Old man problems.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I’m going to take a look at your hands and do a quick neurological exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you want me to wave my arms around? Honestly. Fine. But don't expect miracles. I'm not a gymnast.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you tap your thumb to each of your fingers, one at a time, on this hand?
PATIENT: You're making me look ridiculous. Is this going to lead to anything useful, or are you just… poking at me?
DOCTOR: Just gathering information, Mr. Baide. Now, I’d like you to try and draw a spiral. Do you have a pen readily available?
PATIENT: A spiral? What am I, an artist? I haven’t drawn anything since… well, a long time ago. Here. But don't expect a masterpiece. I was a director, not a painter.
DOCTOR: Just do your best, Mr. Baide. It’s simply to assess your fine motor skills.
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's a mess. I told you I wasn't an artist. Can we please get this over with? My arm is starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your leg, and I'll tap just below your knee.
PATIENT: There. Done. Is that all? I'm getting tired of being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Just a few more things, Mr. Baide. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Alright. Everything sounds good there. Now, have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: No. I haven't fallen. I may stumble a little, but I haven't fallen. I'm still relatively coordinated, thank you very much. And I don't appreciate you implying otherwise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing essential tremor. It's a common neurological condition, especially with age, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate anything more serious. However, given your age and the subtle changes you’ve described with memory and balance, I want to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Rule out other possibilities? What other possibilities? Are you suggesting I’m… losing my mind? Look, I’m just an old man with a shaky hand. I don’t need a battery of tests. Can’t you just give me something for the tremor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, please. I’m not suggesting anything of the sort. But given your age, it's prudent to rule out things like early Parkinson’s disease or other conditions that can sometimes mimic essential tremor. To do that, I'd like to order a simple blood test and potentially an MRI of your brain. The blood test will help rule out any underlying medical issues. The MRI will give us a clearer picture of your brain structure. It’s a precaution, Mr. Baide. Nothing to worry about necessarily. And yes, we can discuss medication to help manage the tremor while we wait for the results. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? Now you want to stick me in one of those… those tubes? Absolutely not. I've heard stories. Claustrophobic, they are. And blood tests… always poking and prodding. Look, I’m not doing any tests. Just give me something for the shaking. A pill. Something. I’m an old man. I haven’t got time for fancy tests. And frankly, I think you’re making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I understand your reluctance. We can forgo the MRI and blood tests for now. However, I strongly recommend you keep a close eye on any changes in your memory, balance, or coordination. If you notice anything worsening, you need to contact me immediately. I can prescribe you a low dose of propranolol, which is a beta-blocker sometimes used to manage tremor. It may help reduce the shakiness, particularly when you're eating. We'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. It’s important to be aware of potential side effects, like fatigue or dizziness. And it’s not a cure, Mr. Baide. It will only help manage the symptoms. Are you comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Fatigue and dizziness? Wonderful. Just what I need. But fine. A pill is better than nothing. Just… don't expect miracles. And if it makes me feel worse, I'm blaming you. Can I go now? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Here's the prescription. Start with one tablet twice a day. If you experience any side effects, or if the tremor doesn't improve, please contact the office and we’ll adjust the dosage or explore other options. I'll also give you a handout with more information about essential tremor and the medication. And, as I said, please keep a close eye on any changes. I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one month to see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: One month? Fine. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my schedule. Look, I appreciate… well, I suppose I appreciate your time. But honestly, I think I could have figured this out myself. Just a shaky hand. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a lunch to get to. And a nap to take. Good day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Enjoy your lunch and your nap. And please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. .
