DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well... it's my waterworks, really. Been trouble with them, on and off. Keeps coming back, you see. I don't... I don't rightly remember when it started started, but it's been a while now. A nuisance, it is.
DOCTOR: "Waterworks," you say. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh dear. Well… it feels like needing to go, all the time. And when I do go… it doesn't always finish going, if you understand. And then it… stings. A burning sort of sting. It’s… unpleasant. Is that specific enough? I’m sorry, I don't explain things well.
DOCTOR: Right. So, frequent urination, a feeling of incomplete emptying, and a burning sensation. How often would you say you're urinating during the day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard question. More than usual, certainly. I… I don’t keep track, dear. Maybe… every couple of hours? Or less? It comes and goes, you see. Some days it's bad, some days… not so bad. It's just… unsettling, having to plan my day around that. I don’t know if that helps. Everything feels a bit blurry, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: "Blurry" isn’t particularly helpful, Ms. Wease. Let's try to be more precise. Do you experience any pain while you are urinating, or is it just the burning sensation afterward?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking a lot of questions. It's… both, I think? A bit of pain during, and then the sting afterwards. Not awful pain, mind you. Just… uncomfortable. Like a… a prickly feeling. It's hard to say what comes first, to be honest. Everything sort of runs together after a while. I… I haven’t been feeling very well, generally. Is this something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “Not feeling well, generally” is also rather vague, Ms. Wease. However, frequent, painful urination can indicate a urinary tract infection, or something more complex. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear, no. Not that I recall. I… I haven’t really looked, to be perfectly honest. I just feel the stinging, and I know something's wrong. I don’t like to dwell on these things, you see. It makes me anxious. It's probably nothing serious, is it? I’ve had waterworks troubles on and off for years. It usually goes away on its own. I… I really should get going soon. I have an appointment.
DOCTOR: "Usually goes away on its own" is not a diagnosis, Ms. Wease. While a recurring issue could be benign, we need to rule out anything serious. I'm going to need a urine sample. We can test it for infection, and other potential issues. It's a simple procedure. Do you think you can provide one for me?
PATIENT: A sample? Oh, goodness. I… I haven’t done one of those in years. Where… where would I do that? And what… what do I do with it afterwards? I’m not very good with these sorts of things, Doctor. Honestly, I just want it to go away. Perhaps a little something for the stinging? Is that possible? I... I really must be going soon. My appointment...
DOCTOR: Ms. Wease, a proper diagnosis is essential before I can consider any treatment. The stinging is a symptom, not the problem itself. I have a nurse who can guide you to the restroom and provide you with a sterile cup. Once collected, you simply hand it to the nurse. It’s standard procedure. We need to rule out an infection. Can you please cooperate?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A nurse, you say? Well… if a nurse is going to help… I suppose so. It’s just… all this fuss. It's probably just a bit of a cold. But… alright. A nurse. Yes. Lead me to the restroom, please. Quickly, if you could. My appointment… really is waiting. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse is just outside. Please inform her you are ready, and she'll provide the necessary instructions. I expect a sample promptly. And Ms. Wease, try to be more forthcoming with your medical history going forward. It will greatly assist in an accurate diagnosis.
