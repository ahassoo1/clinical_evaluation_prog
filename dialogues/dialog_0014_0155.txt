DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Jezik, let's get down to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… the shaking. That's it. My hands. Been… well, it’s been a while now, I suppose. Not sure exactly how long. Everything feels like a long time these days. It’s just… annoying, you know? Makes it hard to… hold things. Especially coffee.
DOCTOR: “Annoying,” right. Well, we need to figure out what exactly is causing this “annoying” shaking. It's not something to just brush off. You said it's been a while… can you give me even a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe… six months? A year? Honestly, it all blurs together. I used to work at the water plant, you know. Lots of… pipes. And gauges. That was… a long time ago now. I don't even remember exactly when I retired. It’s not like it happened yesterday, that’s for sure. It just… gradually got worse.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “gradually” isn't very helpful, Mr. Jezik. Let’s try this. Has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed… not really. Same old house. Same… well, I got divorced, that was a while back. Not much new happening. I mostly just… sit around. Watch the TV. I don't really do much anymore. Everything's just… quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay. And this shaking… is it just in your hands?
PATIENT: Pretty sure it’s just the hands. Maybe a little bit in my arm sometimes, but mostly the hands. It’s worse when I try to… pour things. Or… write. Though I don't do much writing these days either. It’s just… frustrating. I used to be good with my hands, you know? Always fixing things. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, I've been a bit… tired, I suppose. But I'm old, so… Old people are always tired, right? And my… my balance isn't the greatest. I nearly fell in the garden last week. But that could just be the… uneven stones, I guess. It’s hard to say. Everything feels a bit… off, but I can’t put my finger on anything specific. .
DOCTOR: "A bit off" doesn't tell me much, Mr. Jezik. Let’s try something more concrete. Do you have any trouble swallowing?
