DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s been my stomach, mostly. I just don't feel right. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don't even feel hungry, even when I know I should be. It's been going on for a little while now, and it's... worrying me. Honestly, I can’t recall exactly when it started, but it feels like a good few weeks at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder, I understand. Stomach issues that are lasting for weeks are definitely something we should look into. You said you feel sick to your stomach a lot and have a lack of appetite even when you know you should be eating. Can you describe what "sick to your stomach" feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… hard to explain. Not like a sharp pain, exactly. More like… a queasy feeling. Like I might throw up, but usually I don't. It just feels… unsettled. And sometimes it bubbles, you know? Like something's moving around in there that shouldn’t be. It comes and goes, but it’s pretty frequent. Does that make any sense? I'm not good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Kelder. “Queasy” and “unsettled” are good descriptions. And the bubbling sensation is helpful to know. It sounds unpleasant. Now, when you say frequent, about how often are you experiencing these feelings?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It’s almost every day now, I reckon. Some days it’s just a little bit, like after I eat a little something. But other days… well, other days it’s most of the day. It's hard to say exactly. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. It feels like it’s getting worse, though. And it’s starting to keep me from wanting to eat, which isn't good. My daughter keeps after me to eat, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your daily life, and it’s good that your daughter is looking out for you. So, almost every day, with varying intensity. Has anything specific – certain foods, times of day, activities – seemed to make it worse or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. I’ve tried changing what I eat, you know? Less fried foods, more bland things. Didn’t seem to make a whole lot of difference. It happens morning, noon, and night, as far as I can tell. It's just… random, I guess. Except maybe… maybe when I lie down it feels a little worse? I haven’t paid too much attention, honestly. I just try to get comfortable. I don't know if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Kelder. The fact that it worsens when you lie down is something we’ll definitely want to keep in mind. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the nausea and lack of appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I've been a little tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And… oh, yes. I've lost a little weight, my daughter says. I haven't weighed myself, but she says my clothes are a little loose. It’s hard to say if it's much, but she worries, you know. And… sometimes, I feel a bit… bloated, I guess? Like I'm full of air. Does that sound right? I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing just fine, Ms. Kelder. It's very helpful to have all of this information. Fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and bloating – those are all important things to note. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, or changes in the color of your stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… now that you mention it… yes, a little. I haven’t been… regular, I suppose. More… stopped up, if you know what I mean. It’s not awful, but it’s definitely different than usual. And… the stool, it's… lighter colored. Not anything bad, just… not as dark as it used to be. I didn’t think much of it, but now that you ask… yes. That's been happening. I hope I’m not telling you too much. It’s just… embarrassing, talking about these things.
DOCTOR: You're not telling me too much at all, Ms. Kelder. It's my job to know these things so I can help you. Changes in bowel habits and stool color are important clues. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And I haven’t thrown up, thankfully. Just the queasiness, like I said. I get a little sweaty sometimes when it’s bad, but that's all. It’s just… this constant feeling of being unwell. And I just want to feel normal again, you know? I used to be so active, always busy with something. Now… I mostly just sit. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Kelder. It sounds very frustrating to have this constant feeling of being unwell and to have it impact your activity level. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. Must be… twenty years or more. And… I had some high blood pressure for a while, but they got it under control with medication. I’m not sure what else… Oh! I was told I had some arthritis in my hands and knees, but it’s not too bad. Just a little stiff sometimes. And, of course, the cancer… They found it a few years back. I’ve been getting treatment for it ever since. It’s… it’s been a long road. I don't recall the type, exactly. My daughter handles most of that now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. That's important information. So, gallbladder removal, controlled hypertension, arthritis, and a history of cancer. I see. Do you recall what type of cancer it was, or approximately when you were diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I wish I could tell you. It was… in my stomach, I think. Or maybe the esophagus? Something like that. They did a lot of tests and scans and… it was a while ago. My daughter tells me it’s… adenocarcinoma, I believe she said. And she said it was a few years back, maybe three or four years ago. I’ve been seeing an oncologist ever since, getting infusions and things. I don’t always remember what they tell me, honestly. It all just… blends together after a while. Is that bad? I feel like I should remember these things.
DOCTOR: It’s not bad at all, Ms. Kelder. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and have trouble remembering details after dealing with a lot of medical information. Adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagus, that’s very helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, arthritis, or cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… For my blood pressure, I take… lisinopril, I think. A little white pill. And for the cancer… oh, there are so many! Let me see if I can remember… There’s Keytruda, that one's given by infusion every few weeks. And then I take a pill called… capecitabine, I think. And something for the nausea, but I forget the name. My daughter keeps a list, she’s wonderful. I also take some ibuprofen sometimes for my arthritis, when it’s really bothering me. That's all I can think of right now. I hope that’s enough.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Kelder. Lisinopril, Keytruda, capecitabine, and ibuprofen. And something for nausea, we can look that up later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat most anything, and I haven't had any trouble with medications. My daughter always asks when they give me something new, just in case, but I’ve never had an allergic reaction. I’m very lucky, I suppose. Is there anything else I should be telling you? I’m worried I’m forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Kelder, you're doing great. You've given me a lot of valuable information. Let's move on to a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to gently feel your abdomen to see if there are any areas of tenderness or concern. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? I feel so tired all the time, and this nausea is just awful. I just want to feel like myself again. Please, do what you need to do. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Okay… Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, when I press here… does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, a little. Not sharp, exactly, but… uncomfortable. It feels kind of… full, and tender. Especially right here, on this side. It feels like… something's pressing. It's been like that for a little while, I think. I'm not sure if it's always been there, or if it's gotten worse recently. It's hard to say. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. I notice some tenderness in your upper right quadrant, as you pointed out. And it does feel a little distended. I don't feel any masses, but there’s definite discomfort when I press there. Based on what you've told me and this exam finding, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. Given your history of cancer, and the tenderness in that area, we need to rule out any potential recurrence or spread. We also need to consider other causes of nausea, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort. I’d like to order some blood work to check your liver function, pancreatic enzymes, and a complete blood count. I also recommend a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better look at your organs and see if we can identify the source of your discomfort. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan… that sounds serious. But I understand. I just want to know what’s going on. I’ve been through so much already, and this is just… worrying. Blood work and a scan… alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. My daughter will want to know, of course. She handles most of these things. Just… please let me know as soon as you find anything out. I just want to feel better. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Or any foods I should avoid?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Kelder. A CT scan will give us a lot more information, and it's the best way to determine the cause of your symptoms. We'll get the results as quickly as possible, and I’ll be sure to discuss them with you and your daughter thoroughly. In the meantime, I recommend eating small, bland meals to minimize the nausea. Things like toast, crackers, and clear soup are usually well-tolerated. Avoid greasy, spicy, or overly rich foods. And try to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. I’m also going to prescribe you an anti-nausea medication to help manage your symptoms. It’s called ondansetron, and it should help reduce the feeling of queasiness. We'll start with a low dose and adjust as needed. I’m going to write you a referral for the CT scan and a prescription for the ondansetron. And I’ll have the nurse draw blood for the lab work before you leave. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Ondansetron… okay, I'll try to remember that. Small, bland meals, stay hydrated… and the new medication. That sounds manageable. No, I don't think I have any questions right now, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… please, let me know as soon as you know something. I'm really worried, but I trust your judgment. Thank you, Doctor Annesley. And thank you for listening to me. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. I’m glad I could help. I understand your worry, and I’ll do everything I can to get to the bottom of this. We'll get those tests ordered right away, and I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Take care, Ms. Kelder, and I hope you feel better soon.
