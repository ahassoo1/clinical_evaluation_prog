DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh, my… where to begin? It’s this pain, you see. In my lower abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it's… quite severe. I believe that's why I scheduled the appointment. I’ve been having these episodes for… well, a little while now. Honestly, the timing escapes me. It feels like it's been longer than it has, I suspect.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pain in the lower abdomen, coming and going, with episodes of severity. And you mentioned the timing is a bit unclear. That’s alright; we’ll try to get a clearer picture. Could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Describing it… let me see. It's not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… a deep ache, I suppose. And it feels… crampy? Like a tightening. It comes in waves, really. It’s difficult to explain. It’s… unsettling. And sometimes it radiates… down to my legs, a little. Not always, though. It’s all rather… vague, I’m afraid. I apologize for not being more precise. My memory isn’t what it once was, you see.
DOCTOR: A deep, crampy ache coming in waves, radiating to the legs occasionally. “Vague” is perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. We work with what we have. Now, when you say “comes in waves,” how long do these episodes typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. They don't seem to follow a pattern, if I'm honest. Sometimes it’s just a few minutes. Other times… well, other times it lingers for hours. It’s hard to say definitively. I suppose the longest… perhaps a full afternoon? But I was resting then, so I wasn’t paying close attention to the clock, you understand. It’s… frustrating. I wish I could give you a more accurate answer. It just is, you see, and then it isn’t.
DOCTOR: Episodes lasting from minutes to hours… variable. Alright. And during these episodes, would you describe the pain as constant, or does it ebb and flow even within an episode?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, it definitely ebbs and flows within an episode. It’s not a steady ache the entire time. It builds up, gets quite intense, then fades a little, then builds again. Like… waves crashing on the shore, I suppose. Sometimes it’s just a dull discomfort for a bit, then suddenly it’s quite severe again. It’s… unpredictable, really. I find myself bracing for the next surge, if that makes any sense. It’s rather exhausting, to be quite frank. I’ve been trying to manage it with… well, with resting mostly. And warm baths.
DOCTOR: Intermittent, fluctuating pain within episodes. Resting and warm baths… alright. Now, Ms. Glymph, has anything specifically seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a difficult question. I haven’t noticed a clear trigger, no. I’ve tried to think about it, but… nothing comes to mind. Sometimes it happens after I’ve been… active, perhaps? But other times it happens when I’ve been perfectly still. I haven’t changed my diet recently, and I’m not under any particular stress that I’m aware of. It just… seems to happen. It’s quite perplexing, really. I’ve been trying to keep a mental note, but as I mentioned, my memory is… unreliable. Perhaps it’s something I eat? But I can’t recall anything specific.
DOCTOR: I see. No obvious triggers identified. And you haven't experienced any associated symptoms with these episodes?
PATIENT: Associated symptoms… let me think. Well, sometimes I feel a little… nauseous, perhaps? But not always. And occasionally, a bit of… bloating, I suppose. It's not severe, though. Nothing that would send me rushing to the emergency room, certainly. And no fever, no chills, no… anything dramatic. Just a general feeling of… unwellness, really. It’s hard to describe. It’s… subtle. Sometimes I feel a bit tired afterwards, but that could just be from dealing with the pain, I suspect. I haven't noticed any changes in my… bowel habits, if you don't mind me asking. It's all rather… unremarkable, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Mild nausea and bloating associated with episodes, no fever, chills, or significant changes in bowel habits. Alright. Now, Ms. Glymph, let’s move on to some general medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I… I have something called SLE, I believe. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, the doctor told me years ago. It’s… complicated. I see a rheumatologist for it, but it's been quite stable for a while now. I take medication, of course. And… I’ve had a few surgeries over the years, but nothing recent. And… I believe I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. But I’m generally… healthy, considering. I’ve always been a rather… resilient person, if I may say so myself. It’s just… this pain is new, or at least… different. I’m not sure if it’s related to the SLE, but I thought I should mention it, of course.
DOCTOR: SLE. Very good. And you are currently under the care of a rheumatologist?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Dr. Armitage. A very good doctor, though I don’t see her as frequently as I once did. The lupus has been… quiet, thankfully. I take Plaquenil, I believe it's called, and… sometimes a steroid, depending on how I’m feeling. I’m generally quite good about taking my medication, but… sometimes I forget. I apologize. It’s just… a lot to keep track of, you see. And I don't want to bother her unnecessarily if things are stable. But I thought it was important to mention, in case this pain is related. I wouldn't want to overlook anything.
DOCTOR: Plaquenil, occasional steroids. We'll certainly consider the lupus as a potential factor. Now, Ms. Glymph, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a severe allergic reaction to anything, thankfully. I recall a mild rash once, after taking… an antibiotic, perhaps? But it wasn’t serious. I’m generally quite tolerant of most things, to be honest. I eat a variety of foods, and I haven’t had any issues with… pollen or animals or anything like that. I'm fortunate in that regard, I suppose. But I should mention… I bruise easily. I’ve always been prone to bruising, even as a child. I suspect it’s related to the lupus, or perhaps… just my age. But it’s something I should mention, in case it's relevant.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, easy bruising. Alright. Now, Ms. Glymph, are you currently taking any other medications besides the Plaquenil and occasional steroids?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a vitamin D supplement, yes. The doctor recommended it, as my levels were a bit low. And… occasionally, I take Tylenol for… headaches, perhaps? Or just general aches and pains. Nothing regular, though. And… oh! I take something for my blood pressure. A small dose, prescribed by my primary care physician. I… I can’t recall the name at the moment. I apologize. It’s… a little white pill. I take it every morning. But as I mentioned, my memory isn't what it once was, you see. I can look it up when I get home, if you'd like. I just don't keep track of these things, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Vitamin D, Tylenol as needed, and a medication for blood pressure – the name of which you don’t recall. Alright. Now, Ms. Glymph, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a… complicated question. My mother… she had arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had heart problems, yes. He passed away at a relatively young age, unfortunately. And… my sister, she has… diabetes, I think. But beyond that… I don’t recall anything significant. My family wasn’t particularly… forthcoming about medical history, if I’m honest. They weren’t ones for sharing details, you see. And I wasn’t particularly interested in such things when I was younger. I apologize for not being more helpful. It’s just… a bit of a blur, to be quite frank. I wish I could provide more information, but I simply don’t recall. It’s… frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, heart problems, diabetes in the family. Alright. Now, Ms. Glymph, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions, but… very rarely. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I’ve always been a rather… sensible person, if I may say so myself. I believe in taking care of my health, you see. And those sorts of things… they simply aren’t for me. I apologize if that sounds… judgmental. It’s not my intention. I just… I've always avoided those habits. It's a matter of principle, really. And good health, of course.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Ms. Glymph, finally, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, yes, actually. I suppose I’m wondering… do you think this pain could be related to the lupus? That’s what I’ve been most concerned about, you see. Is it possible that it’s a flare-up, even though I haven’t seen Dr. Armitage recently? And… is there anything I should be doing differently? Any specific things I should avoid? I just… I want to understand what’s going on, and I want to make sure I’m doing everything I can to manage it. And… I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… I’m a bit anxious, you see.
DOCTOR: It's certainly possible the pain is related to your SLE, Ms. Glymph. Lupus can present in a variety of ways and can have flares even without frequent rheumatologist visits. However, given the variability of your symptoms and the lack of a clear pattern, we need to consider other possibilities. It’s premature to definitively attribute this solely to the lupus at this stage. As for what you should be doing… continuing your Plaquenil as prescribed is essential. Avoid strenuous activity until we have a better understanding of the cause. And honestly, Ms. Glymph, I would recommend keeping a more detailed log of your symptoms – timing, severity, any potential triggers. It will be invaluable in helping us reach a diagnosis. Now, I’m going to conduct a physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your abdomen.
