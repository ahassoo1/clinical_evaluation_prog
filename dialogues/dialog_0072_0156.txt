DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nahrwold. I’m Dr. Hembrey. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Hembrey. Um… it’s my stomach. It’s been… not good, lately. I keep getting diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit, and… honestly, I don't really remember when it started exactly. It just… is.
DOCTOR: "A bit" isn't terribly specific, Ms. Nahrwold. It’s important for me to understand the timeline. Can you estimate roughly how long you’ve been experiencing this diarrhea?
PATIENT: Ugh, you're right. It’s hard to say. Maybe… a couple of months? Possibly longer? I really don’t keep track of things like that. It comes and goes, you know? Some days are worse than others. I just thought it would… stop. Is a couple of months helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s… somewhat helpful. Intermittent symptoms can be more challenging to diagnose, naturally. Aside from the diarrhea itself, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I’ve been really tired, I guess. Just… more tired than usual. And I’ve lost a little weight, maybe? My clothes feel a bit looser. But I haven't actually weighed myself recently. I just… feel a bit run down. Oh! And sometimes my stomach cramps. It’s not constant, but it happens.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and weight loss are concerning additions. And abdominal cramping... can you describe the cramping?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to describe. It’s not like a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache? And it comes and goes in waves. It feels lower down, in my stomach, mostly on the left side, I think. It doesn’t make me double over or anything, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. It usually happens after I eat, but not every time. Honestly, it’s just… a general feeling of being unwell.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nahrwold, have you experienced any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… That’s… a bit embarrassing to talk about. I… I think so? Maybe? It was a while ago, and I didn’t really… pay close attention. It wasn’t a lot, if that makes sense. Just… a little bit of red. I just figured it was something I ate. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Nahrwold. It’s important to rule out potential causes. Now, let’s discuss your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… I think… I might have something with my stomach? My mum always said I had a sensitive tummy. And the doctor once said something about… IBD? Or celiac? Something like that. But I honestly don't remember the details. It was a long time ago, and I haven't really had any problems until recently. I don’t really keep track of those things, sorry. It was a while ago and I’ve been alright, mostly, until now.
DOCTOR: “Something with your stomach” and vague recollections of IBD or celiac disease are not particularly helpful, Ms. Nahrwold. It's crucial to have accurate medical information for a proper diagnosis. Do you recall when you were told about this potential IBD or celiac diagnosis?
PATIENT: Ugh, you’re right. I'm terrible at this, aren’t I? It was… when I was a teenager, I think? Maybe… fifteen or sixteen? I had a lot of stomach problems then, and I went to a specialist. They did some tests, and they said something about it, but I was more worried about… other things at the time. My mum handled most of the doctor stuff. She’s gone now, so I can’t ask her. I just know she always told me to be careful with what I ate.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to family history. Are there any instances of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or other gastrointestinal issues in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandmother on my mum’s side… she had stomach problems. Bad ones. I remember her always being sick. She used to say she had a “sensitive stomach” too, like me. And I think my uncle on my dad’s side had something similar, but I don’t really know the details. It was a long time ago, and we don’t talk much. Everyone on my mum’s side was always fussing about their stomachs, to be honest. It just seemed… normal.
DOCTOR: And what about your social history, Ms. Nahrwold?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… okay. Well, I'm married. Been married for five years now. I work as a sales rep, mostly on the phone. Not very exciting. I don’t really… go out much. I mostly just stay home with my husband. We don't have any kids. Is that… what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I don’t smoke, I barely drink—like, a glass of wine maybe once a month—and definitely no drugs. My husband doesn’t either. We both try to stay healthy. Which is why this stomach thing is so… confusing. I just don’t understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Now, let’s discuss any medications you are currently taking, or have taken recently. This includes prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements.
PATIENT: Oh, um… Well, I take a multivitamin, just a basic one. And sometimes, when my stomach is really bad, I take something for the diarrhea. It’s… I think it’s called loperamide? Something like that. It helps a little, but not much. And I used to take something for heartburn, but I stopped because it wasn’t really working. Oh! And I take a tablet for my blood pressure, but that's all. I think. I’ll have to ask my husband to be sure. He handles most of the pill organising.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. My mum always made sure I didn't eat anything I was allergic to, but I don't think I have any. I just get a bit… sensitive sometimes, if I eat too much spicy food. But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nahrwold, with your history of intermittent diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, possible blood in stool, and vague recollections of potential IBD or celiac disease, combined with your family history, a thorough physical examination is necessary. Would you be comfortable with me proceeding with that?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… okay. I guess so. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I don’t like doctors much. But if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yes. Please. I just want to feel better. What… what will you do?
DOCTOR: I will start with auscultation of your abdomen, followed by palpation to assess for tenderness or masses. I will also check for signs of dehydration. Please lie back on the examination table and relax. I will need to expose your abdomen, so I will provide a gown and drape for your privacy.
PATIENT: Okay. A gown, right? Okay. Will it… hurt? I’m just a bit worried.
DOCTOR: It should not be painful, Ms. Nahrwold. I will be gentle. However, if you experience any discomfort, please inform me immediately. I need you to lie on your back with your knees bent. I will begin with listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… tell me what you’re doing, okay? It makes me feel better to know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will explain each step as I proceed.
PATIENT: Okay. I’m ready. Please be gentle.
DOCTOR: I’m listening for bowel sounds now, Ms. Nahrwold. Normal bowel sounds are typically gurgling or rumbling. I’m noting a slight decrease in the frequency of sounds in the lower quadrants. Now, I will palpate your abdomen to assess for any tenderness, masses, or guarding. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. I will start lightly and gradually increase the pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. Ooh, that’s a bit… tender. Not painful, but… uncomfortable. It’s… right there.
DOCTOR: There is mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, Ms. Nahrwold. No significant rebound tenderness or guarding noted at this time. Your abdomen is soft overall, with no palpable masses detected. No hepatosplenomegaly is noted. I will now percuss your abdomen to assess for tympany or dullness.
PATIENT: Okay. It feels… weird. Is that normal? What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Percussing helps me assess for fluid or gas in your abdomen. Normal findings are typically tympanic sounds, which indicate air. Dullness can suggest the presence of fluid or an organ. Your abdomen is predominantly tympanic, with no significant dullness noted. Overall, your abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, with decreased bowel sounds. No significant findings of rebound tenderness, guarding, or organomegaly. Do you have any questions about the examination at this time?
PATIENT: No… not really. It didn’t… hurt, exactly. Just uncomfortable. So… what does that mean? Is it bad? Is that why my stomach hurts so much?
DOCTOR: The findings are not definitive, Ms. Nahrwold. The tenderness in your right lower quadrant, combined with the decreased bowel sounds, could suggest several possibilities. It could be a mild case of irritable bowel syndrome, which is common. However, it’s also important to rule out other causes, such as a possible inflammatory process. Given your history and these findings, I recommend we order some laboratory tests and possibly imaging to get a clearer picture. Would you be amenable to a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample analysis?
PATIENT: A stool sample…? Oh, ugh. Is that… really necessary? Couldn’t we just… try something else? I don’t really want to have to… do that.
DOCTOR: While I understand your discomfort, Ms. Nahrwold, a stool sample analysis is crucial in this case. It will help us rule out any infectious causes for your symptoms, such as bacteria or parasites, and also assess for inflammation. It is a standard procedure and provides valuable information for accurate diagnosis. I assure you it is a relatively simple process. The lab will provide you with a collection kit and instructions. I also recommend a CT scan of your abdomen to rule out any structural abnormalities or inflammation. Are you willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. If you really think it's necessary. A stool sample and… a CT scan. Will the CT scan… hurt? And what if it shows something bad?
DOCTOR: The CT scan is non-invasive, Ms. Nahrwold. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It does not hurt, but you will need to remain still for a few minutes. You may be asked to drink a contrast dye beforehand to improve the image quality. Regarding your concern about finding something "bad," the purpose of these tests is to identify the cause of your symptoms, not to predict a negative outcome. If something is detected, we will discuss the findings thoroughly and develop an appropriate treatment plan. I will write orders for both the stool sample and the CT scan. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment for the stool sample collection, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule the CT scan. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… please let me know if you find anything. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Nahrwold. We will review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a bland diet and staying well-hydrated. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as high fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools, please seek immediate medical attention. I will have the nurse come in to assist you with getting dressed.
