DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. It’s not like I feel bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, the nurse mentioned elevated blood pressure readings. It's good you're not experiencing any symptoms right now, but high blood pressure can be a silent condition, meaning it doesn't always cause noticeable issues until it's caused some damage. Let's go over some details to get a better understanding of what's going on. First, do you know what your typical blood pressure readings have been, if the nurse shared that with you?
PATIENT: Honestly, numbers aren’t my thing. She just said it was “high”. I mostly just want a prescription and to get this over with. Is that going to happen, or are we going to sit here all day talking about numbers?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, and I want to be efficient with your time. But rushing into a prescription without understanding why your blood pressure is elevated isn’t the best approach. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes and ensure we choose the right medication, if needed. Before we talk about medication, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Look, I'm perfectly healthy. Always have been. My husband says I worry too much, and I think that’s what’s doing it. Just general stress, okay? I don’t have time for a whole life story. What do you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, stress can definitely play a role. Just a few quick things then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart issues?
PATIENT: No. Never. Like I said, healthy. My mother always said good genes were the key, and I guess she was right. She lived to be 90, so… can we move on?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Not even a broken bone. I'm careful. I don't go doing silly things. Seriously, doctor, is this really necessary? It feels like you’re just trying to waste my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. What about your family?
PATIENT: What about them? They’re fine. My brother has… allergies, I think. Nothing serious. My dad had high blood pressure when he got older, but he also smoked a pack a day for fifty years, so it’s not exactly a helpful comparison, is it?
DOCTOR: Right, that's good to know. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes ibuprofen for headaches, if I really need it. But not often. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. All those chemicals… No, that's it. Nothing else. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to confirm, you don't have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Look, I’m telling you, I'm a perfectly normal, healthy person. I eat okay, I don't smoke, I don't drink much... This is ridiculous. Can we please just get to the part where I get something for this blood pressure? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. I really do. But even if you feel perfectly healthy, it’s important to understand why your blood pressure is elevated before we start any treatment. It could be something simple, but it’s better to be thorough. Just quickly, could you tell me a little about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you want to talk about my diet? Honestly, I eat normal food. I don't stuff myself with junk all day, but I also don't eat rabbit food. I like a good burger and fries sometimes, like everyone else. What difference does it even make? I’m not a nutritionist. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Dudney. I’m going to ask one more question, then we can discuss options. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two, on a Friday or Saturday. It helps me relax. I don't get drunk or anything. Honestly, I'm a very responsible person. Is this going somewhere? Because I’m starting to get annoyed. I just want a prescription and to leave.
DOCTOR: Okay. Before we discuss a prescription, I'd like to check your blood pressure again, and I'd also like to listen to your heart and lungs. It’s a quick exam, and it will give me a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But I'm telling you now, it's going to be perfectly normal. This is all a big waste of time, but I guess I don't have a choice. Don't keep me waiting long.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here and relax. Okay. A little elevated, as the nurse noted. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay. Given your blood pressure reading and your medical history, it's likely we're dealing with essential hypertension. However, to rule out any underlying causes, I'd like to order some basic blood work: a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a urinalysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Seriously? Look, I don’t understand all those fancy words. All I know is I feel fine. But… fine. Do whatever you have to do. Just tell me when it’s over. And will these tests keep me from getting a prescription today? Because if so, I'm walking out of here.
DOCTOR: The tests will help me determine the best course of treatment for you, Ms. Dudney, and ensure we’re not missing anything. They shouldn’t keep you from getting something today. While we wait for the results, I can prescribe a low-dose thiazide diuretic. It’s a common first-line treatment for hypertension, and it’s generally well-tolerated. However, I want to emphasize the importance of lifestyle modifications as well: reducing sodium intake, increasing physical activity, and managing stress. Are you willing to try that?
PATIENT: Fine. A pill is better than nothing, I guess. But I’m not promising any changes to my life. I have a job, you know? And I'm not going to start running marathons or anything. Just… give me the prescription. And can I get it filled at Walgreens? I have a rewards card there.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m prescribing hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily. Here's the prescription for Walgreens. It’s important to take it as directed and to follow up with me in two weeks to check your blood pressure and see how you’re doing. We’ll also discuss the lab results at that time. Do you have any questions about the medication or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I guess. I still think this is all a bit much, but whatever. I'm going to get this filled and then go home. Hopefully, this pill will actually work. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Dudney. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or experience any side effects. Have a good day. .
