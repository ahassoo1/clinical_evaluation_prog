DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. Um... my sinuses, they are... not good. I have... a problem with them. It feels... full, maybe? Like pressure. I don't remember how long, exactly. A little time, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing sinus pressure and fullness. “A little time” is helpful, but could you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific... hmm. Is hard. Maybe... a month? Or two? I work a lot, Doctor. The oil... the drilling... it is dusty. Maybe that has something to do with it? I forget sometimes. It feels worse when I bend over. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Working in a dusty environment like an oil drilling site certainly could be contributing to sinus issues. And the fact that it worsens when you bend over is a helpful detail. So, to clarify – you’ve been experiencing this sinus pressure for roughly a month or two, it’s associated with your work environment, and it worsens with bending over. Aside from the pressure, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms... let me think. Sometimes my head... hurts. Not a bad hurt, but... a dull ache. And maybe... a little tired. I thought that was just from work, though. Oh! And sometimes I have... trouble smelling things. Not everything, but... some smells. Is that... important?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all important details, Mikeisha. The headache, fatigue, and difficulty with your sense of smell are all things we need to consider. Let's talk a little more about the headache. Where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Um... mostly here. And sometimes... in my cheeks. It's not a sharp pain, Doctor. Just... heavy. Like someone is pressing on my face. It comes and goes, you know? Not all the time. It is worse at the end of the day, after work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the headache is primarily in your forehead and cheeks, feels heavy rather than sharp, comes and goes, and is worse at the end of the workday. That’s helpful. Now, regarding your sense of smell—are there specific smells you've noticed are difficult to detect, or is it a general reduction in your ability to smell?
PATIENT: General, I think. Like... I used to smell the cooking from my neighbor’s house. Very strong smells. Now... not so much. Not always, but... less. My husband, he says I don't smell things he can smell. He makes fun of me a little. It is not a big problem, but... I notice.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're aware of the change and that you've noticed it. It's not uncommon for sinus issues to affect the sense of smell. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with allergies, asthma, or chronic sinusitis before?
PATIENT: Allergies... hmm. I don't think so. Never been told I have them. Asthma, no. And... chronic... what was that word again? Is something with the sinuses? I have had... sinus problems before, sometimes. Just... not for a long time. Usually they go away on their own. Nothing serious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Chronic sinusitis means a long-term inflammation of your sinuses. It sounds like you’ve had sinus infections in the past that resolved on their own, but this current issue has been ongoing for a month or two, which is why we’re looking into it a little more closely. Have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Surgeries... no. Never had surgery. Serious illnesses... I had the flu a few times, I think. And a bad cold last year. Nothing else. I am usually healthy, Doctor. I work very hard, but... I try to take care of myself. My husband, he worries a lot. He says I push myself too hard.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And it's wise to be mindful of not pushing yourself too hard, especially with your work. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings – has a history of allergies, asthma, or chronic sinus problems?
PATIENT: Family... hmm. My mother, she always had... bad colds. A lot of sneezing. Maybe allergies? I don't know for sure. She didn't go to the doctor much. And my father... he was very strong. Never sick. My sister... she is healthy too, I think. Nothing like me. I don't know much about their medical problems, Doctor. We don't talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like there may be some family history of allergies, but it's not definitive. Finally, I'll ask about your social history. Do you smoke or are you exposed to secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, I do not smoke. Never have. And no, I am not around smoke. My husband, he doesn't smoke either. It is dusty at work, but... not smoke. I try to stay away from bad air, Doctor. I need to breathe good to do my job.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications... no. I don't take anything. Vitamins... sometimes. Just a multivitamin, when I remember. My husband buys them for me. I forget to take them most of the time. No special pills or anything, Doctor. Just the vitamins sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mikeisha. Thank you for answering all of those questions. That gives me a good understanding of your situation. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your ears, nose, and throat, and feel your sinuses to see if there’s any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I hope you can help me with my sinuses. They are bothering me a lot.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright. Your lungs sound clear. Your ears look normal. Your nasal passages do appear a little congested, with some mild swelling. And I do notice some tenderness when I press on your forehead and around your cheeks, especially on both sides. I’m also going to have you close your eyes. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it seems like you’re likely experiencing sinusitis, possibly a sinus infection. The congestion in your nasal passages and the tenderness in your forehead and cheeks support that. However, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a CT scan of your sinuses. This will help us see the extent of the inflammation and rule out any other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Is that... safe? I don't like too many... machines. Is there something very wrong? I just thought it was a bad sinus thing. Will the scan show what is happening? And… how much will it cost? I don’t have insurance, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mikeisha. It’s understandable to be concerned about a CT scan, especially without insurance. CT scans do use a small amount of radiation, but the benefit of getting a clear diagnosis usually outweighs the risk, especially when we're trying to figure out the cause of your ongoing symptoms. We use the lowest dose of radiation possible. The scan will give us a detailed view of your sinuses, which will help us determine if it’s a simple sinus infection, or if there’s another underlying cause, like a nasal polyp or a structural issue. Regarding the cost, I understand your concern. Let me check with the billing department to get an accurate price estimate for the scan. I can also explore options for financial assistance or a payment plan. We don’t want the cost to be a barrier to getting the care you need. In the meantime, I can also prescribe a course of antibiotics and a nasal saline rinse. This might help relieve your symptoms while we wait for the scan results. However, it's important to remember that antibiotics won't address any underlying structural issues. Would you like me to proceed with a prescription for the antibiotics and nasal saline, and I’ll get that sent to your pharmacy, and look into the cost of the CT scan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. The antibiotics and the rinse sound good. If they can help me feel better, that would be wonderful. And please, please check on the cost of the scan. I don’t want to get into trouble with money. My husband, he works very hard. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. I understand your concerns, and we will definitely work with you on the cost of the scan. Okay, I'm going to write you a prescription for amoxicillin, which is an antibiotic commonly used to treat sinus infections. You'll take one 500mg tablet three times a day for ten days. It's important to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. I'm also going to recommend using a nasal saline rinse twice a day. You can purchase this over-the-counter at most pharmacies. It will help to clear the congestion and inflammation in your nasal passages. Here are your prescriptions. Please take them to your pharmacy as soon as possible. I'll also have the nursing staff schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to see how you're doing and discuss the CT scan results. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. Thank you so much for your help. You have made me feel much better, just talking to you. I will follow your instructions carefully. And I will call if I get worse. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if your symptoms don’t improve. Get well soon, and take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
