DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Pitmon. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. A lot of it. It’s quite embarrassing, really. More than usual, you understand. I am hoping you can help.
DOCTOR: “A lot of gas,” you say. Right. Well, many things can cause that. It’s rarely…serious, thankfully. But we should figure out why it’s happening. When did you first notice this increase?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it started, I believe, about three weeks ago? Perhaps a little longer. It was gradual at first, just a little more than usual after lunch. Now… it is all the time. Even in the mornings, before I eat anything! It is very strange. I have not changed my diet, not really. Same foods, same amounts, you understand.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, gradually worsening…and no dietary changes. Okay. And is this gas…painful?
PATIENT: Painful is… a strong word, Doctor. It is not sharp pain, you understand. More… uncomfortable. Bloated, you might say. And sometimes, it feels like… a twisting inside. Not bad, but… noticeable. And the sound… well, that is the most embarrassing part. It is quite loud, sometimes. Especially when I try to be quiet.
DOCTOR: Bloated, twisting… loud. Right. Okay. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me consider. I have been… a little more tired than usual, perhaps. But I work at the diner, you understand, and that is a tiring job. So, it is hard to say if that is new, or just the job. My… bowel movements have been regular, if that is what you mean. Not constipation, or diarrhea, you understand. Just… normal. Except for the gas, of course.
DOCTOR: “Normal” bowel movements are good, at least. The tiredness… could be a lot of things, honestly. Diner work is demanding. But let’s not dismiss it entirely. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, Doctor. If anything, I have gained a little weight, you understand? Diner food is… tempting. And I do not get much exercise, sadly. I walk to work, but that is about it. I weigh about one hundred and twenty-nine pounds. I haven’t weighed myself recently, but it’s about the same, maybe a pound or two more.
DOCTOR: Okay. No weight loss, consistent weight. And you said you haven't changed your diet. Are you taking any new medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No new medications, no vitamins, nothing like that. I just take a multivitamin sometimes, the cheap kind from the drugstore. I haven't taken one in… well, a few weeks, probably. I forget things easily, you understand. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, though. Just the over-the-counter kind.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of things. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and feel around a bit. Nothing to worry about, just standard procedure. Do you have any tenderness anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: Tenderness… hmm. Sometimes, if I press here, on my lower left side, it feels a little… uncomfortable. Not pain, you understand, just… a pressure. It comes and goes. It is not constant. And it is only when I press firmly.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower left quadrant tenderness. Alright, if you don’t mind, please lie down on the exam table. I’ll start listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Bowel sounds are present, normal activity, though a bit…gurgly. No significant masses palpated. Tenderness is mild in the left lower quadrant, as you described. No rebound tenderness, which is good. Based on what you've told me and this quick exam, it could be something as simple as an excess of gas, possibly related to the bacteria in your gut. However, the tenderness is worth investigating further. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. I’d also like to check a stool sample to rule out any infections.
PATIENT: A stool sample? Oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. But if you think it is necessary, Doctor, I will do it. I trust your judgement. What exactly will these tests tell us, you understand? And will they be… painful? I am a little worried.
DOCTOR: The stool sample will help us rule out any bacterial infections or parasites that could be causing the gas and tenderness. The blood tests will give us a broader picture of your overall health and rule out any other underlying issues. Neither test is painful. The stool sample involves collecting a small sample at home, and the blood tests will be a simple needle prick. Honestly, it’s nothing to worry about. I'll also give you a prescription for simethicone, an over-the-counter gas reliever. Take it as directed. If the symptoms don't improve within a week, or if they worsen, we’ll need to consider further investigation, perhaps a colonoscopy. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Oh my. That sounds… quite serious. But I understand you want to be thorough, Doctor. Simethicone… I think I have seen that at the drugstore. I will try that, certainly. And I will collect the stool sample as soon as possible. So, to be clear, you are not certain it is serious, but you want to rule things out?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, Mr. Goodstein. Most likely, it’s just an upset stomach. But it’s my job to rule out anything more concerning, and these tests will help me do that. I'll have the nurse explain how to collect the stool sample and give you the requisition forms for the blood tests. If you experience any fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything, thankfully. You have been very helpful, even if the tests sound… unpleasant. I will follow your instructions carefully and try not to worry too much. Thank you for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly. Try to relax, Mr. Goodstein. And remember, if anything changes, don't hesitate to contact us. .
