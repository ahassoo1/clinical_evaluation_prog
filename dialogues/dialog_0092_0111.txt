DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Though I confess, I’d rather not be here. It’s…well, it’s this skin of mine. It’s darkening. And frankly, I’m tired. Very tired. I don’t understand why a man of my age needs to be bothered with such…complications. Let’s get this over with quickly, shall we?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. It’s never pleasant to deal with new health concerns, especially as we get older. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. When you say your skin is darkening, can you tell me where on your body this is happening?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, Doctor, everywhere. Arms, face…perhaps not so much the legs. It’s difficult to say precisely. I haven’t been…observing myself in a mirror, if you must know. A man has better things to do than fret over his complexion. It just…happened gradually. And with the fatigue, it's quite unsettling. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. “Gradually” is helpful. And I assure you, we'll try to be as efficient as possible. To get a better understanding, could you describe the color change?
PATIENT: Color change? What do you think it is, Doctor? It’s darker! A shade…less vibrant, if you will. Like old wood, perhaps. Not a pleasant comparison, I admit. Honestly, I don’t have time for descriptions. Is it serious? That's what I want to know. Is it something…contagious? My wife wouldn’t be pleased.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Drahota. We’ll get to the bottom of this. It's good you mentioned your wife, we’ll certainly consider that. To rule out various possibilities, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite…well, it’s not what it used to be. Everything tastes…bland. And yes, I believe I’ve lost a bit of weight. Not drastically, mind you. Just…enough to make my trousers a little looser. I attribute it to the fatigue, naturally. A man doesn't have much inclination for a hearty meal when he's constantly tired. This is all rather obvious, isn't it? Are we any closer to a diagnosis?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have that information, Mr. Drahota. It helps us build a clearer picture. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the darkening skin and fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me think. Everything aches, Doctor. Just a general…weariness. And I’ve been…a little short of breath lately. Nothing alarming, mind you. Just when I exert myself. Walking up the stairs, for example. Or carrying groceries. My wife does most of the heavy lifting these days, thankfully. Honestly, at my age, everything feels like a symptom. Is there a simple explanation for all this, or am I facing some…terminal illness? Don't beat around the bush, Doctor. I prefer directness.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for directness, Mr. Drahota. We are not at a point to discuss terminal illness, but these are all important symptoms to investigate. To help me narrow down the possibilities, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Past conditions? Oh, the usual aches and pains of a long life, Doctor. Nothing of consequence. I had a touch of the flu, perhaps, many years ago. And a bad back once, from lifting steel. But nothing that required…extensive medical attention. I’ve always been a strong man. I took care of myself. This whole situation is quite…unsettling. Are we finished yet? I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to get back to your garden, Mr. Drahota. Before we proceed, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized…Let me see. No, no surgeries. Never had a need for them. As for hospitalization…there was that time, decades ago, when I strained my shoulder at work. Spent a night at the company clinic, but it wasn't a real hospital. Just a cot and a bandage. Other than that, nothing. I pride myself on my good health, despite this…current predicament. Truly, I fail to see what all the fuss is about. It's just a bit of darkening skin and some fatigue. Is this going to require blood tests, Doctor? I loathe needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your dislike of needles, Mr. Drahota. We may need to draw some blood to help us understand what's going on. It’s important to rule out different possibilities. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no! A strong constitution, I tell you! I've eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, from street food in Shanghai to…well, never mind. I've never reacted to anything. I suspect this whole situation is simply a sign of old age. A bit of wear and tear, if you will. I fail to see the need for all these…probes and tests. Are we getting anywhere, Doctor? Or are we simply chasing shadows? .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. While age is certainly a factor, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. To get a better understanding, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and taking a look at your skin more closely. Is that alright with you?
