DOCTOR: Hi Lyman, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. It’s been… well, I don’t rightly remember when it started, to be honest. Seems like a long time. I just want to get it looked at, if you can help. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Not a bother at all, Lyman. We're here to help. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Okay, so a shaking in your hands… and you said it’s been going on for a while. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. It’s worse when I try to do things, you know? Like… holding a cup of coffee. Or writing. Though, I don't do much writing these days. It’s just… a tremor. A wobble. Not constant, but… frequent enough to be annoying. And it seems to be getting… more noticeable, maybe? I’m not sure. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating, especially when it interferes with everyday tasks. And it's completely normal for things to feel less certain as we get older, memory-wise. So, a tremor that's worse with activity, like holding a cup or writing, and you're noticing it seems to be increasing… Is it in both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Though… the right one is usually worse. It’s hard to say for sure, sometimes. I don't really focus on it until it's bothering me, you know? Then I realize it's happening in both. It's not… painful, if that makes sense. Just… shaky. And embarrassing, sometimes, when I’m trying to eat.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Not painful, just shaky and sometimes embarrassing. Okay. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed… besides the shaking? Let me think… well, I retired a few years back. From the water treatment plant. That was… a long time ago. Divorced, too, years and years ago. Not much has been new lately. Just… getting older, I suppose. I haven’t been feeling particularly sick, if that’s what you mean. No fever, no cough, nothing like that. Just… tired, sometimes. But who isn’t, at my age?
DOCTOR: Okay, retired from the water treatment plant, divorced some time ago, and generally feeling tired, which is understandable. No fever or cough. Has the tiredness been new, or has that been a long-standing thing as well?
PATIENT: Oh, the tiredness… that’s probably been building up for a while, now that I think about it. It’s not sudden, like a cold or something. It’s more like… a general lack of energy. Hard to get motivated, you know? I mostly just sit around these days. Not much to do, not much want to do. I don't really have family nearby anymore, either. Just me, mostly.
DOCTOR: I see. A gradual decrease in energy and motivation, and you’re mostly on your own these days. Okay. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… I feel a little… off-balance, maybe? Not falling or anything, but like I could stumble easier than I used to. And my handwriting… well, it was never good, but it's gotten even more scribbly lately. Hard to read, even for me. And… sometimes I feel a bit stiff, especially in my hands and arms. But that could just be from sitting around too much. I don’t know. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what's normal at this age and what isn’t.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Lyman. Feeling off-balance, handwriting changes, and some stiffness… those are all things we need to explore. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, years ago. They gave me pills for it. I think I stopped taking them, though. It’s been so long, I can’t really remember. Nothing serious, not that I recall. No diabetes, no heart problems… I don't think. I had a bad knee once, from playing football when I was young, but that’s been fixed. Everything else… mostly just aches and pains. Old age, you know? I doubt any of it’s connected to this shaking. .
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure, treated with medication in the past, but you think you may have stopped taking it. Knee surgery previously, but otherwise mostly just aches and pains. Alright, Lyman. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
