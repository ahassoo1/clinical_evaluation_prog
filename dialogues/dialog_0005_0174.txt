DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven't been myself lately. It’s…difficult to explain. Just a general feeling of being down, I suppose. I don’t usually bother doctors with feelings, but my daughter insisted. She said I should come.
DOCTOR: “Down,” alright. It's good your daughter encouraged you to come in. Feelings are important, even if they don’t have a clear physical cause. “General feeling of being down” is…vague, though. Can you tell me a little more specifically what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specifics… Let me see. It’s like… everything feels a bit gray, you understand? Not necessarily sad, just… lacking color. And I don’t enjoy things as much. I used to love my garden, but now… even tending to it feels like a chore. I find myself just… sitting. A lot. It’s been going on for… oh, a few months, I’d say. Perhaps longer. It’s hard to keep track these days.
DOCTOR: A few months… alright. Loss of enjoyment, increased sitting… those are things we need to explore. Do you find yourself sleeping more or less than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, sleeping. That’s a good question. I think… less, perhaps? I used to sleep like a log, but now I wake up in the middle of the night quite often. And then I just… lie there. Thinking. It's not necessarily worrying thoughts, just… thoughts. About things. Old things, mostly. And sometimes, I just can’t get back to sleep.
DOCTOR: “Old things,” right. And are you eating normally?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I still eat. My appetite hasn’t suffered, thank goodness. Though I don't have much desire for anything particularly. My daughter keeps trying to get me to eat more fruit, says it will “lift my spirits”. She means well, but honestly, a mango isn’t going to solve anything. I prepare my meals, eat enough to keep going, and then… well, you know. Just existing.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no significant change in appetite, just a lack of enjoyment… We need to rule out anything physical contributing to this. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes… Let me think. My knees have been acting up more lately. Ski patrol isn't what it used to be, even just helping out with the beginners. And I get tired easily. But that could just be my age, I suppose. I'm seventy-five, after all. Everything starts to… wear down eventually. I don't want to waste your time with old age aches and pains, Doctor.
DOCTOR: “Old age aches and pains” are still worth noting, Mrs. Derasmo. It's my job to consider everything. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. A quick exam. I suppose that’s sensible. It’s been a while since I’ve had a proper check-up. Just point me where you'd like me to go. I hope it won't take too long, Doctor. I have a bit of a schedule today.
DOCTOR: If you don't mind. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then we'll check your knees. Try not to tense up, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood pressure first, is it? Honestly, I’m not one for doctors. Always poking and prodding. But if you say it’s necessary... Just get it over with quickly, if you would be so kind.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 76, regular. There's some crepitus and tenderness here, on the medial side of both knees. Range of motion is slightly limited. Do you experience any pain when you walk or climb stairs?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Especially stairs. And first thing in the morning. Everything’s stiff, you see? It loosens up a little after I’ve been moving around for a bit, but it’s always there, nagging at me. It's the price of a life spent outdoors, I suppose. Ski patrol, lifeguarding… it’s good work, but it takes its toll on the body.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the knee pain is consistent with osteoarthritis, not surprising given your history. Now, back to why you’re really here… this feeling of being “down.” Have you experienced any thoughts of harming yourself, or feeling like life isn’t worth living?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. Never. I may not be enjoying things as much, and I may sit around more than I used to, but I certainly wouldn’t… harm myself. That’s a dreadful thought. I have my daughter, my grandchildren… I wouldn't do that to them. It’s just… a lack of spark, that’s all. A bit of melancholy. But harming myself? Heavens, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing symptoms of mild depression. It's common, especially as we age. I'm going to recommend a blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this – things like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. And I'm also going to suggest a referral to a therapist. They can help you develop coping strategies and address these feelings of melancholy.
PATIENT: A therapist? Oh, Doctor, I don’t know about that. I’ve never been one for talking about my feelings. Seems a bit… unnecessary, if you ask me. And a blood test… Very well, if you insist. But I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Derasmo, I understand your hesitation, but talking is often the first step. It's not about "unnecessary" feelings, it’s about addressing a potential health issue. The blood test is standard procedure. I'll write the orders now. The lab is just down the hall. And I'll have the nurse schedule you for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and the therapist referral. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… try to make it quick, if you could. And please, don't keep me waiting too long for the results. I have a life to get back to, you see. Thank you for your time. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day, Mrs. Derasmo. .
