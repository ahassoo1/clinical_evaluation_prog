DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I wish I didn't have to be here. It's…well, it's quite inconvenient, really. Things just aren’t working properly, if you understand. My vision, and my hearing…they’ve both gone rather suddenly. It’s most unsettling.
DOCTOR: “Not working properly,” is a bit vague, Ms. Julie. Suddenly, as in…over what time frame?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Honestly, I haven’t the slightest idea. A few days, perhaps? It’s all a blur, truly. I have a very busy schedule, you see. Important things to attend to. I don't spend my time cataloging the decline of my senses. It just…happened. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, while I understand you are busy, a timeframe is important for me to understand what might be going on. “A few days” could mean anything. Was it a gradual decline, or did it happen all at once?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are we going to spend the entire morning dissecting the precise moment my hearing and vision faded? It was…quick. A noticeable difference. That’s all I can tell you. I’m a surgeon, not a clock! I deal with precision, you should be the one asking the detailed questions and diagnosing the problem, not quizzing me on my personal timeline. It’s rather…disconcerting, frankly.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Julie. Let’s move on, then. You mentioned both vision and hearing. Let’s start with your vision. Is it blurry?
PATIENT: Yes, it's…unfocused. Everything seems rather…washed out. Like looking through a dirty window, if that makes sense. It’s quite bothersome when I’m operating, naturally. Though, I suppose I’m still managing, despite the…inconvenience. I’ve always had excellent eyesight, so this is particularly…unsettling.
DOCTOR: "Blurred vision, feels like looking through a dirty window." Is this in both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, really, Doctor? Must I explain everything? Both, of course. I don’t think I’d be bothering you if it was only one eye, would I? It’s rather obvious, isn’t it? I expect a certain level of competence, frankly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. Apologies. Just trying to gather all the information. Do you have any pain in either eye?
PATIENT: Pain? No, absolutely not. Good heavens, no. Just…blurriness. It’s a visual problem, Doctor, not a…physical one. I’m a surgeon, remember? I know the difference between a failing sense and a genuine ailment. It’s most frustrating to have to explain such elementary concepts.
DOCTOR: “No pain with blurred vision, bilaterally.” Alright. And what about your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, that's even more unpleasant. Everything sounds… muffled. Distant. Like someone is speaking through several layers of cotton. I had a lovely concert planned for next week, and frankly, I doubt I’ll be able to enjoy it at this rate. It’s… quite devastating, really. Not just for me, naturally, but for the musicians as well. A wasted performance.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing in both ears?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor, must we continue this tedious interrogation? Yes, both ears. If it was just one, do you honestly believe I’d be wasting my valuable time here? It’s quite simple, really. A general decline in sensory perception. A most inconvenient development. I've a very important board meeting next week and this is...distracting, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand you are busy and frustrated. However, these symptoms – a sudden decline in both vision and hearing – can be indicative of a number of things, some of which are quite serious. To properly assess what’s going on, I need to ask more detailed questions, and I will need to perform a physical examination. Would you allow me to do that?
PATIENT: Honestly. Well. I suppose I haven’t much choice, have I? But do try to be quick. I have a schedule to maintain, you know. And please, refrain from any unnecessary…prodding. I’m a surgeon, Doctor. I’m quite sensitive. Proceed, then. But swiftly. Very swiftly.
DOCTOR: Very well. First, I'd like to check your pupils and do a basic visual acuity test. Could you please follow my finger as I move it in front of your face?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Must I actively participate in this charade? Fine. But do try not to wave it about like a… a conductor’s baton. Just… move it steadily. And quickly, please. I haven’t all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, could you read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Is this really necessary? Fine. “P… T… F… R…” Honestly, Doctor, the lighting in here is dreadful. It’s making it rather difficult to discern the shapes. It's all terribly blurry, as I’ve already explained. And the letters are so…small! See? Perfectly dreadful. I can barely make them out. It's a waste of time, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your hearing. I'm going to listen to some sounds in each ear with this otoscope. Just let me know when you hear them, even if they are faint.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor. The indignity of it all. Fine. But if it's a high-pitched squeal, I’m warning you now, I won't be responsible for my reaction. Hurry up, please. I have a rather important phone call scheduled shortly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now the left ear. Alright, Ms. Julie. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and do a brief neurological exam. Can you please sit up straight and relax your arms?
PATIENT: Oh, must we? Really, Doctor, I'm a surgeon, not a…a laboratory specimen. Very well. But do try to be gentle. I have sensitive hands, you know. And please, no sudden movements. Get on with it. Quickly. I haven't got all day. And frankly, this is all rather unsettling. I expect a thorough explanation afterward, of course.
