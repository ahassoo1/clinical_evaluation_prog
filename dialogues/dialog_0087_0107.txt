DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Soodeen. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thank you. My heart... it feels like it’s flapping sometimes. Not always, but it happens. Like a bird inside, maybe? It’s a little scary.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Flapping,” you say. Can you describe that sensation a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm... okay. It’s fast, you know? Regular, but fast. Not a thump-thump, more like... thump-thump-thump-thump-thump. And sometimes it feels like it skips a beat, then goes really fast again. It doesn't hurt, just… weird. It lasts maybe a minute, sometimes longer. Then it stops, and everything is normal for a while.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a fast, regular heartbeat with occasional skipped beats, lasting a minute or longer. And it doesn’t cause any pain?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Just... makes me feel funny. A little weak, maybe. Like I walked up a lot of stairs quickly. And I get a little short of breath when it’s happening. Not bad short of breath, just… I need to take a bigger breath than normal. It started, I think, maybe a month ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. It happens at different times. Sometimes when I’m just sitting, sometimes when I’m working. I work with... with machines, big metal things. Not too much lifting, mostly checking dials and things. It doesn't seem to matter. I haven’t noticed anything that makes it happen. Just... happens. It worries my wife a little, she says I look pale when it starts.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it seems to be occurring somewhat randomly, regardless of activity. And your wife has observed some paleness during these episodes. Have you had any other symptoms accompanying these heart palpitations?
PATIENT: No, not really. No dizziness, no sweating. Just the fast heart and feeling a little short of breath, like I said. And tired after it’s done. Like I used a lot of energy. My wife asks if I'm sleeping okay, but I think I am. I haven’t felt sick or anything like that. Oh! Wait… sometimes my chest feels a little… tight. Not painful tight, just… squeezed. But it goes away when the heart stops flapping.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest tightness that resolves with the palpitations. Good to know. Now, let's go over some medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart conditions before, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. No one in my family has heart trouble, as far as I know. My mother… she had high blood pressure, but not heart problems. I haven’t been to a doctor much, to be honest. Just when I broke my arm when I was a boy. I’ve felt okay, mostly. This heart thing… it’s new. It just started a month ago, like I said. I don’t take any medicine, nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior heart diagnosis, no family history of heart disease, and no current medications. And you haven't had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Just the broken arm when I was a kid. They put a cast on it. That's it. I've been lucky, I guess. I work with machines, so I’m careful. We have safety rules. But this… this heart thing scares me a little. My wife keeps telling me to come see a doctor. She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: It’s good you came in, Mr. Puder, and it's smart of your wife to encourage you. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some possible causes and next steps. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. I just want to know what’s going on. Anything you need me to do, just tell me. I'm ready. I hope it’s not too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll please have a seat on the table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. I'll also take a quick look at your thyroid. Just relax, and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is currently 88 and regular. Heart sounds… I do hear a slightly rapid rate, but no murmurs or extra sounds at this moment. Your thyroid feels normal. I’m going to listen to your lungs now. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to have you take a few deep breaths while I listen again.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Deep breaths. Like this? Is that okay? I’m not very good at this. I’ve never had a doctor listen to my lungs before. Everything feels normal to me. It’s just… this flapping is strange. It makes me worry. I hope it's not something serious. My wife… she worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Mr. Puder. Your lungs sound clear, even with the deep breaths. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to feel your pulse in your ankles and check for any swelling. Pulses are good and equal on both sides. No swelling in your ankles. Everything seems normal on the physical exam at this moment, but we need to investigate further to understand what's causing these palpitations. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had a problem with medicine before. I haven’t taken much, to be honest, but I haven’t had any bad reactions. Just… this heart thing. It’s different. I hope it’s not too serious. My wife… she said it could be stress. I don’t feel very stressed, but I work with big machines. Maybe she’s right. It’s just… I don’t know. What do you think it could be?
DOCTOR: It could be stress, Mr. Puder, but we need to rule out other possibilities. The symptoms you’re describing—fast heart rate, palpitations, occasional chest tightness—could be caused by several things. One common possibility is an arrhythmia, an irregular heartbeat. It's also possible it's related to something else entirely. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to record your heart’s electrical activity. I also want to do some blood work to check your electrolytes, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An EKG… and blood work? Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what’s going on. An EKG… is that painful? Will it take a long time? I have to go back to work this afternoon. I hope it doesn't take too long. My wife… she’ll worry if I’m gone too long.
DOCTOR: No, an EKG is not painful at all, Mr. Puder. It’s a very simple test. We’ll just place some small stickers, called electrodes, on your chest, arms, and legs. It doesn't take long, maybe five to ten minutes. The blood work will also be relatively quick—we’ll just need a small sample from your arm. I’ll have the lab draw it after the EKG. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. EKG and blood work. No pain. And if I feel really bad, go to the hospital. Okay. Just… I hope it’s not too serious. And I hope my wife doesn’t worry too much. She gets very worried sometimes. Alright, let's do the EKG. Whatever you need me to do, just tell me. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Puder. I appreciate your trust. Now, just lie still and breathe normally. I’m going to start the recording now. Alright, we have the EKG. Now, let’s go ahead and get that blood work done. The lab is just down the hall.
