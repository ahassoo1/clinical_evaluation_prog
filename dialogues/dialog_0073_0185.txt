DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ambris. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my breath. It smells bad. Really bad. My ex-husband… well, let’s just say that was a contributing factor to everything. It's probably nothing, honestly, but I need it fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, “bad breath” can have a number of causes, Ms. Ambris. It’s good you’re addressing it. It’s rarely “nothing,” as you say. To help me understand, can you describe the smell?
PATIENT: Describe it? Seriously? It smells… bad. Like, old food and… something else. I don’t know, just unpleasant. I brush, okay? I really do. And it’s not like, always there, but it is a lot. Especially in the mornings, obviously. Do I need to give you a full olfactory rundown? This is kind of embarrassing, you know.
DOCTOR: No, a full rundown isn’t necessary, Ms. Ambris. I understand it's unpleasant to discuss. “Old food” is a helpful start. And you brush regularly. Is it just mornings, or are there other times it’s noticeable?
PATIENT: It’s… after I eat, sometimes. Especially if it’s something…strong. Garlic, onions, you know. Normal stuff. And… okay, fine, sometimes after I have a cigarette, too. But I don’t smoke that much. Look, is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, worse after certain foods, and potentially with smoking. It’s good you're being forthcoming. Smoking certainly can contribute. We need to rule out some other possibilities, though. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…what kind of symptoms? I don't have a fever or anything. My gums don't bleed, if that's what you’re getting at. I just want my breath to smell better, not a whole medical examination. It’s probably just…food stuck in my teeth. Can’t you just check for that?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, I appreciate your…directness. But bad breath, or halitosis, isn't always just food. It can indicate underlying issues. A quick check for food particles is certainly reasonable, but I need a bit more information first. Do you have any nasal congestion, postnasal drip, or a dry mouth?
PATIENT: Ugh, dry mouth, sometimes. I mean, who doesn’t get a dry mouth? Especially when I’m stressed. And…okay, yes, sometimes my nose feels a little stuffed up, especially in the winter. But that’s just allergies. Everyone gets allergies. Are we getting anywhere with this? I really don’t have time for a mystery here. It’s bad breath, not a complicated disease.
DOCTOR: Allergies and dry mouth… alright. And do you experience any sort of taste changes?
PATIENT: Taste changes? What do you mean? Like, do things taste different? I don't know. Everything tastes…normal. I eat food, it tastes like food. I'm not a wine connoisseur, okay? I don't need to dissect every single flavor nuance. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Is this covered by insurance? Because I don’t have any.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, I understand your frustration, but I need to gather information to determine the cause of the halitosis, not simply treat a symptom. Since you don’t have insurance, we’ll keep this focused. Let’s proceed with a brief oral examination. Then, I think we should check your oxygen saturation and I’ll listen to your lungs. It’s a quick procedure, and will give us a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick. Seriously. Oxygen saturation? Lungs? What does my breath have to do with my lungs? This is escalating. I just want this over with. Yes, do whatever you need to do, but hurry up about it. I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please open your mouth wide for me. Hmm. Your gums appear healthy, no obvious signs of infection or decay. Your tongue does have a coating, which can contribute to bad breath. Okay, please take a deep breath…and exhale. Lungs sound clear. Oxygen saturation is 98%, which is normal. Now, can you tell me, do you ever have heartburn or acid reflux?
PATIENT: Heartburn? Sometimes. I mean, who doesn't get heartburn? Especially if I eat something spicy or…look, I eat normal food. Not a pristine diet, okay? It’s not a constant thing. It happens. But it doesn't feel like it's related to my breath. It feels like it’s just…in my chest. Look, can we just skip the twenty questions and get to a solution? Is it something I can buy at the drugstore or what?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, intermittent heartburn can contribute to halitosis. Okay. It’s likely a combination of factors – the coating on your tongue, the dry mouth, the occasional heartburn, and potentially, your smoking. I recommend a comprehensive oral hygiene routine: brush at least twice a day, floss daily, and use a tongue scraper to remove the coating on your tongue. An alcohol-free mouthwash can help temporarily freshen your breath, but it won’t address the underlying cause. I also strongly advise reducing or eliminating smoking. If the heartburn persists, an over-the-counter antacid may provide relief, but if it's frequent or severe, you should consult a gastroenterologist. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Brush, floss, scrape my tongue, don’t smoke… basically, live a perfect life. Look, I get it. I'll try to do all that stuff. Is that it? Can I go now? This has taken long enough. I'm not promising anything about the smoking, okay? It helps with stress. But yeah, I guess I'll buy a tongue scraper. And maybe some mouthwash. Now, can I just get a printout of all this, so I don't have to remember everything?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. It details the oral hygiene routine, as well as information about smoking cessation resources. I've also written down a summary of our discussion. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop any new concerns, please seek medical attention. Do you have any further questions for me, Ms. Ambris?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. I think I've got it. Brush, floss, scrape, don't smoke, don't get heartburn. Got it. Thanks. I mean… thanks. Now, if you'll excuse me… .
