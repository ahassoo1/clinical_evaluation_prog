DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s hard to explain, really. Things just haven’t been right. My hearing… it comes and goes. And with it, a sort of spinning feeling. Like the room is tilting. It’s happened a few times now. My daughter, Lani, she’s the one who really made me come. She worries. And, um, my husband… he had something similar before he passed. It’s all a bit blurry, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds unsettling when your hearing and balance are off and especially with your husband’s history. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s been going on. When did you first start noticing this hearing and spinning sensation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a good question. It wasn't all at once, you see. It started… maybe six months ago? Or was it eight? Time just… slips away. I think it was after that big storm we had. But the first real episode… I remember feeling quite sick to my stomach with it. Like being on a boat. Does that make sense? It didn’t last long, just a few hours. But then it happened again… a month later, maybe? I really can't say for sure. It's not something I kept track of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting around six to eight months ago, possibly after the storm, and then recurring. And you've experienced nausea with these episodes. Is the spinning sensation constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, no, it's not constant, thank goodness! If it was, I wouldn't be able to do a thing. It comes in waves, you see. Like… a dizzy spell, but much stronger. It can last anywhere from a few minutes to… well, half a day once, I think. Then it just… stops. And my hearing… that goes with it. Sometimes it's muffled, sometimes it's like there's cotton in my ears. It always comes back, though. Eventually. It’s just… unsettling not knowing when.
DOCTOR: Alright, so the episodes vary in length, from minutes to half a day, and are accompanied by fluctuating hearing – muffled or feeling of fullness. Do you notice anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's… a tricky one. I haven't really noticed a pattern, no. It doesn’t seem to be connected to anything I do. I’ve tried thinking about it… Sometimes it happens when I’m just resting. Other times I’m busy, doing things around the house. I work part-time at the casino, you know, running numbers... it’s never happened at work, thankfully. I haven't noticed anything specific that sets it off, Doctor. It just… happens. It's very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay. No obvious triggers identified. And it hasn’t interfered with your work at the casino. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the dizziness and hearing loss?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my head feels a bit… full. Like pressure. And I've been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, at my age, who isn't tired? Oh, and this might not be important, but I’ve been a bit clumsy lately. Dropping things, bumping into furniture… Lani says I seem a little unsteady on my feet even between episodes. But that could just be me getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, so pressure in your head, increased fatigue, and some unsteadiness noticed by your daughter. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'd like to check your ears, eyes, and do a few balance tests. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… please be gentle, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive. And I'm not very good at standing on one leg, even when I am feeling well!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh. Let’s start with your ears. Your ear canals look clear, no sign of infection. The eardrums themselves appear intact, though they are a bit… dull in color. Your eyes are moving normally, no signs of any unusual drift. Now, let's try a few balance tests. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Here we go. Alright… I’m standing. Be careful, now. I’m not as steady as I used to be. I’m a little nervous, you know. It’s silly, but I don’t like feeling like I’m going to fall.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Ms. Mayhugh. Just focus on a point in front of you. Now, could you close your eyes and stand still for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Oh dear… This isn't going well, is it? It's harder with my eyes closed. I feel like I'm going to… I feel a bit wobbly. Are you seeing this? I’m trying, Doctor, I really am. It’s just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see, Ms. Mayhugh. You have some difficulty maintaining balance with your eyes closed. Okay, please sit down. That was good. Now, let’s check your hearing a bit more formally. I’m going to use an audiometer to play some tones at different frequencies and volumes. You just tell me when you hear them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That sounds… less scary than standing on one leg, at least. Tones, alright. I can do tones. Just tell me when you hear them, you said? Alright, go ahead. I hope I don't miss too many. My hearing isn't what it used to be, you know. And sometimes it’s just… muffled, like someone’s stuffed cotton in my ears.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh, please raise your hand whenever you hear a tone, no matter how faint. Alright, that's enough for now. The results show a mild to moderate hearing loss, primarily in the lower frequencies. It’s more pronounced in your left ear. This aligns with what you’ve described. Now, based on your symptoms – the episodic dizziness, fluctuating hearing loss, nausea, and the results of the exam – it’s highly suggestive of Ménière's disease. Does that name sound familiar?
PATIENT: Ménière’s…? The name… no, it doesn’t ring a bell. But my husband… Harold… he… He had something… something with his ears. He used to get so dizzy. He went to a specialist, I think. And something about fluid… in his ear? He used to complain about a roaring sound too, a buzzing. Is that… is that part of it? Oh dear, it's all so blurry. I remember him being very unwell, and a lot of appointments. Could it be the same thing?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Mayhugh, it certainly sounds like it could be. Harold’s symptoms – the dizziness, the buzzing sound, the ear problems – are all consistent with Ménière's disease. It’s a disorder of the inner ear that causes episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus – that buzzing sound – and a feeling of fullness in the ear. It's often sporadic, with periods of remission and exacerbation. We’ll need to do some further testing to confirm the diagnosis, including an MRI to rule out other causes. But based on what you’ve told me and the initial examination, it’s a strong possibility. Now, there's no cure for Ménière's, but we can manage the symptoms to improve your quality of life. Would you like me to explain some of the treatment options?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Harold… well, that explains a lot. It’s just… a bit frightening to think it might be the same thing. Treatment… yes, please. If there's something that can help, I would like to know. I don't want to end up like Harold, if I can avoid it. What sort of things are we talking about? Pills? More tests? I don’t mind, as long as it helps. I just want to feel… steady again. And be able to hear my grandchildren properly. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Mayhugh, that’s not too much to ask at all. And we’ll do everything we can to help you feel steady again and hear your grandchildren. The treatment for Ménière's disease typically involves a combination of strategies. First, we’ll likely prescribe some medications to help reduce the fluid buildup in the inner ear and manage the nausea during an attack. These are usually diuretics – water pills – and anti-nausea medications. Second, we can explore dietary changes, such as reducing your salt intake, as salt can contribute to fluid retention. Third, we’ll discuss strategies for managing your stress, as stress can often worsen the symptoms. And fourth, in some cases, we may consider injections into the inner ear to help reduce the vertigo. The MRI will help us rule out other potential causes of your symptoms and ensure that we are on the right track. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Pills, less salt, less stress… injections… It sounds… complicated. Less salt, I can manage, I suppose. And I will try to take it easy. But stress… well, that’s easier said than done. I worry about my family, you know? And I don’t want to be a burden. The injections… Those sound… frightening. Are they painful? What if they don’t work? Oh dear, I’m getting anxious just thinking about it. Perhaps we should start with the pills and the salt? And see how that goes? I’m not sure I’m ready for injections just yet.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. We’ll start slowly, and we’ll take things one step at a time. We'll begin with the medications and dietary changes, and we'll monitor your symptoms closely. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing. And we can discuss the MRI then, as well. The injections are usually reserved for more severe cases that don't respond to other treatments, so we don't need to worry about those right now. I’m going to write you a prescription for a diuretic and an anti-nausea medication. The prescription will also include some instructions on how to take the medications and some tips for reducing your salt intake. And I'll give you a handout with more information about Ménière's disease and strategies for managing your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all for now. Just… one small thing. Will this… will this affect my hearing permanently? I enjoy listening to the radio, and talking to my grandchildren on the phone. I’d hate to lose that. It's a silly worry, I know, but… And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. It’s nice to finally know what’s been going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s completely understandable to be worried about your hearing. The hearing loss associated with Ménière's disease can fluctuate, and it doesn’t always progress. With proper management, we can often slow down or even prevent further hearing loss. We'll monitor your hearing regularly, and if it does worsen, we can discuss options such as hearing aids. Now, I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And remember to take the medications as prescribed and try to reduce your salt intake. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m confident that we can get your symptoms under control and improve your quality of life. And don't worry too much. We'll take things one step at a time.
PATIENT: .
