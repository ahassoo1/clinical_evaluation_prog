DOCTOR: Hi Ardelle, it's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s… well, it’s just this tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it really comes. Like someone switched off a light. And the young man at the lab said something about… numbers. Numbers being wrong, he said. Honestly, all this modern testing… back in my day, a good rest and some tea sorted most things.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating, especially with the lab results adding to the confusion. It’s good you went for testing, though—it gives us a better picture of what's going on. When you say “comes and goes,” about how long does this tiredness usually last when it hits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… that’s a good question. Not long, not long at all. A few days, maybe? It’s hard to say. Things just… blur together these days. My husband, Tenzin, he mostly notices it. He says I sleep all the time when it happens, and then I just… don't have the energy for anything. Even my garden suffers, and I love my garden. It's very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few days at a time, and Tenzin notices you sleeping more. That's helpful to know. And it definitely sounds concerning that it's impacting things you enjoy, like your garden. Besides the tiredness and extra sleep, have you noticed any other changes when this happens?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, my muscles feel… weak, I suppose. Like they're made of water. Getting up from a chair is a bit of a struggle sometimes, and I’ve dropped a few things. Not important things, thankfully. Just… small things. And sometimes, a little bit of a pain in my arms and legs. It's not sharp, just… a dull ache. Honestly, I thought it was just old age creeping up on me. Is that what it is?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re telling me all of this, Ardelle. It's never just old age! Weakness, dropping things, and those aches in your arms and legs are all things we need to look into. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any health conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a lot of questions. My history… Well, I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder, years and years ago. They took it out. And I’ve always had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, it goes up and down. Nothing major, the doctor always said. And my knees, naturally. Everyone gets bad knees when they get to be my age. Tenzin handles all the paperwork, so I don't really keep track of everything. Is this all important?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is all important, thank you for sharing. The gallbladder removal and blood pressure are good to know, and it’s not unusual to have knee trouble as we age. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think... Tenzin gives me a little orange pill every morning. He says it’s for my blood pressure, but I forget the name. It’s something long and complicated. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take some of those over-the-counter things… you know, the ones with ibuprofen in them? But that's about it, really. I don’t like taking too many pills. They make me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, an orange pill for blood pressure and ibuprofen for your knees when needed. We’ll try to figure out exactly what that orange pill is. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Allergies… no, not that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, you know? Travelled a bit when I was younger. Tenzin always makes sure I don't eat anything too spicy, but that's just because he worries about my stomach. I think I might have reacted to something once, a long time ago… a rash, maybe? But it wasn’t serious. Honestly, I don’t recall the details. It was a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and a possible rash a long time ago. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a difficult one. My parents, they passed away a long time ago, when I was still young. I didn’t know them well enough to know about any… family troubles, shall we say? Tenzin’s family… they were farmers, mostly. Healthy people, I think. But there was an uncle, on his mother’s side, who had something… with his heart, I believe. But I’m not certain. Details are… hazy. I never paid much attention to those things, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's alright, it's not always easy to remember family medical history. Now, let’s talk a bit about your daily life. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. It’s a terrible habit. And I very rarely drink alcohol. A small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, perhaps. But that’s it. Tenzin doesn't much care for it either, so we don’t keep it in the house. We prefer a nice cup of tea, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and very limited alcohol. That's good to know. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: Well… I try to get up early, around seven, although sometimes the tiredness gets the better of me. Tenzin usually makes me breakfast – porridge, mostly. Then I work in my garden, if I’m able. I grow vegetables and flowers. I used to sell them at the market, but it’s a bit too much effort these days. In the afternoon, I like to read or knit. And in the evening, we watch television. It’s… a quiet life, but I’m content. Mostly. When the tiredness isn't bothering me, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, a peaceful daily routine with gardening, reading, and spending time with Tenzin. It sounds lovely. Alright, Ardelle, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your reflexes and strength. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s perfectly alright. Go ahead. I’ve had doctors poke and prod me for years. I suppose it comes with getting old. Just be gentle, if you would. My bones are a bit… fragile these days. And try not to make a fuss, please. I don't like a lot of commotion.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle. Your heart sounds a little… faint, but that could be normal. Your lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are a little slow, and I notice some weakness in your arms and legs, especially when you squeeze my hands. It’s subtle, but noticeable. I'm also noting some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you notice that swelling yourself?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. Now that you mention it, yes. My slippers have been a bit tight lately. I thought it was just my feet getting wider with age, honestly. It’s not terribly uncomfortable, just… snug. And sometimes, a bit of a throbbing feeling in my ankles, especially at the end of the day. But I just put it down to being on my feet too long in the garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, snug slippers and throbbing in your ankles, worse at the end of the day. Thank you for sharing that. Given your symptoms – the tiredness, weakness, swelling, and the faint heart sound – I’d like to order some blood tests to check a few things. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, your thyroid function, your kidney function, and your vitamin levels. We’ll also want to repeat that blood sugar test the lab tech mentioned. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… more tests. Honestly, it feels like I’ve spent half my life giving blood samples. But… alright, if you think it’s necessary, dear. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Just… try not to poke me too much, please. And could you explain what all these tests are for? I don’t understand all that medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll explain everything. The complete blood count will tell us if you have any anemia, which could explain the tiredness. Checking your thyroid will rule out any thyroid issues, as that can also cause fatigue and weakness. The kidney function tests will help us make sure your kidneys are working properly. Low vitamin levels, particularly Vitamin D and B12, can also cause similar symptoms. And repeating the blood sugar will help us check for diabetes. It's just a lot of information to help us figure out what's going on. We’ll also do an EKG, which is a quick, painless test to check the electrical activity of your heart. It will just involve sticking some patches on your chest. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. So many things… My heart? Is something wrong with my heart? It's been beating away just fine for eighty-one years! I don't understand why it needs patches now. And diabetes… Tenzin’s aunt had that, and it wasn’t pretty. Honestly, it's all a bit overwhelming. Can’t we just give me something for the tiredness? A nice cup of tea always used to do the trick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ardelle. It is a lot of information, and it’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed. The EKG is just a precaution, to get a baseline reading of your heart's activity. The fact that your heart has been beating strong for eighty-one years is excellent news! But sometimes, things can change, and we want to make sure everything is still functioning as it should. We're not assuming anything is wrong, but we need to rule out potential causes for your symptoms. And while a nice cup of tea is lovely, it won't address the underlying cause of the tiredness. These tests will help us determine that cause, so we can get you feeling better. Would you like me to explain each test in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain it all. Slowly. I'm not very good with these… these modern things. And… are these tests painful? I don't like needles, you know. They make me quite faint. Honestly, I think I’m coming down with a bit of a headache now. Perhaps a glass of water would help?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ardelle. Let’s start with the blood tests. We’ll be taking a small sample of blood from a vein in your arm. The needle is very thin, and it’s usually only a quick pinch. Most people don’t find it very painful, but I understand your fear of needles. I'll let the phlebotomist know you’re anxious, and they’ll be extra gentle. We can also have you lie down during the blood draw to prevent you from feeling faint. The phlebotomist will tie a small tourniquet around your arm to make the veins easier to find. Then they'll clean the area with an alcohol swab. You might feel a brief sting when the needle goes in, and a slight pressure when the blood is drawn. It usually takes just a few minutes. As for the EKG, it’s completely painless. We’ll put small, sticky patches called electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs. These patches are connected to a machine that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't send any electricity into your body, it just reads the signals your heart is already producing. And yes, let me get you a glass of water right away. That’s a good idea. Does that sound a little less daunting?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little better, yes. Less daunting. The phlebotomist… is that someone else poking me? I prefer fewer people poking me, if you don’t mind. And lying down sounds… sensible. My knees aren't what they used to be, either. As for the patches, so long as they don’t shock me, I suppose I can tolerate them. Honestly, it’s all a bit much. I just want to feel like myself again. Can you promise me you’ll do everything you can to find out what’s wrong? And perhaps a biscuit with my tea, when all this is over?
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise you I'll do everything I can to find out what’s going on, Ardelle. And yes, absolutely, a biscuit with your tea! We’ll get you a nice cup of tea and a biscuit after all this is over. And you're right to ask about the phlebotomist – it is another person, but they are very skilled and gentle. I'll be right here with you the entire time, and I'll make sure everything goes smoothly. We’ll have you lie down, and I'll explain each step as it happens. We'll start with the blood draw first. Then, once that's done, we'll do the EKG. It will take about ten minutes total. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Ten minutes… I suppose I can manage ten minutes. As long as you’re there, dear. And the promise of a biscuit is… encouraging. Just… be gentle, please. And don’t let them poke me too much. Honestly, my arm feels a bit weak already, thinking about it. Shall we get this over with, then? The sooner it's done, the sooner I can have my tea.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle. Let’s get started. I'll have the phlebotomist come in, and we’ll get you comfortable on the exam table. I'll explain everything as we go, and I’ll be right here with you the whole time. Here's Sarah, our phlebotomist. Sarah, this is Ardelle, and she’s a little anxious about the blood draw. Could you please be extra gentle?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Here comes another one. Hello, Sarah. Please be careful. My veins aren’t very… cooperative, you know. They tend to hide when people try to poke them. And I do get faint easily, so… perhaps a cool cloth for my forehead? Honestly, I think I need that biscuit already. Is it a chocolate biscuit, at least? A ginger one just wouldn’t do.
DOCTOR: Sarah: "Hi Ardelle, it’s lovely to meet you. Dr. Yoshino mentioned you’re a bit anxious, and we’ll take things very slowly. We have cool cloths available, and we can have you lie flat if that helps. We have all sorts of biscuits, so you can choose whichever one you prefer!" Dr. Yoshino: “We'll get you settled, Ardelle. Just take some deep breaths. I'll be right here, talking to you the whole time. Sarah will find a good vein, and you’ll barely feel a thing. And yes, we absolutely have chocolate biscuits! We'll save the best one for you. Let's get you comfortable lying down first. ” Are you feeling alright lying down?
PATIENT: Oh, that's better, yes. Lying down helps… a bit. My knees are still complaining, though. And… is she going to poke me right now? I need a warning, you know. I don’t like surprises. Honestly, all this poking and prodding… back in my day, a good cup of tea and a lie down sorted most things. What is she doing with all those tubes, anyway? They look rather menacing.
DOCTOR: Dr. Yoshino: “You’re doing great, Ardelle. Sarah is just preparing the tubes now. Each tube is labeled for a different test, and we’ll need a small amount of blood for each one. She's applying a tourniquet now, which will help make your veins easier to find. You might feel a slight pressure on your arm, but it shouldn't be painful. She’s looking for a good vein now… there we are. She’s cleaning the area with an alcohol swab. Just take a deep breath… you might feel a little pinch in a moment. ” Dr. Yoshino: “Just go slowly, please.” Dr. Yoshino: “Here we go… just a little pinch.”
PATIENT: Oh! That is a bit of a pinch. Honestly, I don’t think my veins like being poked. Are you sure you’re getting enough? I don’t want to lie here all day, having my blood drained. And it’s making me feel… a little dizzy now. Perhaps I should have had that tea before all this. Just… hurry up, please. And tell me when it’s over.
DOCTOR: Dr. Yoshino: “You’re doing wonderfully, Ardelle. Just breathe deeply. Yes, you’re a little pale, but that’s normal. Sarah is almost done. She just needs one more tube, and then we're finished with the blood draw. She’s very skilled, and she’s getting everything she needs. ” Dr. Yoshino: “Almost there, Sarah. Just the last tube.” Dr. Yoshino: “There we go… one last little bit. Just a few more seconds, and then we’re all done. You’re doing great. Just focus on your breathing.” Dr. Yoshino: “Okay, all done! Sarah is removing the tourniquet now, and then she’ll put a bandage on your arm. ” Dr. Yoshino: “Thank you, Sarah. You were wonderful.”
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. That was… unpleasant. Honestly, all this poking and prodding… I think I need a lie down. And that tea. Definitely that tea. And the biscuit, of course. A chocolate one, remember? Is it over now? Truly, truly over? I don’t think I can handle any more needles. My arm feels… rather weak.
DOCTOR: Dr. Yoshino: “Yes, it's completely over now, Ardelle. Truly, truly over. You were very brave. ” Dr. Yoshino: "Let's get Ardelle a glass of water and a chocolate biscuit, please." Dr. Yoshino: “Your arm might feel a little sore for a few minutes, but that’s normal. Just keep it still, and avoid lifting anything heavy. And yes, we’ll get you that tea and biscuit right away. I promise. ” Dr. Yoshino: “Here you go, Ardelle. A nice cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit. ” Now, let’s take a few minutes to rest and enjoy your tea. We’ll get you feeling better soon.”
PATIENT: Oh… that is lovely. Just what I needed. A warm cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very kind. Though honestly, I still think a good lie-down would have been just as effective. But this is… very nice. What happens now? Do I have to come back for more poking? And will you be able to tell me what’s wrong, eventually? I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Dr. Yoshino: “You’re very welcome, Ardelle. I’m glad you’re enjoying your tea and biscuit. ” “Yes, we'll need to do some further testing based on the blood results. It likely won’t involve any more needles, though! We’ll probably want to do an EKG, which is completely painless. It just involves sticking some patches on your chest. And we might want to do a chest X-ray, but that’s also painless. “As for what’s wrong, we’ll know more once the blood results come back. It usually takes a few days. I'll call you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them. I’ll explain everything clearly, and we’ll come up with a plan to get you feeling better. I promise.” “Right now, though, just focus on relaxing and enjoying your tea. Let’s take a few minutes to rest, and then we can talk about next steps if you'd like. I'll also write you a note for a few days of light activity. ”
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Patches… I suppose patches are better than needles. And a chest X-ray… well, as long as it doesn’t involve being poked. You think it could be my heart, then? I’ve always had a strong heart, but… you never know. My mother always said I worried too much. Perhaps that’s it. Just worry. You really think you can find out what’s wrong? I just want to be able to get back to my garden. And spend time with Tenzin. I worry about him, you know. He gets so flustered when I’m not feeling well.
DOCTOR: Dr. Yoshino: “It’s possible it could be related to your heart, but we don’t know for sure yet. That's why we need to do further testing. It could be a number of things, and we want to rule everything out before we jump to any conclusions. The tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. ” “And yes, I really think we can find out what’s wrong. We have excellent resources here, and I’m committed to getting you the answers you need. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable and confident in our plan. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything clearly along the way.” “And you’re right to want to get back to your garden and spend time with Tenzin. Those things are important, and we’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better so you can enjoy them again. In the meantime, just focus on resting and taking care of yourself. ” “Would you like me to write down the instructions for the next steps, so you have everything in writing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please. Writing it down would be… helpful. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. Tenzin mostly keeps track of everything. But I like to have something to look at, just in case. And perhaps you could write down the name of that patch test, just so I know what to expect. And… thank you, dear. You’ve been very patient with an old woman like me. Honestly, I think I just needed someone to listen. And a cup of tea. And a chocolate biscuit.
DOCTOR: Dr. Yoshino: “Of course, Ardelle. It’s my pleasure. Next Steps: Electrocardiogram : This is a painless test to record the electrical activity of your heart. We’ll place small patches on your chest, arms, and legs. Chest X-ray: This is a painless imaging test to look at your lungs and heart. You’ll stand in front of a special machine. Follow-up Appointment: We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the tests and develop a plan. Please call the office at 555-1234 to schedule your ECG and Chest X-ray. I'll call you as soon as the results are available. “I’ll also write down the name of the patch test for you: It's called an Electrocardiogram or ECG/EKG for short. It really is a very simple test.” “Here you go. And don’t worry about bothering me with questions. I’m here to help in any way I can. And remember, focus on resting and taking care of yourself. ” "Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very helpful, thank you. Electro… something. I’ll have Tenzin write it down properly. And no, dear, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very kind. Really. I just need a bit of peace and quiet now. And perhaps another chocolate biscuit… if you have one? Honestly, they’re very comforting. I think… I think I’m starting to feel a little bit better already. Just knowing someone is listening makes all the difference. Thank you again, dear. You're a good doctor.
DOCTOR: Dr. Yoshino: “You’re very welcome, Ardelle. I’m glad I could help. And absolutely, I can get you another chocolate biscuit. ” “Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. ” “I’ll check in with you after the tests are completed. Have a peaceful day, Ardelle.”
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. You’re very thoughtful. And… you have a good day too. A very good day. Bye bye.
