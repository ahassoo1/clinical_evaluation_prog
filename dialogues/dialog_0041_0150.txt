DOCTOR: Hi Angelle, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s quite simple, really. I want a baby. And I’d like to avoid any…complications. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I’d rather sort this out now than deal with problems later.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re hoping to become pregnant, and you’d like to discuss ways to maximize your chances and minimize potential risks. That’s very proactive of you. Just to get a clearer picture, have you been trying to conceive for a while now, or is this more of a preemptive consultation?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not trying. I simply haven’t…begun. That’s the point, isn't it? I want to plan this. I’m 51, Doctor. I don’t have time to “try” for years and then discover something is…wrong. I’d like to know if everything is as it should be, before I start. Is that so difficult to understand?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I completely understand. You want to ensure everything is optimal before attempting conception – a very sensible approach. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. Okay. So, to start, I’ll need to gather some information. Let’s begin with your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must we? All of this… paperwork. But very well. No, nothing significant. My blood pressure is normal – I check it regularly. No diabetes. And my thyroid… well, I had a little trouble years ago, but it was sorted. Years ago. It’s perfectly fine now. I was divorced, you see, and my ex-husband insisted I get everything “checked”. It was…thorough. Is that sufficient? I don’t want to bore you with details from decades past.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Even information from the past can be relevant, but we can focus on the present if that's easier. You mentioned your thyroid being checked years ago. Do you recall if you were ever prescribed medication for it, and if so, are you still taking it?
PATIENT: Yes, I was. Levothyroxine, I believe it was called. A very small dose. And no, I stopped taking it…oh, goodness, nearly fifteen years ago. The doctor said it was no longer necessary. Everything was stable. I have no recollection of needing it since then. Really, Doctor, I’m a very healthy woman. I eat well, I exercise – I wouldn’t be here if I was constantly unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And aside from that, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Nothing major. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was young, naturally. And…a hysterectomy. Quite a while ago. Twenty years, perhaps? It was…uncomplicated. A routine procedure. My ex-husband and I…it was better this way. Is that relevant? I imagine it might be. Though, surely, at my age… it’s hardly a surprise.
DOCTOR: Yes, the hysterectomy is relevant, thank you for sharing that. It will affect our approach. Have you had any complications since the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Complications? No. None whatsoever. It healed perfectly. I had excellent care. I went through a great deal of trouble finding the right doctor, you see. I am not prone to…problems. I do not tolerate incompetence. Now, are we getting somewhere, or are we simply cataloging my medical history indefinitely? I have appointments later, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere. I apologize if my questions feel extensive; I want to get a full picture to provide the best care. Okay, let’s move onto family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history. Must we? My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my aunt…she had some sort of…nervous condition. Dementia, perhaps? It was a long time ago, and frankly, my family isn’t very forthcoming about these things. They’re a rather…dramatic bunch. Is that helpful? I doubt it. Look, Doctor, I come from a long line of…difficult women. That’s all you need to know. I assure you, I am the healthiest and most sensible one.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That gives me something to work with. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Do I look like someone who smokes? I take pride in my health, Doctor. I haven't touched a cigarette in my life. I consider it… vulgar. And, frankly, damaging. Now, can we please move on? This is becoming rather tedious. I have a very busy schedule. I don’t have time for… trivialities.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. I am not a…profligate. A small indulgence, Doctor. I do not consider it to be harmful. And I certainly don't drink to excess. Really, you are asking very…strange questions. Is this standard procedure? I’ve never been grilled like this before.
DOCTOR: It’s standard, Angelle, I assure you. Just trying to get a complete picture of your overall health. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. A basic one, Doctor. Nothing special. I try to eat a balanced diet, but one can’t be too careful. And occasionally, I take calcium. My bones, you see. Age, Doctor. It catches up with one eventually. Now, is that finally all? Because I truly must be going. I have an appointment with my financial advisor. A far more pressing matter, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. That gives me a good starting point. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to do a brief physical exam – just some basic checks of your blood pressure, weight, and a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? At my age? Honestly, Doctor. I assure you, my body functions perfectly well. I’ve been taking care of myself for fifty-one years. I know my own body. But very well. If it’s absolutely necessary. Just…be gentle. And efficient. I have no patience for… unnecessary poking and prodding. Now, let’s get this over with. The sooner we finish, the sooner I can leave.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat here. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s within a normal range. Now, let’s check your weight. Your weight is 86 kilograms. And your height is 1.86 meters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. I am aware of my dimensions, Doctor. I have a perfectly functional bathroom scale, you know. Please, let’s not prolong this any further. I trust you are a competent physician. If you require any further “information”, simply ask. But I sincerely hope we can expedite this process. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Of course. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Just a quick listen, to ensure everything sounds clear. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good so far. Now, given your age and the fact you haven’t yet started trying to conceive, I think it would be wise to order some basic blood tests. These will give us a more detailed picture of your overall health and hormone levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Of course. What else? It’s always something. Very well. Do what you must, Doctor. But I expect a quick turnaround time. I don’t want to be waiting weeks for results. And please, send the results to my email address. I don’t have time for phone calls. I assure you, I am a very busy woman. Now, can we please discuss the logistics of these tests? Where do I go? What do I need to bring? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab is just down the hall, room 102. You’ll need to fast for at least 8 hours before the test, meaning no food or drinks other than water. Bring your insurance card and a photo ID. I’ll send an order electronically to the lab, and they’ll be expecting you. It usually takes 3-5 business days for the results to come back. I'll also send them to your email address as requested. While we wait for the results, are there any specific concerns you have?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. I have expectations. I expect to be able to conceive naturally, with minimal complications. I have lived a healthy life, and I expect my body to cooperate. I expect you, Doctor, to facilitate that process. And frankly, I expect a little more… optimism. I am not an elderly woman, and I do not appreciate being treated as such. Now, is there anything else? Because I truly must be going. I have a life, you see. A very busy one.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your expectations, and I assure you, I'll do everything I can to help facilitate a healthy pregnancy. We’ll interpret the blood test results together and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist. It’s always good to have a specialist on board, especially given your age. They can provide more specialized guidance and support. Would you like me to schedule an initial consultation for you?
PATIENT: A specialist? Absolutely not. I do not need to be subjected to endless tests and opinions. I trust my own judgment, and frankly, I don’t appreciate being referred to someone else. I came to you, Doctor, because I believed you were competent. If you require me to consult with a specialist, it implies you are incapable of providing adequate care. No. I will not be seeing a reproductive endocrinologist. I expect you to handle this yourself. And frankly, I expect a swift and positive outcome. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a very busy schedule. I believe we’ve covered everything. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Angelle. As you wish. I'll await the results and we can discuss them when they arrive. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day.
