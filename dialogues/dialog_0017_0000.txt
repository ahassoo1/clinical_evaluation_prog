DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I am Dr. Blim. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my legs. They just…gave out. Not completely, you understand, but they’re awfully weak. It started a few days after I got over a really nasty cold. Just…not right. It's quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Weakness, you say. And this began shortly after a cold. Hmm. Inconvenient is…certainly one way to put it. Can you be more specific about this weakness?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, it’s just…difficult to walk. Like trying to wade through thick mud. Especially first thing in the morning. And it doesn’t seem to get much better throughout the day, not really. I used to be able to walk for miles, you know. Now? A trip to the grocery store feels like a marathon. And I do like my grocery store. It has the best avocados.
DOCTOR: Avocados, yes. While I appreciate a good fruit as much as the next person, let’s focus on the legs. You say it's difficult to walk… is this difficulty constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not constant, Doctor. That would be ridiculous. It’s…worse in the mornings, definitely. And after I’ve been sitting for a while. If I get up and move around, it loosens up a bit. But it always comes back. It’s just…a bother. Honestly, I suspect I’m just getting old. Though I do try to stay active. Not like some people, of course.
DOCTOR: “Getting old” is rarely a diagnosis, Ms. Firestone. And “some people” is… unhelpful. Let’s establish a timeline. When exactly did this weakness begin?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Well, the cold ended, let’s see… July 28th, I think. Yes, the 28th. And I noticed the legs feeling a bit…off… the next day. July 29th. It wasn’t dramatic, just a little wobbly. But each day it’s gotten…progressively worse. I remember because I had planned to visit my sister, and I thought, ‘Oh, I should probably wait until this passes.’ It hasn’t.
DOCTOR: And did you experience any other symptoms during this cold?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A terrible cough, of course. And a stuffy nose. Just the usual. Achy all over, you know, like you get when a cold really grabs hold. I took some over-the-counter remedies, the usual decongestant and cough syrup. Nothing special. I don’t usually bother with doctors for a simple cold, honestly. They just tell you to drink fluids and rest. Which I did. Perfectly adequate fluids, I might add.
DOCTOR: Adequate fluids. Right. And after the cold resolved, were there any other symptoms concurrent with the leg weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No fever, certainly. No aches. Not really… Oh! Now that you mention it, I have been rather…tired. More tired than usual, I mean. I always have a bit of energy, but this is…different. Like I haven’t slept properly, even though I have. It’s a…a vague exhaustion. Does that make sense? I’m not usually vague.
DOCTOR: Vague or not, it's information I need. Now, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Definitely not. Just weakness. It's… frustrating, really. I like to be independent, you see. Doing things for myself. And now I have to worry about falling. It’s… undignified. I don’t need assistance. I just need to figure out what’s wrong. It's probably just something minor. I’ve always been quite robust, you know. A strong constitution.
DOCTOR: Robust constitutions are not immune to illness, Ms. Firestone. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please, have a seat on the table. I need to assess your reflexes and muscle strength. It’s a standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. But I do hope it won’t take long. I have… plans. Though they’re rather difficult to accomplish in my current state. And please be gentle. I have sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just relax. I’ll start with your reflexes. Please keep your leg relaxed. Two plus. Normal. Two plus. Also normal. Now, can you please lift your left leg straight up, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? It feels a bit… strained, honestly. I haven't been doing much lifting lately, you see. It's not easy when one is… compromised.
DOCTOR: And the right?
PATIENT: There! It's… considerably more difficult on this side. It’s…uncomfortable, honestly. I do hope this won't take much longer.
DOCTOR: Slight weakness in dorsiflexion on the right. Now, I'd like to check your sensory function. Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes! I felt that. Perfectly adequate sensation. Though your touch is… firm. I do hope you aren’t trying to cause discomfort. Honestly, I'm quite sensitive. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Firestone, to rule out certain possibilities. Now, can you close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Very well. But do hurry. I don't enjoy being vulnerable. And please don't poke me. I have a low tolerance for unnecessary prodding.
DOCTOR: Do you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I felt it. It’s…prickly. Honestly, is this really necessary? I told you, my sensation is perfectly adequate. I can feel perfectly well when someone touches me. It’s the weakness that’s the problem, Doctor. Not my ability to perceive touch.
DOCTOR: Very well. That is sufficient. Based on your history and this brief examination, there are several possibilities. However, given the recent cold and the weakness, I suspect post-viral neuritis. It’s not uncommon. But to be certain, I need to order some blood work. We need to rule out other causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or… more serious neurological conditions. I'm also going to order a Vitamin D level.
PATIENT: Neuritis? Is that…serious? I haven’t the time for serious. I have engagements. And blood work? Honestly, I despise needles. Is there no other way? Perhaps a scan? Or…something less invasive? I’m perfectly capable of self-diagnosis, you know. I read a great deal. And I'm usually right. It's probably just a temporary setback. A minor inflammation. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Self-diagnosis is rarely accurate, Ms. Firestone. And scans are not indicated at this time. Blood work is a standard procedure, and it’s the most efficient way to determine the cause of your weakness. It’s a small inconvenience compared to the potential consequences of an undiagnosed condition. I will also order a CBC to rule out infection. I will send the orders to the lab downstairs. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend… avoiding strenuous activity. And please, hydrate.
PATIENT: Hydrate. Of course. As if I haven't already been adequately hydrating. Honestly. Very well. Send the orders. But I expect a prompt response. I haven’t the time to waste. And please, ensure the phlebotomist is…gentle. I have delicate veins. I suppose that will be all, then. I trust you’ll have a definitive answer shortly. I have other commitments.
DOCTOR: The lab will contact you within 24 hours. Should your condition worsen—severe weakness, numbness, difficulty breathing—go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not delay. And Ms. Firestone… please try to manage your expectations. A definitive answer requires time. .
