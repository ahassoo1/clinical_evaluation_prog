DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let's just get right to it. It's… well, it's my stomach. Been having the runs for… honestly, I’ve lost track. Weeks, probably. Everything the doctors have given me just isn’t doing anything. It’s really frustrating.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks. I told the last doctor that, and they just kept trying different… pills. Honestly, I don’t even remember what they were. Little white ones, mostly. They didn’t help. It's just… constant. And it's really inconvenient, if you can imagine. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. And has anything in particular seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Honestly, everything triggers it at this point! I eat something, it happens. I drink water, it happens. I think too hard… okay, maybe not that last one, but you get my point. It’s just… random. I’m a painter, I’m always on the go, I can’t be running to the bathroom every hour. It's ridiculous. And embarrassing.
DOCTOR: So, it doesn't seem to be related to anything specific in your diet?
PATIENT: No! I've tried cutting things out. Dairy. Gluten. Spicy food. Nothing changes. Look, I'm not one of these people who believes everything has to be organic or something. I eat normal food. And it’s still happening. I'm starting to think it's just… something I'm stuck with. Is that even possible?
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the diarrhea, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I'm tired, probably. But honestly, who isn't tired these days? And… I guess a little crampy sometimes, but that comes and goes. It's mostly just... the bathroom issue. It’s really affecting my work, if that matters. I had a big commission, and I'm having trouble keeping up the schedule. It's just a mess.
DOCTOR: Any fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Absolutely not. Look, I'm not a child. I would know if there was blood. No fever, no throwing up. Just… a lot of running to the bathroom. And it’s gotten worse, honestly. I thought it would go away on its own, but it hasn't. That’s why I’m here, wasting my time. Is there anything you can actually do about it, or are we just going to keep trying different pills that don’t work?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and feel around a bit. It’s standard procedure. Just lie down on the exam table for me.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't take too long. I have things to do, you know. And be gentle. I don't need any unnecessary poking and prodding. Honestly, this whole thing is just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Okay, and again. It doesn't seem particularly tender to the touch, though your bowel sounds are… a bit hyperactive. I'm going to palpate your abdomen a little further. Let me know if anything is painful.
PATIENT: Ouch! There. A little to the left. That's… a bit sensitive. Not excruciating, but definitely not comfortable. And stop pressing so hard, please. You're not trying to break anything, are you? Honestly, I'm starting to think I should have just stayed home. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. That area is slightly tender. It could indicate some inflammation. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to rule out anything else. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I’m going to order some blood work and a stool sample. The blood work will help rule out any infections or inflammatory conditions, and the stool sample will check for parasites or bacteria.
PATIENT: Blood work and a stool sample? Seriously? This is getting more and more inconvenient by the minute. Look, is this going to take long? I need to know if I can even work tomorrow. And what if it's something… awful? I don’t have time for a serious illness. This is just great. You're telling me I have to come back again?
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to come back for the results. The lab typically takes 2-3 business days to process everything. As for what it could be, it’s too early to say definitively. It could be a number of things – a lingering infection, irritable bowel syndrome, or potentially something else. That's why we need the test results. I understand your concerns about time, Ms. Woodring, but these tests are necessary to get a proper diagnosis. I'm going to give you a requisition form for the blood work and instructions for collecting the stool sample. Please follow the instructions carefully.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… try to be quick about it. And don't expect me to be happy if it turns out to be something serious. This whole thing is just… frustrating. I have a life, you know. A business to run. I can't just sit around waiting for test results. And if this doesn't get resolved soon, I’m going to find another doctor. Is that clear? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Woodring, that is clear. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a few days, once the results are available. Please call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms before then. .
