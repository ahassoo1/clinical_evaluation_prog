DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Boham. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 40 years old. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor Seil. It is nice to meet you as well. Um… my sinuses. They… they bother me. A lot. It’s been… a while, I think. It's hard to remember exactly when it started, but… it’s not good.
DOCTOR: I see. Sinus issues, and it’s been ongoing for some time. Thank you for letting me know. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the discomfort a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh… how to explain? It’s… pressure. Behind my eyes, mostly. And… my nose feels stuffy. Always. I try to breathe through it, but… not much air gets in. Sometimes… sometimes it hurts a little, too. Like a… a dull ache. But not all the time. It comes and goes. I don’t know if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Boham. Pressure behind your eyes and nasal congestion with some intermittent aching. When would you say this started—roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… difficult. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good with dates. It’s been… months, I think? Maybe longer. Before… before my husband’s new job, I think. He started that job in… April, maybe? So… before April. It could be… a long time. I wish I could be more precise. It just… slowly got worse, I think. I don't remember a specific day it started.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not always easy to remember exactly when something began. So, several months, potentially longer than April, with a gradual worsening of symptoms. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… when it's cold, it is worse, I think. Especially if the wind is blowing. And… sometimes, when I am very tired, it feels… heavier. Not better, not worse, but… different. I haven't really tried anything to make it better, though. Just… tried to ignore it, mostly. I don't know what to do. Do you have a… a spray, maybe? For the nose?
DOCTOR: Okay, so cold weather and being tired seem to aggravate it. And you haven't used any treatments yet. I understand wanting something simple to start with. We can certainly discuss nasal sprays. Before we do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to get a clearer picture. Have you experienced any fever, facial pain, or changes in your vision associated with this sinus discomfort?
PATIENT: Fever…? No, I don't think so. Not that I remember. I haven't felt sick, really. Just… this pressure. And… no, not any pain in my face, no. It's just… behind my eyes. And… no changes to my vision, no. Everything looks the same. I haven't noticed anything different with my eyes. I worry sometimes, but… I haven't seen anything strange.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Boham. No fever, facial pain, or vision changes. Now, have you noticed any colored nasal discharge – meaning anything other than clear?
PATIENT: Colored…? Oh. Um… sometimes. When I blow my nose, sometimes it is… yellow. Or… greenish. But not always. Sometimes it is clear, like you said. It changes, I think. Mostly yellow, maybe. But… it’s hard to tell, honestly. I don't really look at it closely. It's just… nose stuff. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Boham. Yellow or greenish discharge suggests there might be an infection present. One final question before we move onto a brief examination. Have you experienced any recent cough, sore throat, or headache along with these sinus symptoms?
PATIENT: Headache… sometimes. A dull headache, mostly. Not very bad. And… a little cough, maybe. Just a small one. Nothing big. It’s been… on and off. And no sore throat. No, not a sore throat. I don't think I’ve been sick, Doctor. Just… uncomfortable. It's just this… pressure. And the nose. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. So, we have ongoing sinus pressure with nasal congestion, occasional yellow/green discharge, a mild headache, and a small cough. Now, I’d like to perform a quick examination if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your ears and throat, and palpate your sinuses to assess for tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I… I trust you. Please, go ahead. I just want this… pressure to go away. It is very tiring.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Boham. We’ll do our best to figure this out. I’ll start by listening to your lungs. Just breathe normally through your mouth. Lungs are clear, bilaterally. Now, I'm going to take a look at your ears with an otoscope. Ears appear normal. No signs of infection. Now, open your mouth for me, please. Throat is mildly erythematous, but no exudate or significant swelling noted. Finally, I’ll gently palpate your sinuses. There is some tenderness to palpation over the maxillary sinuses, bilaterally. No tenderness over the frontal sinuses. Okay, Ms. Boham. Based on the examination findings, you do have some tenderness in your maxillary sinuses, which suggests sinus inflammation, consistent with sinusitis. The mild redness in your throat could be related, or a separate mild viral irritation. Now, given your symptoms have been ongoing for some time, and the presence of colored discharge, it’s likely you have a bacterial sinusitis.
PATIENT: Bacterial…? Oh dear. That sounds… bad. Is that serious, Doctor? What… what do I need to do? I don’t like the sound of “bacterial.” Will I need… shots? I don't want shots. And… will it go away?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned when you hear "bacterial," Ms. Boham. It’s not necessarily serious, but it does require treatment. Luckily, it’s usually very treatable with antibiotics. We wouldn’t need any shots, thankfully. It would be an oral medication, pills to take. Now, given your symptoms and the examination findings, I believe a course of antibiotics would be beneficial. I’m thinking Amoxicillin, 500mg three times a day for 10 days. However, before we proceed, do you have any known allergies, especially to penicillin or any other medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything. My husband says I don’t remember things very well, so… maybe I have, but I wouldn’t know. He handles all the medicines usually. No, I don't think I am allergic to anything. But… he would know better, I think. He always asks. Is Amoxicillin… strong? Will it make me feel sick?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Boham. It's good you don't recall any allergies. We can always start with a lower dose and monitor for any reactions. Amoxicillin is generally well-tolerated, but some people experience mild side effects like nausea or diarrhea. If you experience anything unusual, please stop taking it and contact the clinic immediately. Now, alongside the antibiotics, I recommend over-the-counter saline nasal spray to help keep your nasal passages moist and clear congestion. You can use it several times a day. Also, adequate hydration is important, so drink plenty of fluids. And, try to get adequate rest. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a course of antibiotics as well as a recommendation for a saline nasal spray. Do you have any questions about the medications or instructions?
PATIENT: Saline spray… and drink lots of water. And the pills. Three times a day. And… stop if I feel sick. Yes, Doctor. I think I understand. But… how much are the pills? I don't have… insurance. My husband works, but… it doesn't cover me. Will they be very expensive? I don't want to get into trouble with money.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Boham. Let me check the cost for you at a few local pharmacies. Okay, it appears that Amoxicillin is relatively inexpensive, even without insurance. At one pharmacy, the 10-day course is approximately $15. Another pharmacy has a discount card that would bring the price down to $10. We also have a list of local resources that may be able to provide financial assistance with medications. Would you like me to print that list for you?
PATIENT: Oh. That is… good. Fifteen dollars… I can manage fifteen dollars. Ten dollars would be even better. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel much better. Yes, please. If you have the list, that would be very helpful. Thank you for thinking of that. I… I worry a lot about money. My husband says I do. But he works very hard, and I don’t want to be a burden. So, yes, the list, please. And… thank you again, Doctor Seil. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Boham. It’s my pleasure. Here is the list. It includes information about local charities and programs that can assist with medication costs. Don't hesitate to reach out to them if you need help. Now, to summarize, you’ll take Amoxicillin 500mg three times a day for 10 days, use saline nasal spray as needed, and drink plenty of fluids. If your symptoms don't improve after 3-5 days, or if they worsen at any time, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. Amoxicillin, spray, water, and… contact you if it gets worse. I will remember. Thank you very much for your help, Doctor Seil. You have been very patient with me. And… thank you for not laughing at me when I forgot things. I think I will go home now and try to get some rest. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Boham. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And please, don't worry about forgetting things. It happens to everyone. Get some rest, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, Ms. Boham. .
