DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello. Is okay to meet you too. My heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like… flippy-floppy. Not all the time, but often enough I worry. My wife, she say I need to see doctor.
DOCTOR: "Flippy-floppy," okay. I understand. It's good your wife encouraged you to come in. That sounds concerning, and we want to figure out what's going on. When did you first start noticing this “flippy-floppy” feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… six months ago? Maybe a little more. It started slow. Just once in a while when I walk fast. Now… more often. Even when I rest sometimes. It scare my wife. She very worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or so. And it's become more frequent, even when you’re resting. I appreciate you sharing that your wife is concerned, that's helpful to know. Can you describe exactly what it feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… hard to say. Like… a fast beat. Not slow, but too fast. And sometimes… it feels like it skip. Like thump-thump-skip-thump. And then back to fast. It not pain, just… strange. Make me feel… weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fast beat, sometimes skipping, and a feeling of weakness. So, no chest pain specifically, just the sensation of a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Have you noticed anything that brings on these episodes?
PATIENT: Yes. When I work… sometimes. I work with… machines. Big machines. Lots of walking. And… sometimes when I drink coffee. Not always. But usually after coffee. Also, when I get… upset. If my wife and I… disagree.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be triggered by work – walking, machines – caffeine, and stress, like disagreements with your wife. Hmm. Have you ever had this checked out before?
PATIENT: No. Never. This is first time. I not like doctor much. Always… poking and prodding. But wife say I must. She very… firm. She good wife.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. We'll try to make this as comfortable as possible. It's good that you have a supportive wife. We'll just do a basic exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That okay. Blood… is okay. Just… fast, please. I not like wait long. Is okay if you tell me what you do, yes? So I not scare.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything as I go. We’ll start with your blood pressure – it’s just a cuff around your arm that squeezes briefly. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope – it doesn’t hurt at all, I’m just listening for any unusual sounds. It’ll be quick, I promise. Let's start with your blood pressure, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. Fast is good. Is tight, yes? Like… squeezing. Is normal? My arm feel… numb little bit.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a little tight, that's normal. It squeezes your arm for a moment to get an accurate reading. The numbness you're feeling should go away quickly. Your blood pressure is 130 over 85. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally, please. Deep breaths. Hmm. I do hear a slightly irregular rhythm. It’s not very pronounced, but it’s there. Your lungs sound clear. Pulse is 92, also a little fast. Okay. So, we've got a slightly irregular heartbeat, a slightly fast heart rate, and your blood pressure is a bit elevated. This could be a number of things. Given what you've told me about the triggers—work, coffee, stress—and this irregularity, I'd like to order an EKG. It's a quick, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. We also should do some blood work to rule out other potential causes. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: EKG… is like… poking? Blood work… is needles? My wife… she say I need to do what doctor say. But… needles make me… shaky. Is very important? Can I think about it?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension completely. The EKG isn't poking, it’s more like placing small stickers on your chest to record the heart’s rhythm. It doesn’t hurt at all. And the blood work… yes, it does involve a small needle, but it's quick. We'll use a thin needle, and the nurse is very skilled. It is important. The EKG and blood work will help us figure out what’s causing these palpitations – this “flippy-floppy” feeling – and make sure it’s nothing serious. It could be something simple, like too much caffeine or stress, but we need to rule out anything more concerning. We can take it one step at a time. Let's start with the EKG. If you're not comfortable with the blood work right now, we can discuss it further after we see the EKG results. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Okay. EKG… stickers. Okay. No needles. Yes. I do stickers. But… if EKG show… bad things… I still not do blood. Maybe… I talk to wife first. She good with… medical things. She scare easy, so I not tell her yet. But… maybe after.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable. We can absolutely start with just the EKG, and you can discuss the blood work with your wife afterward. No pressure at all. I'll have the nurse come in and get you set up for the EKG. It will just take a few minutes. And don't worry about frightening your wife. We’ll get the results and explain everything clearly. Just focus on getting the EKG done for now. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes. Stickers is okay. Fast is good. I hope… no bad news. Thank you, doctor. You… very patient.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Puder. And don't worry, we'll take it one step at a time. I'll let the nurse know you're ready. She’ll be right in to get you set up. And I'll be back to discuss the results as soon as they are available. Just relax. We'll figure this out.
