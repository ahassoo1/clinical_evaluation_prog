DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Miner. I am Dr. Jules. So, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Right. The… puffiness. My face and legs, yeah. Been gettin’ worse lately, it has. Don’t know why it’s happenin’, mind you. Never had this before, not like this. Feels… uncomfortable, is what it is.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable, yes. And when did you first notice this puffiness, Mr. Miner?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Dates… Dates are hard. Seems like… a few weeks maybe? Hard to say exactly. Everything kinda blends together these days, you know? Since… well, since Martha. It’s not been a good stretch, that's for sure. But the puffiness… a few weeks, I reckon. It weren’t much at first. Now… well, now it’s noticeable.
DOCTOR: A few weeks. Right. And has anything changed in those few weeks, Mr. Miner?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, changed? Like… the weather? It's been hotter than usual, that's for sure. Everything feels sticky. I haven't been eatin' much different, just… the usual. Toast, mostly. And coffee. Lots of coffee. Can't get goin' without my coffee. And I've been tryin’ to stay inside more, with the heat and all. Don’t know if that makes a difference. I don't go doin' much anymore, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Toast and coffee… and limiting outdoor activity. And you haven't noticed any other symptoms alongside this puffiness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… feelin’ tired? Yeah, I'm always tired. Old age, I suppose. And achy. My joints ain’t what they used to be. But that's just normal. I wouldn’t call that a symptom. No, nothin' else really. Just… puffy. And uncomfortable. And tired. Honestly, I just want to know why I look like a balloon. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Miner, puffiness – or edema, as we call it – can have many causes. We’ll need to rule out some more serious possibilities. Have you had any issues with your kidneys in the past?
PATIENT: Kidneys? Issues with my… Oh, good grief. No. Never had no problems with my kidneys. Not that I know of. Never been told. I've had a bit of trouble with my back, though. Always pullin' somethin' at work. But that's just the welding, you know? Heavy work. But kidneys… no. No issues there. Why would my kidneys have anything to do with my face bein' all swollen? Seems like a silly question.
DOCTOR: Kidneys regulate fluid balance, Mr. Miner. It's… basic physiology. Now, let's move on. Any heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? Well, I get a little breathless sometimes when I'm climbin’ the stairs, but who doesn't? I’m not exactly a young man anymore. Martha always said I pushed myself too hard at work. Said I should retire. But what would I do all day? No, no heart problems. Nothing the doctor ever told me about. A little fast beat sometimes, but… nothing serious. Honestly, doc, I just want to know what’s makin’ me look like this. Is it somethin’ I ate? Something in the air? I'm not a complicated man.
DOCTOR: Right. No history of diagnosed cardiac issues. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Miner?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. Just… the occasional aspirin for a headache. And sometimes, when my back’s really bad, I take somethin' for the pain. Can't remember the name of it… some little white pill. Martha used to get it for me. But that's it. Not a man for takin’ pills, generally. Prefer to just… tough it out. I don't like feelin' all drugged up.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look at your legs. If you wouldn’t mind, please sit on the examination table and I will assess the edema.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. The table. Fine. It's kinda high, isn't it? Always been a bit of a climb. Well, go ahead. Just tell me what you see. And please, doc, be quick about it. This is a little… undignified. And if you could just tell me what's wrong at the end, that'd be great. I don’t like bein’ kept in suspense.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is definite pitting edema bilaterally, extending up to the mid-shin. And your skin feels warm to the touch. No visible rashes or ulcers. Your pulses are present, although slightly diminished. I'll also auscultate your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… a slight murmur, but not acutely concerning given your age. I think we need to rule out a few things. I’m going to order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. That will give us some insight into your kidney function and overall health. And a urinalysis, to check for protein in your urine. We'll get these results back in a few days.
PATIENT: Protein in my… urine? Good grief. Is that serious? Martha never had protein in her urine. This sounds complicated. And expensive, I bet. I don’t have insurance, you know. Can’t afford a lot of tests. Just tell me straight, doc. Is it somethin’ bad? Is it… goin’ to kill me? I just want to know what’s wrong with my face and legs. And how much it’s gonna cost.
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I understand your concerns, but it is far too early to determine the cause of your edema or to make any definitive pronouncements about your health. These tests are necessary to gather information. As for the cost… I will see if the lab offers any financial assistance options. However, I cannot give you an exact figure at this time. The protein in your urine could indicate kidney problems, but it could also be benign. We need the results to know for sure. I am ordering these tests as a precaution, not because I suspect something dire. Let’s focus on getting the information we need first. Take this to the lab down the street. They’ll draw some blood and collect a urine sample. They should have the results back within three to five business days. I have other patients waiting, so I’m afraid that is all I can do for you today. Do you have any other questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: Fine. Three to five days… that’s a long time to be walkin’ around lookin’ like this. And… and financial assistance? You think I want charity? Just… just when I thought things couldn’t get worse. No. No more questions. Just… just tell me where this lab is. And how much it’s gonna cost, if you can. This whole thing is a bother, really. A terrible bother.
