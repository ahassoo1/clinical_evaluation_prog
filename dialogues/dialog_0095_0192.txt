DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, well, the army… they want me to take a test. Before they let me… you know… join. Seems silly, really. I feel fine. Always have. But they got forms and stuff. So here I am. Waste of a good morning, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. A pre-enlistment exam. That’s perfectly standard, even if you feel perfectly healthy. It's good they're being thorough. Just to be clear, you’re looking to join the army?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Always wanted to. My father… he was a mechanic, see? Kept the whole fleet of trucks running smooth during… well, never you mind when. Point is, good with machines, always have been. Army needs people like that, right? Not much paperwork where he was, I can tell you that much.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. The army certainly does need skilled mechanics and technicians. And you’re right, there's quite a bit more paperwork now than there used to be. Let’s get through this exam so we can hopefully get you on your way. To start, can you tell me about any current medical issues you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Medical issues? Look, I told you, I feel fine. Never been sick a day in my life, not really. Maybe a little cold now and then, but who doesn’t get a cold? Nothing serious, never been to the doctor for anything, not until this. My wife, she worries too much, that’s why I’m even here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you telling me that. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, it's helpful for me to get a complete picture. So, just to confirm, you haven’t had any significant illnesses, surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. Broken a bone or two, when I was a kid, climbing trees, things like that. But nothing… serious. Just a normal childhood, you know? Always working with my hands. Fixing things. That's what I do. Still do. Don’t need fancy doctors for that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about any ongoing pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Look, I work with engines all day. My hands get a little sore sometimes, my back aches a bit after a long week, but that's just… work. Every man my age feels that. It’s not pain, it’s just… being alive, you know? I rub some liniment on it and get on with things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like typical aches and pains from physical work. Just to be thorough, are there any medications you take regularly, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never been one for pills. Waste of money, if you ask me. Liniment, like I said. And a good night's sleep. That's all I need. My wife tries to get me to take something for my joints sometimes, says they're getting “old”, but I refuse. I’d rather just keep moving. Makes it better, not worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And how about any allergies to anything – food, medications, insects, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. Bees stung me a couple times as a kid, didn’t bother me none. Dust gets in my eyes sometimes when I’m working in the garage, but who doesn't get dusty eyes? My wife is allergic to cats, but that's her problem, not mine. I've never had a reaction to anything I can recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… now we're getting somewhere. My father, he was a strong man. Worked hard his whole life. Died in his sleep, when he was… old. They said it was his heart, maybe? Didn't get much detail. Mother, she lived a long life too, mostly fine. A little arthritis in her hands when she got older, like my wife's got now. Nothing serious, just… old age things. We didn't spend much time at the doctor, if you understand me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like a family history of longevity, with some typical age-related conditions. Okay. And just one more question about your background before we move on to a physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Now look here. I drink a beer with dinner sometimes, that’s it. A good Swedish lager. Don't smoke. Never have. And recreational… what? Look, I'm a hardworking man. I don't have time for… that. My father didn’t, and I certainly don't. Waste of time and money, plain and simple. Next question?
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Just checking all the boxes. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. Okay, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don’t go poking around too much. I got work to do later. Just… do whatever you need to do, quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here, that would be great. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Both within normal limits. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Everything appears normal so far. I’m going to listen to your joints now. I'll need you to bend and flex your elbows, wrists, knees and ankles.
PATIENT: Fine. My wife keeps telling me I need to stretch more, but I haven't got the time for all that. Joints ache a little, you know? From the work.
DOCTOR: I’m noting some mild crepitus in your knees and elbows, which is consistent with age-related wear and tear, as you mentioned. There is some limitation in full extension of your right elbow, but no acute swelling or tenderness. Your wrists and ankles appear normal. Now, to complete the exam, I'd like to check your neurological function - your balance, coordination and reflexes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Look, I already told you, I feel fine. What's the point of all this poking and prodding? Can't I just sign something saying I'm healthy and get on with it? I haven't got all day. But fine. Go ahead. Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Balance is stable, coordination is intact. Reflexes are still 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Alright, Mr. Hartness, everything appears within normal limits for your age and physical activity level. I do note some mild crepitus in your knees and elbows consistent with wear and tear, but no signs of acute injury or disease. Based on this physical exam, you appear to be in generally good health. Now, to be thorough, I would recommend a basic blood workup to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. It would give us a more complete picture. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood work? Look, I told you, I feel fine. This is getting ridiculous. I'm a mechanic, not a porcelain doll. I don't need fancy tests. Cholesterol? Sugar? What does that have to do with fixing engines? Just… is there a form I can sign saying I'm healthy enough to join the army? Or do I need to come back every week for more poking and prodding?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. However, the army has specific medical requirements, and a basic blood workup is often required for enlistment, even if you feel perfectly healthy. It's a standard procedure. Without it, I'm unable to provide a medical clearance for enlistment. I can't ethically sign off on your health without completing these basic tests. We can order the blood work now, and the results will be available in a few days. It's a relatively quick procedure, and it will give us peace of mind, and fulfill the army's requirements. Would you like me to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Order the blasted blood work. Just… get it over with. But I'm telling you, it's a waste of time and money. And if it delays my enlistment, you'll be hearing from my lawyer.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I’ve ordered the blood work. The lab is just down the hall – I’ll have the nurse escort you. They’ll draw a small sample, and it will only take a few minutes. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together. And I’ll provide you with a signed clearance for enlistment, if everything checks out. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… tell the nurse to be quick about it. I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse come get you now. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Hartness. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available.
