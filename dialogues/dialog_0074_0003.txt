DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. My name is Dr. Reisig, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, sure. Look, I don't really have time for this, to be honest. My hand... it shakes. Been happening for a while now. It's just... annoying, alright? I make things, you know? Direct things. Hard to do when you can't hold a camera steady. Honestly, I don't know why I even bothered coming. Probably just old age.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I appreciate you coming in despite feeling that way. It's good you did come in, as we should investigate any new or bothersome symptom. While it could be related to age, it's important to rule out other possibilities. Could you tell me a bit more about when this shaking started?
PATIENT: When did it start? Honestly, doc, I don't remember exactly. A while ago. Months, maybe? Years? It comes and goes, you know? Not like it's constant. Sometimes it's worse when I’m... concentrating, I guess. Or tired. But I've always been tired. Look, I directed a lot of films, okay? Long hours. It’s not like I’ve got time to catalog every little tremor. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand it's difficult to pinpoint exactly when it began, especially with your busy history. That’s alright; we'll work with what you can recall. The fact that it seems to worsen with concentration or fatigue is helpful information. To get a better picture, could you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It shakes! What do you want me to say? It’s my hand, it… trembles. Like a leaf in the wind, I suppose. Though I haven’t spent much time looking at leaves lately. It's not like a big violent shake, alright? It's subtle. Annoying, like a fly buzzing around your head. My daughter keeps telling me I need to slow down, but she doesn't understand. She’s never made anything in her life.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you explaining that, Mr. Baide. It sounds like a fine tremor, and that’s a useful distinction. And I understand your frustration with having to slow down. To help me understand further, does anything else seem to make it worse or better?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm... coffee, probably. I like my coffee strong. Though, to be honest, everything makes it worse these days. Being cold, being tired, thinking too much... being alive, practically. Better? Not much. Maybe… when I’m not using it? When I’m sitting still, I guess. But what’s the fun in that? I need to do things, alright? I'm a producer and a director! Sitting still is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the tremor is particularly noticeable when you’re active or under stress, and lessened with rest. And I certainly appreciate your dedication to your work. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this tremor?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Look, I’m eighty years old, doc! What doesn't ache? My knees, my back… everything’s a little creaky. But you mean… besides the usual old-age stuff? Not really. Maybe… I’ve been a little clumsy lately. Dropped a few things. But I always was a bit of a klutz, to be honest. Don’t remember anything specifically related to the hand shaking, though.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And it’s helpful to rule out any other specific symptoms. You mentioned some general aches and pains, and some clumsiness. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history… Look, I've lived a long life. I’ve seen a lot of doctors. Honestly, I barely remember what they told me. High blood pressure, maybe? Something with my cholesterol, I think? My wife always handled all that stuff. She passed a few years ago, and… well, it all just went out of my head after that. Medicare sends me a lot of bills, that’s about all I know. Is this really important?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide, and I’m very sorry for your loss. It’s perfectly understandable that you might not recall specific details after such a significant event. Knowing about past medical conditions can help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. We can also access some of that information through your Medicare records if that’s alright with you. Just to be sure, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think... Oh, there's a little blue pill for… something. Blood pressure, maybe? And a white one for my… joints. That’s about it, I think. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take more, but honestly, I don't like all those pills. They make me feel… foggy. Honestly, I can barely keep track of the ones I do take.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Baide. That's helpful. Knowing about the blue pill for blood pressure and the white one for your joints is a good start. We can look up the specific names and dosages later, if that’s okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re willing. I’d like to check your reflexes, coordination, and muscle strength. It will help me assess the tremor more accurately. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't have time for poking and prodding, doc. Honestly. I have things to do. But… alright, fine. Get it over with. Just be quick about it, alright? I don't want to be here all day. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. First, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? This is ridiculous. You're going to make me drop something, I just know it. I’m a director, not a circus performer. And be careful, alright? I need these hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide. I’m just checking your reflexes and observing the tremor. I’m also going to ask you to touch your finger to your nose a few times, and then quickly alternate touching your nose and my finger. Just to check your coordination.
PATIENT: See? I told you I was clumsy. This is pointless. Just tell me if I’m dying or not and let me go. Honestly, I've had more stimulating conversations with my cleaning lady. And she doesn't poke me with hammers.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Baide. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing the tremor. The characteristics suggest it could be essential tremor, which is a common condition, especially with increasing age. However, other possibilities need to be ruled out. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Seriously? More poking and prodding? Look, doc, I’m an old man. I’ve lived a full life. Whatever it is, it’s probably just old age. But… fine. Do your tests. Get it over with. But I want a quick turnaround, alright? I don't have all day to sit around waiting for results. And if it’s nothing serious, I don't want to come back. Understand?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Baide. I will order the blood tests now, and we will expedite the results as much as possible. It typically takes a few days, and my office will contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol, as these can sometimes worsen tremors. I also want to reiterate that while it could be something benign like essential tremor, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. Depending on the results, we may need to consider further evaluation, such as a neurological consultation. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just get me out of here. I’ve wasted enough of my day already. And don't bother calling unless it's something serious. I have things to do, alright? Important things. Directing, producing… living. Just… send me the results when they're ready. And don’t expect a thank you card. .
