DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about this…procedure. My daughter insisted I come. Says I need a “clearance.” Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Been better, certainly, but what 81-year-old doesn’t ache a bit? It’s just… vanity, I suppose. She keeps going on about how I look “tired.” She means well, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A “clearance,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s what she called it. Some… face lift thing. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to the details. She handles all that. It’s not like I want to look like one of those…overdone women you see on television. Just a little tightening, she said. But apparently, you need to say it’s alright before they go ahead with it. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, a pre-operative evaluation is standard procedure, Mr. Orwin. Even for elective surgeries like a face lift. It’s simply to ensure you’re healthy enough to undergo anesthesia and recover without complications. It's not about whether or not you need it, it’s about patient safety. So, let’s start with a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any current medical problems – anything at all that’s bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: “Patient safety.” Hmph. I’ve lived eighty-one years without needing anyone to check if I’m “safe” before doing things. But alright, alright. What do you want to know? Let me think… My knees bother me, naturally. Getting old, you know. And my back aches. Used to be a terrazzo worker, you see. Hard work. Beyond that…oh, the doctor said my cholesterol was a bit high last year, but he put me on something. A little pill. Can’t remember the name of it.
DOCTOR: Terrazzo work… that is physically demanding. And you said a pill for cholesterol…do you currently take that pill?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Every morning. Small, white pill. I think it starts with a “S”…Sim…something. Simvastatin, perhaps? My daughter manages the refills, so I don't bother with the names. It's all a blur. Honestly, all these pills…they just want to keep you dependent, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Simvastatin, alright. That’s helpful. And aside from Simvastatin, are you taking any other medications – vitamins, supplements, over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: Vitamins? You think I need vitamins? I eat perfectly well. Mostly. My daughter keeps a lot of things around, though… Probably some of those fish oil capsules. She’s always going on about Omega-3s. And I take something for my… well, for my waterworks, if you understand what I mean. Old man’s problem. Little blue pill. Not Viagra, mind you, something else. I think it's called… Flomax? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Flomax, yes. That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Orwin, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don’t have allergies. I’m a Norwegian! We're a hardy folk. Though... now that I think about it, I got a bit of a rash once, years ago, after eating some shellfish. But that was decades ago. Probably just a bad oyster. Nothing serious. I wouldn't say I have allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Significant… hmm. Let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, naturally. And…oh! I broke my wrist a few years back, when I fell on the ice. Had to have a cast. That was a nuisance. Beyond that…no, not really. Nothing major. Just the usual bumps and bruises.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, broken wrist… good. Now, let’s talk about your family history, Mr. Orwin. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly, that’s a long story. My mother lived to be ninety, very healthy woman. Father…not so much. He had…something with his heart. A weak heart, I think. And my sister…she had cancer, years ago. Lung cancer. Didn’t smoke, though. Strange. Beyond that… Norwegians are a pretty hardy bunch, if you ask me. We don’t get sick much.
DOCTOR: Heart disease in your father, lung cancer in your sister… alright. Now, before we move on, a few lifestyle questions. Do you currently smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. My father tried it once, but he coughed so much he nearly choked. No, no smoking in my family. We’re sensible people.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? I have a glass of aquavit with dinner sometimes. A small one. For digestion, you see. My mother always said a little aquavit keeps the blood flowing. It's a Norwegian tradition. Nothing excessive, mind you. Just a polite glass.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, finally, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It’ll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, more poking and prodding. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. But alright, alright. Get it over with. Just… be quick about it, will you? I have a perfectly good dinner waiting for me. And my aquavit.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. Heart rate is regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Not overly concerning given your age, but worth noting. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/85. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Tympanic membranes are normal. Throat is clear, no significant inflammation. Overall, your exam is reasonably normal for your age. But the slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur do warrant further investigation before proceeding with elective surgery.
PATIENT: “Further investigation”? What does that even mean? More poking and prodding, I suppose. Look, I've lived eighty-one years. I think I know my own body. It's a little creaky, yes, but perfectly functional. I don't need to be fussed over. Is this going to mean I can’t have this… tightening thing?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, it’s not about whether or not you need it, it's about ensuring your safety. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues before putting you under anesthesia. I recommend an EKG and a basic blood panel to assess your overall health. It's a standard precaution. Depending on the results, we may need to consult with a cardiologist before proceeding. I wouldn’t want to put you at risk.
PATIENT: Cardiologist…blood panels… Honestly, it’s a conspiracy, I tell you. Just another way for them to take your money. Look, I appreciate your… caution, I suppose. But I’m not running a marathon here. It’s a little face lift! A little tightening! I’ll think about it. My daughter will probably have a fit if I say no. Fine. Do your tests. But I’m not promising anything. And don’t expect me to jump through hoops.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now and schedule an EKG for you this week. We’ll review the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. I understand your reluctance, but this is simply a necessary step to ensure your well-being. The nurse will explain the process. I'll have her come in now.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. And tell her to be quick about it. I have a dinner to get to. Honestly, all this fuss… .
