DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Yeah, well, I’m trying out for a team, a sports team. Need to get a check-up, make sure I’m still in good enough shape, you know? Get a paper signed or something. I’m not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lamark. That’s a very sensible idea. Preparing for a sports team requires ensuring you're in optimal health. We’ll certainly get that paperwork completed for you, and perform a thorough check-up to assess your current condition. I see here your age is 62, and your height and weight are noted as 183 centimeters and 129 kilograms, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Sounds about right. Though, honestly, I haven't weighed myself in a while. Those numbers… they could be a little off. But yeah, roughly.
DOCTOR: Understood. Those numbers are simply a starting point, and we'll confirm everything during our examination. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Honestly, not much to tell. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Never broken any bones, no serious illnesses. Had the usual childhood stuff, but nothing major. I try to eat okay, mostly. And I… well, I try to stay active, obviously, since I'm trying out for a team. Does that make sense? I don’t really go to doctors much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy, Lamark. It's always positive when someone has a relatively uncomplicated medical background. However, even without major issues, a thorough review is still important. When you say "the usual childhood stuff," can you recall anything specific?
PATIENT: Uh… chickenpox, I think. Measles, maybe? It was a long time ago, Doctor. Mom took care of it. Nothing that needed… hospitals or anything. Just stay in bed, drink lots of fluids, that sort of thing. Really, I can’t remember much detail. It’s… been decades.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Lamark. Childhood illnesses often fade from memory. It’s less important to recall specifics from that time, and more important to focus on your current health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing like that. Never had any of those problems. I feel alright. A little stiff in the mornings, maybe, but who doesn’t at my age? Definitely no diabetes or anything. I drink a bit, but nothing crazy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And just to be complete, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason other than childhood illnesses?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife. And no hospitals since I was a kid. Seriously, I’m starting to think I’m a bit of a medical miracle. I probably jinxed myself by saying that, didn’t I?
DOCTOR: Perhaps, but it's good information nonetheless! Let’s not tempt fate, though. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My parents… they’re both gone now. Dad… he had some heart trouble towards the end, I think. Nothing much before that. Mom was pretty healthy, actually, until… well, until old age got to her. I don’t really know much about my grandparents, to be honest. We weren't very close, and they lived far away.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to have limited information about family medical history, especially if relatives lived far away or passed away some time ago. Knowing your father had heart trouble is helpful, though. Did he have any specific diagnoses, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or a heart attack?
PATIENT: Uh… I think it was just… his heart got weak. I don’t really know the details. He went to the doctor a lot towards the end, but he never really told me much. He didn’t like talking about it, I guess. I remember pills, and… shortness of breath, sometimes. That’s about all I know, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Lamark. Some people prefer not to discuss their health issues. Shortness of breath is a significant symptom, though, and the fact that he was seeing a doctor frequently suggests it was a serious concern. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I try to stay active, like I said. I’ve always liked sports. I still play a bit of… well, I’m trying out for the team, so that gives you an idea. I used to drink more, but I’ve cut back. Smoke… no, never smoked. I eat… I eat pretty well, most of the time. I enjoy a good meal. And I sleep… I sleep okay. Not perfectly, but okay.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you maintain an active lifestyle and have avoided smoking. Cutting back on alcohol is also a positive step. When you say you eat “pretty well,” could you describe a typical day of meals for me?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. Breakfast is usually just toast and coffee. Sometimes eggs if I have time. Lunch is usually a sandwich, maybe some fruit. And dinner… dinner varies. Sometimes I cook, sometimes I eat out. I like noodles, rice dishes. Meat… I eat meat, but I try not to overdo it. I drink water, mostly. And… yeah, that’s pretty much it. Nothing fancy. I’m not a big snacker.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a reasonably balanced diet, Lamark. Now, one last question before we proceed with the physical examination. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Mom tried to give me everything as a kid, to build my immune system, I think. And nothing ever bothered me. So, no allergies. I think I'm pretty lucky.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies simplifies things considerably. Alright, Lamark. That gives me a good overview of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination to assess your current health status. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Let's get it over with. I've got things to do, you know? But yeah, do your thing.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please have a seat on the table. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a brief examination of your abdomen, neurological function, and musculoskeletal system. This cuff will inflate around your arm momentarily. It might feel a little tight.
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels… weird. I’m not a fan of doctors, never have been. But I need this done, so get on with it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your apprehension, and I will do my best to make this as comfortable as possible. Your blood pressure is 145/90 millimeters of mercury. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep that in mind. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, regular. Your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which is normal. Your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, within the normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please breathe normally. I hear a normal S1 and S2 heart sound, but there’s a very faint murmur. It's difficult to determine its significance without further investigation. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'll just palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: A murmur? What kind of murmur? Is that bad? And… yeah, a little tender right… there. Nothing major, just… a little uncomfortable. I get heartburn sometimes. That’s probably what it is. Don't worry about it too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the murmur, Lamark. It's often benign, but it warrants further investigation to determine its cause and significance. It could be a functional murmur, meaning it's not due to a structural heart problem, or it could indicate a valve issue. We’ll consider an echocardiogram – an ultrasound of the heart – to get a clearer picture. The tenderness you’re experiencing could be related to heartburn, as you suspect. We’ll keep that in mind as well. Now, I'm going to assess your neurological function. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There. See? Perfect. I told you I was alright. Just a bit of heartburn, a little stiffness in the mornings. Don’t go making a big deal out of nothing. I need this signed so I can get on with things.
DOCTOR: Excellent, your eye movements appear normal. Now, I’ll check your reflexes. Please relax your arms at your sides. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’ll quickly assess your musculoskeletal system. Could you please bend at the waist and touch your toes, if you’re able?
PATIENT: There. Happy? My back’s not what it used to be. I'm an old man, Doctor. What do you expect? Honestly, all this poking and prodding is just making things worse. Can we just get the paper signed?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Lamark. And I apologize if the examination has caused any discomfort. Your range of motion is somewhat limited, and you do exhibit some discomfort with flexion, which is consistent with age-related changes. Based on my examination, I’ve noted a slightly elevated blood pressure, a faint heart murmur, tenderness in your upper abdomen, and some limited range of motion in your back. To get a more complete picture, I recommend the following: 1. Echocardiogram: To evaluate the heart murmur and assess heart function. 2. Blood Work: Including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and lipid profile. 3. Follow-up Appointment: In two weeks to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques. I will prepare the paperwork you requested. However, due to the findings during the examination, I cannot sign it off unconditionally. I can provide a preliminary form stating your examination findings and recommendations. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An echocardiogram… more tests. This is ridiculous. I just need a paper signed so I can try out for the team. That's it. Alright, fine. Do what you have to do. But this is costing me time. And the preliminary form… yeah, that'll have to do. Just… please hurry. I've got a life, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lamark. I assure you, I’m working as efficiently as possible. These tests are simply precautionary measures to ensure your safety and well-being, especially given your desire to participate in sports. We want to make sure you're in optimal health before you begin strenuous activity. Here is the preliminary form detailing your examination findings and recommendations. It states that you have been evaluated and are currently being considered for participation in sports, pending the results of the echocardiogram and blood work. It also includes my recommendations for follow-up care. I will provide you with the requisitions for the echocardiogram and blood work. You can schedule these appointments at your convenience. Do you have any questions about the form or the recommendations?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… where do I get these tests done? And how long will they take? I need to know if this is going to interfere with tryouts.
DOCTOR: Here is a list of nearby facilities that offer echocardiograms and blood work. I recommend calling ahead to schedule appointments. The echocardiogram typically takes about 30-60 minutes, and the blood work should be relatively quick, about 15-20 minutes. The blood work results usually come back within 24-48 hours, and the echocardiogram results may take a few days to a week, depending on the facility. Once you have the results, please bring them to your follow-up appointment in two weeks, and we can discuss them further. I’ve also included information about a local cardiologist, Dr. Anya Sharma, if you'd like to establish care with a specialist. Do you have any other concerns or questions I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… maybe. We'll see. Look, I think that's everything. I appreciate you not making a bigger deal out of things. Just… get this done quickly so I can get on with my life. Thanks. I guess. And try not to scare me with any more bad news, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lamark. I understand your concerns, and I will do my best to provide you with clear and concise information. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or experience any concerning symptoms. Have a good day, Lamark. .
