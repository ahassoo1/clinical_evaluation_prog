DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, to put it simply… I’m hoping for a bit of a… fresh start, I suppose. I feel like I’m not quite running on all cylinders these days, and I'd like to get things back on track, you see. A jumpstart, if you will.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling like you're not at your best is definitely something we can address. “Not running on all cylinders” is a good way to put it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, I get tired easily, even after a good night’s sleep. Not the kind of tired a little rest fixes, you understand. And my memory… it isn’t what it used to be. Small things, mostly. Like where I put my glasses – happens all the time! – or names, sometimes. It's frustrating, you know? I used to be so sharp. And I just don't have the energy for my garden like I used to. It's my favorite thing, and now… well, it feels like a chore.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness even after rest, some memory difficulties – mostly with names and misplaced items, and decreased energy for activities you enjoy, specifically your garden. That's helpful to know. Let's try to get a clearer picture of all of this. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It sort of crept up on me. I think… maybe six months ago? Perhaps a little longer. It was around the time my neighbor, old Mr. Henderson, passed away. He and I used to do water aerobics together three times a week. After he was gone, I just… didn’t keep it up. And things felt… different after that. I suppose I wasn't as motivated, and then the tiredness started, and then I noticed I was misplacing things more often. It’s all a bit muddled, to be honest. Six months feels right, though. Maybe a little more.
DOCTOR: It’s very common for things to feel muddled when you’re dealing with changes like this, especially after a loss. It sounds like things started to shift around the time of Mr. Henderson’s passing. So, about six months ago, tiredness and memory issues began, coinciding with a change in your routine. Now, besides the tiredness and memory, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. My appetite hasn’t been very good lately. Not that I’m not eating, just not enjoying my food as much. And I’ve been feeling a little… down, I suppose. Not terribly sad, just… not my usual cheerful self. My daughter, Carol, keeps telling me I need to get out more. She says I’m isolating myself. She might be right. I just don’t have the energy to socialize like I used to. It feels like a lot of effort. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Decreased appetite, feeling a bit down, and a decrease in socialization due to low energy – I’m noting all of this. It sounds like we’re building a more complete picture. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. Dr. Ramirez, bless his soul, he was a good doctor. He passed away a few years back, too. And I had my gallbladder removed back in… oh, goodness, must have been the seventies. Other than that… not much. Just the usual aches and pains that come with being an old lady, you know? Nothing serious. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, and gallbladder removal in the 1970s. That’s helpful. Do you recall what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. Let me think… Carol handles most of that now, she's very organized. It's a little white pill… and another one that’s pink. I honestly can’t remember the names, I’m afraid. I just take them every morning, like I’m supposed to. I can tell you they don’t seem to be causing any trouble. No dizziness or anything like that. I can ask Carol when I get home, if that’s alright? She keeps a very detailed list.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McNabb. Carol keeping a detailed list is excellent. We can certainly confirm the medications with her. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but that cleared up years ago. No food allergies, no reactions to bee stings or anything like that. I’m a pretty sturdy lady, all things considered. I’ve always been lucky that way, I suppose. I always ate a lot of Chamorro food, and never had a problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no known allergies. And it's wonderful that you've been able to enjoy Chamorro cuisine without any issues. Now, before we move on, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had heart trouble later in life, I believe. She needed a pacemaker, eventually. And my grandfather… on my father’s side… he had something with his mind, I think. My aunt always said he was “not quite right” in his old age. She used to say he got “confused,” but it was a long time ago, and I wasn't very old myself. I don’t know if it was like… Alzheimer’s or something, but he definitely had trouble remembering things toward the end. It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and nobody talked about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mother and some memory issues in your grandfather. It’s understandable that the details are hazy, especially given the time and how these things weren't always discussed openly. That information is still helpful. Now, lastly, let's talk a little about your daily life. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. My husband, George, passed away five years ago. It's quiet, but I manage. Carol lives about ten minutes away, and she checks on me a few times a week. She’s a good girl, always making sure I have everything I need. I keep busy, though. I like to garden when I have the energy, and I read a lot. I used to volunteer at the church, but I haven’t been going much lately. It’s just… hard to get motivated sometimes. I miss George, terribly, and I think that has a lot to do with it. He always kept me going.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a good support system with Carol, and it’s very understandable that you’re still feeling the loss of your husband, George. It's clear he was a significant part of your life. Okay, Ms. McNabb, that gives me a good overall picture of things. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a simple neurological exam to assess your reflexes and memory. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are. It's good to know someone is listening and trying to help. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A bit elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear and breathing is normal. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. I asked you to recall three words a few moments ago, and you were able to repeat them correctly. However, when I asked you what you had for breakfast this morning, you hesitated briefly before recalling it. That’s not necessarily concerning on its own, but it’s something we’ll keep an eye on. Everything seems within normal limits for your age, but given your symptoms and family history, I’d like to order some blood tests. We’ll check your thyroid function, vitamin B12 levels, and a complete blood count. We will also want to test for something called cognitive impairment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That all sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood tests, cognitive tests… whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. Yes, that's perfectly alright. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you see? It's unsettling not feeling like myself anymore. And if there's anything I can do to help, please let me know. I may be an old lady, but I'm still a fighter.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. McNabb. You are a fighter, and we’ll work together to figure this out. The blood tests will give us a good baseline and help rule out any underlying medical conditions. The cognitive assessment is a simple test that will help us evaluate your memory and thinking skills more objectively. I'll have the lab draw the blood today. The results usually take a few days. Once we have those, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active, even if it’s just a little bit each day, and making sure you’re eating a healthy diet. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. I appreciate your kindness and patience. You’re a very good doctor. I think that’s all I need for now. Just knowing there’s a plan in place is a great relief. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McNabb. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. The nurse will escort you to the lab for your blood draw. Please don’t hesitate to call if any questions come up. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
