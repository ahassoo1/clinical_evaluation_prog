DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and I'll be your doctor today. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me this morning?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's… it's about going to the bathroom. Or, more accurately, not going to the bathroom easily. It’s been…troublesome, for a little while now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Difficulty with urination can certainly be troublesome. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it takes me a while to start, you know? I have to…wait. And sometimes it feels like it doesn’t all come out, even when I think I’m finished. It’s… frustrating. It's not a sudden thing, it’s just gotten worse slowly over, oh, maybe the last few months, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over the past few months. That’s helpful to know. And when you say it takes a while to start, could you estimate how long we're talking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It used to be almost immediate, you know? Now… sometimes I have to sit there for a good minute, maybe even two, before anything happens. And I have to… strain a little, too. Not painful, exactly, just… effort. It feels like I have to push to get things moving.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a delay in starting urination, taking a minute or two, and a sensation of straining. Do you find yourself having to go to the bathroom more frequently than usual, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t know if more frequently, exactly. I think I’m just… more aware of needing to go, because of the trouble getting it started. I try not to drink too much before bed, you know, to avoid that. But during the day, maybe…normal? I haven’t really kept track, to be honest. I just know it's a bother.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. No need to keep track if you haven’t been. So, no significant change in frequency, but a heightened awareness due to the difficulty. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, sometimes I feel like I haven’t emptied my bladder completely, even after I go. And sometimes, just a little dribbling afterwards, you know? Not a lot, just a few drops. It’s embarrassing, really. And… oh! Sometimes, a little discomfort down there, a sort of… ache, but it goes away pretty quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so incomplete emptying, some post-void dribbling, and occasional discomfort. Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Ms. Yadao. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on medication years ago and it’s been under control ever since. And… let me think… I had a bit of a problem with my kidneys when I was younger, maybe thirty years ago? But they said it cleared up on its own. Oh, and arthritis, in my hands. Nothing major, just gets a little stiff sometimes. I think that's it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of hypertension managed with medication, a previous kidney issue that resolved, and arthritis. Thank you. And have you ever had any surgeries, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, a long time ago. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy when I was in my thirties. That was… a while back. I don’t think there’s been anything else. Nothing in recent years, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and hysterectomy. Thank you. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, just the one for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis, when it’s really bothering me. But that's it, really. Just the two. Nothing else regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for hypertension and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Now, I’d like to ask about allergies, Ms. Yadao. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. I used to get hay fever when I was a child, but that's gone away now. I can eat anything, take any medicine... I’m pretty lucky that way. No allergies to report.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members who have had problems with their kidneys, bladder, or prostate?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father had some trouble with his kidneys when he was older, I think. He needed dialysis for a while, but he passed away before I really understood what was going on. And… my brother had some bladder infections, but they cleared up with antibiotics. As for prostate problems… that was my brother’s husband, I believe, but I don’t know much about it. It was years ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. That's helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I've never smoked a day in my life. And I haven't had a drink in… well, it's been decades. Not since my husband passed away. And drugs? Never touched them. I lead a pretty quiet life, mostly. Just my garden and my church.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Now, Ms. Yadao, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I'll also do a quick neurological exam to assess your reflexes. And I’d like to check a urine sample, if that’s alright with you. This will help us get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A urine sample… yes, I can do that. Just let me know where to go.
DOCTOR: Excellent. There’s a restroom just down the hall. I'll give you a cup, and I’ll ask you to collect a midstream sample. I'll explain that to you briefly. And then we can return here for the rest of the exam. Please wash your hands thoroughly before you collect the sample. And try to collect a midstream sample – that is, start urinating, then collect a sample midway through the stream. This helps to ensure a more accurate result. Take your time, and let me know when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds easy enough. A midstream sample… I think I remember that from before. I’ll just go now, then. And I’ll come right back when I’m finished.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Yadao. I'll be right here when you return.
