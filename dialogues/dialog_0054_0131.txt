DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s my blood pressure. It's been a bit high lately, and my sister said I should really get it checked out. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: That's good of your sister to encourage you to come in. High blood pressure is definitely something we want to take seriously. Just to get a better understanding, can you tell me how high it's been, if you know the numbers?
PATIENT: Hmm, numbers… I don’t really remember exactly. I checked it a couple times at the pharmacy, you know, those machines they have? It was usually red though, not green. And one time it was really high, like… 160 over something? But I don’t remember the second number. Sorry, I’m not good with remembering numbers.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mykeisha. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember the exact numbers. “Red” is helpful information, and 160 over something is a good starting point. It does sound like it's been elevated. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to take your blood pressure myself right now. And then we can talk a little more about when you first noticed it being high, and if you’ve been experiencing any symptoms along with it – things like headaches, dizziness, or shortness of breath. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Taking it here is probably better than me trying to do it myself at the pharmacy. And headaches… yeah, I've been getting a few more of those lately. Nothing terrible, but just… more frequent, you know? And sometimes I feel a little… breathless when I climb the stairs, but I figured that was just because I’m not as young as I used to be!
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re telling me about the headaches and the breathlessness, Mykeisha. Those could certainly be related. And it’s always wise to investigate when things change, regardless of age. Okay, let's get your blood pressure reading first. Just relax your arm for me, and try to take a few deep breaths. I'll let you know the numbers as soon as we have them.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breaths… trying.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 158 over 92. And your pulse is 78, which is normal. That reading does confirm that it’s elevated, as your sister suspected. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be causing this, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been pretty healthy, all my life really. A few colds here and there, but that’s about it. My mother, she had arthritis, but I don’t think I got that from her. Oh, and I had a bad bout of the flu a couple years ago, but I recovered just fine.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mykeisha. So no chronic conditions diagnosed, which is helpful. And just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’m really lucky, I think. I’ve always been careful about what I eat and try to stay active, even if it’s just walking around the neighborhood.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful! Staying active and eating well are excellent habits, and they definitely contribute to good health. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any health conditions that run in your family—heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney problems—anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… my grandfather on my father’s side, he had heart trouble, I think. He died when I was pretty young, so I don't remember much about it. And my aunt, she had high blood pressure, but she didn't take care of herself. Smoked a lot, drank a lot… not like me at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. A family history of heart trouble and hypertension does increase your risk, but it doesn’t mean you'll necessarily develop it. Now, to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a… well, it's a little of everything, really. Personal care, helping people out. It keeps me busy, that's for sure. I don't smoke, and I hardly ever drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine at Christmas. I eat pretty healthy, like I said, mostly fish and vegetables. And I try to walk a few times a week.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very healthy lifestyle overall, Mykeisha. Okay, and just to finish up with the medical history basics, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I've never had any problems with any food or medicine. I can eat anything, thankfully!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s excellent. So, to summarize, you're a 36-year-old female with no known chronic medical conditions, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations, no allergies, and a healthy lifestyle. You’ve reported some recent headaches and breathlessness with exertion, and your blood pressure is elevated. Your family history includes heart trouble and hypertension. Given your blood pressure reading of 158/92, it's considered Stage 2 hypertension. It’s important to address this to prevent any long-term health problems. Now, before we jump to conclusions, I'd like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what might be causing this. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… okay. Yeah, that’s alright. If it’s going to help find out what’s going on, then yes. What kind of tests are we talking about? I don't like needles, if that matters.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles. We'll try to minimize discomfort as much as possible. The tests I’m thinking of are pretty standard. First, a blood test to check your kidney function, electrolytes, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. This will help rule out any underlying medical conditions. Second, an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart rhythm and look for any signs of heart damage. And finally, a urine test. The blood test will require a small blood sample, and the EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest. The urine test is just a simple sample collection. Would you be comfortable with those?
PATIENT: Stickers I can handle, definitely. And a little bit of blood is… okay, if it’s necessary. Urine test is no problem at all. So stickers and a little blood, huh? Alright, let’s get it over with. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Like, should I eat anything special beforehand?
DOCTOR: That's great, Mykeisha. You're being very cooperative. For the blood test, it's best to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand, so no food or sugary drinks. You can drink water. For the EKG and urine test, there's no special preparation needed. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now, and then we'll do the EKG right after. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. It might involve lifestyle modifications, or possibly medication, depending on what we find. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, no food. I can do that. Just… no breakfast? I guess I can skip breakfast. And then the stickers, and we'll see what happens. Yeah, that sounds… okay. Hopefully it's nothing too serious. Just want to get it sorted out.
DOCTOR: Okay. And it’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious about this. We'll take everything one step at a time, and I'll explain everything clearly as we go along. We’re just gathering information right now. I'll have the nurse come in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, if you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm going to step out for a moment to review some of the lab orders, but I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor.
