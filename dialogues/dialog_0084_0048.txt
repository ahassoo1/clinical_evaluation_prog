DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Lason. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my head. Things…aren't quite right sometimes. My wife, she's the one who really insisted I come. She says I’ve been…forgetful. Though I don’t see it. But there are times, you know, a bit of confusion. Just little things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good that your wife is looking out for you, and it’s common for family members to notice changes before we do ourselves. "Little things" can be important. So, can you tell me a bit more about these times of confusion?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s hard to explain. It's not like I forget everything. I remember exactly how to lay tile, every cut, every angle, after forty years. But…dates, sometimes. Or names. People I should remember. And…losing things. Not important things, like my tools, thankfully. But where I put my glasses, or…what I was doing just a moment ago. It's irritating, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So it sounds like it’s mostly with recent memory – dates, names, things you’ve done recently?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Recent things. Old things, I recall perfectly. Ask me about building the temple in Siem Reap, I can tell you every stone. But ask me what I had for breakfast? Don’t bother. My wife gets frustrated, saying I ask her five times in an hour. Which is…unfair. She should remember what we had for breakfast too!
DOCTOR: I can see how that would be frustrating for both of you. It sounds like it’s primarily affecting your short-term memory. And it’s good you’re able to recall details from your past so clearly. Do you have any trouble with things other than remembering names and dates?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can still do my work. I laid a whole bathroom floor last week, no problems. My hands remember what my head…sometimes forgets. It doesn't affect my balance, or my speech. I can still understand people just fine. It’s just…this fuzziness.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s reassuring. And you haven't noticed any changes in your vision, or difficulty with speaking or walking?
PATIENT: No, none of that. My eyes are still sharp enough to spot a crooked tile from across the room. And I can still yell at my son-in-law for tracking mud in the house, loud and clear! He doesn’t listen any better, of course, but that’s a different problem.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years ago. I take a pill for it. And my knees ache sometimes, old age, I suppose. But no major illnesses. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. Been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some knee pain. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it’s a little white pill. That’s about all I remember. My wife handles the refills, so she'd know the exact name. I just take it every morning with my coffee. It’s… starts with a ‘L’ I think. Lisinopril? Something like that. Maybe.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, yes. I see it in your records. And how about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had a reason for one, thankfully. And no hospital stays. A few broken bones when I was a boy, climbing trees, foolish things. But nothing serious in recent years. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has had memory problems, or conditions like Alzheimer's disease or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother… she was a bit forgetful towards the end, yes. Not like me, not really. More…absent-minded. Lost things, forgot appointments. But she lived a long life, she wasn't really sick, it was just old age, I suppose. My wife's side… I don't know, haven’t asked. They don’t talk about such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had some memory issues in her later years, but it sounds like it wasn't severe. And you're not sure about your wife's family history. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father was a smoker, it smelled awful, and it didn’t do him any good. Alcohol… I have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A little red wine, good for the heart, they say. Not every day, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, and occasional small amounts of alcohol. Now, about any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not to food, not to plants, not to anything, as far as I know. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction. My wife always checks when she makes me new food, but I always tell her it's unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and balance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. Though I suppose I have more time now that I’m not laying tile every day. My son-in-law says I need to “slow down”. He doesn't understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not significantly different from what I see in your records. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good airflow. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. I can do that. Perfectly fine. Always had good eyesight. Used to be able to spot a crooked tile from fifty paces. There. Am I following it? Properly?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly. You're tracking well. Now, I'm going to ask you to stand up, if you're able. Just try to stand still and balance yourself. Alright, good. A little unsteady, but nothing major. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. I can walk. See? Perfectly fine. Though this floor is a bit slippery. Always complained about that to the builders. But they never listened.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. It looks like you have a slightly wider gait than usual and some mild balance issues, but nothing alarming. Now, let's do a simple cognitive test. I'm going to ask you to repeat three words and then recall them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Three words? Very well. Get on with it. I used to manage entire construction projects, three words won't be a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There. Done. Simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few other questions. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: What year? Really? You're asking me the year? It's… 2025, isn't it? Yes. 2025. I read the newspaper. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where are we? This is… a doctor’s office. Your office, of course. In the… well, it’s a rural area. My wife said it was a bit of a drive. Not my preferred location. Prefer to stay closer to town.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Three words… three words… Hmm. Apple… I remember apple. And… something with wood… a desk? No, not a desk… A chair? Oh dear. Now you’ve put me on the spot. I knew it, always happens. Words… escaping me.
DOCTOR: Okay. You remembered apple, and you were close with the second word – it was table. And the third word was penny. Based on the exam and your responses, you're experiencing some short-term memory loss and mild difficulties with recall, along with a slightly unsteady gait. It’s not severe, but it's enough to warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a few tests, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. We should also consider a brain scan, like an MRI, to rule out any structural issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A brain scan? Now, hold on. A brain scan sounds… serious. Is something wrong? I told you, I'm just a bit forgetful. Happens to everyone. My wife worries too much. But a brain scan… that's a bit extreme, don't you think?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. A brain scan doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. It's simply a precautionary measure to get a clearer picture of what's going on and rule out any potential causes for your memory issues. There are many reasons why someone might experience memory loss, and most of them aren’t serious. The tests will help us determine the cause and develop an appropriate plan. We can discuss the results in detail once we have them. In the meantime, I'd also like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Another specialist? This is getting ridiculous. All this for a few forgotten names and dates? Look, doctor, I appreciate your concern, but I don't want to be poked and prodded and scanned. I’m an old man. Maybe my head is just… slowing down. Is that so wrong? Perhaps a good rest and a bit less worrying from my wife is all I need.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lason. It's completely valid to feel overwhelmed by the prospect of further testing. And you're right, it's possible that this is simply a natural part of aging. However, memory loss can also be a sign of an underlying condition that's treatable, and it’s important to rule out those possibilities. While I respect your decision, I strongly recommend at least considering the neurological evaluation. A neurologist can provide a more specialized assessment and help us determine the best course of action. If you're hesitant about a full evaluation right now, we could start with a simpler cognitive test that can provide more detailed information about your memory function. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A…simpler test? Not a brain scan? And just a specialist looking at the results? Alright. Fine. I suppose I can agree to a simpler test. But that’s it. No poking, no prodding, and definitely no brain scans. My wife will be happy, though I doubt she’ll be satisfied with just that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I think that’s a good starting point. The test will take about 30-45 minutes. It's a series of questions and tasks that will help us assess your memory and cognitive function. I’ll arrange for that to be scheduled with a specialist in our clinic. In the meantime, I'd also like you to continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and try to maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and a balanced diet. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s enough for today. Just get it over with. And please, tell the specialist not to waste my time with unnecessary procedures. I've got better things to do than spend my days in a doctor’s office. Like… remembering how to lay tile, before that disappears too.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I’ll make a note of your concerns and ensure the specialist is aware of your preferences. My nurse will schedule the cognitive test for you before you leave. Thank you for coming in today. I appreciate your willingness to seek help, and I’m confident we can work together to determine the cause of your memory issues and develop an appropriate plan. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Have a good day, Mr. Lason.
