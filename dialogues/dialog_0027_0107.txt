DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, my heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not good flapping, you know? Like a bird, but inside. It happens… not all the time. It makes me feel tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Flapping” – that’s a good way to describe it. And it makes you feel tired afterwards?
PATIENT: Yes, very tired. Like I have no energy. Even just walking… hard. It doesn’t hurt, just… weak. And it comes and goes. Sometimes days okay, sometimes… boom. It happens. Last time was… July 28th, I think. Wednesday. I was making tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 28th making tea... that's helpful. And it doesn’t cause any chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath when it happens?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not dizzy. I can breathe okay, I think. Sometimes… maybe a little worried, that’s all. Like something is wrong. But no… not hard to breathe. Just… scared when it starts. It’s fast, you know? My heart goes very fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fast heartbeats, not associated with pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath, but causing you worry and fatigue. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? I don’t think so. Maybe… when I am busy? Like, lots of work. I work with… machines. Big machines. Chemicals. But it happens when I relax too. Not sure. It’s just… random. Sometimes after I eat… maybe? Big meal. Not always. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possibly related to stress, work, or large meals, but it’s not consistent. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing before. Never been to the doctor much. Just… small things. Cold, maybe. Never anything serious. My wife… she goes to the doctor more than me. She has… I don't remember. Something with her stomach. But me? No. Healthy, I think. Mostly. Until this heart thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. No hospital. I broke my arm when I was a little boy… playing. But that’s it. Just the arm. It healed good. Doctor in Yemen… he fixed it. Long time ago. No problems since.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My father… he had some problems with his… pressure, I think. High pressure. He took pills. My mother… she was healthy. Very healthy. Lived long time. My brothers and sisters… they are okay. No heart problems that I know of. We don’t talk much about… health things. It’s not really… talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure in your father, but otherwise no significant heart issues that you're aware of. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I drink tea, that’s all. Sometimes coffee, but not much. Just tea. And water. No pills. No vitamins. My wife… she takes lots of things. But I don’t. Just tea. And I try to eat healthy. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. I eat everything. Sometimes my wife says I eat too much. But no allergies. No problems with… bee stings or anything like that. Never had a reaction to anything. I’m good with food. Very good.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Listen to my heart… good. Check… everything. I trust you. Do what you need. I just want to know what’s wrong with my heart. It’s okay. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Now another deep breath… and exhale. Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 142 over 90. Your pulse is regular, but a bit fast at 98. I’m hearing a regular rhythm, but I do detect a slight… murmur. It's faint, but present. Lungs sound clear. I'd like to order an EKG and some blood work, just to get a better picture of what's going on. The blood work will include a complete blood count and a thyroid panel. The EKG will help us look at the electrical activity of your heart.
PATIENT: EKG and… blood work? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? Is my heart… very broken? What will you find? I don’t like tests. Is it expensive? I don't have… insurance.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a breath. EKG stands for electrocardiogram. It’s a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all - we just put some stickers on your chest. The blood work will tell us about your overall health and rule out other possible causes for your symptoms. It's not necessarily that your heart is broken. We're just gathering information to understand what's causing these palpitations and fatigue. It's important to rule things out, and that’s what these tests will help us do. Regarding cost… I understand you don’t have insurance. Let me check what the prices are for these tests. Our billing department offers a discount for self-pay patients, and we can also discuss payment options. I want to make sure we can figure something out. We'll get you the information you need to make an informed decision. I don’t want cost to prevent you from getting the care you need. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… stickers, you say? No… hurt? That’s good. I don’t like needles much. But stickers… okay. And you will check… the price? Discount? That would be… very good. My wife… she worries about money. So, discount… yes, please. I want to know what’s wrong, but… we have to be careful. So, stickers and discount… that sounds better. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No needles, just stickers. I’ll have the nurse draw up the lab order and print out the information about the pricing and the discount for self-pay patients. She can explain everything to you while she prepares the EKG. In the meantime, I want you to avoid excessive caffeine and energy drinks. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. No caffeine… no energy drinks. I mostly drink tea, so that’s okay. But no energy drinks… good. And if… pain or dizzy… emergency room. I understand. My wife… she will make sure I don’t do anything silly. So, no caffeine, no dizzy, emergency room… and stickers soon?
DOCTOR: Yes, stickers soon. The nurse will be in shortly to start the EKG. And remember, we're just trying to get a clearer picture of what's happening. It's often something minor, but it's best to rule everything out. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that’s all. I’m a little nervous, but… you explain things good. Thank you for… not laughing at me when I say “flapping”. And for the stickers. I will wait for the nurse. Thank you. I think… that’s all for now.
