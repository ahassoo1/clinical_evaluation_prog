DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… concerning, this issue. I have been… forgetting things. Small things, mostly, but more lately. And my blood pressure, it has been… difficult to manage. I am Venus Alvara.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Alvara. It's good you're addressing these concerns. We can definitely look into both the memory issues and your blood pressure. To start with the memory problems, could you describe what you mean by "forgetting things"?
PATIENT: Yes, please. It is… troubling. It is not like I forget who people are, or big events. It is… where I put my keys, or what I was about to say. Yesterday, I made tea, and I… completely forgot I did. I found two cups, already cold. And names… sometimes a name is on the tip of my tongue, but it will not come. Small things. Annoying things, mostly. But more now.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, mostly recent memory lapses – things like misplacing items, difficulty recalling recent events, and occasionally struggling with names. And you’ve noticed this has been increasing recently. Can you give me a sense of how recently this has been happening?
PATIENT: It is… difficult to say exactly. Perhaps… six months ago, it was very rare. Maybe once a month. Now? Several times a week. Sometimes even… twice in one day. It is concerning because… my late husband, he… he had problems with remembering. Not like this, exactly, but… it brings back unpleasant memories. I do not want… I do not want that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially given your husband’s experience. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. We will investigate to determine the cause and best course of action. Let’s move on to your blood pressure. How long have you been aware of having issues with it?
PATIENT: Oh, the blood pressure. It is… a long story. Perhaps… ten years now? The doctor before, he put me on pills. I stopped taking them. They made me feel… unwell. Now, my neighbor checks it sometimes, but it is… often too high. It is not a constant problem, but when it is high, it is… very high. I do not like the feeling. It makes me dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were previously on medication for your blood pressure for about ten years, but stopped due to side effects. You’ve been off medication since then, and your neighbor monitors it occasionally, noting times when it’s significantly elevated and causing you dizziness. Do you know what your blood pressure readings typically are when your neighbor checks them?
PATIENT: I… I do not remember the numbers exactly. My neighbor, she writes them down, but… I have not looked at the list recently. She says it is… “too high,” and that I should see a doctor. She is a very good neighbor, but she is not a medical professional, you understand. I think… last time, she said something about “160 over 90?” But I could be mistaken. It frightened me, so I do not focus on the numbers.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that your neighbor is looking out for you, and it’s perfectly alright that you don’t focus on the numbers when you’re feeling anxious. A reading of 160 over 90 would be considered high. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to check your blood pressure myself. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please do. I would… like to know. It is better to know, yes? And perhaps… a different medication? Something that does not make me feel so unwell. I would like that very much. I just… I do not want this to get worse.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Knowing is always best, and we can certainly explore different medication options if needed. Alright, Ms. Alvara, I'm going to wrap this cuff around your arm. Try to relax your arm and take a few deep breaths. This will give us a good starting point. Okay, your blood pressure is 168 over 94. And your pulse is 72 and regular. As you mentioned, that is elevated. Now, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your overall health, if you don’t mind. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms – headaches, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No chest pain, thank you. And my vision is… fine, I believe. I wear glasses, of course, but that is for distance. No changes. Sometimes… a little dizziness, especially when my blood pressure is high. And… fatigue. I tire easily. But that could be… my age, yes? I do not sleep as well as I used to. No headaches. I feel… mostly normal, except for the forgetting and the dizziness. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Alvara. It sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of symptoms that are definitely worth investigating. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions, like diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I have… had the usual things. Colds, flu, a broken wrist when I was young. But no serious illnesses. My late husband, he had… heart problems, but not me. I try to eat… reasonably healthy. I enjoy cooking. Not much sweets, mostly vegetables. I walk when the weather is good. I am not… a very active person, but I try to stay healthy. I do not drink alcohol. Never have. And I do not smoke.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Alvara. It sounds like you’ve been very conscientious about your health. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Only the broken wrist, Doctor. When I was a girl. It was… a long time ago. I was ten years old, I believe. A silly accident. I fell from a tree. It healed well. No other surgeries. No other hospital stays. I try to avoid… doctors and hospitals, if I can. It reminds me… of my husband. But I understand it is necessary sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. My parents… they both passed away when I was young. From… old age, mostly. I do not know much about their medical history. My mother, she had… some problems with her memory, perhaps? But it was a long time ago. I do not remember the details. My father… he was a strong man. Never sick. I have a sister, but we do not speak very often. She lives in Russia. I do not know about her health. I am… not very close to my family. I am sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Alvara. You’ve shared what you know, and that’s perfectly fine. It's not always possible to have a complete family medical history. Finally, do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I used to take… something for my joints, a few years ago. But it did not help. And it upset my stomach. So I stopped. Now, I just… try to manage on my own. I drink tea. And try to get enough sleep. Nothing else. No pills. No vitamins. Nothing. I prefer… natural remedies, if possible. But the forgetting… it is more than just needing more sleep, I believe. It is… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Alvara. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me. Given your symptoms of increasing forgetfulness and elevated blood pressure, and the fact that you're not on any current medications, I think it's important to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, a thyroid panel, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. We should also do an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. And, given your memory concerns, I’d like to order a cognitive assessment to get a baseline of your memory and thinking skills. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: Those… are many tests, Doctor. Is it… necessary? I do not like… needles, and I worry about what the results might show. I just want… to feel better. Is there… anything else I can do? Perhaps… change my diet? Or… get more rest? I understand you want to be thorough, but… it is frightening. I suppose… if you think it is necessary. But I would… appreciate it if you could explain the results to me very clearly. And… what they mean. I am not a medical professional, you understand. I just… want to understand.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask those questions, Ms. Alvara. It is a lot of tests, and I understand your apprehension. I wouldn't order them if I didn't think they were important. The reason I’m recommending these tests is to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. For example, thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, or even early signs of cardiovascular disease can affect both your memory and blood pressure. The cognitive assessment will give us a baseline to monitor any changes over time. We will start with the bloodwork and EKG. The cognitive assessment is a simple set of questions, and we can do that here in the office today if you're comfortable. It’s also good that you’re thinking about lifestyle changes like diet and rest. Those are definitely important. But before we make any changes, I want to have a better understanding of what's going on internally. I will explain the results to you very clearly, in language you understand, and we can discuss the best course of action together. We will take things one step at a time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds more reassuring. One step at a time. I can do that. The cognitive assessment… today? If it is not too… taxing. And if you promise to explain the results… very carefully. I trust your judgment. I just… I worry about what we might find. But I understand it is better to know, yes? Alright. Let us… begin with the bloodwork and the EKG. And then… the questions. But slowly, please.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Alvara. That’s a very sensible approach. I promise to explain everything very carefully, and we will absolutely take things slowly. Okay, let's start with the bloodwork. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw a few vials of blood. It will only take a few minutes. After that, we’ll do the EKG, which is also quick and painless. Then, we can sit down and I'll ask you a few questions. Please, have a seat and I’ll have the phlebotomist come in. Would you like a glass of water while we wait?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Water would be lovely, thank you. I am… a little nervous. It has been a long time since I have been to a doctor. But I trust you. Please… just take your time. I will try to… relax. And I am ready for the questions… when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Alvara. There's no rush at all. I understand your nervousness, and we’ll go at your pace. I’m here to listen and help you feel comfortable. “Hello, Ms. Alvara. Dr. Soodeen has asked me to draw a few vials of blood for some routine tests. It shouldn't take long.” “Just let me know if you feel any discomfort during the blood draw, and I’ll be right here.”
