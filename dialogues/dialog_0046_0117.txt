DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah. Doc, right? I… I got a cough. Been coughin’ up stuff. Red stuff. Not good. Been smokin’ a long time, I guess. That what you want to know? I just… want it fixed, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. A cough with red-colored sputum. I understand. And you mentioned a history of smoking – how long have you been smoking, and how much do you typically smoke?
PATIENT: Long time. Real long. Since I was… young. Don't remember exactly how many years. A pack a day, maybe? Sometimes more. Sometimes less. It's hard to keep track. It's been… a while. I don't really… count anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. A pack a day for a long period of time. Thank you for being honest with me, Mr. Reyno. That’s important information. Besides the cough and the red-colored sputum, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Uh… tired. Real tired. More than usual, I mean. And kinda… short of breath. Especially when I walk. Even just to the store. Makes me stop and catch my breath. That it. I think. Memory’s not so good these days. Did I say somethin’ else?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and shortness of breath, especially with exertion. We'll definitely explore those. Have you had a fever or any chills recently?
PATIENT: Fever? I… don’t know. Maybe? I get warm sometimes, but I thought that was just the… the heat. It's been hot, you know? Hard to tell what’s normal anymore. No shivers, though. Not that I remember. Definitely no shivers.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe a little. Not much, but… yeah. Especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just… bein’ old. And the heat, again. Everything swells in this heat. I don't pay much attention, if I’m bein' honest. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re noticing it, Mr. Reyno. It's helpful information. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions like heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Uh… Doc, I go to the clinic sometimes. They give me pills for… somethin’. High blood pressure, maybe? Something like that. And I had a bad spell a few years back, chest pain, but they fixed it with… more pills. I don’t really… remember the names. Sorry. It was a long time ago. Never been told I had nothin’ wrong with my lungs. Or… the sugar sickness. Does that answer your question? I just… take the pills they give me.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Reyno. We can look up your records here at the clinic. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Not that I remember. Maybe when I was a kid… somethin’ small. But nothin' big. Definitely nothin’ in a long time. I'd remember somethin’ like that, right? A big surgery? No. Just… the pills. Always the pills. I wish I could just… not need them. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: We can certainly discuss that as we figure out what's going on, Mr. Reyno. Now, regarding your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, lung problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… not much family left. My brother, he… he had somethin' bad with his heart. Years ago. And my mom… she got sick too. Real sick. But I don't know what kind of sick. Just… sick. Old age, maybe? They didn't have good doctors back then. Everything just… faded away. It's been a long time. I don’t know the details. Sorry. I really don’t.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Reyno. You've shared what you remember, and that's helpful. Do you drink alcohol, and have you ever used tobacco products other than cigarettes?
PATIENT: Used to drink. A beer now and then. Not much anymore. Doc told me to stop. Been good about that, mostly. And cigarettes… that’s it. Always cigarettes. Never tried nothin’ else. Just… these. For a long, long time. I always tell people, never started, they'd say 'You shouldn't', but they didn't understand. I can't help it. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. And finally, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
