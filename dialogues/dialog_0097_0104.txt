DOCTOR: Hi Tammie, it's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh. Hello. It’s… my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for a little bit now, I suppose. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of these things. Just… hurts when I swallow. Can we get this over with quickly? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Tammie. We’ll get this sorted out as efficiently as possible. Sore throat, okay. And it's worse when you swallow. About how long has it been hurting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Maybe… a week? Or more? I really couldn’t say. Time just… goes. It wasn’t bad bad at first, just a little scratchy. Now it’s… noticeable. Is that good enough? I don’t understand why it matters exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Tammie. It helps me get a better picture, but we can work with "about a week or more." Has anything specific made it worse, like being out in the cold, or talking a lot?
PATIENT: No. Not really. I haven’t been anywhere cold. And I don't "talk a lot". I speak when I need to. It’s just… there. It’s probably nothing, really. People get sore throats. Is this going to take long? I have… arrangements.
DOCTOR: Okay. No specific triggers, and it’s been present for over a week. I understand you're busy, Tammie. Just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the sore throat?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Like what? I don't have… the plague. Just my throat. And I’m a little tired, maybe. But everyone is tired. It’s August! It's hot. I don't see what that has to do with anything. Are you going to look at my throat, or just ask questions all day?
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie, no need to worry. I just want to rule things out. Feeling tired is good to know, thank you. Let's take a quick look at your throat. If you could open wide and say "ah," that would be great.
PATIENT: Aaaah. There. Quickly, please. I have… things. It’s probably just allergies. Or something. I really don’t enjoy having people stick things near my mouth.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Your throat is quite red, and I see a few spots on your tonsils. No swelling of the uvula. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: Fever? I haven't taken my temperature. Why would I? And no, I don't have chills. It’s August! And aches? I'm a bit stiff, maybe. But that's just… getting older. Honestly, this is all very unnecessary. I’m sure it’s nothing. Just a bit of a cold. Can we be done now?
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie. No fever, chills, or significant body aches. Just a bit of stiffness. Have you noticed any rash, difficulty breathing, or difficulty swallowing solids specifically?
PATIENT: Rash? No. I haven’t looked. Difficulty… breathing? No, I can breathe perfectly fine. And swallowing… well, it hurts, as I’ve repeatedly said. Solids are… fine. They just hurt going down. It’s not a struggle. I eat. Can we please just get some sort of… medicine? I really don’t have time for this. My arrangements… are important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. So, sore throat for over a week, worsened by swallowing, with some redness and spots on the tonsils. No fever, chills, rash, or difficulty breathing. Considering your symptoms, it sounds like you likely have a viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat caused by a virus. However, because of the spots on your tonsils, I want to be cautious and rule out Strep throat, which is a bacterial infection. Would you be willing to do a quick Strep test?
PATIENT: A… test? You want to poke me again? No. Absolutely not. I told you it’s just a sore throat. Viral… whatever you said. I don't need to be poked and prodded. I'm not a child. Just give me something for the pain and let me leave. I have… commitments. And frankly, I find this entire process rather… demeaning. Can we please skip the test? I’m perfectly capable of deciding what’s wrong with my own body.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie, and I respect your feelings. However, Strep throat can lead to complications if left untreated, such as rheumatic fever. The test is quick and relatively painless – just a swab of the back of your throat. It would give us peace of mind. If you absolutely refuse the test, I will document that in your chart. But I strongly recommend it. If we don't test, we'll treat this as a viral infection, but you'll need to be aware of warning signs like high fever, difficulty breathing, or a rash developing, and seek immediate medical attention if those occur. Is there anything that would make you more comfortable doing the test?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But make it quick. And don’t stick anything too far down. Honestly. This is ridiculous. Just… get it over with. But I'm telling you now, it's nothing. Absolutely nothing. And if it turns out to be… this "Strep," I’m holding you personally responsible for wasting my time. I have very important things to do, you understand? Very important. So hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, that's all done. Now we just wait a few minutes for the results. In the meantime, for the pain, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, following the instructions on the bottle. And plenty of fluids. Warm salt water gargles can also be very soothing. Do you have any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I take whatever I need. And I already told you, I'm perfectly capable of caring for myself. I don’t need to be lectured on salt water. Just… hurry up with the results. I have arrangements. Very important arrangements. And frankly, this entire visit has been a complete waste of my time. I expect a full refund for this… ordeal.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie. The Strep test is positive. That means you have Strep throat, which is a bacterial infection. It requires treatment with antibiotics to prevent complications. I'm going to prescribe you a course of penicillin. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. You'll likely feel better within a day or two of starting the antibiotics, but it's crucial to take it as prescribed. Are you able to fill prescriptions easily?
PATIENT: Penicillin? You mean I wasn’t wasting my time? And now you want to give me… medicine? Honestly. This is preposterous. I haven’t taken antibiotics in… well, a very long time. And I don’t see why I need to finish a whole course of anything. If I feel better, I’ll stop taking it. My body knows what it needs. And no, filling prescriptions isn't exactly… simple. I don't have insurance. But that's your problem, isn’t it? Just… write it down. And don't expect me to thank you for this ordeal. I still believe this whole thing is unnecessary. And I’m still expecting a refund. A full refund. This has been a complete and utter waste of my valuable time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Tammie. It's important to me that you feel heard, and I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. However, Strep throat can lead to serious complications like rheumatic fever if left untreated, even if you start feeling better. Finishing the entire course of antibiotics is crucial to ensure the infection is completely eradicated and to prevent those complications. I can provide you with information on low-cost pharmacies in the area, and there are programs available to help with medication costs for uninsured individuals. I’m happy to help you explore those options. Regarding a refund, I'm afraid I'm not authorized to issue refunds for medical consultations. However, I'm happy to provide you with a detailed invoice to submit to your insurance provider, if you have one. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. I’ll… look at it. But don’t expect me to be grateful. This is a complete and utter outrage. I’m sure it’s just a waste of money. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being lectured about rheumatic fever. I know my own body. No. I have no further questions. I’m leaving now. And I expect a full explanation of the charges. And a detailed apology for wasting my time. This has been… deeply unprofessional. And don’t expect me to be back.
DOCTOR: Very well, Tammie. I understand. I’ll have the front desk provide you with a detailed invoice. Please, if you experience any worsening symptoms – high fever, difficulty breathing, or a rash – seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day.
