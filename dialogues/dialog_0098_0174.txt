DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s nice to meet you as well. Honestly? I’m not usually one for…this. Talking about feelings, I mean. But my daughter, she insisted. She says I haven’t been myself lately. I suppose…I’ve just been feeling quite down. Not ill, exactly. Just…low.
DOCTOR: I understand. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things, so thank you for doing so. “Feeling down” can mean a lot of different things. Could you tell me a little more about what that feels like for you, Nani?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, everything feels…grey, you know? Not bad, precisely. Just…lacking colour. I don’t enjoy my usual things anymore. Ski patrol used to be such a joy – the mountains, the fresh air, helping people. Now…it’s just work. And I’m…tired. Very, very tired. Even after a full night's sleep. It's difficult to explain. I haven’t been sleeping well, either, just…a lot of it. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Nani. A loss of interest in things you usually enjoy, and feeling fatigued even with adequate sleep…those are important things to note. And you mentioned feeling “grey” – that’s a good way to put it. Now, has this feeling come on suddenly, or has it been a gradual change over time?
PATIENT: Oh, gradual, definitely gradual. It didn't just happen one day. It’s been…well, I suppose since last winter, really. It started slowly. Just not looking forward to things. Then…less energy. Then…just…less of everything. It’s hard to pinpoint a moment. I thought it was just the change of seasons, at first. But it hasn't lifted. It’s just…persisted. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Nani. A gradual onset is important information. And it’s good you’ve been aware of it for several months. Now, thinking back to last winter, was there anything particularly stressful or upsetting happening in your life around that time?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Last winter… my divorce was finalized, actually. It wasn't… a bad divorce, not a messy one. We simply…grew apart. But it was still… final. And my son, he moved to Canada with his family. Further away than ever before. So, yes… there were changes. Big changes. I suppose I hadn’t really…processed them properly, at the time. I just kept busy with work. Is that what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, Nani, that’s very important. Major life changes like a divorce and your son moving away are significant stressors. It's completely understandable that you might be feeling the effects of those changes now. Now, could you tell me a bit about your current living situation?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I live alone now, naturally. In the suburbs, just a small house. It’s… comfortable enough. I have neighbours, friendly enough, but… it's quiet. Too quiet, sometimes. I keep myself busy. Work, gardening, a little bit of volunteering at the church. But mostly… I just fill my days. It's not lonely, exactly. Just… empty, sometimes. Is this helpful? I’m not very good at… explaining these things.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly, Nani. You're explaining everything very clearly. Knowing about your living situation and how you spend your time is helpful. Now, thinking about your physical health… have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite… it's not what it used to be. I used to enjoy cooking, a good, hearty meal. Now… I just don’t feel very hungry. I eat, of course, I have to. But it’s…forced, sometimes. And I think I've lost some weight. Not much, but my clothes feel a little looser. My daughter pointed it out, actually. She worries. She’s a good girl, that one.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Nani. A decrease in appetite and unintentional weight loss are important things to consider. Now, have you been experiencing any difficulty with sleep, besides just feeling tired?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I sleep a lot, as I said, but it’s not… restful sleep. I wake up several times during the night. Sometimes I can get back to sleep, sometimes I just…lie there. Thinking. Worrying. I don’t have nightmares, exactly. Just… thoughts. Spinning around and around. It’s… frustrating. I used to be such a sound sleeper. Is that…helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Nani. Fragmented sleep and difficulty staying asleep are common symptoms. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… No diabetes, no heart problems. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago, but it's been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. And arthritis, in my knees, from all the skiing. It flares up sometimes, but it's manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers. Nothing else, not that I can recall. I see my general practitioner regularly for check-ups. Is there something specific you are looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nani. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take a small dose of lisinopril for the blood pressure, as I said. And ibuprofen when my knees are bothering me. Sometimes, just a multivitamin. That's it, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I prefer a more natural approach, when possible. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Nani. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or other substances?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat most things, no dietary restrictions. My daughter is always worried about that, too, but I assure her, I'm perfectly fine. Is that… all the questions for now? This has been…a lot.
DOCTOR: Thank you for answering all those questions so thoughtfully, Nani. That gives me a good understanding of your situation. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. It’s just a quick check of your blood pressure, heart rate, and a listen to your lungs. It will also be helpful to briefly assess your mood and cognitive function. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, yes, that’s perfectly alright. I suppose I should expect that, shouldn’t I? A physical exam. I’m not… fond of doctors, never have been, but I understand it’s necessary. Just… please be gentle with my knees, if you can. They aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart and lungs sound good. And your cognitive function seems perfectly intact, Nani. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions, just to get a better sense of how you’re feeling emotionally. Have you been feeling hopeless or helpless lately?
PATIENT: Hopeless… well, sometimes. Not constantly, but… yes, there are days when I just feel… overwhelmed. Like nothing I do matters. Like I’m just going through the motions. It’s not… a strong feeling, usually. Just… a quiet sense of… resignation, perhaps. It's hard to explain. It's not like I'm actively sad, if that makes any sense. Just… empty.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Nani. It sounds like you're experiencing some symptoms of depression, specifically anhedonia – the loss of interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy – and feelings of hopelessness. Now, have you been having any difficulty concentrating or making decisions lately?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Absolutely. My mind just… wanders. I used to be so organized, so efficient. Now, I forget things constantly. Simple things. I’ll go into a room and forget why I went there. And making decisions… even small ones… it feels like such an effort. I just… put things off, hoping they'll resolve themselves. It's… frustrating, to be honest. I used to be so sharp.
DOCTOR: That’s very common with depression, Nani. Difficulty concentrating and making decisions are key symptoms. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of this brief exam, I believe you may be experiencing a depressive episode. It’s important to remember that this isn't a sign of weakness, and it's treatable. Now, I want to be clear, I'm not making a definitive diagnosis at this point, but I do believe it's important to explore this further. Would you be open to discussing some treatment options?
PATIENT: Treatment options… yes, I suppose I should. My daughter would certainly be relieved to hear me say that. I’ve never… been one for medication, if I’m honest. I prefer natural remedies, when possible. But… if it’s necessary… I suppose I’m willing to consider it. What options are we talking about, exactly?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Nani. We can certainly explore all options. There are a few different approaches. We could start with lifestyle modifications – things like regular exercise, a healthy diet, and improving your sleep hygiene. We could also consider talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy. And, yes, there are medications available, antidepressants, which can help regulate brain chemistry. We don’t have to start with medication, if you’re not comfortable with that. I would recommend, at least initially, starting with talk therapy and see how that goes. Would you be open to a referral to a therapist?
PATIENT: Talk therapy… yes, that sounds…less invasive, I suppose. I’ve never done anything like that before, but… I’m willing to try. As long as it doesn’t involve… a lot of digging up the past, if you know what I mean. I’m not one for dwelling on things. A referral to a therapist… yes, that would be good. If you think that’s the best course of action. As long as they understand I’m… a practical woman. I prefer solutions, not…analysis.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nani. I can definitely recommend a therapist who specializes in solution-focused therapy. They will work with you to identify your goals and develop strategies to achieve them, without dwelling excessively on the past. I’ll give you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, she is excellent and well-regarded in the area. She's experienced in working with patients experiencing similar feelings to yours. In the meantime, I recommend trying to maintain a regular routine, even if you don’t feel like it. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you're feeling overwhelmed or if your symptoms worsen. We're here to support you. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very… thorough, Doctor. And surprisingly… kind. I was expecting a much more… clinical approach. Dr. Vance, you said? I'll look into it. Thank you. I suppose…that's all for now. I’m rather tired, actually. It's been a long morning.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nani. It was my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to check in on your progress. In the meantime, take care of yourself, and remember that you’re not alone. Here is the referral information for Dr. Vance and a summary of our visit for your records. Have a good day, Nani. And please, don't hesitate to reach out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
