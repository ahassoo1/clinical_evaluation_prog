DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I decided it was time to get checked for… for HIV. I just wanted to know my status, really. It’s something I’ve been putting off, and I thought it best to finally do it.
DOCTOR: I see. And what prompted you to finally decide to get tested now, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just… life, I suppose. Getting older, thinking about my health more. And my husband and I… we’ve been talking. It just felt like the responsible thing to do. No particular incident, just… prudence, you know? I want peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Prudence is a very good reason, Ms. Shaub. It's commendable that you're taking this step. Now, have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don’t think so. Not that I recall, anyway. It was a long time ago, before it was… so common to talk about. I don't remember any specific testing during doctor visits, if that makes sense. It wasn’t something they routinely offered, I don’t believe. Would my records show it, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Let me check your records… No, I don’t see any documentation of prior HIV testing. So, this will be your first time. Have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That’s right, I’d forgotten. Years ago, after my daughter was born, I needed a transfusion. It was a difficult birth, and I lost quite a bit of blood. That was… oh, goodness… almost forty years ago now, at a hospital in Lagos. I believe they tested for things then, but I don’t recall the specifics. Would that have included HIV?
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely they had the comprehensive testing protocols we have now in 1985, Ms. Shaub. The understanding of HIV was still evolving then. Alright. And have you ever shared any needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! Absolutely not. I’ve never… I don’t even know anyone who would do such a thing. I’ve always been very careful about things like that. This is all rather… personal, isn't it? But I understand you have to ask. It’s just… a bit unsettling to think about all this.
DOCTOR: Of course. These questions are standard procedure, Ms. Shaub. Now, let's talk about sexual history. This is important for assessing risk, and your responses will be kept strictly confidential. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Well… yes. My husband and I, of course. We’ve been married for… oh, goodness, forty-two years now. But… before him, a very long time ago, when I was a young woman, I… I had a few relationships. It was before I met my husband, a different life, really. But it was… a long time ago. Do you need details? I… I’m not particularly comfortable discussing it.
DOCTOR: A general overview is sufficient, Ms. Shaub. Knowing there were other partners before your marriage is what’s important. Were these partners male or female?
PATIENT: All male, Doctor. Only male. It was… a different time, and things were… less open. I assure you, it was a long time ago and… well, my husband is the only partner I’ve had since. He's a good man. This is all feeling rather… invasive, I must say. But I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: It is necessary to gather a complete history, Ms. Shaub. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a difficult question. I think not. There was a… a scare, once, years ago, when I was quite young, before my husband. A minor infection, nothing serious, the doctor said. It was treated quickly. But I don’t recall the specifics. It wasn't… a major illness. Would that show up in records, do you think? I'm rather hazy about the details. It was so long ago.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be documented this far back, Ms. Shaub, particularly if it was a minor infection. Now, before we proceed with the HIV test, are you aware of the different types of tests available?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no, I am not. I just assumed… you’d take some blood, and that would be that. What types of tests are there, Doctor? Are some better than others? It’s all rather confusing, you know. I'm not very good with medical things.
DOCTOR: There are antibody tests, which detect the presence of antibodies your body creates to fight the virus. Those take a little longer to show a positive result, usually a few weeks after exposure. Then there's the antigen/antibody combination test, which can detect the virus earlier. And finally, there's a nucleic acid test, which detects the actual virus, but it's usually reserved for high-risk situations or confirming positive results. For initial screening, the antibody test is generally sufficient. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s… a lot of information. Antigen, antibody… it’s all rather technical. I… I suppose the antibody test sounds alright. If that’s what you recommend. As long as it’s reliable. And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m rather anxious about this, you know. I just want to know, one way or the other.
DOCTOR: It is reliable, Ms. Shaub. It typically takes about a week to ten days for the results to come back from the lab. Now, let’s proceed with the blood draw. Nurse Anya will be in shortly to take a sample. While we wait, I’m going to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that is acceptable, Doctor. A physical exam sounds… sensible. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Thank you for explaining everything, even though it was rather… complicated. I do appreciate it. I’m just hoping everything is alright. I’ll try to relax while we wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Normal heart sounds, regular rhythm. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. We'll monitor that. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses. Do you experience any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no abdominal pain. Occasionally a little… indigestion, perhaps, but nothing serious. Just the usual things for someone my age, I suppose. Everything feels… quite normal, really. It's just this… waiting, you know? This anticipation is the most unsettling part. I'm a bit of a worrier, I confess.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Ms. Shaub. While we wait, I’ll review your overall medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. No diabetes, thankfully. My mother had it, so I’m always careful about my diet. As for high blood pressure… well, you just said mine was slightly elevated, didn’t you? I haven’t been formally diagnosed, but it does tend to run a little high when I’m anxious. The doctor at home mentioned it once, but said it wasn't anything to worry about urgently. Just to watch it. I try to stay active, walk every day… it's probably just stress.
DOCTOR: I see no record of a prior hypertension diagnosis, Ms. Shaub. It's important to get that controlled, regardless. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small dose of vitamin D in the winter months. The doctor recommended it, as I don’t get much sunlight. And occasionally a pain reliever for arthritis in my knees, but that's just when they flare up. Otherwise, nothing. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in natural remedies, you know? I try to stay healthy through diet and exercise.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take most medications… no reactions at all. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Though, I do get a bit of a rash if I use heavily scented soaps, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Just a sensitivity.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not an allergy, Ms. Shaub. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor! Absolutely not! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life, and I only take a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And as for recreational drugs… well, that’s simply unthinkable! I was raised with very strict morals, you see. I lead a very respectable life.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, finally, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or mental illness?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a difficult question. My mother had… well, she had some heart trouble later in life. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he passed away from cancer. Lung cancer, I believe. And my sister… she struggled with anxiety for many years, but it wasn't a severe case. Nothing else that I can recall, really. My family was quite healthy, overall. We were farmers, you see. Hard work keeps you fit.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub. That completes the history. Nurse Anya should be in shortly to draw your blood for the HIV test. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. You've covered everything very thoroughly, I must say. Although… will the test be painful? I’m not very good with needles, you know. Just… a little reassurance would be lovely. And… thank you for your patience. It’s been a bit of an ordeal, but I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: It will be a brief pinch, Ms. Shaub. No more than a routine blood draw. Anya is very skilled. And I assure you, it is a necessary procedure. While you wait, I'll step out and review the results of your blood pressure reading. Nurse Anya will be with you momentarily.
PATIENT: .
