DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Venna. Well, it’s my blood pressure. Been runnin’ a little high, the last check-up the nurse gave me. That’s what she said, anyway. I mostly just wanted to make sure it weren’t nothin’ too serious. I’m an old woman, things break easy, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna. It’s good you came in to get it checked. High blood pressure is something we definitely want to keep an eye on, especially as we get older. The nurse did mention it during her initial assessment. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this might be a problem, or if you’ve had any symptoms associated with it?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Not really. I don’t feel any different. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m ninety years old, Doctor! I figure that comes with the territory. I think it was… oh, maybe a month or so ago the nurse at the Senior Center started keepin’ track of it regular. She said it was a little high then, and then again at the last check-up. I don't rightly remember what the numbers were, if that matters. I'm terrible with numbers these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venna. Numbers can be tricky. It’s good you’re not experiencing any specific symptoms, but high blood pressure often doesn’t cause any noticeable feelings, especially in the early stages. That’s why regular checks are so important. Do you happen to know if you've ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or been on any medication for it in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been told I had it before this, and I ain't never taken any pills for it. I try to stay away from medicine if I can. My mama always said a good cup of chamomile tea fixes most things. Though I reckon chamomile tea ain't gonna fix high blood pressure, is it?
DOCTOR: Your mama sounds like a wise woman, Venna. Chamomile tea is wonderful for many things, but you’re right, high blood pressure usually requires a bit more than tea. Let's go over a little of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder taken out when I was… oh, maybe fifty? That was a long time ago. And I broke my hip a few years back, fell in the garden. That was a mess. Other than that… I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Just the usual aches and pains that come with livin’ a long life. Never had nothin’ serious that kept me down for long. Mostly just stubbornness keeps me going, I reckon.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Venna. Gallbladder removal and a hip fracture… those are significant events, but it sounds like you recovered well from both. And stubbornness is a powerful medicine! Do you have any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… that’s a tough one. My mama’s side, they all lived long lives, but I don’t rightly remember anyone bein’ sick with… heart trouble, or strokes, or nothin’. My daddy’s side… well, he didn’t have much family. He was an orphan, as I recall. So, not that I know of. Folks didn't talk about sickness much when I was growin’ up. Just dealt with it and kept on goin’. Sorry I can’t be much help there, Doctor. My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venna. It’s common for family medical history to be a little hazy, especially as time goes on. We’ll work with what we have. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Lord, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mama wouldn’t allow it. Said it was a nasty habit and smelled awful. I did used to chew a little tobacco when I was younger, but I gave that up years ago. It made my teeth ache. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea, as you know. Much better for a body.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Venna. Chamomile tea is an excellent choice. And good for you for avoiding smoking. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine with dinner sometimes. A small glass, maybe a couple of times a week. It helps me relax. My husband, bless his soul, always liked a little wine with his supper, so I got used to havin’ a sip with him. Haven’t had much since he passed, though. Doesn’t taste the same without him.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Venna. A small amount of wine is generally considered okay, and it sounds like you enjoy it responsibly. And it’s perfectly natural to miss sharing things with loved ones. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Are you taking any prescriptions or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a little arthritis medicine, helps with my hands. It’s… ibuprofen, I think. The white pills. And sometimes I take a little something for my sleep, when I can’t get to dozin’. But that’s just now and then. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement, the nurse told me to. Said old folks don't get enough sun. That's about it, really. Nothin’ fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen for arthritis, a sleep aid occasionally, and vitamin D. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s fine with me. Go right ahead. I always liked a good check-up. Makes me feel… reassured, I suppose. Though I warn you, my heart’s been beatin’ for a long time. Might be a little worn out by now!
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Venna. Ninety years is a long time for a heart to work! Your heart sounds regular, though a little quiet, as you might expect. I hear some normal lung sounds. Your pulse is a little slow, but strong and regular. Now, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is reading 152/88. That is a bit elevated, which confirms what the nurse noted. It's not critically high, but it's something we need to address. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Lord, no. Never had an allergy in my life. Not to poison ivy, not to bee stings, not to nothin’. I reckon I’m just a tough old bird. But I do get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast. Is that what you mean by allergies? It don't last long, though. Just a little swoosh in the head.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not an allergy, Venna. That sounds like orthostatic hypotension – a little drop in blood pressure when you change positions quickly. It’s common, especially as we get older. So, to recap, your blood pressure is elevated, you have some occasional dizziness when standing, and you take ibuprofen, a sleep aid occasionally, and vitamin D. You have no known allergies. Given your age and these findings, I think the best course of action is to start with some lifestyle modifications and see if that helps lower your blood pressure. Things like reducing salt intake, getting regular exercise – even a short walk each day can make a difference – and managing stress. We can also talk about ways to prevent falls to minimize the dizziness. I also want to order some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying causes for the elevated blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I ain’t one for fancy medicines if I can help it. Walkin’ and less salt… I can do that. My daughter always tells me I eat too much salt, anyway. And blood work… well, I suppose that’s gotta be done. If you think it’s best. Just… try not to poke me too much. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Venna. I'll be as gentle as possible. The blood work is just a routine precaution. It will give us a better picture of your overall health. I’m going to write you a prescription for a blood pressure monitor so you can check your pressure at home. It's important to track it regularly. I’ll also give you a handout with information on lifestyle changes for managing high blood pressure and preventing falls. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to review your blood work results and see how you're doing with the lifestyle changes. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds… right sensible, Doctor. A little machine to check it myself… that’ll be good. Keeps me feelin’ in control, I reckon. And a paper to read… well, I’ll try my best to remember it all. My daughter can help me if I get confused. A month… that’ll give me time to get walkin’ and less salty. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venna. I'm glad I could help. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will come in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule your next visit. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. You’ve been a good help to an old woman. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venna. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you in a month.
