DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Kristofik. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Bloating, like… my stomach just feels puffed up, okay? It’s annoying. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so if we could just get right to it… It’s been happening for… well, a while now. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. It just is.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Just is” is perfectly alright. We’ll figure it out. Bloating can be caused by many things. When you say “a while now,” would you say it's been weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Ugh, months, probably. Maybe even longer. Like I said, I don’t really… pay attention. It doesn't hurt, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. It makes my clothes fit weird, and I get winded easier when I'm working. Is that all you need to know? Because honestly, I got a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Okay, months of discomfort. And it's affecting your breathing a bit with work, that's good to know. Not pain, but definitely noticeable. Alright. Let’s see if I can narrow things down a bit. Have you noticed anything specific that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Specific? Like… what do you mean? Do I eat something? I eat what I eat. Steak, mostly. Sometimes chicken. Look, I work hard, I need to eat. It doesn’t seem to matter what it is, it just… happens. I don't sit around analyzing my meals, Doc. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kristofik. You’re a busy man. Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be tied to specific foods. Has anything changed recently – like a new job, more stress, different activity levels?
PATIENT: New job… no. Same job for… a long time. Stress? Look, life is stressful. Pile driving isn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? Activity… same as always, maybe a little more work lately, but that's just how it goes. Honestly, are we getting anywhere with this? I feel like I’m just describing… life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major changes in lifestyle. Alright. Let's move onto some general questions. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, anything like that?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you’re asking about… that? Look, I don’t really want to talk about… that stuff. It's all… normal, okay? I go to the bathroom when I need to. Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not. Is that good enough? I really need to get back to work. My guys are probably wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s uncomfortable to talk about, Mr. Kristofik. It’s a necessary part of figuring things out. “Normal” is good to know. Okay. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, even unintentional?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I’m probably a little heavier. Steak, remember? And… well, I eat a lot of it. I haven’t weighed myself recently, but I definitely haven't lost any weight. Look, I'm a working man, I need fuel. Can we just… skip this part? It’s all very obvious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no weight loss. Okay. Just a couple more quick questions, then we can do a quick exam if you’re comfortable. Any nausea, vomiting, or heartburn?
PATIENT: No vomiting, no. Sometimes a little heartburn, yeah, after a big meal. But that's just… steak. I’ll take some stuff for it if it’s really bad. Look, I think I’ve answered all your questions. Can we just get this over with? I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional heartburn. Alright. Let's just do a quick physical exam. I want to listen to your belly and feel it to see if anything feels unusual. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. And don’t take too long. My guys are waiting. Honestly, I don't understand why you need to listen to my stomach. It's bloated, you already know that. But whatever. Just hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the exam table for me, that would be great. I’ll just listen with my stethoscope, and then gently feel your abdomen. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Okay. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. I'm feeling a little tenderness when I press here and here, but nothing too concerning. No sign of anything immediately serious. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, that’s a little… uncomfortable. Not pain, exactly. Just… feels weird. Like pressure, maybe. Look, I told you I’m bloated. You’re just poking around at it now. Honestly, this is making me more uncomfortable than before. Can we be done soon? I really need to get back to work. My foreman is going to kill me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your bloating is causing some general abdominal discomfort, and pressure. Given your history of months of bloating without significant pain, weight loss, or changes in bowel habits, and the mild tenderness I'm feeling, it could be related to several things. It could be something simple like trapped gas, or it could be related to your diet. I want to order a few blood tests just to rule out anything more serious, like inflammation or other underlying issues. Also, a stool test to rule out any infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Seriously? Look, I don't need tests. I need to get back to work! I eat steak, I lift heavy things, and my stomach feels puffed up. That’s it! This is ridiculous. Are you sure you’re a doctor? Honestly, I think I’m better off just dealing with it. No tests. Absolutely not. I’m leaving. Just… forget it. I wasted my time here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration. However, as your physician, I have a responsibility to rule out potential medical concerns. While your symptoms don’t immediately suggest a serious issue, I strongly recommend these tests to ensure nothing is being overlooked. I can write you a referral to a gastroenterologist if you'd prefer a specialist opinion. They may be able to provide more specific guidance. But I won't force you to have tests if you're unwilling. I strongly advise you to reconsider, though. If you experience any worsening symptoms – severe pain, fever, changes in bowel habits, or blood in your stool – please seek immediate medical attention. .
