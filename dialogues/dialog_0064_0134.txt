DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s my stomach, I reckon. Been feelin’ poorly for a bit now. Not sick sick, but…off. I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I get full, and then I feel queasy. It's just…uncomfortable, mostly. I forget how long it's been, exactly. A few weeks, maybe? It’s hard to keep track these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of discomfort and feeling full quickly… and queasiness. That gives us a starting point. Can you tell me a little more about that queasiness?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't like throwin’ up, thankfully. Just…a sickly feelin’ in my gut. Like somethin’s not right. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s worse after I try to eat, but not always. And it don’t seem to matter what I eat. Soup, toast…doesn’t make a difference. I used to have a good appetite, you know? I could always finish a plate. Now… barely a few bites. I'm losin’ weight, I suspect. My clothes feel a little looser.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s a general feeling of queasiness, not necessarily linked to specific foods, and it's affecting your appetite. And you've noticed some weight loss. Has anything changed in your life recently that might be causing you stress or worry?
PATIENT: Stress…well, now that’s a question. It's been a quiet time, mostly. Lost my husband, Earl, a couple of years back. Still miss him somethin’ fierce, of course. But I have my animals…trainin’ ‘em keeps me busy. A few folks around here ask me to help with their dogs, too. I don't think anything new's caused me worry… nothin’ I can put my finger on. Everything feels…normal, except for this stomach trouble. Oh! Except…Agnes, my niece, she's been askin' me to move in with her family. Said she wants to help me out, but…I like my own space. Is that stress, you think? It’s just a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: That could be a source of stress, Ms. Kelder – a big life change like that. Even if it’s offered with good intentions. Let’s talk a little about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a question. I get all my dates mixed up, Doctor. I remember…arthritis, a bit. In my hands mostly. And…I had a surgery years ago, somethin’ with my gallbladder, I think. But that was a long time back. And…well, I was told a few months ago, by another doctor… that I had…cancer. Somewhere inside. I don't rightly remember all the details. They started me on somethin’…pills, I believe. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. It was a rush of appointments and talk, and…well, I don’t have the best memory. I think it’s the stomach, though, that’s been botherin’ me. Could that be somethin’ to do with the cancer?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, gallbladder surgery in the past, and…a cancer diagnosis and treatment a few months ago. And you're wondering if this stomach trouble might be related. It's very possible there's a connection. To clarify, do you remember which type of cancer was diagnosed, or where in the body it was located?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. See, that’s just it. They said so much, all at once. I think… they said it was somethin’ to do with my stomach. Or maybe…somewhere close to it. They talked about scans and…biopsies, I think. It was all very fast, and Earl always handled all the doctor stuff, you see? Now I'm tryin' to manage on my own. I think it was…stomach cancer, maybe? But I'm really just guessin' at this point. I remember bein’ scared, of course. And tired. And the pills made me feel kinda sick at times, but…I don't recall much beyond that. I just want this feelin' in my gut to go away. It’s wearin’ me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. It sounds like you were diagnosed with some type of cancer near your stomach, underwent some treatment, and now you’re experiencing new stomach discomfort. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and having trouble remembering details, especially with everything that's happened. I'm pulling up your records now. It seems you were diagnosed with early-stage stomach cancer about six months ago and completed a course of chemotherapy. It’s possible this new discomfort is a side effect of the treatment, or… it could be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A physical exam. Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. It’s just… hard keepin’ track of everything. And I worry somethin’ terrible. I just want to feel normal again. If you think an exam will help, then please do. I trust your judgement. I reckon I’m ready when you are. Just…be gentle, if you wouldn't mind. My old bones ain't as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kelder. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then I'll gently palpate, or feel, your stomach to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Sounds are normal in all quadrants. Now, I’m going to gently press on your stomach. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. I notice some slight tenderness in your upper abdomen, particularly on the right side, but no significant masses or guarding. It's not severe, but it’s worth noting. Your abdomen is otherwise soft and non-distended. I’m also going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Your pulse is 78 and your blood pressure is 130/80, both within a normal range.
PATIENT: Well, that didn’t sound too bad, Doctor. I did feel a little bit of a twinge there on the right side, but it wasn't awful. Just…a little uncomfortable. I get those twinges sometimes, to be honest. I always figured it was just my old stomach actin’ up. The rest felt alright, I suppose. It’s good to know my pulse and blood pressure are normal. That’s one thing I don’t have to worry about, at least. What do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? I’m gettin’ a bit nervous now, I confess.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Kelder. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. Given your history of stomach cancer and recent chemotherapy, as well as the tenderness I felt during the exam, we need to investigate this further. It could be a number of things – a side effect of the treatment, inflammation, or, less likely, a recurrence of the cancer. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few tests. First, a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. Second, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your liver and kidney function. And finally, a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to visualize your organs and check for any abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… well, I don’t like tests, Doctor. Always worry about what they’ll find. But… if you think it’s necessary, then alright. I suppose I have no choice. Better to know, I reckon, than to just sit here worryin’. A blood count, a metabolic panel… and a CT scan. That sounds like a lot, but… if it’ll help, then do ‘em. When can we get these done? And will they make me feel sick? I get awfully tired after things like that, you see. I just hope it’s not somethin’ too bad. I’ve been through enough lately, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Kelder. It’s completely natural to feel that way. We'll take things one step at a time. The blood tests are relatively quick and painless, just a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. The CT scan is a bit more involved, but it’s also painless. You’ll lie on a table while a machine takes images of your abdomen and pelvis. It takes about 20-30 minutes. It's possible you might need a contrast dye administered intravenously to help enhance the images, but we'll discuss that further if it's necessary. The CT scan can sometimes cause fatigue, so we'll make sure you have a comfortable place to rest afterward. I’ll write you an order for the tests now. You can schedule them at the front desk. They usually have appointments available within the next few days. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible, usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with a light diet and staying hydrated. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – severe pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting – please come back to the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Here are the orders for the tests. Do you have any questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That was… a lot of information, but you explained it nicely. Light diet…stay hydrated… I can manage that. And I will come back if things get worse. I suppose I just have to wait and see. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… thank you for listenin’ to me, and for takin’ the time. It’s nice to have someone explain things so calmly. It’s a bit of a burden carryin’ all this worry by myself, you see. I reckon I’ll go schedule those tests now. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. That's what I'm here for. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions before your tests. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
