DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Or… good afternoon, perhaps?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, afternoon is good. I just… well, I need a little something from you, see. Not sick, exactly. Just… a pick-me-up.
DOCTOR: A “pick-me-up,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes. A card, Doctor. One of those… get well cards. Or, you know, one that says… keep going. Something nice. My daughter, she says I need… encouragement. She worries too much. But a card from you… that would show her. That would mean something. It's just… things haven't been easy, see?
DOCTOR: I… see. You're requesting a card from me… for encouragement?
PATIENT: Exactly, Doctor. A little note. Not a prescription. Not a test. Just… a kind word on paper from the doctor. Is that… unusual? I mean, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important to my daughter. She’s a good girl, very responsible. Always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: It’s… not a typical request, no. But I understand wanting to reassure your daughter. Let me see if I can… accommodate that. Just to be clear, there aren't any medical concerns bringing you in today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no concerns. Just… feeling a little low, you understand? Old age, maybe. Divorced, you know? It does things to a man. But I'm fine. Really. A card is all I need. It would just… prove to her I’m okay. That I’m still something.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, before we proceed, just to document things properly… could you tell me a little more about feeling “low”?
PATIENT: Document? Oh, now hold on. I just want the card, Doctor. What does feeling low have to do with a card? I'm not here for a whole examination. I explained. Divorced. Things happen. I just want to show my daughter I’m doing okay. Is that so hard to understand? I just want a card. A simple card.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you're frustrated. And I want to help. But as a physician, even when someone requests something seemingly simple like a card, I need to ensure there isn’t an underlying medical issue contributing to how you’re feeling. Feeling "low" can sometimes be a sign of something more serious, like depression, and it’s important to rule those things out. It’s part of my responsibility to you. Would you mind just answering a few quick questions?
PATIENT: Depression? Doctor, I'm a grown man! I built boilers! I operated heavy machinery! I’ve seen things! A divorce is hard, yes, but it doesn’t mean I’m… broken. Look, I appreciate you wanting to help, truly. But a card is all I need. I don’t need questions. I just want a card. Are you going to give me one or not? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I… I am not trying to upset you. But providing a card without understanding why you’re feeling this way could be… inappropriate. And could potentially miss something important. As a physician, I have to consider all possibilities. I’m concerned about your well-being. Perhaps we could start with a very simple question?
PATIENT: Concerned? You’re concerned about a divorced man wanting a card for his daughter? Doctor, with all due respect, I think you're overthinking this. My daughter worries. I want to reassure her. A card from a doctor… that would do it. And you’re making it harder than it needs to be. You’re a doctor, not a… a mind reader. Just write “Get Well Soon” or “Keep Your Chin Up” and be done with it. Is that really too much to ask? I’m wasting my afternoon here. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I… I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I'm making this difficult. But I’m ethically obligated to assess your well-being before providing any kind of… documentation. I can't simply write a card without understanding why you're requesting it. I’m afraid I can’t fulfill your request at this time. However, I can offer to discuss some resources for emotional support, or perhaps schedule a follow-up appointment to explore how you're feeling. Would either of those options be acceptable?
