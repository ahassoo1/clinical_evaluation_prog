DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. I’m just… tired. Really tired. And I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot, but… yeah. Dirt. Don’t look at me like that. It's stupid, I know. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. No judgment here. It’s good you came in to discuss this with me. “Tired” is pretty broad – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More… how can I explain? It's not just sleepy. It's like… everything takes so much effort. Even getting out of bed. And I just… don't want to do things. I used to like gardening, but now… forget it. It feels like a waste of energy. Has been going on for… a while, I guess. Months? I don't really keep track anymore. What do you want to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds really difficult, and it’s good you’re recognizing it’s been going on for months. That helps us figure things out. So, feeling a lack of energy and motivation for several months... Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I remember to. Weight… probably lost some. My clothes feel looser, but I haven’t… stepped on a scale in ages. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to that stuff. It's not like it's going to solve anything. Look, is this dirt-eating thing a vitamin thing? Because I take a multi-vitamin sometimes… when I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, so changes in appetite, some weight loss, and intermittent multi-vitamin use. We can definitely explore whether a vitamin deficiency might be playing a role. The dirt eating is… unusual, and we’ll need to talk more about that. It could be related to something called pica, which is craving non-food items, often due to a nutritional deficiency, but there can be other causes too. Before we dive into that, let’s get a better picture of your overall health. Do you have any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Ugh. What kind of symptoms? My back hurts sometimes, but everyone’s back hurts. And I get headaches. Not terrible ones, just… annoying. I feel a little dizzy now and then, but that could be from not eating enough, I guess. Honestly, it's hard to say what’s normal anymore. I just feel… off. Everything feels… muted. Like the color’s drained out of things. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Okay, so back pain, headaches, dizziness, and a general feeling of being “muted.” That's helpful to know. It doesn’t sound like any of those are immediately alarming, but we need to rule things out. Let's go through some basic questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills… not really. I get cold sometimes, but that’s just because I'm always freezing. Night sweats… maybe? I don’t pay attention to my sheets, honestly. I just… sleep. Or try to. I’m not good at remembering things like that. Can we just skip this part? It’s a waste of time. I know I'm tired, that's what I came here for.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy, and I appreciate you coming in. It is good that you’re here. While it might feel like a waste of time, these questions help me to build a complete picture and make sure we aren’t missing anything important. Alright. Let's move on then. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Now you want to talk about… that? Look, everyone has bowel habits. Sometimes it’s okay, sometimes it’s not. What difference does it make? It’s not like I’m bleeding or anything. Just… normal stuff. Can we please get to the dirt thing? Is it iron? I read something online about that. Is that what it is? I swear, if I have to spend all day answering questions about my… everything, I'm walking out.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy, you’re right. Let’s focus on the dirt eating. We can definitely explore that. You mentioned reading about iron deficiency… that's a good thought. It's a common cause of cravings for unusual things like dirt. But we still need to rule out other possible causes. Have you been having any unusual cravings besides the dirt?
PATIENT: No. Just the dirt. Well, sometimes I feel like chewing on ice, but that's just because it’s hot. And I like pickles, but everyone likes pickles! No other weird stuff. Honestly, it's the dirt that's the problem. It's embarrassing, okay? I don’t want to be judged. Can we just run a blood test and be done with this? I’ve got a garden to… try to fix. Is that even possible at this point? I probably don't have the energy.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s embarrassing, Hedy, and you’re not being judged. It takes courage to come in and discuss something like this. And yes, a blood test is a good next step. We’ll check your iron levels, as well as some other things to get a clearer picture. Before we order that, let's quickly cover your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No! Nothing. I’ve been pretty healthy, mostly. My husband… well, he had some problems, but that was years ago. I don’t… I don't like talking about that. I don't have anything. Just tired, and eating dirt. Honestly, I think I'm starting to get a headache just from all these questions. Can we please just get this over with? The sooner I know what's wrong, the sooner I can… do something about it. Even if it's just accepting that my garden is ruined.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. No chronic medical conditions. I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I’m pressing too much. We will get to the bottom of this. Just a few more quick questions about your past. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Ugh. Yes. A hysterectomy. A long time ago. And my appendix out when I was a kid. That’s it. Nothing else. I don’t want to remember any more details, honestly. It was… unpleasant. Can we just skip the rest of this? I feel like I'm reliving my whole life. I just want a simple answer. Is it iron? Please tell me it’s iron. Then I can take a pill and… go home. My garden is dying.
DOCTOR: Okay, hysterectomy and appendectomy. We’ve got that documented. I completely understand your desire for a simple answer, and we will get you closer to one. Let’s pause the questions for now. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your iron levels, vitamin D, complete blood count and a few other things. While we're waiting for those results, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a general sense of how you’re doing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… hurry. The sooner this is over, the better. And please don't poke around too much. I don't like being touched. My back’s been hurting, but I don’t want to make it worse. Just… get it over with. I've got a garden to… mourn. If it's not too late. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Hedy. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look at your throat and ears, and quickly examine your abdomen. If anything causes you discomfort, please let me know immediately. We will also check your reflexes. First, let's get your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
