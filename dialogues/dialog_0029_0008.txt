DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… my ear. It feels… blocked, I think? Full. It's been… a while now. Honestly, I can’t really say how long. Things aren’t so clear these days, you know? Just… full. It’s annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, "full" is a good way to describe it. And you said it's been going on for a while… can you try to give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Before… before my wife… passed. Yes, it was definitely before then. Maybe… six months? A year? It’s hard to say, Doctor. It wasn’t sudden, if that helps. Just… gradually got worse, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, gradually worsening over the past six to twelve months. And has this been in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Just the right one, I think. Yes, definitely the right. The left one seems fine. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… muffled. Like I’m underwater a little bit. Sometimes it feels… popping, too. Not a lot, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing and a feeling of fullness in the right ear, with occasional popping. Have you noticed any drainage from the ear?
PATIENT: Drainage…? No, I don't think so. No. Nothing like… leaking, or anything. Just the fullness. I’m fairly certain about that. I… I keep it fairly clean, you see. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no drainage. And have you experienced any pain with this, even mild?
PATIENT: No, no pain. That’s good, right? Just… annoying. It makes it hard to hear people sometimes, especially my grandkids when they visit. They mumble. Or maybe I just can’t hear them very well. It’s probably me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just muffled hearing and a feeling of fullness. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Now that you mention it… sometimes, yes. A very faint ringing. Not constant, though. Comes and goes. And dizziness… no, I don't think so. Not really. Maybe a little unsteady sometimes, but I put that down to… well, getting older, you know? It happens.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent ringing in the right ear and some occasional unsteadiness. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… That’s a good question. I had… something with my blood pressure, years ago. But it was controlled with pills, I think. And… arthritis in my knees, of course. Everyone gets that, don't they? Other than that… not that I recall. My wife used to handle all the paperwork. I'm afraid my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure, which was treated, and arthritis in your knees. Do you remember what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, no, I really don't. A small white pill, I think. Or maybe it was a capsule? I honestly couldn’t tell you the name. It was a long time ago, Doctor. I stopped taking it when… well, it doesn’t matter now. I haven't been to a doctor regularly since my wife passed. She kept track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s alright. We can look into getting your records if you'd like. Now, any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm. My tonsils, when I was a boy. And… a hernia, many years ago. That’s all I can remember. Nothing else. They fixed the hernia, though, I remember that part. It was quite painful at the time, but I recovered well. Is that important, Doctor? I just want to get this ear sorted, if possible. It’s a bit of a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and hernia repair. And any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I recall. My wife always said I was lucky. I suppose I was. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not much help, am I? I wish I could remember more. Everything seems so… foggy.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It's common to have trouble remembering details. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my father… he had diabetes, I believe. Both of them gone now, a long time ago. My wife’s family… mostly healthy, as far as I know. They didn’t talk much about illnesses. They were a cheerful bunch. Is this useful, Doctor? I'm trying my best. It's just… a lot of years have passed.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your father. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she couldn’t stand it. And I didn’t want to upset her. I did drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But not much. And I haven’t had a drink since… well, you know. It doesn't seem right, somehow.
DOCTOR: Alright, you don't smoke and drink very little. Let’s do a quick examination of your ear. I’m just going to take a look in your ear. It might be a little uncomfortable for a second. Just let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, please? And if it hurts, I'll tell you. I'm not very good with… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some cerumen – that’s earwax – blocking the ear canal. The eardrum appears a little… dull, and I don't see much movement. Your left ear looks normal – clear canal, good eardrum movement. It appears you have a blockage of wax in your right ear, and the eardrum isn’t moving as freely as it should. This could be the cause of your symptoms. I’m going to check your hearing briefly with a simple test, and then we’ll discuss options for removing the wax.
PATIENT: Alright. Wax… that explains it, I suppose. Anything simple is good with me. I'm ready when you are. Just… let’s get it done, Doctor. I'd like to be able to hear my grandkids again.
DOCTOR: Okay, the test shows some hearing loss in the lower frequencies in your right ear, which is consistent with the blockage. The good news is that this appears to be conductive hearing loss - meaning it's likely due to the blockage and should improve once we remove the wax. I recommend we try a simple wax removal procedure first, like irrigation. If that doesn’t work, we may need to refer you to an audiologist for more specialized cleaning. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Irrigation… that sounds… reasonable. As long as it's not too unpleasant. I’ve never had anything done to my ears before. Is it painful, Doctor? And how long will it take? I have an appointment later this afternoon, you see. I wouldn't want to be late.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't be painful. It might be a little uncomfortable, like water getting in your ear when you swim, but it’s generally well-tolerated. We’ll use body-temperature water and go slowly. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes. I’ll just need you to sit here while I prepare the equipment. We’ll start with a gentle stream and see how you tolerate it. Let me know immediately if you feel any pain or dizziness. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds… manageable. Ten to fifteen minutes is fine. Just… be careful, Doctor. And let me know if everything’s alright, too. It’s sometimes hard for me to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m going to gently warm the water and then use this syringe to irrigate your ear canal. You might hear some bubbling sounds, that's normal. I’ll have you tilt your head slightly to the side. Here we go. Just relax and let me know if you feel any discomfort. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It's… a little strange. A bit cold, maybe? And… a pressure. Not painful, exactly, but… unsettling. It feels like water is rushing around in there. Is it supposed to feel like that? Just… take it easy, Doctor. Slowly, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll warm the water a bit more. You’re right, it is a little cold. I’m adjusting it now. And yes, it’s normal to feel some pressure and rushing sounds. That means the water is getting in and hopefully dislodging the wax. I’m seeing some debris coming out now, that’s good. Let me take a look… Okay, it’s looking much better. There’s still a little wax remaining, but it’s significantly improved. Let’s try a bit more. How does that feel now?
PATIENT: It feels… better, actually. The pressure is less. And… I think I can hear a little bit more. It’s still muffled, but not as bad as before. Maybe… maybe I heard you say something? It's hard to tell. But… it feels like progress. Please, continue, Doctor. Slowly, but surely.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m seeing a good amount of wax coming out now. Alright, it's looking much clearer. The eardrum is moving freely now, which is a good sign. I think we've removed the majority of the wax. I’ll just do a final rinse. Okay, all done. Let me take a look one more time. Excellent. The canal is clear, and your eardrum looks normal. How does that feel now?
PATIENT: Oh… wow. That’s… that’s much better! I can hear you clearly now, Doctor. It's… amazing. It’s been so long. I can hear the clock ticking! And… and the birds outside. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. I feel like a new man! You’ve done a wonderful job. Is there anything else I need to do? Or is this it?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m glad I could help. For now, just keep your ears dry for a day or two. Avoid swimming or getting water in your ear. If you experience any pain, dizziness, or decreased hearing, please contact the office. I would recommend a follow-up appointment in a few weeks just to ensure everything remains clear, but it’s not urgent. Do you have any other concerns or questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. I just want to thank you again, Doctor. It’s a relief to be able to hear properly. It's such a simple thing, really, but it makes all the difference. I should have come sooner. I'll remember to schedule a follow-up. You've been very kind. Thank you. Goodbye, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a wonderful day. Goodbye. .
