DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Lindsey. Well, I got a letter from the clinic saying my cholesterol is a bit high. I don't really know what that means, to be honest. I just figured I should get it checked out. My wife, bless her soul, always took care of these things… been a bit lost since she passed, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. High cholesterol. It’s… complicated. Essentially, it’s a fatty substance in your blood. Too much can build up and cause problems with your heart and circulation. It's good you’re addressing it. Now, the letter just said "a bit high?
PATIENT: Complicated, huh? That figures. My wife used to say the same thing about everything medical. She always explained things so clearly... I mostly just nodded and agreed with whatever she said! "A bit high"... yeah, that's what the letter said. Didn't give me any numbers or anything. Just said I should come in for a visit. I don't really feel any different, if that makes sense. Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Well, feeling different isn't always the first sign, unfortunately. That’s why we check these things regularly. Let me pull up your results here… hmm. Okay, your total cholesterol is 245. Your LDL – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – is 160. And your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is 40. Those are a little elevated. Honestly, it's not catastrophically high, but it does warrant some attention, especially at your age. It’s something we want to get under control to prevent bigger problems down the road. Have you ever been on any medication for cholesterol before?
PATIENT: Numbers, numbers... always with the numbers! My wife was good with numbers, too. I just... wasn't. 245... is that bad? I really don't understand what any of that means. No, never been on any medication for cholesterol. Not ever. Doctors haven't really bothered with me much over the years, to be honest. Just the usual check-ups. I mostly just try to stay active, you know? Walk the dog, do a little gardening... is that enough?
DOCTOR: “Enough” is a tricky question. Staying active is good, absolutely. But sometimes genetics, and just the natural aging process, mean lifestyle isn't enough. Look, let’s not get bogged down in the details. Basically, those numbers mean there’s a higher risk of heart problems in the future. It doesn’t mean you’re going to have a heart attack tomorrow, but it's something we need to address. Do you have any family history of heart disease?
PATIENT: Heart disease… well, my father… he had a bit of a weak heart later in life. Didn't take care of himself, really. Smoked a lot, drank too much… passed away when I was still pretty young, though. Maybe in his 60s? And my mother… she was always pretty healthy, as far as I know. Never heard anything about heart trouble with her. She lived a long life, thankfully. Does that help? I'm not good at remembering specifics... it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s… relevant. Your father’s history certainly adds to the picture. It’s good your mother was healthy, but family history on either side is important. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. My wife always said I had a strong heart, but I suppose that's what wives are for, right? Go ahead, do what you need to do. Just tell me if anything feels... well, wrong. Though I'm not sure I'd even know what "wrong" feels like, to be honest!
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart rate is a little fast, but not alarming. I hear a slight murmur, which isn’t necessarily a cause for immediate concern, but it's something we'll monitor. Blood pressure is a bit elevated at 140/90. And your pulse is strong, but irregular. Alright. I'm also going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Overall, nothing immediately concerning, but there are enough things here that warrant further investigation. I'm going to order a lipid panel to re-check your cholesterol levels, and an EKG to get a better look at your heart’s electrical activity. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: EKG... sounds serious. My wife always hated when doctors started ordering tests. She said it always meant bad news. Allergies... hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. I had a bit of a rash once when I was a boy, but my mother said it was just poison ivy. Nothing I've ever been formally allergic to, if that makes sense. I’ve never had any trouble with antibiotics or anything like that. But now that you mention it, my wife did say I was sensitive to… codeine, maybe? I got terribly nauseous when I had to take it for a toothache once. But that was years ago! Does that count? I really can't remember details too well these days...
DOCTOR: Okay, codeine sensitivity noted. It’s good you remembered that. Even mild reactions are important. The EKG isn't necessarily a sign of bad news, Mr. Bohnett. It’s just a precaution. It helps us get a clearer picture of what’s going on with your heart. Think of it as gathering information. Given your history and these initial findings, I’m also going to recommend a lifestyle modification program. It focuses on diet and exercise, and can be very helpful in managing cholesterol. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modification... sounds sensible, I suppose. I mean, I'm not against eating healthier or walking more. Always good to try and stay active. My wife used to make the most wonderful, healthy meals… I've mostly been eating frozen dinners since she passed, to be honest. It's just easier. Is it… expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you know. And I don't have insurance, unfortunately. It's a long story... but things are a bit tight these days. I wouldn't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the good news is the lifestyle modification program at this clinic is free for patients without insurance. It’s run by a nutritionist and a physical therapist. It's a group program, so it's a good way to meet people, too. As for the EKG and the lipid panel… those will be around $150 each. I understand that’s a significant expense. I can offer a payment plan, or we can discuss alternative labs that might have lower rates, though quality can vary. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a low-dose statin. It’s a cholesterol-lowering medication. We can start with a very low dose to see how you tolerate it. It's often the most effective way to manage cholesterol, but it's entirely your decision. It's around $20 a month with a discount card I can provide. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A discount card... that's kind of you, Doctor. That's good to hear. $20 a month… I think I could manage that, if it helps. A statin, you say? That sounds… serious. My wife always worried about side effects with medications. She said you never really know how your body will react. Is it something I have to take? Could I try the lifestyle changes first, and see if that's enough? I'm just… hesitant about starting a medication, if I don't absolutely need it. It’s just a feeling, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, with respect, “trying” lifestyle changes is often not enough, especially given your age and family history. It’s a good start, absolutely, but it's rarely sufficient to significantly lower cholesterol levels. The statin isn’t about “having to” take something. It’s about proactively managing a risk factor that could lead to serious health problems—heart attack, stroke… those aren't things we want to wait and see about. However, I understand your hesitation. We can start with the lifestyle changes, and I'll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to re-check your cholesterol levels. But I strongly advise against delaying the statin. If your levels haven’t improved significantly, we’ll need to revisit that discussion. I’m going to give you a handout on heart-healthy eating and exercise. And I'll schedule you for the EKG today and a follow-up appointment in three months. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Three months… alright. If you think that’s best, Doctor. I suppose I trust your judgment. I just… don’t want to be one of those people who ends up needing a lot of medical attention. My wife always said it’s better to be proactive, but… it’s hard, you know? It’s just me now. A handout sounds good. And the EKG… alright, let’s get it done. Just… try to explain it to me in plain English, okay? All these numbers and tests… it’s a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll make sure the technician explains everything clearly during the EKG. And I'll do my best to keep things simple during our follow-up appointment. It's my job to ensure you understand your care. I'll have the nurse come in to schedule the EKG and give you the handout. She'll also give you information on the lifestyle modification program. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything… and for being patient with me. I really appreciate it. I suppose I'll just wait for the nurse then. Tell her to take it easy on the numbers, okay? .
DOCTOR: Of course. .
