DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… well, it’s this… business with needing to go to the little boy’s room. Seems like all I do is go, go, go these days. It’s a nuisance, really. Not like when I was a young man, strong as an ox, could hold it for hours. Now… well, you get the picture. I don’t rightly remember when it started, just… gradually.
DOCTOR: Gradually, you say. Alright. And is it… uncomfortable when you need to go, or just frequent?
PATIENT: Uncomfortable? Not really. It's not painful, mind you. More like… an urgent feeling, I suppose. Like a little nudge, then a bigger nudge, and then… well, you know. It’s just… disruptive. I used to be able to plan my day, get things done. Now I gotta keep track of where the nearest… facilities are, all the time. It's a bother.
DOCTOR: Disruptive. I understand. So, no pain, no burning, just urgency. And how many times would you say you’re going in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a hard question. I don’t keep records, Doctor! I'm a farmer, not a bookkeeper. But… more than I used to, that’s for sure. Used to be, maybe three, four times. Now? I don’t know… six? Eight? Maybe even more if I drink a lot of tea. My wife, bless her heart, keeps track of these things, but I don’t bother her with it. She's got enough on her plate.
DOCTOR: Six to eight times, especially with tea. Alright. Do you notice any difference at night?
PATIENT: At night? Hmm… let me think. Well, I usually wake up once, maybe twice, to… relieve myself. It’s not too bad, but it does interrupt my sleep, you know? I used to sleep like a log, never stirred. Now, I'm getting up and shuffling around. Old age, I suppose. It's the price you pay for a long life, though I’m not complaining… much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. And just to clarify, is it a complete emptying of your bladder each time, or do you feel like you're still needing to go shortly after?
PATIENT: Complete emptying…? Now you’re asking me things I haven’t thought about in… well, ever! I go, and it feels… empty, I suppose. But maybe not completely? It’s hard to say. I don't measure it, Doctor. I just… go. Is there supposed to be a certain amount? This is getting rather… detailed for an old man. I just want to be able to go about my day without… this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. No need to apologize for not knowing specifics. It's good you're addressing this. Okay, let’s move on. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, smell, anything unusual?
PATIENT: Unusual? Well, now that you mention it... it seems a little darker sometimes. Maybe? It’s hard to tell, to be honest. I don’t spend a lot of time examining it, you understand. More important things to worry about on a farm. As for smell… I suppose it smells like… urine? I haven't noticed any… strong odors, nothing like that. I drink a lot of tea, maybe that affects the color?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any difficulty starting to urinate?
PATIENT: Difficulty starting…? Now that's a strange question. No, not really. It starts… when it starts. I don't have to… push or strain or anything like that. It just… flows. Always has, as far as I can remember. Though, thinking about it, it might take a moment to get going sometimes. A small moment. Not a big deal. Is that what you're asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. So, a slight delay occasionally. Alright. And have you noticed any dribbling after you finish urinating?
PATIENT: Dribbling…? Oh, dear. Well, now… that’s a bit personal, isn’t it? Sometimes. A little bit. Not a flood, mind you. Just a few drops. I try to… shake it off, but it happens. It’s… inconvenient. Especially in the winter, gets cold. I just try not to make a mess. Is that common?
DOCTOR: It can be, Mr. Segretto. Alright. Let’s do a quick exam, just to check a few things. It’ll be quick and straightforward. We'll check your abdomen and a quick neurological exam. Then we can talk about potential causes and what we can do. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An exam…? Oh. Well, I hadn’t expected that. I just thought we’d talk about it. But… alright, I suppose. If it’ll help. As long as it’s quick, like you say. And… not too uncomfortable. I’m not as spry as I used to be. Where do you want me to…?
DOCTOR: If you’ll just lie down on the table, please. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen. Just relax. I’m going to listen in a few different spots. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Now another deep breath… and exhale. Do you have any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just breathing, you say. It's a bit… chilly in here, isn’t it? And this table isn't the most comfortable thing. No pain… not exactly. Just… awareness. You know? Old man’s body. I feel everything. A little pressure, maybe. But not a sharp pain, if that’s what you’re asking. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Not long at all, Mr. Segretto. Just getting a feel for things. And what about here?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… a bit tender, actually. Not awful, but… I feel it. I think I pulled something lifting hay a few weeks back. Maybe that's it? It hasn’t been bothering me much, just a little ache sometimes. Is that what you're checking for? Is everything alright? You look… concerned.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the hay. Alright. And have you been having any difficulty with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements…? Well, now that you mention it… they’re not as regular as they used to be. I used to go like clockwork, you know? But lately… it’s been a bit unpredictable. Not constipation, exactly. Just… not as often. And sometimes a bit… loose. Old age, I suppose. Everything's slowing down. Does that matter? Is that connected to… this?
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to finish the exam, I’m going to check your reflexes quickly. Please relax your legs. Good. And now the other leg. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia – BPH – and potentially some mild urinary retention. It’s common in men your age. The prostate enlarges, putting pressure on the bladder, which explains the frequent urination, urgency, and dribbling. The irregular bowel movements could be related, as the prostate can affect the rectum. But it’s important to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Benign… what-now? The… what was it? Prostate? That’s… something men get? I always thought that was something else entirely. Enlarging…? Pressure…? Is it serious? Is it cancer? My wife… she's been worried about my health lately. Is there something really wrong with me?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mr. Segretto. BPH is very common in men as they age - it’s not cancer, and it’s usually not life-threatening. However, it can be uncomfortable and disruptive to your life, which is why we need to address it. To get a clearer picture and rule out other potential issues, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a PSA test – that’s a blood test to check the level of prostate-specific antigen. It will help us assess your prostate health and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… blood test? And the… urine analysis? More poking and prodding, huh? Alright, alright. If you think it's necessary. I just… I don't like going to the doctor. It reminds me of… bad memories. But… if it will help figure out what’s wrong, I suppose I can do it. When do I have to come back? And will it be… expensive? My wife handles the finances, and I don't want to worry her.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto. We'll take it one step at a time. I'll write you a lab requisition for both tests. You can get them done at the clinic – just walk-in, and they’ll take care of it. The results should be back in about a week. As for cost, Medicare typically covers these tests, but we’ll verify that before you go. I'll have the receptionist confirm your coverage and give you an estimate, so there won’t be any surprises. In the meantime, try to limit your fluid intake before bed, and avoid caffeine and alcohol. And if you experience any fever, chills, or difficulty urinating completely, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Limiting fluids… no caffeine… alright, I can do that. My wife always tells me to cut back on the tea, anyway. And avoiding… what was it? Caffeine? Yes. I can manage. So, just a week to wait for the results… and then we'll know what's wrong? Alright. That's… a little reassuring, actually. Tell the receptionist to let me know when the results are back. I’d like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. And thank you, Doctor. For… explaining everything so clearly. It's been a bit of a shock, but… I feel a little better now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. The receptionist will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Get dressed, and take your time. And remember, if anything changes or you become concerned, don’t hesitate to call. Have a good day, Mr. Segretto.
