DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… lovely to meet you as well. Oh dear, what does bring me in… It’s this pain, you see. Down low. In my abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it’s here… well, it’s quite something. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about… a condition? Something with my immune system. It's all a bit foggy, I'm afraid. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Glymph. No need to apologize at all; it’s perfectly common for details to be a little unclear. We’ll work through it together. So, this pain in your lower abdomen – could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it. It's… a cramping, mostly. A deep ache, really. Like a heavy weight, pressing in. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like twisting. Not sharply, but… unsettling. It comes in waves, I suppose. And it makes me feel rather… weak. Though I haven't fainted or anything. Is that helpful? It’s hard to put into words, you see.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Glymph. Thank you. “Cramping, a deep ache, like a heavy weight, twisting in waves” – I’m noting all of that. And you mentioned weakness associated with the pain. Now, when did this pain start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The start of it… That’s a tricky one. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It’s been… building, I think. For… several months, perhaps? It started as just a little discomfort, easily ignored. But it’s gotten… more insistent lately. I'd say, within the last three or four months it’s been truly bothersome. Before that, it was just… a vague awareness. I really wish I could be more precise, but my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's common for symptoms to develop gradually. “Several months, building gradually, more bothersome in the last three to four months” – I’ve recorded that. And is the pain constant, or does it come and go as you mentioned?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, yes. It’s not… always there. Some days I barely notice it, and others… well, others it’s quite difficult to manage. It seems to flare up after… activity, perhaps? Or if I’m… stressed. Though I haven’t noticed a clear pattern, to be honest. It’s unpredictable, which is rather frustrating. I try to keep busy, you see, but sometimes the pain just… stops me.
DOCTOR: I see. Flaring with activity and stress, unpredictable. We'll try to pinpoint any triggers. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, other symptoms… Let me think… Well, I have been rather tired lately. More tired than usual, even for my age. And… my joints ache a bit, sometimes. My hands, mostly. But I thought that was just… getting old! It’s hard to say what’s connected and what isn’t, you see. And… sometimes I feel a little… feverish. Not a high fever, just… warm. Is that helpful? I apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not rambling at all, Ms. Glymph. This is all very useful information. Fatigue, joint ache in the hands, and occasional feeling of being feverish. Do you have any changes in your bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it? Well… I have been a little… irregular, I suppose. More constipated than usual. But I haven't noticed any… blood. No, thankfully not. It’s just… uncomfortable. And it adds to the overall feeling of… not being quite right, you see. I'm sorry, I feel rather awkward discussing this.
DOCTOR: You have no reason to apologize or feel awkward, Ms. Glymph. These questions are important for understanding what's going on. "Irregular, more constipated" – noted. Now, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I was diagnosed with… something autoimmune, a few years ago. Lupus, I believe. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. That's what the doctor said. It's been… managed, mostly, with medication. But I haven’t seen that doctor in a while, to be honest. And… I had a bout of pneumonia a couple of years ago, but I recovered fully. Aside from that… I don’t recall anything major. My memory is just… dreadful, you see. Is that helpful? I apologize if I’m forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Glymph. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, previously managed with medication, and a bout of pneumonia. We'll certainly want to review those records. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries… Let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was quite young. And… I had a hysterectomy many years ago. That's all I can recall, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and my memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. I truly apologize if I'm forgetting something important. It feels like… pieces are missing.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. Glymph. Appendectomy and hysterectomy – noted. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That's another tricky one. My mother had… arthritis, I believe. And my sister… she had some sort of… autoimmune condition as well. Not Lupus, but something similar. But I don't recall the specifics, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about medical things much, you see. They're both… gone now, unfortunately. I apologize for being so vague. It feels like… information is slipping away.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Glymph. Arthritis in your mother and an autoimmune condition in your sister – noted. It's perfectly alright if details are unclear. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, medications… Let me see… I take… Plaquenil, for the Lupus. And… a vitamin D supplement. And… occasionally, ibuprofen, when the pain is particularly bad. That's all I can think of right now. Though I'm sure I take something else, occasionally. I apologize for being so disorganized. It's difficult to keep track of everything, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful. Plaquenil, vitamin D, and ibuprofen as needed. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, allergies… Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Though I do get a little… itchy sometimes, after eating shellfish. But I don’t think that’s a true allergy, just… a sensitivity. And I'm rather sensitive to the cold, but that's not an allergy, is it? I apologize for being so unsure. It's difficult to remember everything, you see.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. Glymph. It's helpful to know that you haven't experienced any true allergic reactions and have a sensitivity to shellfish and cold. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment, of course. I understand it's necessary. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I'll do my best to remain still. It's just… sometimes my joints ache a bit, so please be gentle. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound good, Ms. Glymph. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. I'm noting some mild tenderness here, Ms. Glymph, in your lower abdomen. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate this tenderness?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that's… a little uncomfortable. Hmm… I would say… a four, perhaps? It's not excruciating, but it's certainly noticeable. It’s similar to the pain I've been experiencing, just… more focused. It's a dull ache, really. Not sharp or stabbing. It’s just… unpleasant. Thank you for being so gentle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. Your reflexes are normal, and your bowel sounds are good. No rebound tenderness or guarding noted. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, a few things could be going on. Given your history of Lupus and the symptoms you're experiencing – the abdominal pain, fatigue, joint ache, and constipation – it's possible this is a Lupus flare. However, other possibilities include irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, or even a urinary tract infection. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order some lab tests. These will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a C-reactive protein level, a urinalysis, and a stool sample to check for infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… very thorough, Doctor. Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. If it will help determine what's going on, I'm happy to have whatever tests you deem necessary. I trust your judgment entirely. Will these tests require… a lot of samples? And will they be uncomfortable? I apologize for being such a worrywart.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned. The blood tests will require a standard blood draw – just a few vials of blood. The urine test will involve providing a urine sample – we have a private restroom available for that. And the stool sample will require collecting a small amount of stool – we can provide you with instructions and a collection kit. None of these tests should be particularly uncomfortable. I'll write the orders now, and then the nurse will come in to collect the samples. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or if you develop a fever, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms, please contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that… sounds manageable, thankfully. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I'm just… anxious to get to the bottom of this, you see. Thank you again for your time and attention. I'll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Glymph. I understand your anxiety, and we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. The nurse will be in shortly. Please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions or concerns while you wait. Thank you for coming in today.
