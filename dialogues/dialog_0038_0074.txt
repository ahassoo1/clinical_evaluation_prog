DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this blood pressure of mine. Been a bit high lately, the nurse said when she checked it back there. Truth be told, I mostly just want to get it sorted so I can get back to my bakin’. Folks depend on me for their bread, you see.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked and wanting to stay on top of things. And it’s wonderful you have such a dedicated following for your baking! Let's talk about this blood pressure. When did you first notice it being high, or when did your nurse first mention it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It was… maybe a month ago? The nurse at the market checks it sometimes, just bein' friendly-like. She said it was a little high then, told me to watch it. Didn’t really bother me much at the time, thought it was just a bad day. But then it stayed high when I went to see my regular doctor, and he sent me over here. I don’t rightly remember the numbers, if that matters.
DOCTOR: It does matter, but don’t worry if you don’t remember precisely. Your regular doctor sending you over is good – it means they want to get it properly looked at. About a month ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, 'bout a month. Maybe a little more, now that I think on it. Things get blurry when you get to be my age, ya know? It was right after the July 4th picnic, I reckon. Lots of salt in everything at those things, probably didn’t help.
DOCTOR: I completely understand – memories can be a bit tricky! And you’re right, salt can definitely play a role. Besides the picnic, have you noticed any changes in your diet or lifestyle around the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. I eat pretty much the same as always. Been bakin' for sixty years, so that hasn't changed. Maybe I’ve been a little more tired lately, but I figured that was just gettin' old. I mostly just take things easy now, don’t do much heavy liftin' anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you haven't started any new medications or supplements recently, have you?
PATIENT: No, sir. Just my regular pills for my arthritis. Been takin’ those for years. Don’t like takin’ a lot of things if I can help it. Makes me feel all fuzzy-headed.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Not really. Sometimes my head feels a little… tight, I suppose. Not a headache, exactly. Just… pressure. And maybe a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast. But that happens every now and then, always has.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness in the head and occasional dizziness when standing. Have you noticed any changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: Vision's been a little blurry lately, now that you mention it. I just figured it was my eyes gettin’ old too. I haven’t been to the eye doctor in a while. It's just one of those things, ya know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's easy for things to creep up on you. Let's do a quick exam to get a better picture of what's going on. I'd like to check your heart, lungs, and also take a look in your ears and eyes, if that’s alright with you. We’ll also do a neurological exam just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just try not to keep me too long, alright? I got a batch of sourdough startin' that needs tendin' to.
DOCTOR: I’ll do my best, Ms. Steines. Sourdough is important business! Your heart sounds a bit… robust, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing at your age. I’m hearing a regular rhythm, but a slightly stronger beat than I’d typically expect. Now, let me listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… and again. Sounds clear on both sides, no wheezing or crackling.
PATIENT: Good. Glad to hear my lungs are alright. Been breathin' air all my life, ought to be good lungs! That robust heart… is that somethin' I need to worry 'bout?
DOCTOR: It’s generally not something to worry about immediately. A stronger heart beat can simply be a normal variation, especially in someone who’s lived a long and active life. But it’s something we need to consider along with your blood pressure and other symptoms. Your ears look clear, no signs of infection. Now, I'm going to check your pupils and reflexes. Just follow my penlight with your eyes, if you can.
PATIENT: Alright. Follow the light… there we go. Old eyes ain’t as quick as they used to be, but they still work. Hope I’m not makin’ this too hard for ya, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Steines. You're doing wonderfully. Your pupils are reacting normally to light, and your eye movements seem good. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, but they're present and symmetrical. Now, to finish up the physical exam, I'd like to check your blood pressure again. It's helpful to see if it's consistent. Could you sit up straight and keep your arm relaxed?
PATIENT: Alright. Just get it over with, alright? I got bread to bake! And I swear, if it's too high, you gotta promise not to make me give up salt completely.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Steines. We’ll certainly try to avoid drastic measures! Okay, your blood pressure is 160/95. That is elevated. Your pulse is 78. Now, I have access to your EHR here. It shows you have a history of osteoarthritis, and you've been taking ibuprofen for that. Do you take any other medications regularly?
PATIENT: Just that ibuprofen, Doctor. Sometimes a little somethin' for my arthritis gets bad, but not every day. Usually I just try to tough it out. My mama always said a little pain builds character.
DOCTOR: I see. It's good you try to manage it without medication when possible. Ibuprofen can sometimes contribute to higher blood pressure, so that's something to consider. Given your blood pressure reading of 160/95, along with your symptoms of occasional headaches, dizziness, and blurry vision, it’s important to investigate this further. I want to rule out any underlying causes. I'd like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a few other things. I also recommend an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And, given the blurriness, a referral to an ophthalmologist for a full eye exam would be a good idea.
PATIENT: Lots of tests… sounds expensive. And I ain't one for pokin' and proddin' if I can avoid it. Is it really that bad? I feel alright most of the time, just a little tired and maybe a bit foggy-headed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Steines. It’s true, it’s a few tests, but they’re important to get a clear picture of what’s going on and rule out anything serious. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to problems with your heart, kidneys, and brain over time, even if you feel okay right now. It’s about being proactive and preventing potential complications. The tests will help us determine if we need to make any changes to your treatment plan. We can discuss the costs with your insurance company. For now, I'd recommend keeping a blood pressure log at home for a week. That will give us a better idea of how your blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day. I’ll write you a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor. Also, I’d like you to limit your salt intake as much as possible for the next week, and try to get at least 30 minutes of gentle exercise most days. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A log… and less salt. I can do that, I reckon. But don’t expect miracles. My sourdough starter needs a good amount of salt to rise proper. And I’m payin' for this monitor myself, aren't I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are, but think of it as an investment in your health, and your baking! We can discuss some lower-sodium salt substitutes if you’re concerned about your starter. I'll write you the prescription for the monitor now, and give you a handout with instructions on how to take your blood pressure correctly. I’ll also write down the number for a reliable ophthalmologist. I want to see you back here in one week with your blood pressure log and the results from the ophthalmologist. We can discuss those results and make a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A week. Alright. Just… try not to keep me waitin' too long, Doctor. I got a reputation to uphold. Folks depend on my bread, ya know. And… you won't make me stop bakin’ altogether, will ya?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Ms. Steines! Your bread is far too important. We’ll work with your lifestyle, not against it. Here’s the prescription and the handout. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. And remember, we’re here to support you. Now, do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… keep it simple, alright? I ain’t good with fancy medical talk. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate ya listenin' to an old woman.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Steines. It was my pleasure. And you are not just an old woman – you're a valued member of your community, and I want to help you stay healthy so you can keep doing what you love. And yes, I'll keep it simple. Have a good day, and please, take care. I look forward to seeing you next week.
PATIENT: .
