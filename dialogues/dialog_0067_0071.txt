DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s about getting some shots. My grandson… he’s trying to get settled here, you see, and I believe he needs certain vaccinations for his papers. I'm hoping you can tell me what those are. I don’t really know where to start, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. We can definitely figure that out. It's good you're thinking ahead about this. To make sure I give you the correct information, could you tell me a little more about your grandson?
PATIENT: Certainly. His name is Eli. He’s… twenty-two years old. He’s coming from Honduras. He’s a good boy, very hard worker. He’s never been to the United States before. He’s applying for… a green card, I believe his lawyer said. Is that the right term? I’m not very good with all this paperwork, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, a green card is right – that means he’s applying for permanent residency. And knowing he’s twenty-two and coming from Honduras is very helpful. Immigration physicals have specific vaccine requirements. Let me pull up the current requirements for a twenty-two-year-old applying for permanent residency from Honduras. It’s August 2nd, 2025, so we’ll use the most up-to-date guidelines. Just one moment… Okay, here we are. Generally, it includes verification of certain vaccinations like measles-mumps-rubella , varicella , influenza, hepatitis A and B, and Tdap . There may be others, depending on his records, and potentially a COVID-19 vaccine as well. Do you happen to know if Eli has any records of previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… a lot of names. I’ll have to write those down. As for records… he had some shots when he was a little boy, I know that much. But Honduras… things aren’t always kept up so well, you understand. His mother, God rest her soul, tried to keep track, but… I don’t believe he has anything official with him. We might have to start from scratch, then. Is that… common?
DOCTOR: It’s very common, actually, Mr. Skarbek. Especially with people coming from other countries, records can be difficult to obtain. Starting from scratch is perfectly fine – we can do titers to see what immunities he already has and then give the necessary vaccinations. Okay, so we’ll proceed as if he doesn’t have records for now. To start, let’s talk about his medical history. Has Eli had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. He was a healthy boy. A bit sickly when he was very small, like all babies, I suppose, but nothing serious. He broke his arm once, falling out of a mango tree when he was about ten, but that healed up fine. Other than that… just the usual childhood things. He’s never been hospitalized, if that’s what you’re asking. He’s a strong boy. Works very hard in the fields.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No major illnesses or surgeries is helpful. And working in the fields… that gives me a bit of a picture. Now, does Eli have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. He’s never mentioned any allergies, not that I recall. He eats everything, bless him. His mother was always careful about what she fed him, and he never had a reaction to anything. He’s not around any animals much, so no allergies there either. I’m fairly certain he doesn’t have any, but I suppose it’s always best to be sure. He’s a pretty simple boy, you see. Doesn't ask for much.
DOCTOR: That’s good. No known allergies is helpful. Now, I just want to quickly go through some current medications. Is Eli currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. He doesn't take anything regularly. Sometimes, if he has a headache, he’ll take one of those over-the-counter pain relievers… I don’t recall the name. But that’s it. He mostly just drinks water and eats what his aunt cooks. He’s a very healthy boy, really. Doesn’t believe much in doctors or medicine, honestly, but he’s doing this for his papers, you see. He’s a good boy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Just occasional pain relievers. And it’s good he’s willing to come in for this even if he’s not a big fan of doctors, that shows responsibility. Now, let’s talk about his family history. Are there any major medical conditions that run in his family?
PATIENT: Well, his mother… she had problems with her heart, later in life. She passed away when she was… oh, maybe sixty? It was sudden. And his grandfather, on his father’s side, he had diabetes, I believe. But other than that… not that I know of. His father was always healthy as a horse, worked in the fields his whole life. His aunt… she's healthy too, as far as I know. We don’t see them much, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in his mother and diabetes in his grandfather. That’s helpful information. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, I just want to ask one quick question about his social history. Does Eli smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Not at all. He doesn’t smoke. He doesn’t drink. And he certainly doesn’t use… those things. He’s a good boy, a hard worker. He’s too busy working to bother with any of that. He goes to church on Sundays, too. A very respectable young man.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, let’s proceed with a quick physical exam to get a baseline and see if there's anything that needs attention before we administer any vaccinations. Is that alright with you, Mr. Skarbek?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. He’s a bit nervous, but he'll cooperate. Just… be gentle with him, please. He’s not used to this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Okay, let’s start with his height and weight. Then I’ll listen to his heart and lungs, check his blood pressure, and do a quick visual exam. It won’t take long. Alright, he’s 5’8” and weighs 180 pounds. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal – no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. No organomegaly. Neurological exam is grossly intact. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. No obvious signs of acute illness. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Now, I just want to check his temperature. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. All vital signs are normal. It seems he's in good overall health.
PATIENT: That’s… good to hear, Doctor. He is a strong boy. I was worried he might be… unwell, coming all this way. What does this mean, then? What about the shots? Which ones does he need?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Skarbek, based on the exam and what you've told me, he appears to be in good health, which is excellent. As for the vaccinations, according to the current immigration guidelines, he will need the following: MMR : We’ll need to verify he’s had two doses. Varicella : Two doses are required. Influenza : One dose annually. Hepatitis A and B: A series of shots are needed. Tdap : One booster is required. COVID-19: At least one dose is recommended. Since we don’t have any records, we’ll need to give him a series of vaccinations today. We can start with the MMR, Varicella, and Tdap. We’ll also give him a flu shot since it’s flu season. We can schedule follow-up appointments for the remaining vaccinations. Do you have any questions about these vaccinations?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… a lot of shots. Are they… painful? He doesn’t like needles much, you understand. And what about… side effects? Will he be sick? I just want to make sure he’s alright. He’s got to work, you see. He can’t afford to be ill.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Skarbek. It is a lot of shots, and it’s perfectly normal to be worried about pain and side effects. The shots will cause some mild discomfort – a brief stinging sensation. We can use a numbing spray to minimize the pain if you’d like. As for side effects, they are usually mild. He might experience some soreness at the injection site, a low-grade fever, or mild fatigue for a day or two. Serious side effects are extremely rare. We'll monitor him closely after each shot and provide you with instructions on how to manage any discomfort. We can space out the vaccinations to make it more manageable. We don't have to give them all today if he's uncomfortable. We can start with a few, and then schedule follow-up appointments. What do you think would be best for him?
PATIENT: Hmm… spacing them out sounds… sensible. Maybe just a couple today, then. The Tdap and… the one for the chickenpox? Varicella, you called it? He’s a strong boy, but he doesn’t like being sick. And I need him to be able to work. Could we do those two today, then see how he feels?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. We can do the Tdap and Varicella today, and then schedule a follow-up appointment to complete the series. Alright, let me explain the process. I’ll clean the injection site, then administer the vaccine. After the injection, I’ll apply a bandage and we’ll monitor him for about 15-20 minutes to ensure he doesn’t have any immediate reaction. Okay, here we go. This might sting for a moment… just relax. And here’s the Varicella… almost done. Alright, all done. Now we’ll sit here for a bit and monitor him. I’ll also give you a printout with information about the vaccines and what to expect in terms of side effects. Just let me know if you notice anything unusual.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That was… not as bad as I expected. He didn’t even cry. I appreciate you being so gentle. And explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now. What about the next appointment? When should we schedule that? And which shots will he need then?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear! I’m glad it wasn't too bad for him. He was very brave. Let’s schedule the next appointment for two weeks from today, on August 16th, at the same time. That will give him time to recover and any potential side effects to subside. At the next appointment, we’ll need to administer the MMR, Hepatitis A, and the Flu shot. We'll also check to see if any boosters are needed. Here’s the appointment slip. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Skarbek?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful. And patient. I appreciate your kindness. I think we’re all set, then. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. It was my pleasure to help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Take care, and have a good day.
