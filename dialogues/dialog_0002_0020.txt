DOCTOR: Hi Avril, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. I… how you say… my… the doctor, he send me. For… check up. A telehealth, he say. But… is better to be here, yes?
DOCTOR: That's right, I see here you were referred in for a follow-up after a telehealth visit. And yes, it's often much better to get a good in-person look at things. So, your previous doctor wanted me to do a check-up. Can you tell me a little bit about why he sent you?
PATIENT: Hmm. He say… my bones. And… the tiredness. I feel… so tired all the time, even after sleep. He want to see if… something is wrong with them, the bones. I work with cars, you know? Is… hard work. Maybe is that? But… is more than just the work, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so he was concerned about your bones and the fatigue you've been experiencing. And you work with cars, which is physically demanding. That's helpful to know. When did you start noticing this tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… is… slow, you know? Not one day. Maybe… six months ago? I think. At first, I thought is just… old age. But is… getting worse. I have to… rest more. Evenings, I just sit. No energy to do… things. My garden… is not so good this year. I like my garden.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, starting gradually… and now it’s affecting things you enjoy, like your garden. That sounds frustrating. And it's good you're getting it checked out. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… Let me think. Sometimes… my back. Is… achy. Not all the time, but… when I bend. And… I feel… cold. Even when is warm. My husband… he always say I am cold. But he… is gone now. So… no one say that anymore.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your husband, Avril. That must be very difficult. And thank you for sharing all of this with me. So, back pain when bending, and feeling cold… Have you noticed any weight loss recently, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, not weight loss. I… eat okay. Maybe not as much as before… but is hard to cook for one person. And… no, no big changes. I like… soup. And bread. Simple things. And… sometimes I feel… dizzy. Not all the time. Just… when I stand up quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dizziness when standing up quickly… That’s helpful information. And soup and bread – good, simple foods. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… the doctor, he say my… pressure is a little high. A few years ago. He give me pills. I take them. Is… okay now, I think. He check it. And… I had… the flu, many times. But not much else. I don’t like going to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve had high blood pressure in the past, which is currently managed with medication. And you’ve had the flu. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. I… always try to stay healthy. Except for the tiredness, of course. And the cold. My mother, she always say I am too thin. She worry about me. But she… is gone now too.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, Avril. And it’s admirable that you try to stay healthy. Okay, so no surgeries. What about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. Maybe… dust, sometimes. I sneeze a little. But not bad. Nothing I take pills for. My husband, he was allergic to cats. Terrible sneezing! I like cats, but… he always say no.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mild dust allergy. And your husband wasn't a fan of cats. Now, let's talk about medications. Besides the blood pressure medication, are you taking anything else – vitamins, supplements, over-the-counter drugs?
PATIENT: Just the pills for the pressure. One in the morning, one at night. I try to eat good food. That is… enough. Sometimes, if my back hurts, I take… ibuprofen. But not every day. Only when is bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication twice a day, and ibuprofen occasionally for back pain. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. I… trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Avril. Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. And again… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some diminished breath sounds at the bases. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72. I'm going to examine your joints, just to see if anything seems tender or inflamed. Some mild tenderness in your lower back, but no swelling or redness. And finally, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I follow. Is… okay? I try to be still. My hands… sometimes they shake a little. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: It is okay, Avril. I'm just checking. And a little tremor is very common, especially as we get older. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. Okay, balance seems good. Based on what you've told me and the exam, you're experiencing fatigue, some back pain, feeling cold, and occasional dizziness. The tremor in your hands is worth noting, and the diminished breath sounds could be a sign of something going on in your lungs. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and to rule out any other underlying conditions that could be causing your symptoms. I also want to get a chest X-ray to take a look at your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. The blood tests and… the picture of my lungs. I trust you. When… when will I get the results? I hope is not too long. I want to… feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Avril. You're right to want to feel better. The lab usually takes a few days to process the blood tests, and I should have the X-ray results within a week. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – especially if you experience any shortness of breath or chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You are… very kind. And… patient. I will wait for the nurse to call. And… I will try to rest.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Avril. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up. Take care of yourself, and try to get some rest. Have a good day.
