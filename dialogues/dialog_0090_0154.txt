DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. They’ve been bothering me again. It feels like… a burning, you know? And I have to go so often. It’s quite… inconvenient. I don’t recall exactly when it started this time, but it's been a while, I suppose.
DOCTOR: "Again," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It… happens from time to time. Several times, I think. It was worse a few years back, I remember that. I had to… go to someone then. Not here, though. A different doctor. I don't recall his name, I'm afraid. Old age, you know. It’s just… uncomfortable, and it keeps coming back. I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what did that other doctor say?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… difficult to recall, truthfully. Something about… a bug, perhaps? He gave me some pills. Yellow ones, I think. They helped at the time, but… well, here we are again. It wasn’t a permanent fix, clearly. I don't remember anything about why it happened, just that I needed the pills. Is that… helpful? I'm not very good with remembering details.
DOCTOR: Yellow pills…right. Okay. So, to clarify, Claudene, you’ve had this burning sensation and frequent urination on and off for several years, treated once with an antibiotic, but it’s returned. Is the burning constant, or does it come and go with the urination?
PATIENT: Oh… constant is… no, not exactly. It’s more when I… you know… go. It burns during, mostly. And a little bit after, sometimes. Not all the time, thankfully. It's not a constant ache, if that makes sense. Just… unpleasant when it happens. And it makes me worried, naturally. It’s… disrupting. Is it serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, disrupting isn't a medical term, Claudene. We need to be specific. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I apologize. Changed? Let me think… not really. I haven’t… travelled anywhere. I eat the same things. I haven't… met anyone new. It’s all been very… routine. I live alone, you see. Divorced, a long time ago. Not much changes for me these days, Doctor. I'm afraid that's the truth.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh! Good heavens, Doctor! No! Absolutely not. I am… a widow, you see. And it has been… many years. A very long time. I find that question… quite inappropriate, frankly. Is that… necessary to know?
DOCTOR: It's a standard question, Claudene. Part of ruling things out. Now, let's move on. Do you have any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Back… sometimes. A little ache, lower down. But I'm an old woman, Doctor! I have aches and pains everywhere. It’s just… old age. I don’t think it’s connected to… the waterworks. It's just… my bones, I suppose. And my side… no, not really. Unless I’ve overdone it in the garden. Does that help? I’m trying to be as useful as I can, but my memory… it fails me so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness. No… no, I haven’t. Not that I recall. I think not. I always check, you know, just in case. But no, there hasn't been any blood. That would be… worrying, wouldn't it? I do hope not. I’d remember that, surely. Is it bad if there is?
DOCTOR: It depends. It could be nothing, but it needs to be investigated. Let's do a quick exam, and then I'll order a urinalysis. We need to rule out a urinary tract infection.
PATIENT: An exam…? Very well. I do hope it won’t be too… unpleasant. I’m not as… nimble as I used to be. And I haven't been to a doctor in a while. As quickly as possible, if you please, Doctor. I have errands to run. .
DOCTOR: Right this way. Try to relax, Claudene. It won't be long. And frankly, errands are not a medical priority.
