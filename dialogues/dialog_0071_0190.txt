DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet lately. It's not constant, but… I stumble sometimes. It’s been worrying me. I don’t… I don’t quite recall when it started, exactly. Perhaps a few weeks ago? It’s all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteady on your feet, stumbling… a few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Though it could be longer, I truly can’t be certain. It doesn't happen all the time, which is what makes it so confusing. Some days I feel perfectly normal, and others… well, I nearly fell carrying groceries just yesterday. It was quite frightening. I don’t remember anything specific causing it, either.
DOCTOR: Right, so intermittent, not a constant issue… and yesterday you stumbled with groceries. No specific injury or event that triggered it, as far as you can recall?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing that I can place. I… I wish I could be more precise, but my memory hasn’t been the best lately. It’s just… a feeling of losing my balance. Sometimes it feels like the room is tilting, but I don’t get sick, if that makes sense. No nausea or anything like that. Just… unsteady. It’s rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea, just the unsteadiness and a feeling of the room tilting… That's helpful. Have you noticed anything else happening around the time you feel unsteady?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Let me think. Around the time… Hmm. No, not that I can recall. I mean, work is… demanding, as you might expect. Long hours, quite physical, of course. But I wouldn’t say anything particularly different happened before those times. I do get rather tired, naturally. But that's… normal for the job, I suppose. I'm a rotary drill operator, out in the oil fields. It’s… strenuous work. But I don’t think that’s caused it, surely?
DOCTOR: Rotary drill operator… strenuous work, yes. Fatigue is understandable. Okay, let's go through a quick review of other systems, just to be thorough. Have you experienced any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… That’s… another good question. I haven’t been to the optician recently, I must confess. Everything seems normal, but it’s possible I haven’t noticed anything. Perhaps a little blurry sometimes, but I put that down to being tired, mostly. I wear glasses for distance, you see. But the prescription hasn’t been changed in quite some time.
DOCTOR: Okay, glasses for distance, prescription stable… Any headaches recently, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: Headaches… Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been getting them more frequently. Not terrible, debilitating headaches, but… a dull ache, mostly at the back of my head. Again, I attributed it to the stress and long hours at work, and perhaps not drinking enough water. They come and go, but they've been more noticeable lately.
DOCTOR: Dull ache at the back of the head, increasing frequency… Alright. And any ringing in your ears, or any hearing loss?
PATIENT: Ringing in my ears… No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. My hearing seems… normal, as far as I can tell. It's quite noisy where I work, of course, so perhaps there is some ringing, but I wouldn't notice it amidst the other sounds. I haven't had any trouble hearing people speak, or anything like that. No, no ringing, as far as I’m aware. It’s a very loud environment, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is there anything specific you'd like me to do while standing? Just… stand here? I do feel a bit wobbly, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, just stand for a moment. I want to check your balance. Can you close your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright… Closing my eyes now. I do feel rather… unsteady, even more so now, if that’s possible. I’m trying to remain still, but it’s… difficult. Please let me know if you see anything concerning. I’m a little worried about falling, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. You can open your eyes now. You did sway a little, but nothing overly concerning at this point. Now, let's check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knees and ankles. Just relax.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Relax… I will try my best. It’s been a long time since I had a proper medical check-up, you see. Everything feels a bit… strange. Please don’t hesitate to tell me if something feels wrong. I’m… a little nervous, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal on both sides. Good. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your ears. This might be a little uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Deep breaths… Ears… Yes, I understand. Please let me know if it feels uncomfortable. My ears sometimes feel a bit… blocked, especially after work, due to the noise, I imagine. But nothing serious, I don’t think. Just… a slight pressure sometimes. But it usually goes away on its own. I’m trying to remain still.
DOCTOR: Okay. Some wax buildup in both ears, but nothing significant. Now, let's take your blood pressure. 130 over 80. Good. And your pulse is 72, regular. Okay. So, Lilyanna, that was a good initial exam. Everything seems relatively normal, but your symptoms – the unsteadiness, the headaches – are concerning enough to investigate further.
PATIENT: I’m glad we’ve done some tests, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to hear that everything seems normal, but I am relieved you're taking my concerns seriously. What sort of investigation are you thinking of? I’m a little worried about what it could be, if I’m honest. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you're being open with me. It's hard to say definitively without some further testing. Your symptoms could be caused by several things, ranging from relatively minor issues like dehydration or inner ear problems, to something more significant. To rule things out, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to check for any underlying infection or anemia. Second, a Vitamin D level, as deficiency can cause dizziness and weakness. And finally, an MRI of the brain to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… That sounds… quite serious. But I understand, Doctor. If it's necessary to get a proper diagnosis, then yes, of course. Blood tests and an MRI… I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Will the MRI require any preparation? And how long will it take to get the results? I do have to return to work soon, you see. And I don't want to worry my colleagues unnecessarily. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It eases my anxiety somewhat.
DOCTOR: Yes, an MRI can seem daunting, but it’s a very safe and effective way to get a good look at your brain. No preparation is needed – just let the technician know if you have any metal implants. As for results, the MRI typically takes about 30-45 minutes, and the radiologist usually sends the report within 24-48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. As for work, I’ll write a note excusing you for a couple of days, to allow you time to recover and for us to discuss the results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect, Doctor. A note for work is very thoughtful, thank you. And knowing it’s just a few days is reassuring. So, to summarise… blood tests, MRI, and I’ll receive the results within 48 hours. And you’ll call me to discuss them. Is there anything else I need to do at this stage? Perhaps any lifestyle changes I should make while we wait? I do try to drink plenty of water, but… work is demanding, as you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. While we wait for the results, it’s a good idea to stay hydrated, get enough rest, and avoid any strenuous activity, especially if you feel dizzy or unsteady. If your symptoms worsen or you develop any new symptoms, such as a severe headache, fever, or weakness, please don’t hesitate to call us immediately. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today, to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: That sounds… very sensible, Doctor. Rest, hydration, and avoiding strenuous activity. And a follow-up appointment in a week. Yes, that works perfectly. Thank you so much for your time and thoroughness. I feel… considerably better knowing we have a plan. I appreciate your patience with my… vagueness. It’s frustrating not to remember things clearly. I believe that’s everything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. Don’t worry about your memory – it’s common, and we’ll work around it. My priority is to get to the bottom of this and make sure you’re feeling your best. The nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment and give you the lab requisition forms. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Galena. You’ve been very kind and reassuring. I will certainly take care, and I appreciate your help. Goodbye. .
