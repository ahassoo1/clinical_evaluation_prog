DOCTOR: Bula and welcome, Adyn! I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Um, well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure. My husband actually made the appointment. Something about my speech… he says it’s been a bit slurred, but I haven’t really noticed. I just… feel a little off, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common to not always be aware of subtle changes yourself. So your husband noticed some slurring in your speech… and you just feel generally “off”?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s just… vague, you know? Like trying to remember a dream. He mentioned it a few times over the past week or so… and now I'm here. I don’t… recall anything particularly stressful happening recently. Everything’s been pretty normal, I think. Do you need me to… elaborate on anything? I apologize if I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Adyn. It’s good you’re here, and we’ll figure things out together. "Generally off" is helpful information. Can you tell me a little more about how you feel off?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's not a pain, or tiredness exactly. More… like things are a little distant? Hard to explain. Like watching a movie through a foggy window. And maybe… a little slower to think sometimes? I wouldn't say it's a huge difference, but noticeable, I guess. Does that make any sense? I do apologize again; I'm terrible at describing things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Adyn, don’t worry about a thing! "Distant" and "slower to think" are both good clues. Has this feeling been constant over the past week, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: I… believe it comes and goes. It's not like it’s always there. Some days I feel perfectly fine, and other days… it's just a little more pronounced. I haven’t kept track, unfortunately. I didn't really think much of it until my husband pointed it out. He can be quite observant, you see. Perhaps he noticed it before I did.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know – intermittent symptoms. Now, let's just do a quick check of some other things, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, dizziness, or weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. Maybe a little tension sometimes, but nothing severe. Vision changes, no. And dizziness… I don't think so. No, that’s not right. Weakness… definitely no weakness. I'm a construction manager, Doctor, I’m on my feet all day. I'd notice if something was wrong with my strength! Though...now that I think about it, sometimes I stumble a little, but I just put that down to being clumsy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. “Stumbling a little” is worth noting, Adyn. Do you have any difficulty swallowing, or has your voice changed at all?
PATIENT: Swallowing… no, I don’t think so. No trouble with that. And my voice… hmm. I haven't noticed a change. My husband hasn’t said anything about it either, and he’s usually quick to tease me about my accent. So I assume it's still the same. It’s probably fine. I really apologize for not being very helpful, Doctor. This is all rather… confusing.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Adyn. You're providing me with valuable information. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… let me see. I have Medicare, which means I see a doctor regularly, but… honestly, I don’t have anything major. High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned it once, but it’s managed with… well, with pills, I suppose. And I had a bad bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but I recovered fully. Other than that… nothing springs to mind. I’m generally quite healthy, Doctor. I hope that’s a good thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication – that’s good to know. Do you know the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a tricky one. My husband handles most of the paperwork, you see. He keeps track of all my medications. I… believe it’s a small, white pill? I take it every morning with my breakfast. I apologize, Doctor, I truly wish I could be more helpful. I don’t mean to waste your time. Perhaps my husband could bring the bottles next time?
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Adyn, it’s perfectly alright. We can certainly have your husband bring the medication bottles next time. Now, let's just quickly go through your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had diabetes, I believe. And… my grandfather, on my father’s side, had something with his heart, I think. Something serious. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t know the specifics. I’m not very close to that side of the family, so I don't have much information. My grandmother was quite healthy, actually, lived to be 95! So, it’s a bit of a mix, really. It's hard to say, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother and some heart condition in your grandfather – that's helpful. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not! I don't smoke. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but rarely. And definitely no drugs. I’m a construction manager, Doctor. I need to be sharp on the job site! I don’t have time for any of that. I hope that’s alright with you. I’m trying my best to be as helpful as possible, though my memory is… not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Adyn, and I appreciate your honesty. And it's good to hear you're taking care of your health. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I'll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological assessment. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Though, please be gentle, if you don’t mind. I haven't been feeling quite myself lately. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Balance is slightly off, and there’s a slight tremor in your hands. Coordination is a little diminished. Alright, Adyn. Everything seems relatively normal, but those findings—the murmur, the balance issue, and the tremor—warrant further investigation. I want to order a few tests, if you’re willing.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. What kind of tests, Doctor? Is something seriously wrong? I confess, I’m starting to feel a bit anxious. I didn't realize things were so… complicated. I hope it's nothing too serious. Perhaps it’s just stress? I have been working long hours lately.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious, Adyn. We're just gathering information, and it doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. It’s better to be thorough, okay?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think it's best. What sort of tests are you thinking of? Will they be… painful? And how long will I have to wait for the results? I have a deadline on a project next month, and I need to be on top of things.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’d like to order a complete blood count – that checks your overall health. An MRI of your brain to get a better look at things, which isn’t painful, you’ll just lie in a scanner for a while. And a CT scan of your chest, to rule out anything going on with your lungs. And finally, I'd like to get an EKG to evaluate your heart. The MRI and CT scan will require scheduling, and the results usually take 2-3 business days. The EKG we can do right here in the office today. Do all these tests sound alright, Adyn?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That’s… a lot of tests. An MRI, a CT scan, an EKG… it sounds quite serious, Doctor. Well, if you think it’s necessary… I suppose I don’t have much choice. But will I need someone to drive me to the MRI and CT scan? And will I have to take time off work? This project is really important, you see. I really apologize for being such a worry.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Adyn, you’re not being a worry at all. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned. You’re right to ask about the MRI and CT scan – yes, you will need someone to drive you, as you’ll likely be given a mild sedative to help you relax during the scan. As for time off work, it depends on your specific job and how you feel afterwards, but I would recommend taking at least one day off after each scan to rest. I can write you a note for your employer explaining the need for the tests and potential time off. I’ll also have my nurse schedule these tests for you. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a medication to help manage any anxiety you’re feeling. It’s a low dose, and it should help you feel a little calmer while we wait for the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be wonderful. The note for work would be a great help, and anything to calm my nerves would be much appreciated. This has all been… rather overwhelming, to be honest. I apologize if I’m not being very cooperative. My memory isn’t what it used to be, and I confess, I’m starting to feel a little frightened. Is there… anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any symptoms I should be looking out for?
DOCTOR: You are being perfectly cooperative, Adyn, and I understand your anxiety completely. It’s okay to feel frightened. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe headache, weakness on one side of your body, difficulty speaking, or loss of vision, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Other than that, just try to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid any strenuous activity. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to schedule your tests and go over the medication instructions with you. We will call you as soon as the results are in, and we can discuss them then. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before Sarah arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think I’ve asked everything. You’ve been very patient with me, and I truly appreciate it. I just… hope everything turns out alright. Thank you for listening. I’ll just wait for Sarah then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Sarah will be with you shortly. Take a deep breath and try to relax.
