DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Look, I don't usually do this, going to doctors... but a friend suggested I come talk about... well, something to help stay safe. It’s about preventing HIV, I think? She called it PrEP. Is that right? I just want to get this sorted quickly, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: PrEP, yes. Pre-exposure prophylaxis. A… sensible precaution, I suppose, though I find most people overestimate their risk. Still. We can certainly discuss it. To be clear, you are requesting information regarding preventative medication for HIV exposure?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Exactly. Look, I'm not… I don't have it, okay? I just want to stay that way. A friend… a new friend… and I just want to be careful. Is that so strange? And honestly, the sooner we figure out if this is even something I need, the better. I have things to do today.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Trefren, it is not strange. Proactive health management is… acceptable. However, simply wanting to be careful is not sufficient for determining medical necessity. We need to assess your risk factors. Let's begin with a brief history. Have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Several times. Mostly when I was younger, traveling… you know, just being sensible. And more recently, maybe… six months ago? I remember it being negative. A standard test, at a clinic downtown. I can get you the name if you need. I have a pretty good memory, actually. It was… HealthFirst Clinic, on Elm Street. Does that help?
DOCTOR: HealthFirst… yes, I see a record. Good. And besides those tests, Ms. Trefren, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: No. Never. Honestly, I’ve been pretty careful my whole life. A few… relationships, yes, but always responsible. I’m not one for… casual things. Does that make sense? I’m not trying to be… evasive, just truthful. I wouldn't be here if I hadn’t been thinking clearly. I just want to know if this PrEP thing is right for me.
DOCTOR: “Responsible” is a subjective term, Ms. Trefren. While I appreciate your… candor, we must be thorough. Let’s move on to your current activities. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes. I… I am. It’s new, though. Very new. That’s why I’m here. It’s with… someone I met recently. We’re seeing each other. And I just want to be… sure. I haven't been with anyone in a long time, and this is different. And… she suggested I talk to someone about PrEP. Is that enough information? I don't really like talking about this, honestly. It feels… personal.
DOCTOR: "New" is… concerning. And I understand your discomfort, Ms. Trefren, but omitting details hinders accurate assessment. What is the nature of this relationship?
PATIENT: Look, it's… complicated. We’re getting to know each other. It’s not a long-term commitment, if that's what you're asking. It's mostly… physical, at this point. And she’s… she's had partners before. That's why my friend suggested PrEP. Just in case. I don’t know her history, exactly, and I don’t want to… rely on her telling me everything. Is that a reasonable explanation? I just want to protect myself. I’m 55 years old, I've been sensible my whole life. I don’t need complications.
DOCTOR: "Complicated" and a lack of complete information regarding your partner's sexual history does raise your risk level, Ms. Trefren. And while I commend your prudence, relying solely on preventative medication without open communication is… suboptimal. Now, let's proceed with a physical examination. It will be a standard assessment of your overall health. And, while I understand your… reluctance, I must inquire about your last menstrual cycle.
PATIENT: Wait. A physical examination? I thought this was just a consultation. And… my menstrual cycle? Really? I mean, with all due respect, what does that have to do with preventing HIV? I came here about PrEP, not a gynecological exam. Is that necessary? I'm not comfortable with that. Honestly, I think I'm starting to regret coming here. I just wanted a simple answer, not… this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, a comprehensive medical evaluation is always necessary before prescribing any medication, especially preventative pharmaceuticals. Assessing your overall health, including a basic physical exam and pertinent questions regarding your reproductive history, is standard procedure. Ignoring potentially relevant factors would be… irresponsible. While I respect your discomfort, omitting crucial information compromises your health and mine. I assure you, this is a routine part of the process. If you prefer, I can refer you to another physician, however, I cannot responsibly prescribe medication without a thorough assessment.
