DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Pandolfi. I am Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're with Medicare. Thank you for choosing our practice. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It's… a delicate situation, Doctor. I’m dating someone, and I thought it prudent to have a check-up before things… progress. One must be sensible, you understand. It’s not as though I’m a young girl anymore.
DOCTOR: Sensible is always a good approach, Ms. Pandolfi. I appreciate you being proactive about your health. So, you're looking for a general health assessment with a focus on sexually transmitted infections, given your new relationship?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not just that. Though, naturally, that is… a concern. I simply want to ensure I am in optimal condition. A complete overview, Doctor. Everything. I wouldn’t want any… surprises cropping up later. One has a reputation to maintain, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. A comprehensive assessment. Very well. Let’s start with a detailed history. Can you tell me about any past medical problems you’ve had?
PATIENT: Oh, really, Doctor, I haven’t had problems. Minor things, over the years. Childhood illnesses, naturally. A bout of the flu a few winters ago. Nothing serious, nothing that would be… relevant. I’ve always been quite healthy, if I may say so myself. I do watch my diet, you know. And I’ve always been very particular about my doctors.
DOCTOR: Of course. While you describe your health as good, even seemingly minor things can be relevant. For the sake of a thorough assessment, let’s try to be as complete as possible. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Doctor, really. I assure you, I have never required hospitalization. My mother raised me with a very strong constitution, and I’ve always taken excellent care of myself. It’s simply… not a possibility. Though, my grandmother did spend a week in the hospital with pneumonia when I was a child, but that's hardly relevant to my health, is it?
DOCTOR: While your grandmother’s history isn’t directly relevant, it's good to be aware of family predispositions. Let’s move on. Have you ever had any surgeries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… there was the tonsillectomy when I was eight. And… oh, yes. A rather unpleasant mole removal on my back some years ago. But those were… decades ago. And quite uncomplicated, I assure you. The doctor did a lovely job, hardly a scar. It’s really quite remarkable, actually. Not something to be concerned about at all.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, mole removal… noted. Now, Ms. Pandolfi, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I do not take medications. I believe in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding unnecessary pharmaceuticals. A little vitamin D in the winter, perhaps. And occasionally, a mild pain reliever for a headache, but that’s hardly… consistent. I find most doctors are too quick to prescribe pills for everything. It’s quite alarming, actually.
DOCTOR: Very well. No current medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness no. I have a rather robust system. I eat everything, I travel everywhere. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though… I once had a slight rash after using a particular brand of hand lotion, but I simply discontinued use. It wasn’t a true allergy, merely… sensitivity. A discerning woman knows the difference, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really. That is quite impertinent. I am a respectable woman. I do not engage in such… behaviors. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps. But certainly nothing… excessive. I find such questions rather vulgar, to be honest. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Ms. Pandolfi, to gather a complete medical history. It helps me understand your overall health profile. Very well. Let’s move on then. What is your occupation?
PATIENT: I am a Personal Service Manager, All Other. It’s… a rather broad category, but it involves overseeing various client services. It requires a great deal of discretion and organizational skill, I assure you. One must be very particular about the people one employs. It’s not a job for just anyone.
DOCTOR: Very good. And finally, Ms. Pandolfi, can you tell me about your sexual history?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor. Really! Must we delve into such… personal matters? I’m here because I’m starting a relationship, not to provide a detailed account of my life. It’s… private. And frankly, rather none of your business. I’ve been married, and I’m… discerning. Is that sufficient? One doesn’t air one’s laundry, you understand. It’s simply… improper.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, while I respect your privacy, a thorough assessment of your sexual history is crucial for determining appropriate screening and preventative care. Without this information, I cannot properly address your concerns about sexually transmitted infections. I understand this may be uncomfortable, but it is a necessary part of my duty of care. If you are unwilling to provide this information, I can document that refusal, but I cannot proceed with a complete assessment. I can also provide you with a list of specialists who may be more comfortable discussing these topics. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: So, you’re saying I’m… withholding information? That’s quite presumptuous, Doctor. I simply don’t see the necessity of divulging such… intimate details to a complete stranger. I’ve been perfectly healthy all my life. And frankly, I find your insistence rather… rude. I think I’ve answered quite enough questions for one afternoon. Perhaps I should seek a second opinion. Yes, I believe I shall.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Pandolfi. I respect your decision. I will document your refusal to provide a sexual history. I wish you all the best. Please be aware of the risks associated with unprotected sexual activity and consider seeking care elsewhere if you change your mind. Have a good day.
