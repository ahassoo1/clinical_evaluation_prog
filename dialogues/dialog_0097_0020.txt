DOCTOR: Hi Avril, welcome! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Georgiou. It is nice to meet you too. Well, I am here for this… this talk on the telephone. My… someone told me I need to check with a doctor, yes? Because of my age. It is a… evaluation, they said.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're absolutely right. It sounds like your primary care provider recommended a general evaluation, which is a really good idea as we get older – just to make sure everything is ticking along as it should be. No need to worry, it’s a pretty standard check-up. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to come in today?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, to be honest, I do not feel… bad. Not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but… I work. I fix cars. It is hard work, you know? I have been doing it for a long time. My husband… he also worked with cars. But he is… gone now. So, I keep doing it. Is that… is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. And I'm so sorry to hear about your husband. It takes a lot of strength to keep going after a loss like that. It's good to hear you're not feeling particularly unwell, and yes, working as a mechanic is definitely physically demanding! We'll definitely take that into consideration. Just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: It is… just tiredness. Like, at the end of the day, I just want to sit. Not much energy to do… things. Before, I would garden, maybe visit friends. Now… not so much. It is not a sick tiredness, if that makes sense. More like… old tiredness. I sleep, yes. About seven, maybe eight hours. But I wake up… not feeling fresh. Sometimes my knees… they ache a little when I get up. But I take something for that. A white pill, I think. I do not remember the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. It sounds like a gradual decrease in energy, which is fairly common. And the knee aches – that’s good to know too. We'll look into those. You said a white pill for the knee aches – do you remember anything else about it?
PATIENT: No… it is small. White. Round, maybe? I get it from the… the drugstore. Old man, he knows me. I just ask for the “knee pill.” He gives it to me. I do not remember the name, Doctor. I am sorry. My memory is… not so good anymore. Is that a problem? Should I know this?
DOCTOR: No, not a problem at all, Avril. It's perfectly normal for memory to be a little fuzzy, especially with medications. We can look it up based on where you get it, don’t worry. We'll figure it out. Let’s back up a little. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. The doctor… before, he said my blood pressure was… a little high. He gave me a pill for that too. Blue one, I think. I take it every morning. And… I had problems with my back, many years ago. I went to a… a specialist. They gave me exercises. I do not do them anymore. And… oh! My feet. I have… bunions, I think they are called. They hurt sometimes, when I wear work boots. I do not think that is a… a condition. Just… feet. Is that enough? Am I forgetting something?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Avril. You’re not forgetting anything, you're giving me lots of good information. High blood pressure, past back problems, and bunions – all important things to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. When I was young, I had my tonsils out. A long time ago. And… when I broke my arm, when I was a girl. They put it in a cast. But… that was a long, long time ago. Hospital… I was in the hospital when my husband… passed away. For a few days. But no other surgeries, I do not think. Just the tonsils, the arm, and… the hospital. Is that all? I worry I am forgetting things.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Avril. It’s perfectly normal to have a little trouble remembering things from the past. Tonsils, a broken arm, and time in the hospital after your husband’s passing – that’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your family. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, my parents… they are gone. Both of them. My mother, she died when I was young. My father… he lived a long life, but he died many years ago. I have a sister, though. She lives in… Pilsen. In the Czech Republic. We do not see each other very often, but we talk on the telephone sometimes. She is… well, she is older than me. A bit frail, she says. And I have a son. He lives in Prague. He has a family. Two children. I do not see him very often either. It is… far away. Is that enough about my family?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you have a close bond with your sister and son, even from a distance. I'm sorry for your losses as well. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I fix cars, like I said. I try to eat… healthy, I think. Not much sweets. Mostly vegetables, meat. I do not drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. I do not smoke. Never have. I used to garden, but now… not so much. I live alone, in a small house. It is quiet. I walk sometimes, to the store. It is… simple. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I wanted to know. It sounds like you lead a pretty active life despite your work, and you’re mindful of your health. Now, just to finish up, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I do not think so. Never had any problems with medications. I can eat… everything. Sometimes my skin gets… itchy, in the winter. But I think that is just the dry air. Nothing… serious. I don't think I have any allergies, Doctor. I am pretty sure. Is that it? Are we finished? My back is starting to ache a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, Avril, that’s excellent. You've given me a lot of very helpful information. Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of everything. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… alright. If you think it is necessary. I do not mind. But please, be gentle with my back. It is… old, you know? And my knees too. But yes, you can look. Just… please be careful. I do not want to fall.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Avril. I will be very gentle, I promise. We'll take it slow and easy. First, let’s check your blood pressure. And could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright. I am breathing. Is that good? I hope it is not too high. I worry about that. It makes my head ache sometimes. But yes, I am breathing. Deeply.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That’s a little elevated, but not dramatically so. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. I am breathing. Is everything alright? I do not hear anything… bad, do I? My husband, he had problems with his heart, you know. But I… I hope I am okay. Just… tell me if anything is wrong.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Everything sounds good so far. Now, let’s take a quick look in your ears. Just relax your head for me.
PATIENT: Alright. I am relaxing. My ears… they sometimes feel… blocked, you know? Especially when it is cold. But I do not think anything is wrong. Just look, if you need to. Be careful, please. I do not want you to hurt anything.
DOCTOR: Your ears are clear, with a little bit of wax buildup, which is normal. Nothing concerning. And finally, let’s take a quick look in your nose and throat. Could you please open your mouth for me and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: Ah… Is that good? I hope you do not see anything… bad. My throat sometimes feels… scratchy, especially in the morning. But I think it is just… old age. Ah…
DOCTOR: Everything looks good in your throat – a little redness, but nothing concerning. Alright, Avril, that completes the physical exam. Overall, everything looks pretty good for your age. We did find your blood pressure is a little elevated, and we will address that, and I'd like to order some routine blood work just to get a baseline of your levels and make sure everything is functioning normally. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Good. That is good to hear. Elevated… you mean not too bad? And blood work… yes, alright. If you think it is necessary. But… what about the tiredness? Is there something wrong with me? I just… feel old sometimes. But I want to keep working. I need to keep working. Does the blood work tell you about that?
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to want answers about the tiredness, Avril. The blood work will help us rule out several things that can cause fatigue, like anemia, thyroid problems, and vitamin deficiencies. It’s a good first step. It won't definitively tell us everything, but it will give us a much clearer picture. We'll also consider other things, like your work and stress levels. Sometimes, simple changes can make a big difference. For now, let's focus on getting the blood work done. Would you like me to go over what's involved in that?
PATIENT: Yes… please. What is involved? Do I need to… fast? And will it hurt? I do not like needles very much. But if you think it is important… then I will do it. Just… tell me what I need to do. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take it one step at a time. You'll need to fast for about 12 hours before the blood draw, which means no food or drinks other than water. We need an empty stomach for accurate results. As for the needle, yes, there will be a small prick, but it's usually very quick and not too painful. The phlebotomist – the person who draws the blood – is very experienced and gentle. It’s over before you know it. We'll take the blood sample from your arm, and it's just a small amount – a few vials. I'll give you a lab requisition form with detailed instructions, and the lab will handle everything from there. It should take about 15-20 minutes. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Twelve hours… no food? That is a long time. But alright, I can do that. And the phlebotomist… is that a… a doctor? And they are gentle? I do not want to bleed everywhere. But yes, I will try. I want to know what is wrong with me. So, I will do it. And what about… what about my blood pressure? What do I need to do about that?
DOCTOR: That’s great, Avril. Yes, twelve hours can be challenging, but you can do it. The phlebotomist isn't a doctor, but they're specifically trained to draw blood safely and efficiently. They are very good at what they do. And we’ll definitely address your blood pressure. For now, I’m going to recommend a few lifestyle changes: Reduce your salt intake. Try to avoid processed foods, and don’t add extra salt to your meals. Increase your potassium intake. Foods like bananas, sweet potatoes, and spinach can help lower blood pressure. Get regular exercise. Even a 30-minute walk a few times a week can make a big difference. Manage your stress. Find healthy ways to relax, like meditation or spending time in nature. I’m also going to prescribe you a low-dose medication to help lower your blood pressure. It's a very common medication with minimal side effects, but we'll monitor you closely. I’ll write out all of these instructions for you. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No salt… potassium… exercise… medication… It is a lot to remember. And I work all day. I do not have much time for exercise. But alright, I will try. I will try everything. And the medication… is it safe? And will it make me feel… different? I do not want to feel tired all the time. Will it interact with the other pill I take for my knees? I hope not. That pill works very well. Perhaps I should just… go back to work? It is too much, maybe.
DOCTOR: I understand that feels like a lot, Avril. It is a lot, and it's perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. We're not going to change everything overnight. We'll take it one step at a time, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way. Let’s focus on a few small changes to start: try reducing your salt intake and adding a short walk each day, even if it's just for 15 minutes. We can discuss the medication in more detail – it's a low dose, and we'll monitor you closely for any side effects. And yes, we will absolutely check for any potential interactions with your knee pill. That’s very important. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to see how you're doing and adjust the plan as needed. And no, you definitely shouldn’t just go back to work and ignore everything. Your health is important, and it's worth taking the time to address these issues. I’m here to help you manage your health so you can continue to do the things you enjoy. Would you like me to write all of this down for you, including the lifestyle changes, the medication information, and the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Write everything down. And the follow-up… how long should I wait? And what if I… forget? I am old, you know. My memory… it is not what it used to be. Perhaps my son can come with me to the next appointment? He lives in Prague, but he can visit. Yes, please. Write everything down very clearly. And perhaps… a reminder? A telephone call?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Avril. I will write everything down very clearly, including a detailed list of lifestyle changes, the medication information, the date and time of your follow-up appointment, and my contact number if you have any questions. I will also make a note to have my nurse call you as a reminder a few days before your appointment. And it's a wonderful idea for your son to come with you – having support is always helpful. Here you are. This includes everything we discussed. The follow-up appointment is scheduled for August 30th at 10:00 am. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. I want you to feel comfortable and confident in managing your health. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor Georgiou. You have been… very kind. And patient. It is a lot to remember, but… I will try. I promise. Perhaps… perhaps I should go now? Before I forget something else. Thank you again. And… good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Avril. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, take it one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. And take care! Have a good day, and I'll see you on August 30th.
