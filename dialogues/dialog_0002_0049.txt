DOCTOR: Hi Betty, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s…well, it’s my ears, I think. They don’t seem to be workin’ as well as they used to. Everything’s a bit muffled, you know? Not sure when it started, honestly. Time just… slips away.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing. I understand. It's very common as we get older. And you're right, time does slip away! So, it sounds like this has been developing gradually. Can you tell me – is it both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Hard to say for sure. It's not like one’s suddenly gone quiet, more like…everything's just turned down a bit. Like talkin’ underwater, maybe? Does that make sense? I used to hear the birds so clearly in the mornin’, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. "Talking underwater" is a good way to describe it. And noticing a difference with sounds like birdsong is helpful. Okay, so both ears, gradual onset… Have you noticed it getting worse recently, or has it been pretty stable?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yes. It has been a bit worse lately. My niece, Carol, was over last week, and I had to ask her to repeat herself a good few times. She was tellin’ me about her new puppy, but I missed half of it. It was embarrassin’, to be honest. I just nodded and smiled, hopin’ I didn’t look too confused.
DOCTOR: I understand that can be frustrating, and it’s definitely not something to be embarrassed about. It's good you noticed it was getting worse recently. Do you experience any ringing in your ears, or any pain or dizziness along with the muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes, yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine, but it comes and goes. Not all the time. And no, no pain or dizziness. Just the quiet. Everything’s a bit… distant, you know? Like I’m listenin’ through cotton. It doesn’t bother me all the time, but it makes it hard to follow conversations sometimes. Especially when there’s background noise.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent ringing, no pain or dizziness, muffled hearing that’s worse with background noise. That gives me a bit more information. Have you ever been exposed to a lot of loud noises – maybe at work, or hobbies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My work, now that you mention it. I worked in a shoe factory for… goodness, must be fifty years! All those machines whirring and banging away. It was loud. We didn’t have earplugs or anything like that back then. Just… got used to it, I suppose. Didn’t think much of it at the time. It was just part of the job.
DOCTOR: Okay, a long history of noise exposure at work. That's very relevant. And it’s common to not realize the damage it can cause until later in life. Let's do a quick exam of your ears, just to get a better look and rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course dear. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go right ahead. My ears are probably full of dust from the factory anyway!
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. I'm just going to take a look inside your ears with this light. It won't hurt, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, I see some wax buildup in both ears, which is pretty common. The ear canals themselves look okay, no sign of infection or anything concerning. The eardrums do appear a little dull, which can be a sign of fluid or stiffness, but it's hard to tell definitively without some further testing. I'd like to do a simple hearing test, if you're up for it. It just involves wearing headphones and responding to some tones. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That doesn’t sound too bad. Tones, you say? Like… beeping? Yes, I can handle beeping. My ears aren’t completely gone yet! Wax, huh? I suppose that makes sense. I never did bother with cleaning them much. Just… left them alone. Go ahead with the test then, dear. Let's see what you find.
DOCTOR: Great. I’m going to put these headphones on for you. I'll be in the next room, and I'll give you instructions through the speaker. Just raise your hand whenever you hear a tone, no matter how faint. We’ll test each ear separately, and it’ll take about ten to fifteen minutes. Just relax and do your best. Let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Alright then. Sounds… simple enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty, we’re all done. Thank you for your patience. The test shows you have a mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears, primarily affecting the higher frequencies. This is consistent with age-related hearing loss and the noise exposure you mentioned. It explains why you're having trouble with conversations, especially with background noise and higher-pitched sounds. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh… well. That doesn’t surprise me, I suppose. Mild to moderate… what does that mean exactly? I’m not very good with… charts and things. And higher frequencies… is that like… birdsong?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a little overwhelmed by these charts. “Mild to moderate” means you have some difficulty hearing sounds, but it’s not a complete loss. You’re likely missing some of the softer sounds, and it's harder to hear clearly in noisy environments. And yes, you’re right – higher frequencies are like birdsong, or the higher tones in speech like “s” and “f”. Those are often the first sounds to go with hearing loss. Essentially, it means you're not hearing the full range of sounds that you used to. Now, there are a few options we can consider. We can talk about hearing aids, which can amplify sounds and improve your hearing. Or, we can focus on strategies to cope with your hearing loss, like making sure you're in a quiet environment when having conversations, or asking people to speak clearly and slowly. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hearing aids… oh dear. I’ve always thought those were for… very old people. I’m not that old yet! And I don’t like things in my ears. It feels… stuffy. Strategies… that sounds… easier. Maybe just tryin’ to get people to talk slower. My niece, Carol, she talks a mile a minute. And I do try to find a quiet spot, when I can. It’s just… hard sometimes. I don’t want to be a bother, askin’ people to repeat themselves all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about hearing aids, and you’re not alone in feeling that way. They’ve come a long way, though – they're much smaller and more discreet than they used to be, and the technology is fantastic. But we absolutely don’t need to jump into that right away. Focusing on strategies is a great first step. And you’re right, asking people to repeat themselves can be tiring for everyone. Some things that can help include making sure you're facing the person when they're talking, reducing background noise as much as possible, and letting people know you're having a little trouble hearing. I can give you some resources with helpful tips and communication strategies. We can also discuss assistive listening devices, like amplified phones or TV speakers, if you're interested. I’m going to print out a handout with some of these tips for you. And I'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a few months to see how you’re doing and if you have any questions. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… lovely, dear. A handout is good. I like things written down. And a follow-up, yes, that’s sensible. Just to check things. I don’t want to bother you too much. Assistive… what was it? Amplified phones? I suppose that wouldn’t hurt. My phone is a bit quiet. Thank you. You’ve been very patient with me. I do get a bit… muddled sometimes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. It’s my job, and I’m happy to help. And please, don't worry about getting “muddled” – it’s perfectly normal, and I’m happy to take things at your pace. Here’s that handout with the communication strategies. It also has some information about assistive listening devices and local resources if you’re interested in exploring those further. I've scheduled your follow-up appointment for November 2nd at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: November 2nd… yes, that sounds alright. November’s a good month. Not too hot, not too cold. Thank you again, dear. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll try those strategies and see how I get on. And if things don’t improve, I’ll give you a call. I suppose I should be goin’ now. Don't want to keep you too long.
DOCTOR: Of course, Betty. You take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was lovely meeting you. .
