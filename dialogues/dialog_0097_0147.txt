DOCTOR: Hi Amy, welcome! I'm Dr. Georgiou. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s very nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, I’ve noticed a lump, a mass, down low in my abdomen. It’s been…present for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. That's good you're getting it checked out. “A little while now” – can you give me a sense of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Probably…around three months, maybe a little longer? It wasn’t really bothering me at first, so I didn’t rush to come in. But it hasn’t gone away, and I figured it was better to be safe.
DOCTOR: Three months, okay. And it hasn’t changed in size at all during that time?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… honestly, I haven’t been actively measuring it, if that makes sense. But I don’t think it’s gotten much bigger. Maybe a tiny bit, but I could be imagining things. It’s hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, it’s often hard to tell! And you’re right to come in to have it evaluated. Is it painful to the touch at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn’t hurt when I press on it. It's…firm, I guess. But no pain, thankfully. It’s just…there. It’s a little unsettling, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good that it’s not painful, but any new lump is worth checking out. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. No fever, no changes in my bowel habits, no weight loss…nothing like that. Just the lump. I feel otherwise completely normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, just so I have a full picture. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that’s the only surgery. And, honestly, I haven’t been seriously ill. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing major. My family… my mother had high blood pressure, but other than that, we’re pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed as a teenager, and a family history of hypertension. And no allergies to medications that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I can take most things without any problems. I don't take any medication regularly, either. Just over-the-counter pain relievers if I have a headache, that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam, if you don't mind. It’ll just involve me listening to your abdomen and feeling the lump to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you feel anything… concerning, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will definitely let you know what I find. Alright, if you could lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Here we go. Is there anything specific I should be doing? Like, should I be tensing my stomach muscles or…?
DOCTOR: No, just relax as much as possible. I'm going to start by listening with the stethoscope, and then I’ll gently feel your abdomen. Just breathe normally. Okay… I’m feeling a firm mass in the lower abdomen, about… 3 centimeters in diameter, located slightly to the left of your midline. It doesn't seem to be particularly tender to the touch, which is good. It feels… somewhat mobile, meaning it doesn’t seem to be fixed to anything deeper. And I don't feel any enlarged lymph nodes in the area.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… relatively reassuring, I suppose? Mobile is good, right? What do you think it could be? I’m probably being overly anxious, but my mind is already jumping to all sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Mobile is good, yes. It suggests it's not necessarily something deeply embedded. It's understandable to be anxious; it's natural when you find something new. There are a number of possibilities, and it’s too early to say definitively what it is without further investigation. It could be a lipoma – a benign fatty tumor – or a muscle issue, or even a hernia. But to be sure, I'd like to order a few tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Tests are good. I’d rather know one way or the other, even if it’s not what I want to hear. What kind of tests are we talking about? Will it involve… anything invasive?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I was thinking we'll start with a complete blood count to rule out any signs of infection or inflammation. Then, I'd like to order an abdominal ultrasound. It's non-invasive – we just use sound waves to create an image of the tissues underneath your skin. It will give us a much clearer picture of the mass, its size, shape, and what it’s made of. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfectly reasonable. Non-invasive is definitely good. And a CBC is… fairly standard, I imagine. So, ultrasound and blood work. And then we go from there? How long will it take to get the results? I have a bit of a busy schedule, so knowing a timeframe would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, ultrasound and blood work, and then we’ll go from there. The timeframe will depend on the availability of appointments at the imaging center and how quickly the lab processes the blood work. Typically, I’d say you can expect the results within 3-5 business days. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule the appointments for you and call you with the dates and times. She’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the ultrasound. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Having Sarah handle the scheduling is very helpful. Three to five business days is manageable. Okay. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any symptoms I should be watching out for? Or anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. For now, just continue to monitor the lump for any changes in size, shape, or consistency. Also, pay attention to any new symptoms like fever, pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits. If you experience any of those, please call the office immediately. Otherwise, just continue with your normal activities. No need to avoid anything specific at this point. I'll also have Sarah send you a printed handout with these instructions, just as a reminder. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very thorough. Thank you. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, and for not dismissing my concerns. It’s put my mind at ease a little, knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. I'll keep an eye on things, and I’ll let Sarah know if I have any questions. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. It’s always best to get these things checked out, and we’ll figure it out together. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any questions at all. Have a good day!
