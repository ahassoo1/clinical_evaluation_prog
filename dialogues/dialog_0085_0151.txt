DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this tingling… in my hands and feet mostly. It's been going on for a little while now, and I figured I should probably get it checked out. It's just… annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands and feet. “Annoying” is a good way to describe it, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not always there, you know? Some days it’s barely noticeable, just a little… pins and needles. Other days, especially at night, it feels… numb, almost. And kinda cold, even when I’m not. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it comes and goes, varies in intensity, and you've noticed it's worse at night. And you said it feels numb and cold – is that in both your hands and feet, or is it more pronounced on one side?
PATIENT: It’s both, yes, both hands and both feet. But… hmm. I think it is worse on my feet, maybe? It’s hard to say for sure. My hands get it when I’m doing things with them, like knitting, or… well, anything really. The feet… just seem to always be a little bit… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's bilateral – both hands and feet – but perhaps more noticeable in your feet. And it seems to be triggered by hand use. Have you noticed anything else that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… well, sitting still makes it worse, I think. When I’m moving around, doing things, it’s not as bad. And… warm water helps. A nice warm bath… that’s good. But it doesn’t last long, you know? It comes back pretty quickly after I get out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so movement seems to help, and warm water provides temporary relief. That’s good information. Now, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you had any other symptoms along with this tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Not really… no. No pain, no weakness, no dizziness. I've been a little tired lately, but who isn't? I'm 63, Doctor! It's probably just… old age creeping up on me. I haven't fallen or anything, if that's what you're wondering.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No weakness, dizziness, or falls. And I understand about the fatigue – it's common at any age! Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, have you had any medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been… well, it’s been years. The doctor put me on some pills, but I stopped taking them after a while. I just didn’t like how they made me feel. And… arthritis, I suppose. Just a little bit in my hands, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure and some arthritis. Do you remember what medication you were on for the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, I really don't. It was a little white pill… or maybe it was pink? Honestly, Doctor, I don't keep track of those things. My husband always handled the medication. It's been… five years since he passed, and I just… I don't even remember the name. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Teretha. It's understandable. We can look into it further if needed. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. And… no, I haven’t been in the hospital, thank goodness. Just the usual… colds and flu over the years, nothing serious. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk every day, eat… reasonably well.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, thinking about your family… do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions, like diabetes, neuropathy, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… hmm. My mother had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. And my brother… he had some problems with his legs, numbness and tingling, I think. He went to a specialist, but I don’t remember what they said was wrong with him. He lived in Ukraine, you know? It's hard to keep track of everything when they're so far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of arthritis and potentially neuropathy in your brother. That’s helpful. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything… well, almost everything. I don't like beets, but that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Teretha, not an allergy! Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Like I said, I don’t really like taking pills. Just… trying to get by on my own, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Alright, Teretha, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright. We’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. I have some errands to run this afternoon, and I don’t want to be too late.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Alright, your reflexes are a little diminished in your ankles, and sensation is slightly decreased in your feet, particularly on the outer sides. Your grip strength is good, though. There's some mild swelling in your ankles as well. I don’t feel any major abnormalities, but these findings suggest some possible nerve involvement.
PATIENT: Nerve involvement? Oh dear. Is that… bad? What does that mean? Is it something serious? I just want to be able to walk and knit, Doctor. That’s all.
DOCTOR: It can be concerning, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious. “Nerve involvement” is a broad term. It just means something is affecting the nerves in your hands and feet. There are many possible causes, and we need to investigate further to determine the exact cause. The diminished reflexes and reduced sensation are consistent with what we call peripheral neuropathy. Given your history and the exam findings, I suspect it could be related to a few things, including possible vitamin deficiencies, diabetes , or simply age-related changes. We need to rule out other possibilities too. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, kidney function, and thyroid levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Blood tests… Well, alright, if you think it's necessary. I don’t like needles, but… I want to know what’s going on. And I really do want to be able to knit again without my hands feeling funny. So, yes, blood tests are fine. Can I still go to the store afterwards, or will I be too tired?
DOCTOR: You’ll be able to go to the store afterwards, Teretha. The blood draw itself is quick, and most people don’t feel any lasting effects. It’s just a little pinch. I’ll write you a lab order. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take care of it. Once we have the results back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience any pain, weakness, or difficulty walking – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I just hope it's nothing too serious. And thank you for being patient with an old woman like me. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Teretha. It’s my pleasure. And please don’t think of yourself as “an old woman.” You're a patient who is seeking answers, and I'm here to help. Here is the lab order. The staff at the lab will guide you through the process. Please let me know if you have any trouble. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
