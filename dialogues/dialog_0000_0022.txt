DOCTOR: Alright, Soila McConnon, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. It's... good to meet you, Doctor... Batara, yes? My memory, it isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Pinky Batara. Yes, and don't worry about your memory, dear, it comes with age. Though, try to keep things concise, if you can. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well. It feels... big. Bigger than usual. And I don’t want much to eat, you see? Not like before. Everything feels… heavy. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Maybe longer? It’s hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: Right. "Big," and not wanting to eat. And this has been going on for… weeks, possibly longer. Can you describe "big"?
PATIENT: Just… rounder. My tummy. It feels full, even when I haven't eaten. And… tight. Like a balloon, almost. Not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. It’s strange. I used to be so small, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, abdominal fullness, not painful, just uncomfortable. Has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no… not really. I eat… soup, mostly. And sometimes bread. Not much meat anymore, it’s… hard to chew. It’s been like that for a while, I think. Maybe since… the winter? Or was it spring?
DOCTOR: Soup and bread. Alright. Any nausea?
PATIENT: Nausea…? Oh… you mean, feeling sick to my stomach? Sometimes. Not often. Just… a little queasy, maybe. Especially in the mornings. But I get queasy a lot, even when I am eating. It’s an old lady thing, I think.
DOCTOR: Queasiness, especially in the mornings. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a… personal question, isn’t it? Well… I don't go as often. And when I do… it’s… harder. Everything is just… slow, you see? Very slow. Like an old… river.
DOCTOR: Reduced frequency and difficult passage. Alright. And any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. I haven’t been weighing myself, you see. But my clothes… they feel a little loose. Maybe? It's hard to say. I always wear the same things, so I don’t notice these things. I used to be quite… stout, though. So, maybe a little. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: So, potentially some weight loss. Alright, let's do a quick examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please? My bones… they aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Sounds normal so far… a little quiet, but nothing alarming. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Anything here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. There. That… feels a little… full. Not painful, exactly, just… tight. Like a… a hard knot. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Hmm. A fullness, a "knot" as you say, in the lower abdomen. It's not acutely tender, but it is palpable. I’m also noticing some… guarding. Your liver and spleen feel normal. There’s no obvious ascites. I’m going to auscultate your bowel sounds. Bowel sounds are present, but a little diminished. Alright. I’m going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh dear… is something… bad wrong? What are you looking for? I don’t like scans… they make me nervous. Is it… cancer?
DOCTOR: Now, now, don't jump to conclusions. A CT scan is just an imaging test. It will give us a better look at what’s going on inside your abdomen. I need to rule out anything serious. It could be something simple, but it's best to be thorough. We’ll check for… obstruction, masses, inflammation. As for cancer… it’s too early to say anything about cancer. We need the results of the tests first. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… tests. That’s… good. I suppose. It’s just… all this talk of scans and… masses… It’s frightening. When will I get the results? And where will I go for the scan? I don't drive anymore, you see. Perhaps it is just something simple, like you said.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will write you a referral for the scan. It's at the clinic across town. I’ll have the receptionist schedule a transport for you. They have a service that can take you and bring you back. The scan itself shouldn't take long. The results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours. I will call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, continue to drink plenty of fluids, and try to eat small, frequent meals. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I used to be allergic to… dust, maybe? When I was a little girl. But that was a long time ago. No, I don’t think I have any allergies now. Unless you count a dislike of beets. Those are terrible. Is that the kind of allergy you meant?
DOCTOR: No, dear, not a dislike of beets. I meant any actual medical allergies to medications or other substances. Alright, no known allergies. I’m also going to order a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood count and a liver function test. These will give me more information about your overall health. The receptionist will explain the details when they schedule your appointments. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Batara. You’ve been very… patient with me. I hope… I hope it’s nothing serious. I just want to feel like myself again. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on. Remember, try not to worry too much. We’re taking all the necessary steps. The receptionist will be in touch shortly to schedule everything. You have a good day now. .
