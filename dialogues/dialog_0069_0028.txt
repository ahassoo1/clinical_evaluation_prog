DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Andraca. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Andraca. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough… it just won’t go away. It’s been bothering me for a while now, and my heart… it hasn't been the best lately either, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and some heart concerns. Let's start with the cough. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s not a bad cough, not like one that rattles your whole chest. It’s more… dry, and it comes and goes. Mostly at night, I think. Keeps me up sometimes. I have to sit up to breathe properly. It's been going on for… oh, maybe a month now? Hard to say exactly, time just slips away these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. A month of a dry cough, worse at night and causing you to sit up… that gives us a starting point. Do you notice anything that makes the cough worse – like being in a certain room, or after you eat or drink something?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. It doesn’t seem to be worse in any particular room. And eating doesn't bother it. Maybe… maybe when it’s cold? But then again, I’m always cold these days! It’s just… there. Most of the time, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not related to specific triggers like food or location, possibly a little worse in the cold. And you mentioned it keeps you up at night. Do you have any other symptoms along with the cough – like a fever, chills, shortness of breath, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills, definitely not. Shortness of breath… yes, a little. But that’s just… my heart, I think. It gets tired easily, you see. And no chest pain, thankfully. It's just… hard to catch my breath sometimes, especially when I'm walking. It feels like I’m carrying a heavy weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little shortness of breath, which you attribute to your heart. We'll definitely need to explore that. Now, let's talk about your heart a little more. When did you start noticing this shortness of breath or feeling of fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a while now. It's come on slowly, you see. Maybe… six months ago? It started with just getting tired walking to the market. Now, even getting up the stairs is a struggle. The doctor before… he said it was my heart. He gave me some pills, water pills I think they were, and I’ve been taking them ever since. They help a little, but it still gets bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this heart-related fatigue and shortness of breath have been developing over the past six months, and you're currently taking water pills prescribed by a previous doctor. Do you remember the name of those pills, or perhaps have a list of your medications with you?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! I think they were… Furosemide? Yes, that sounds right. Furosemide. And… let me check my purse. Here we are! Yes, Furosemide 40mg, once a day. And… that's it, I think. Just the water pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Furosemide 40mg daily. Thank you. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, thankfully! My mother always said a good appetite was a blessing. I’ve been pretty lucky that way, allergies aren’t something I’ve ever had to worry about.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let's see… Well, I had pneumonia when I was younger, a long time ago. But that was… oh, maybe fifty years ago? I recovered fully. And… I had my gallbladder out, sometime in the eighties, I think. Other than that… not much. I’ve been pretty healthy for my age, I think. I used to be very active, always gardening. But now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in your younger years and gallbladder removal in the eighties. Any major surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries. Just the gallbladder. And… nothing else, that I can remember. I’ve been pretty lucky, really. I’ve always been a strong woman, I think. I just wish my heart felt as strong as I do.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a bit sad, actually. My mother, she had a weak heart. She passed away when I was still young, maybe in her sixties. My father… he lived a long life, but he had high blood pressure. And my brother… he had a stroke a few years back. So, yes, there’s a bit of heart trouble in the family, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart trouble, specifically your mother with a weak heart and your brother with a stroke. Thank you. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I was married for a long, long time. My husband, Rafael, he passed away a few years back. We didn’t have any children. I used to work, I was a cook, short order, in a little diner. But I’m retired now, of course. I live alone, but I have a nice neighbor who checks on me. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Mostly, I like to read and watch television. And I used to garden, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you are widowed, retired, live alone with a helpful neighbor, don’t smoke, and drink wine occasionally. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm used to doctors, you see. I want to get to the bottom of this cough, and if listening to my heart will help, then that’s wonderful.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Alright, now I’m going to listen to your heart. Your heart rate is a little fast, around 98 beats per minute, and I can hear a slight murmur. It’s not terribly loud, but it’s present. Your lungs sound clear, but there is some mild wheezing. Blood pressure is 140/90. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don't feel any masses or abnormalities. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Now, based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like there are a few things going on. The cough could be due to several things, but the wheezing suggests some airway narrowing. The rapid heart rate, murmur, ankle swelling, and your history of water pills and your mother's heart condition raise concerns about possible heart failure. I want to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a BNP, which is a test that can help assess for heart failure. I also want to get an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity. And finally, a chest x-ray to look at your lungs and heart. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That… sounds like a lot. But yes, Doctor, if that’s what you think is best, then please do. I just want to feel better. Heart failure… that sounds scary. Is that what you think it is? I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best to find out what’s wrong, please do it. I just want to be able to breathe properly again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It could be heart failure, but it’s important to remember that these tests will give us more information and help us make an accurate diagnosis. We need to rule things out and see what’s actually going on. The blood tests and EKG are relatively quick and painless. The chest x-ray involves a small amount of radiation, but it’s a standard procedure and the benefits outweigh the risks in this case. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw the blood now. Then, we’ll get you over to radiology for the EKG and chest x-ray. It will likely take a couple of hours to get the results back. I'll review them as soon as they are available and let you know what we find. In the meantime, I want you to continue taking your Furosemide as prescribed. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as significant shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… please let me know as soon as you know something. I don't like being in the dark. And thank you… for listening to me. I'll just sit here and wait for the lab technician, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. I understand your anxiety, and I will do my best to get you answers as quickly as possible. I’ll check on you regularly while you wait. Let me call the lab technician now. They should be here shortly. Please don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you need anything at all.
