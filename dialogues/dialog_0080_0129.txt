DOCTOR: Hi Dawnetta, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven't got all day. It's my stool. It's black. Been taking these pain pills for years, you see, and now it's just… black. Is that serious? I don't do well with waiting around, so let’s just get to the point, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand wanting to get straight to the point. Black stool can be serious, so it’s good you’re getting it checked out. It definitely warrants a look. Years of pain pills… alright. First, let’s clarify a bit. How long has your stool been black?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A few weeks now, I suppose. Maybe a month? It all blurs together when you're getting on in years, you know. It wasn't immediately noticeable, it just… gradually got darker. Honestly, I figured it was the pills. They mess with everything, those things. Is that what this is about? The pills? Because if it is, I'm not changing them. They're the only thing that lets me garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so of gradual darkening. That’s helpful. And you’re right to wonder about the pills. Some medications can cause black stool, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. It's good you mention the gardening - important to know what you need to be able to do. I see you’ve been on oxycodone for chronic back pain for quite some time. Alright. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits besides the color?
PATIENT: Oh, thorough. That’s what they all say. Look, I'm a practical woman. I don’t need a whole lot of poking and prodding if it's just the pills. But alright, fine. Bowel habits… well, it’s been a bit… looser, I suppose. Not awful, but not like it used to be. And a little more frequent. Does that matter? Honestly, getting old is just one thing after another.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser and more frequent. Yes, that does matter, thank you for telling me. We need to consider a few things. Dark stool and changes in bowel habits can sometimes indicate bleeding in the digestive tract, even if it's not obvious bleeding. The pills could be the cause, but we need to investigate. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel around a bit. It won’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Another thing? Look, I'm not thrilled about this, but I suppose I haven't got a lot of choice, have I? Just get it over with quickly, alright? I’ve got tomatoes to stake and weeds to pull. Don't go poking around too much. It’s just a waste of time if it’s the pills, and I’m telling you, it feels like the pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. We're just ruling things out. Okay, I’m listening now… sounds a little quiet, but nothing alarming. And feeling… no tenderness, no masses. Everything feels relatively soft. Your abdomen is a little distended, but that could be related to the changes in your bowel habits. Now, I'm just going to feel along your lower abdomen… any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. A little… uncomfortable, maybe, but I'm not a young woman anymore, you know. Everything's a little uncomfortable. You're pressing on my insides! Honestly, I've had better days. Just get on with it, alright? I don't like being poked and prodded like this. Is this getting us anywhere? It feels like a complete waste of time. I told you, it's the pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your discomfort, and I apologize if this is unpleasant. I’m just trying to be thorough. You're right, it could be the pills, and that's what we're trying to determine. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, the most likely cause is the oxycodone. However, because of the change in bowel habits, and to be absolutely sure, I’d like to order a stool test – just a simple one to check for hidden blood. It’s a quick, non-invasive test you can do at home. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Hidden blood? Oh, for goodness sake. More tests. I swear, doctors just like to make things complicated. Fine. Fine, I'll do the stupid test. But if it comes back negative, I want you to write down that it was the pills. I’m not coming back in here for another poking and prodding session over this. And if it is the pills, I'm not changing them. Got it? I’ve got a garden to tend, you know. I haven't got time for endless testing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll write down that the most likely cause is the oxycodone, and we’ll proceed based on the results of the test. If it’s negative, we’ll discuss further options, but we’ll respect your wishes regarding continuing the medication. I’ll give you the instructions for collecting the sample now. It’s very straightforward. Do you have any questions about the collection process?
PATIENT: Ugh. More reading. Fine, I'll look at it. Honestly, it sounds complicated. You'd think they could make these things simpler. What if I… can't… you know… produce? Is that a problem? I’m an older woman, things aren’t always as reliable as they used to be. Just tell me plainly, is this going to be a difficult process? I haven't got all day to sit on the toilet.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and a common concern. It’s perfectly alright if it takes a little time, and if it’s difficult, don’t force it. If you’re having trouble, drink plenty of fluids and eat some fiber-rich foods – like fruits and vegetables. If you absolutely can’t produce a sample, call the lab, and they can give you some dietary suggestions or, in some cases, provide an alternative method. It’s not a race, Dawnetta. We just need a small amount. Don't stress about it. Does that make you feel a little better?
PATIENT: Well, it’s still a nuisance, but alright. Fine. I'll try. But if it takes all day, I'm blaming you. And don't expect me to come back in here if it's negative and you want me to try some other test or change my medication. I've made my position clear. Now, can I please go? I've got tomatoes to stake.
