DOCTOR: Hi Zelina, welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s probably nothing, but… people keep backing away when I talk. It’s embarrassing. It’s my breath, I guess. It just… smells. I don’t know why though. And frankly, I don’t have all day to figure it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're addressing it. It’s definitely worth looking into if it's causing you concern. “People backing away”... that sounds distressing. So, it's a concern about body odor, specifically your breath, and you've noticed it recently?
PATIENT: Recently-ish. It’s been… a few months, maybe? Look, I just got divorced, okay? Things were… stressful. Maybe it’s that. I don’t know. I’m not a doctor. And I really don’t want to spend hours talking about my personal life, so let’s just focus on fixing the smell, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we can focus on the smell. Stress can definitely contribute to changes in the body, so it's possible that's a factor. A few months... okay. Let's try to pinpoint some details. Have you noticed it consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty consistent, honestly. Maybe a little worse in the mornings, but it's not like it's good any other time. I brush my teeth, I floss… like a normal person. I don’t… I don’t do anything weird. Do you need me to list everything I ate yesterday? Because that’s going to take a while.
DOCTOR: No, no, let's not start with a detailed food diary just yet. Just brushing and flossing… good. And you don't have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Like what kind of symptoms? I just… smell bad. Is that not a symptom enough? I don't have a cough, if that's what you're asking. And no fever. Look, I work on the highway, okay? It's not like I'm sitting in a sterile office all day. I eat when I can, drink a lot of water… basic survival stuff. I don’t have time for fancy illnesses.
DOCTOR: Right, highway work. Okay, that gives me some context. No cough, no fever... that’s good to know. So, just the breath odor itself. Have you noticed any changes in your mouth?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? Is my tongue supposed to look a certain way? I don't… I haven't really looked at my mouth lately, to be honest. I look in the mirror to make sure my hair isn't a mess, that’s about it. Do you want me to go get a mirror? Because this is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, no, don't worry about getting a mirror right now. It’s okay if you haven't specifically looked. I was just wondering if you’ve noticed any sores, unusual coating, or dryness. If you have noticed anything, even something small, that would be helpful. Otherwise, we can move on. Let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any health problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. I mean, I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And… I had a bad flu a couple of years back, but everyone gets the flu. I'm pretty healthy, all things considered. I have to be, to do my job. It’s physical work. And frankly, I don’t go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. It’s a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Tonsils out as a kid… okay. And the flu a couple of years ago. No other significant medical problems. That’s good to know. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. I get headaches sometimes, but I just drink water and lie down. I’m not a fan of masking problems with drugs. Is this going somewhere? Because if you’re going to tell me I need a ton of tests, I’m leaving. I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: No, no tests right this moment. I just need a complete picture. No medications, okay. What about allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I can eat whatever. I'm Lithuanian, we eat a lot of weird stuff. Pickles, beets… all sorts of things. Nothing makes me break out in hives or anything. Seriously, I’m pretty sure I’m just fine. This whole thing is probably just stress. Can we just… agree that it’s stress and move on? I’ll try to relax more, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. It’s certainly possible it's stress-related. However, since it’s been a few months and is consistent, we should rule out any other potential causes just to be sure. Would you mind if I just take a quick look in your mouth and smell your breath?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But make it quick. I have things to do. And don’t stare. It’s rude.
DOCTOR: Okay… I’m just looking. Your gums look healthy, and your tongue doesn't have any unusual coatings. The odor is… noticeable, but not overpowering. It's a bit difficult to pinpoint the source without further investigation. I’m going to document these findings.
PATIENT: Wonderful. So you found nothing. I told you it was stress. Can we be done now? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Not quite yet. Finding nothing obviously wrong doesn't mean it's just stress. It means we need to consider a few other possibilities. Since it’s been consistent for a few months, I’d like to suggest a simple blood test to rule out any underlying infections, and perhaps a referral to a dentist to rule out any dental issues. It's a precautionary measure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: You’re kidding me, right? A blood test? A dentist? Seriously? I barely have time to sleep, let alone go to doctors and dentists. Look, I appreciate your concern, but I’m telling you, it’s stress. I’ll try to relax more. I’ll take some time off. I’ll drink more chamomile tea. Can we just… write that down as a plan and be done with it? I have to get back to work tomorrow. People are relying on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, and I respect your desire to avoid unnecessary tests. However, as a doctor, I have a responsibility to rule out any potential underlying medical causes. Since you're resistant to testing at this time, I won't force you to have them. But I strongly recommend reconsidering. If you're still experiencing the odor in two weeks despite stress reduction efforts, I urge you to schedule a blood test and dental appointment. In the meantime, let's focus on managing stress. Do you have any hobbies or activities you enjoy that help you relax?
PATIENT: Hobbies? Relax? I work on the highway, okay? My hobby is not getting run over. And my idea of relaxing is collapsing into bed after a 12-hour shift. Honestly. Look, I’m not going to sit here and talk about my feelings or take up pottery. I’m a practical person. Fine. Two weeks. If it doesn’t get better, I’ll… think about the tests. But I’m telling you, it’s the stress. Now, can I please go?
DOCTOR: Alright. Two weeks of stress reduction. If no improvement, reconsider testing. I'll document that we discussed the possibility of blood tests and a dental referral. Here's a summary of our visit. It outlines your symptoms, our discussion, and the plan. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime – fever, difficulty breathing, severe headache – please seek immediate medical attention. Thank you for coming in today, Zelina. I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Thanks.
