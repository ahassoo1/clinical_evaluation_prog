DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. My name is Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Bacy. It is nice to meet you as well. Oh, the hiccups. They're just… well, they won't stop. Started a few days ago, and they're quite persistent. Not painful, just… annoying, you know? It's exhausting, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Persistent hiccups, that is exhausting. A few days, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, started on... let me think... Tuesday, I believe. So, three days now. They come and go, but mostly come, if you catch my drift. I've tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down… all the little things people tell you. Nothing seems to work for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days of persistent hiccups despite trying some home remedies. And you’ve tried holding your breath and the water trick, good to know. Can you describe what they feel like exactly?
PATIENT: Well, they feel like… a normal hiccup, I suppose! A quick jerk in my chest, and then… hic! See? Just like that. It’s not a strong one, usually, but it’s frequent. And sometimes they come in little bursts, one right after the other. It feels like something’s just… stuck. Not painful, honestly, just… unsettling. Do you understand what I mean? It's hard to explain a hiccup!
DOCTOR: I do understand, perfectly. It’s hard to describe something so… involuntary! “Unsettling” is a good word for it. And you said they come in bursts sometimes. Are there any things that seem to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific that starts them, no. I was drinking a cup of tea yesterday, and they were pretty bad then, but I drink tea all the time. Maybe when I eat too quickly? That might be it. And laughing, definitely. If I have a good chuckle, hic!, they usually start right up again. It’s a bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no consistent trigger, but possibly tea and eating quickly, and definitely made worse with laughter. Let’s talk a little more generally. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. I haven’t felt unwell otherwise. No heartburn, no shortness of breath, no dizziness… just the hiccups. I've been sleeping alright, eating alright… everything seems normal, except for this… persistent twitch, I suppose. It’s just… annoying, like a little fly buzzing around your head. You know?
DOCTOR: I do know. "Annoying" is a good way to put it. No associated symptoms like heartburn, shortness of breath, or dizziness, that’s good. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, go right ahead. Let me see… Nothing major, really. I had my gallbladder out years ago, back in the… oh, goodness, must be thirty years now. And I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it's well managed with some gentle exercise and over-the-counter pain relief. Other than that, nothing I can think of that would be important. I've always been a fairly healthy person, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago and some arthritis managed with exercise and over-the-counter medication. That's good to know. Have you had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries. Just the gallbladder, as far as I remember. And vaccinations, of course, as I've gotten older – the flu shot every year, and the COVID boosters when they were available. But no other operations or anything like that. I try to avoid hospitals if I can!
DOCTOR: Alright, no other surgeries. Good. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the arthritis medication, really. I take naproxen when my knees are bothering me, but not every day. It’s just as needed. And sometimes a little bit of paracetamol for a headache, but again, not regularly. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter stuff. Oh, and a multivitamin, just to keep things ticking over. That's about it, I think. I don't like taking a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen and paracetamol as needed, and a multivitamin. No regularly prescribed medications. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I've had all sorts of injections over the years, and I've always been fine. No allergies to food either, or anything like that. I’m quite lucky, really. My family always said I was a robust child. Perhaps that explains it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And finally, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? My mother lived to be 92, quite healthy until the very end. She had a little bit of high blood pressure, but it was well-controlled. My father passed away younger, in his 70s, from a heart condition. And my brother… he had some issues with diabetes, but that's about it. Nothing major, no history of anything like cancer or anything like that in my immediate family. We were a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother lived to 92 with controlled hypertension, father passed away in his 70s from a heart condition, and a brother with diabetes. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and just have a look around. It’s just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, certainly. That sounds perfectly sensible. Go right ahead, Dr. Bacy. I’m not a bit worried. You seem very thorough, and I appreciate that. I’ve always said, it’s best to be safe.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and I don’t detect any murmurs. Your lungs are clear on both sides. I'm not hearing any wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft and not tender. Your reflexes are normal. And finally, I’ll just check your throat. Your throat looks clear as well. Everything seems normal on the physical exam. Given the history and the normal physical exam findings, the most likely cause of your hiccups is benign and self-limited. It’s likely a temporary irritation of the diaphragm. However, hiccups lasting for more than 48 hours warrant further investigation to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It's been three days now, so let’s explore some options.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear it’s likely nothing serious! But three days is a long time to hiccup, isn’t it? What kind of options are there? I’ve tried all the usual things, like holding my breath and drinking water… Are there any medications for hiccups? And what if they don’t go away? I don’t want to be hiccuping forever!
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned about the duration. While most hiccups resolve on their own, persistent hiccups can be quite disruptive. There are medications that can help, but we usually reserve them for more severe cases or when home remedies aren’t working. First, let's try a few more things. Have you tried stimulating the vagus nerve?
PATIENT: Stimulating the… vagus nerve? I don’t think so. What does that involve? Is it… painful? I'm not good with… procedures, if you know what I mean. I get a bit nervous easily. And honestly, I don't even know what the vagus nerve is!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, many people aren’t familiar with it. The vagus nerve is a long nerve that runs from your brain down to your abdomen, and stimulating it can sometimes help to reset the hiccup reflex. There are a few ways to do it. One simple method is the Valsalva maneuver - that’s where you try to exhale forcefully while pinching your nose and closing your mouth, like you’re trying to pop your ears. Another is gargling with water for 30 seconds. And finally, you can try drinking a glass of ice water very slowly. None of these are painful, and they’re quite safe to try. Would you be willing to give one of them a go?
PATIENT: Oh, those don't sound too bad! I think I could manage the ice water, yes. I don't think I’d be very good at the… Valsalva maneuver. I’d probably turn red in the face! So, slow sips of ice water, then? How much should I drink, and for how long should I try it? And what if it doesn't work?
DOCTOR: Perfect. Slow sips of ice water is a great place to start. Try drinking a full glass, taking small sips over about a minute or two. If that doesn’t help within 15-20 minutes, we can discuss other options. If the hiccups persist despite trying the ice water, we may consider a trial of a medication called baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help to calm the diaphragm. However, it does have potential side effects, so we’d need to discuss those carefully before starting it. We could also consider blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as electrolyte imbalances or kidney problems, but given your otherwise good health and normal physical exam, I don’t think that’s necessary at this stage. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, yes. I’d rather try the ice water first, and avoid medication if possible. I’m not keen on taking pills unless absolutely necessary. And blood tests… well, I don’t mind them, but it’s always a bit of a hassle, isn’t it? So, ice water for 15-20 minutes, and then we’ll see. I suppose I should go home and try that now. Is there anything else I should be doing, or anything I should avoid? And if the hiccups do get worse, or if I develop any other symptoms, who should I contact?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Ice water is a good first step. No, there aren’t any specific things you need to do or avoid. Just try to relax and stay hydrated. If the hiccups worsen, or if you develop any other symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, or vomiting, please contact my office immediately. You can reach us at 555-1234. If you experience severe shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room. I'll document our conversation and recommendations in your chart. I’m optimistic that the ice water will help. If not, we’ll explore other options. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Dr. Bacy, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I feel much better knowing what to do, and that there are options available if the hiccups don’t go away. Thank you again. I think I’ll go home and try the ice water now. Hopefully, it will do the trick!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. I'm glad I could help. And you’re right, hopefully, the ice water does the trick! Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
