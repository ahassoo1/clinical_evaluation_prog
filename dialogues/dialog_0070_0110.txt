DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNABB. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, I suppose you could say I'm here for a little...revitalization. I’m getting on in years, you see, and things just aren’t working quite as smoothly as they used to. I'm hoping for a bit of a "jumpstart," if you will. A reset, maybe? I want to feel more…like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. McNABB. It’s perfectly natural to want to maintain a good quality of life as we age. A “reset,” as you put it, is a good way to think about it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you be a little more specific about what isn’t working as smoothly as it used to?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Where to begin? Well, my energy isn't what it used to be, of course. Simple things tire me out quicker. And my memory… it’s not terrible, mind you, but I do misplace things more often. Just little things, like my glasses or where I put the remote. And honestly, Doctor, I just don’t feel as…bright, as sharp as I once did. It’s frustrating, you know? I used to be so active, always gardening and visiting friends. Now…it takes a bit more effort.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some fatigue and some cognitive changes, primarily with memory. And a general decrease in your overall energy levels. These are all things we can explore. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about how long you've been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It didn’t happen overnight, certainly. I’d say… probably the last six months or so it’s become more noticeable. Before that, it was just…the usual slowing down, you know? A little more tired after a long day. But in the last half-year, it’s been…more persistent. Even with a good night’s sleep, I don’t bounce back as quickly. And the forgetting…it’s definitely become more frequent. It worries me a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It's good you're paying attention to these changes and bringing them to my attention, Ms. McNABB. It’s always best to investigate. Six months is a reasonable timeframe. Now, let’s talk a little more about your current symptoms. Besides the fatigue and memory issues, are you experiencing any other changes?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my appetite hasn’t been the best lately. I used to enjoy cooking, a lot of Chamorro food, you know, but now I don't have much of an appetite. And I've noticed I get cold very easily. Even when others are comfortable, I’m shivering. And… oh, this might sound silly, but my skin feels so dry, always itchy. It’s a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Those are all important details, Ms. McNABB. Loss of appetite, feeling cold easily, and dry, itchy skin. It sounds like we have quite a bit to work with. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any chronic medical conditions that you’re aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, thankfully, not much. My husband, God rest his soul, had high blood pressure, but I've always been pretty healthy. I did have a bit of trouble with my gallbladder a few years back, and they took it out, but that was years ago. Otherwise, no, nothing major. I do take a daily vitamin, just a standard one for seniors, and sometimes I’ll take something for my arthritis when it flares up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major chronic conditions, a history of gallbladder removal, a daily vitamin, and occasional medication for arthritis. Do you recall the name of the arthritis medication you use when your symptoms flare up?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. My granddaughter usually picks it up for me when I ask. It's a little white pill. I think it’s naproxen? Or maybe ibuprofen? It’s one of those… a pain reliever. I’m not very good with names, you see. It comes in a little orange bottle.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McNABB. We can certainly look that up. It's good you're able to tell me what it looks like, that’s very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. I do try to avoid shellfish, not because I'm allergic, but just because I don’t particularly care for it. But no, no known allergies.
DOCTOR: Good, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother lived to be 92, and she was very healthy, mostly. She had a little arthritis towards the end, but otherwise, she was quite strong. My father, though… he had some heart trouble, I believe. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had Alzheimer’s, towards the end of her life. That’s something that worries me a bit, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble and Alzheimer’s. That’s good to know, Ms. McNABB. We'll definitely keep that in mind as we move forward. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history… well, I’m widowed, as I mentioned. My husband, Frank, passed away five years ago. We were married for 62 years, a good life, a very good life. I have three grown children, all living on the island, thankfully. They visit often. I used to be very active in the church, but lately, I haven't been able to get out as much. I enjoy gardening when I have the energy, and I like to read. Mostly mysteries, you know? Keeps the mind sharp.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a full and rich life, Ms. McNABB. And it’s wonderful that you have a close family nearby. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever smoked, or do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh goodness no, I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were terrible for you. And I don't drink alcohol either. Frank, my husband, enjoyed a little beer now and then, but I never cared for it. I prefer a nice glass of guava juice.
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. McNABB. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment to evaluate your reflexes and memory. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Let’s get it done. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just have a seat here, we can get started. Your heart sounds regular, though a little bit quiet. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is slightly elevated but not overly concerning. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. And your memory… it seems a little bit slower, but you are able to recall the objects eventually. Overall, the exam doesn’t reveal anything immediately alarming, but we do need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to check your thyroid levels, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and a complete blood count. We can also do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I want to get to the bottom of this. I'm happy to do whatever it takes. When will I know the results? And… will they be painful? I don't do well with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. McNABB. I assure you, the blood draw will be as quick and painless as possible. It's just a small prick, and our phlebotomist is very skilled. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for the lab to get them back to us. Once I have them, I’ll call your home to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to eat a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and get as much rest as possible. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, and you’ve answered all my questions. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I really do hope we can figure out what's going on. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. McNABB, and we will do everything we can to help you feel better. I’ll have the lab order ready for you, and you can go there at your convenience. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good rest of your day.
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. You too. And… thank you again for being so kind. It puts an old woman's mind at ease.
