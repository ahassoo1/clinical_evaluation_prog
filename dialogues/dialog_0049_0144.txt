DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, honestly? Just… curiosity, I suppose. My neighbor, Agnes, she’s been coming here for years, raving about you. Said I should get checked out, just to be sure. Though, sure about what, she couldn’t quite say. Old woman, bless her heart. I feel fine, really. Just thought I'd see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: I see. A wellness check, initiated by Agnes, your neighbor. That’s… unusual, but certainly not unwelcome. Still, even with feeling “fine,” it’s good to have a baseline. We’ll do a thorough exam, just to be certain everything is as it should be. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That’s a… a long time ago. Let me think. Surgeries… hmm. Well, there was something with my gallbladder, years and years ago. And… I think I had my appendix out when I was a girl? Honestly, it all blurs together. My husband, bless his soul, he always remembered those things. He handled all the paperwork. I mostly just… showed up where I was told. Is that helpful? I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal and possible appendectomy. We can try to access your records to confirm those dates, if that’s alright with you. And don't worry about the details; we'll do our best to piece things together. Any other illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Illnesses... well, I had the flu a few times, I suppose. And a bad cold here and there. Nothing… serious. I mean, I’ve lived a long life, you know? You pick up a bug now and then. I always just rested and drank a lot of tea. My mother always said tea was the cure for everything. She was a very sensible woman. Oh! And I had high blood pressure for a bit, maybe ten years ago? They gave me a little pill for it. Still take it now and then. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: The blood pressure is important, yes. Do you know the name of the medication you take for it?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, I really don't. It's a little white pill. I have a whole bottle of them at home. My daughter, Susan, she fills it for me. I just take one every morning. Honestly, I don't even look at the label. Too much trouble, you know? All those tiny letters... Is it really that important what it’s called? I mean, it keeps my pressure down, doesn't it? That's all that matters, right?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know the specific medication, as different ones have different side effects and interactions. We can likely identify it from your pharmacy records, if you’re comfortable with me checking. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I eat just about anything. I used to love shellfish, but my husband didn’t, so I haven’t had it in years. Not an allergy, just… preference. I remember being stung by a bee once when I was a child, but I didn’t have a bad reaction. Just a little swelling. Honestly, I think people worry too much about allergies these days. My mother grew up on a farm, she ate everything! She lived to be ninety. Perhaps it's the tea... But no, I don't believe I have any actual allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And you mentioned your husband… is he still with us?
PATIENT: Oh… no, dear. He passed away. Five years ago now. Cancer. It was… a difficult time. He was a good man, a very good man. We were married for… oh, goodness, almost fifty years. I miss him terribly. He always took care of all the… details. Like remembering which pills I took and when. It’s just been me since then, mostly. Susan helps out, of course, but she has her own family.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like he was a wonderful companion. It’s understandable that remembering details might be difficult with everything you’ve been through. Now, let’s talk about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! Smoke? Never! My mother would have had a fit. Alcohol… I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not anymore. Doesn’t sit well with me. And recreational… whatever that means? No, dear, I’m a very sensible woman. I take my pills, I drink my tea, and I try to get a good night’s sleep. That’s about it. I certainly don’t go around… recreating. Is that what young people do these days? It all sounds rather exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Good. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, is there anything specific you’re concerned about?
PATIENT: Hmm... Specific concerns? Not really. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but that's just old age, I suppose. And my knees ache when it rains. But honestly, dear, I feel pretty good for my age. I just thought I’d get checked out, just to be sure. Agnes was very insistent. She’s a worrier, that one. Always telling me I should be more careful. Honestly, I think she just likes coming to the doctor. She gets to gossip with the nurses. No, nothing specific. Just a general check-up. As you said, a baseline.
DOCTOR: Very well. A baseline it is. We'll start with some basic vitals—blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and weight. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. It’s a fairly standard procedure. Would you mind stepping on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, all right. Scale it is. I suppose I should have expected that. Don’t mind the weight, dear. It fluctuates. I had a rather nice chocolate cake last week. Susan brought it. It was her birthday. I try to watch my figure, you know, but it's so hard to resist a good piece of cake. Especially Susan’s. She's a wonderful baker.
DOCTOR: 103 kilograms. Alright. And your height is 174 centimeters, according to the chart. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me...
PATIENT: Oh my. Is that high? The blood pressure, I mean. I always worry about that. My mother had high blood pressure too, you know. Though, she lived to be ninety, so I suppose it wasn't too bad. Deep breath, you say? I used to be able to hold my breath for ages when I was a girl. Not anymore, though. Gets harder and harder with each passing year. Is everything alright, dear? You seem very… focused.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, yes. We’ll need to monitor that. And I do hear some mild wheezing in your lungs. Have you had a cough recently?
PATIENT: Oh, wheezing? Is that bad? I have had a little tickle in my throat lately, yes. Just a little something. I thought it was the dust. Susan came over to help me clean last week, and it stirred up a lot of… well, dust. I don’t think it’s anything serious. Just old age, probably. Everything creaks a little when you get older, doesn’t it? My knees, my back, my… lungs, apparently. It's probably just the dust. Really.
DOCTOR: The wheezing is present bilaterally, and there’s some mild rhonchi as well. Your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Let’s take a look at your ears now. Do you have any problems with your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, problems with my hearing? Not really. Though, I do sometimes have trouble hearing Susan when she’s talking quickly. She always talks so fast! And the television… I have to turn it up a bit louder these days. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? Everything gets a little… muffled. I used to be able to hear a pin drop, but not anymore. Is that… necessary? It feels a bit cold.
DOCTOR: There’s some cerumen buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to your hearing difficulties. And I do notice some mild inflammation in the ear canals. Given your wheezing, throat irritation, and the ear inflammation, it’s possible you have a mild upper respiratory infection. However, given your history of high blood pressure and the wheezing, I'd like to be cautious. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An X-ray? And a… blood count? Is something wrong? I thought you said it was just a mild infection. My mother always said doctors like to do too many tests. She always preferred a nice cup of tea and a good rest. X-rays sound… frightening. And blood? I don’t like needles. Honestly, dear, are you sure it’s necessary? Perhaps a stronger cup of tea would do the trick? It always worked for my mother. I’m not sure I like all these tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Calvery. And I assure you, we're not trying to frighten you. However, given your symptoms and medical history, it's important to rule out any potential complications. The X-ray will help us assess your lungs and heart, and the blood count will check for signs of infection and inflammation. It’s a precautionary measure, just to ensure we have a complete picture of your health. We can discuss alternative options if you're truly uncomfortable, but I strongly recommend these tests to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment. As for the needles, it will be a quick prick, and we can numb the area beforehand. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh... detail, you say? Well, I suppose if you insist. But I really don't like needles. Not one bit. My mother used to faint whenever she saw a needle. I inherited that tendency, I’m afraid. So, the X-ray… what exactly does that involve? Do I have to undress? And the blood… how much blood will you take? I get dizzy easily, you know. And will it hurt? Honestly, dear, you're making me very nervous. Perhaps a nice cup of tea before we proceed? It might calm my nerves. I really don't like hospitals. Or tests. Or needles. It all sounds rather dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s go through it step-by-step. For the X-ray, you’ll simply need to remove any jewelry around your neck and chest. You’ll then stand or sit in front of the X-ray machine, and the technician will take a few images. It’s quick and painless. As for the blood test, we’ll only need a small vial – about a teaspoon’s worth. The phlebotomist will clean the area with an alcohol swab, then insert a needle to draw the blood. You might feel a brief pinch, but it shouldn’t hurt. We can have you lie down during the blood draw to prevent dizziness, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. We can also offer you a small snack and some water beforehand. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Calvery, and we’ll take every precaution to ensure you’re as comfortable as possible. Perhaps a cup of tea would be a good idea. Let me see if the nurse can bring us one while we discuss this further. In the meantime, let me explain the possible reasons we're ordering these tests, so you're better informed.
PATIENT: Oh, well, that sounds... slightly better, I suppose. A teaspoon's worth. Not a whole bottle, thankfully. And lying down... that's a good idea. I do get dizzy easily. My mother always said I had a weak constitution. A cup of tea would be lovely, thank you. And explaining the reasons... yes, please. I like to know what's going on. I don't like surprises. My mother always said surprises were the downfall of civilization. So, the reasons... what are we looking for, exactly? Are you worried about my lungs? Or my heart? Or… something else? Is it serious? Please, be honest with me. I may be old, but I can handle the truth. Just… not surprises. And definitely not needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. I’ll be as honest and straightforward as possible, no surprises. Given your age and your symptoms – the mild wheezing, the throat irritation, and the elevated blood pressure – we want to rule out a few possibilities. The most common would be pneumonia or bronchitis, which can cause inflammation in the lungs. However, given your history of high blood pressure, we also want to rule out any cardiac involvement, such as heart failure. The X-ray will help us visualize your lungs and heart, and the blood tests will check for signs of infection, inflammation, and cardiac stress. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's important to be thorough. We're simply gathering information to make an accurate diagnosis and develop the best treatment plan for you. I’ll also be referring you to a cardiologist as a precautionary measure. They can perform a more detailed evaluation of your heart health. Does that make sense?
