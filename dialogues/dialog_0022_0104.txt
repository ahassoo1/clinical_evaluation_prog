DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, I suppose I am here about my throat. It… hurts. It's been hurting for a little while now, I think. Honestly, I don't really keep track of these things. Can we just get on with it? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can definitely get to it. I understand you're busy. Just so I can get a better picture of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: More about the pain? Honestly, it just hurts. Like… when you swallow. And sometimes just… sitting there. It’s not… a good hurt. I work with machines all day, very loud machines, so maybe it's from yelling over the noise? I don't know. It's probably nothing important.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it hurts when you swallow and sometimes even just at rest. And you think it might be related to yelling over loud machinery at work. That’s helpful to know. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Yes. It’s worse at the end of the day, naturally. After a long shift. I've been doing this work a long time, you know. Long, long time. And it’s always loud. I suppose it could be that. But really, I just want something to make it stop hurting.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it’s definitely impacting your daily life. And it’s reasonable to suspect the noise at work is a contributing factor. Besides the pain with swallowing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… what sort of symptoms? I haven't been feeling well, if that counts. Tired, mostly. But everyone is tired these days, aren’t they? I don’t have a fever, I don't think. I haven't bothered to check. Honestly, I just take a couple of paracetamol and try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and taking paracetamol to manage the pain. No fever that you’re aware of. Have you noticed any cough, runny nose, congestion, or any difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? No. Absolutely not. I’m a strong woman. I work with heavy machinery, remember? I don't get… winded. A cough? Maybe a little one, sometimes. But it's just… dust from the factory. Always dust. It’s awful, really. Not a bad cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mild cough that you attribute to dust at work. Have you noticed any swollen glands in your neck, or any changes in your voice – hoarseness, trouble speaking?
PATIENT: Swollen glands? Honestly, I haven't been looking at my neck. I have better things to do than poke around at my neck. And my voice is fine. I can yell just as loud as anyone. Really. It’s necessary at the factory. I don’t think my voice has changed.
DOCTOR: Okay. I appreciate your honesty. Let's do a quick examination of your throat just to get a better look. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I have a schedule, you know. Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won't take long. Please open your mouth for me, and say "Ah". Okay. Your throat is a bit red, and your tonsils are slightly swollen. There’s no visible exudate, which is good. I don’t see any significant swelling in your neck either. I’m going to listen to your lungs quickly, just to rule anything else out. Your lungs sound clear. Now, just take a deep breath in and out for me. Everything sounds clear back here as well.
PATIENT: Clear, clear. Everything is always clear. I told you. It’s just my throat. Is that all? Can I go now? I really need to get back. I have things to… manage.
DOCTOR: Based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you likely have pharyngitis – inflammation of your throat, probably caused by a viral infection. It’s not surprising given your work environment and the symptoms you've described. However, because you've been experiencing this for a while and given your busy schedule, I want to be cautious. It’s important to rule out other possibilities. Would you be willing to do a quick strep test, just to be certain it's not bacterial?
PATIENT: A test? Really? Another thing? Look, I don’t have time for tests. I told you it’s just my throat. I’ve been working with machines for decades. I know what a sore throat is. If it gets worse, maybe I’ll consider a test. But right now? No. Just give me something to make the pain go away and let me go.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and I respect your decision. Given your strong history and the clear lung sounds, it’s reasonable to try a symptomatic approach for now. However, I do want to emphasize the importance of monitoring your symptoms. If you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or if the pain worsens significantly, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest urgent care center. We need to rule out other, more serious causes in that case. For now, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed. Lozenges and warm salt water gargles can also provide relief. Staying hydrated is important as well. I'll document everything we’ve discussed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Ibuprofen. Lozenges. Hydrate. I know what that means. Just… write it down and let me go. I have a factory to run, you know. And honestly, I don’t have time for… this.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This summarizes everything we discussed, along with the recommendations for managing your symptoms. Please don’t hesitate to come back if things worsen. And remember, if you develop a fever or difficulty breathing, seek immediate medical attention. Thank you for coming in today, Tammie. I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Thank you. I suppose. Wasted time. Absolutely wasted time.
