DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Batara, it’s this fever I keep getting. Comes and goes, you know? It’s been happening for... oh, let me think… about three weeks now, I reckon. It's just annoying, really. Not feeling quite right.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, you say. "Not feeling quite right" isn't very specific, Mr. Brege. Is it a high fever?
PATIENT: High? I dunno, Doc. I haven’t actually taken my temperature. My wife, Elena, she usually checks, but she's at bingo tonight. It just feels warm, kinda chills and sweats, then feels normal for a bit. You know, like a regular fever. Nothing crazy, but it keeps coming back. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Honestly, Mr. Brege, relying on how you feel isn’t medicine. We need numbers. But fine. Chills and sweats, coming and going for three weeks… Have you noticed anything else with these fevers?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that you mention it, my back’s been a little sore, lower back mostly. It usually bothers me after I've been doing a lot of work in the garden, but it's been achy even when I haven't. And… I’ve been a little tired, more than usual, I guess. Not sick tired, just… worn out.
DOCTOR: Garden work, lower back pain, fatigue… and recurring fevers. Alright. Any cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no cough. Breathing’s fine. And my stomach's been okay, thankfully. No throwing up or… you know. Nothing like that. Just the fever and the achy back, that's it. Really, it's just bothersome. I got things to do, Doctor. I’m a chiropractor, gotta keep my schedule.
DOCTOR: A chiropractor?
PATIENT: Yeah, I own Brege Chiropractic down on Elm Street. Been doing it for… oh, forty years now. Mostly back pain, neck issues, that kinda thing. Funny, right? I fix backs, and my back's giving me trouble. But honestly, I haven’t had time to get it checked out properly. Been too busy with patients. That's why I'm here, I guess. To get this fever sorted.
DOCTOR: So, a professional who understands the body, yet neglects his own health. Fascinating. Still, self-diagnosis isn't advisable, even for chiropractors. Let's do a quick exam. Lie down on the table, please. We'll listen to your lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your back. And then we’ll take your temperature. It’s amazing what a thermometer can tell you.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. A thermometer. Whatever. Just try to be quick, Doc, if you don’t mind. I got appointments this afternoon. Elena's gonna be mad if I'm late.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. And your lower back… yes, some muscle tenderness here and here. No obvious signs of acute injury. 101.3 Fahrenheit. Well, there’s your number. Not a crisis, but certainly elevated.
PATIENT: 101.3, huh? See? Not crazy. Just a bit warm. So what does that mean, Doc? Is it… a virus? Something I caught? I haven't been traveling, if that matters. Mostly just been working and gardening. Is it serious? I really don't have time for a long illness. Elena needs help with the bingo prizes next week.
DOCTOR: It means you have a fever, Mr. Brege. And 'just a bit warm' is subjective. A low-grade fever for three weeks… it’s not typical. Could be a mild viral infection, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Given your age, and the persistent nature of this, I’m ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. And a chest x-ray, just to be safe. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to know. The lab is across the street. Take this requisition form, and they’ll take care of it. Come back tomorrow with the results.
PATIENT: A chest x-ray? Really, Doc? All this for a little fever? I’m a chiropractor, I understand bodies, okay? And a blood test… honestly. Fine. Across the street. Tomorrow. This is gonna be expensive, isn't it? I don’t even have insurance. Elena’s gonna kill me. .
DOCTOR: The cost is your responsibility, Mr. Brege. A full workup is necessary to ensure an accurate diagnosis. Perhaps we should have addressed insurance before starting. Come back tomorrow with the results, and we'll discuss them. Don't self-treat. And try to relax. Although, given your profession, I suspect that may be difficult. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
