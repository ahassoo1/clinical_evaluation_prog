DOCTOR: Hi Soila, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… my tummy. It feels… big. And I don't want much food these days. Not like before, you know? It just doesn’t taste good.
DOCTOR: Okay, your tummy feeling big and a loss of appetite… and things just don't taste as good anymore. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Changes… oh dear. When did I notice? It’s… fuzzy. Maybe a few weeks? A month? It all blends together, you know how it is when you get old. I think it started slowly. Just not feeling hungry, and then… my pants felt a little tighter. Not a lot, just a little.
DOCTOR: I understand completely – time can definitely seem to blur as we get older. A few weeks to a month… that's helpful. And you've noticed some changes in your appetite and your clothing feeling a bit snugger. Have you had any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. Sometimes I feel a little tired. Just… more tired than usual. And… oh! Sometimes my tummy feels… full, even when I haven’t eaten much. It’s a strange feeling. Not painful, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, and a feeling of fullness even after eating only a small amount. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh, dear. What do you mean? I… I go to the bathroom. Yes. Is that what you ask? I don't know if it's different. Maybe a little? It's hard to remember. Everything feels… slow.
DOCTOR: Alright, “slow” is good to know. And it's perfectly okay that it's hard to remember, we’ll try to figure things out together. When you say slow, does that mean you're having trouble going to the bathroom, or is it more about how often you need to go?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. It’s not trouble going, no. It’s… not as often, I think. Before, I went every day, maybe two times a day. Now, it’s… every other day? Sometimes longer. It's not a big worry, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve noticed a decrease in how often you’re having bowel movements – going from daily or almost daily to every other day or longer. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in the color or consistency?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear, no! Not that I know of. No, no blood. It looks… normal, I think. Maybe a little… lighter color? But I don't pay much attention. It all looks the same to me after a while. And… consistency? What does that mean? Is it too hard? Too soft?
DOCTOR: Alright, no blood is good to hear. Consistency just means how firm or loose it is. Is it usually soft, formed, or hard?
PATIENT: Oh… Usually… formed, I think. Like little… sausages? That's a nice way to say it, yes? But lately, it’s been… softer. Not watery, just… not as firm. Like… mashed potatoes, maybe? Is that a good comparison?
DOCTOR: Mashed potatoes is a perfect comparison, thank you! So, softer stools recently, along with the loss of appetite and feeling of fullness. Now, have you had any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Oh my. I don’t know. I haven't been weighing myself. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? But that could be from… everything. I don’t eat as much, so I suppose I might have lost a little, but I don't worry about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, clothes feeling looser, potentially some weight loss, but you haven’t been weighing yourself. That's good information. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical… history. Oh dear. That’s a long time ago. I had… something with my heart, many years ago. But the doctor fixed it. I think. And… my blood pressure, sometimes it’s a little high, the nurse tells me. But mostly, I’m fine. I’ve always been a strong woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of a heart condition that was treated, and sometimes high blood pressure. Do you know the name of the heart condition?
PATIENT: Oh… no. Not anymore. The doctor… he said a long word. It was many years ago, in Russia. I don't remember. It was fixed, that’s all that matters. They gave me pills, and I felt better. I don't remember the name of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's okay. Sometimes details fade over time. And you mentioned high blood pressure – are you currently taking any medications for that, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Yes, I take a pill for my blood pressure. A small white one. And… sometimes a little pink one for my water. The nurse gives it to me. I take them every morning with my tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill for blood pressure and a pink pill for “water” - likely for swelling. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don't think so. I eat everything. I used to grow all my own vegetables, you know. And I’ve never had any trouble with pills. Sometimes they make me a little sleepy, but that's all. I don't think I'm allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… history. Hmm. My mother… she had trouble with her heart, I think. And my father… he got very old. Very, very old. But I don’t know what he died of. We didn’t talk much about sickness, in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mother with heart trouble, and a father who lived to a very old age. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? What does that mean? I live alone. I used to work, a long time ago. I was a… a sociologist. I studied people. It was very interesting. Now, I mostly stay home. I read. I watch television. I have a few friends, but they are… also old.
DOCTOR: Alright, you're retired, used to be a sociologist, and enjoy reading and watching television. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh no, no smoking! Never smoked a cigarette in my life. And… sometimes a little glass of wine with my dinner. But just a little! It helps me relax. Not every day, just… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, and occasional light alcohol consumption. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes that is fine. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just be gentle, my bones are old.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. I’m hearing some crackling sounds in your lungs, mostly at the bases. Now, I’m going to listen to your tummy. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly distended, and it’s a bit tender when I press here on the left side. No masses that I can feel. Pulses are weak, but present. There's some mild swelling in your ankles and feet. Everything else seems normal on initial exam. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Oh dear. All of that… It sounds serious. Crackling lungs? Distended tummy? What does that mean, Doctor? I just feel… tired and full. And my tummy feels big. Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be worried, Soila. Let me explain. The crackling in your lungs could indicate some fluid buildup, which can happen with age or certain heart conditions. The distended tummy means it’s a little bit bigger than usual, and the tenderness suggests some inflammation. Those findings, combined with your symptoms of loss of appetite, feeling full quickly, and weight loss, raise some concerns. Given your age and history, and the findings on the exam, I suspect we're dealing with a few possibilities, including fluid retention, possibly related to your heart, or a digestive issue causing bloating and discomfort. It could also be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray. The blood tests will help us evaluate your kidney function, liver function, and rule out any infection. The chest X-ray will help us see if there's any fluid in your lungs or any other abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood tests and an X-ray… It sounds… a lot. But… if it helps you figure out what’s wrong, yes. Yes, that’s alright. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to feel better. And maybe eat a little something without feeling so full.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Soila. We’ll take things one step at a time. I'll write up the orders for the blood tests and the X-ray now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and then we’ll schedule you for the X-ray. It should be a relatively quick and painless procedure. While we wait for the results, I recommend sticking to smaller, more frequent meals, and avoiding foods that make you feel bloated. Also, let’s make sure you’re getting enough fluids. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Smaller meals… that’s good. I will try. Um… how long will it take to get the results? And… will it hurt? The tests, I mean.
DOCTOR: That's a great question. The blood test results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. The X-ray results should be available within a few hours. As for whether it will hurt, the blood test is just a quick prick of the needle, which most people barely feel. The X-ray is completely painless. You’ll just need to stand or sit still for a few moments while the technician takes the pictures. I’ll call you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. I just hope it's not something too bad. I’m getting old, you know. It’s hard to… fix things when you’re old.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. We'll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Getting older doesn’t mean things can’t be improved, and we have many options available. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood, and she can also go over the instructions for the X-ray with you. Thank you for coming in today, Soila. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll talk soon.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You too.
