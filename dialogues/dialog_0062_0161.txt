DOCTOR: Hi Helaina, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, honestly? A friend suggested I come talk about… PrEP. She said it was a good idea, just to be safe. I don't really know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright! It’s great that your friend mentioned it, and it’s very smart of you to come in and learn more. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a medication to help prevent HIV. It’s a really good option for folks who want to lower their risk. To make sure it’s the right choice for you, and to see if you're a good candidate, I’m going to ask you a few questions, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Questions are fine. Honestly, I just want to… you know, do the right thing. I've lived a long life, and I’d like to keep it that way. Ask away.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a very sensible approach. First, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I mean, I'm 55, so things creak a bit, you know? My knees aren’t what they used to be. But no doctor has ever told me I have anything serious. I have Medicare, so they check things regularly. I had a checkup last year and everything was normal, I think. I can’t remember exactly what she said, but she didn’t mention anything worrying. I do take a vitamin D supplement, though. The doctor said I was a bit low.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. “Creaky knees” are common at 55! And it’s helpful that you’ve been keeping up with regular checkups and taking vitamin D. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. That’s about it. And… oh! I broke my wrist when I was maybe ten, but that healed up fine. Nothing else. No hospital stays or anything like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just the usual colds and flu over the years.
DOCTOR: That’s great. No major surgeries or hospitalizations is definitely a good thing. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – has any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had heart problems when he got older. He smoked for a long time, so that didn't help. I have one brother, and he’s healthy as a horse, as far as I know. We don’t talk that much, so I don’t always know what’s going on with him. No kids of my own. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Knowing about your parents' health conditions is good information. Now, this is a bit of a sensitive question, and you absolutely don’t have to answer if you’re not comfortable, but to determine if PrEP is right for you, I need to ask about your sexual history. Specifically, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. That… um. Yes. I am. I'm single, you see, and… well, I have a few… friends. It’s not something I usually talk about. I just… I like company, you know? And I’m careful. I always use protection. But… that's it, really. Is that enough information? I’m not… I don't want to get into details. It feels a bit personal.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You’ve given me enough information. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t want to go into details, and I respect your privacy. Knowing that you are sexually active is what’s important right now. Now, just to finish up with some background information, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. I don’t have any food allergies. I’m a bit sensitive to dust, but that’s just a sniffle, you know? And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times over the years, and pain relievers for headaches, but nothing serious. No, I can’t think of any allergies at all. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies is helpful. And you are lucky, it sounds like! Okay, so we've covered a lot of ground. Just to be sure, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – besides that vitamin D supplement?
PATIENT: No, just the vitamin D. I don't really like taking pills unless I have to, you know? I try to eat healthy and get enough sleep. That’s usually enough. No, no other medications. I’m pretty good about avoiding them.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure there aren’t any immediate concerns. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m trusting you, Doctor. I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing, you know? And I’d like to get this all sorted out as quickly as possible, if that’s alright. I have a… a lunch date later.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand wanting to be mindful of your time. We’ll move as efficiently as possible. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. 130 over 80. That’s a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. We can keep an eye on it. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Heart rate is regular. Alright, and just a quick check of your abdomen… No tenderness or abnormalities. Everything feels normal. Now, I’ll just check your reflexes… Those are good and strong. Everything looks good overall. Your vitals are stable, and the physical exam didn’t reveal any immediate concerns.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s… that’s a relief. So… what does this all mean? Am I a good candidate for… for this PrEP thing? I'm not getting any younger, you know. And I want to be careful. What are the next steps?
DOCTOR: Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, you do appear to be a good candidate for PrEP. There are a few key factors that make it a good option for you: you're sexually active, you haven't had any concerning medical conditions revealed in your history, and the exam didn't reveal anything that would contraindicate its use. However, to be completely sure, we’ll need to do some blood tests. We need to check your kidney function, liver function, and, most importantly, test you for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. We also need to confirm your HIV status – it’s important to know you’re HIV-negative before starting PrEP. Assuming those tests come back negative, we can discuss starting PrEP. It’s a daily pill, and it’s very effective at preventing HIV when taken consistently. We'll also talk about safe sex practices and regular follow-up appointments to monitor your health and ensure the medication is working properly. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood tests. That’s… fine. I don’t love needles, but I can handle it. As long as it's not too much trouble. And I promise to take the pill every day, if you think it’s a good idea. I just want to be safe. How long will the tests take? And will I have to come back here, or can I go somewhere else? I have a… a schedule, you know. And I'd like to get this sorted out quickly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand wanting to get this sorted out quickly. The blood tests are pretty standard, and they shouldn't take long – maybe 15-20 minutes. We can do the blood draw right here in the clinic, so you won’t have to go anywhere else. The results usually come back within 3-5 business days. We'll call you as soon as they're available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and, if everything looks good, start you on PrEP. In the meantime, it’s important to continue practicing safe sex. And if you experience any unusual symptoms – fever, rash, fatigue – please don't hesitate to call us. Does that all sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Three to five days. I can wait. And I’ll definitely continue being careful. Okay. Let’s get the blood tests done. I just… I’m glad I came in. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. And you’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. I’m glad I could help. It's always good to be proactive about your health, and you're taking a very positive step. Let me just have the nurse come in and draw the blood. She’ll get you all set up. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions at all, even after you leave today. Nurse Patel, could you please come to room 3 for a blood draw?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything for now. I'll just wait here for the nurse. And I'll try not to worry too much. It's just… a lot to take in, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It is a lot to take in, and it's perfectly normal to feel a bit anxious. Just remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Please, just relax and let the nurse take care of you. I’ll be right next door if you need anything.
