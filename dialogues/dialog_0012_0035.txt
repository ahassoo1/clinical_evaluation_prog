DOCTOR: Hi Mirriam, it's so nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. They just won’t go away! Started a couple of days ago, and they’re… persistent, to say the least. Not painful, just… annoying. Really annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent hiccups, that is frustrating. A couple of days, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Started Tuesday, I think it was. Yes, Tuesday. I was having tea with old Mrs. Patel, and then hic… there they were. We were talking about her grandson, lovely boy, going off to university… and hic… wouldn’t stop. Still going now, as you can hear.
DOCTOR: Right, so they started mid-conversation on Tuesday while you were visiting Mrs. Patel. And they’ve been pretty constant since then?
PATIENT: Pretty constant, yes. Not every second, mind you. They come and go, but they always come back. I tried holding my breath, like my mother used to tell me, and drinking water upside down… all the old tricks. Nothing seems to work. It’s just… tiring, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s definitely tiring when something like that just won't resolve. And you've already tried some good home remedies. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Not that I've noticed, really. I was gardening yesterday, bending over a lot, maybe that? But I garden all the time and it’s never bothered me before. I did have a rather large plate of spicy curry on Monday… could be that? Though I eat curry fairly often too. Honestly, Doctor, I’m stumped! It just came on for no reason that I can figure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gardening and curry are possibilities, but you don’t usually find either one triggers them. And they just started Tuesday seemingly out of the blue. Besides the hiccups themselves, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, no other symptoms. Just the hiccups! No pain, no shortness of breath, no… well, nothing else. I feel perfectly fine, other than being a bit… jumpy, I suppose, from all the hic… unexpected bursts. Appetite’s good, sleeping alright… Everything else is normal. Which is why I thought I should come see you, really. It’s just so odd!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no other symptoms accompanying the hiccups. Okay. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I’m just glad someone is taking a look at this! It’s a bit silly, I know, being bothered by hiccups, but it’s really starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your abdomen is soft. Neurologically, everything seems normal as well. Blood pressure is 140/85, pulse is 78 and regular. Nothing immediately jumping out at me on the physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear! Everything sounds alright, that's a relief. Allergies… let me see. No, I don’t think so. I had a bit of a rash once when I used a new hand cream, but that was years ago. Nothing serious. No known drug allergies, no. I can take most things, I think. Though I prefer not to, if I can avoid it!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies, that’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I try to stay away from pills if I can. Just a bit of turmeric in my tea sometimes, for the joints, but that’s it. I like to keep things natural, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And just turmeric occasionally. Now, I'm thinking this is likely a benign, self-limiting issue – hiccups can sometimes just happen. However, since they've persisted for a couple of days, I'd like to rule out a few other possibilities. Have you had any recent changes in your diet, besides the curry?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I’ve been eating my usual things. Fish and vegetables mostly, lots of fruit. I did try a new brand of mango chutney last week, but that was before the hiccups started. And I didn't eat much of it, to be honest. It wasn't very good. I stick to what I know, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major dietary changes. Given your age and the fact that you have no other symptoms, I’m not overly concerned, but just to be safe, I'd like to order a simple blood test. It will check your electrolytes and kidney function – sometimes imbalances can cause persistent hiccups. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. If it will put my mind at ease, absolutely. Blood test sounds perfectly fine. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. It’s good to be thorough, isn’t it? And perhaps it will finally explain these pesky hic… hiccups!
DOCTOR: Yes, it's always best to be thorough. Okay, I’ll get the lab order sent over. You can go to the lab just down the hall. It shouldn’t take too long. While we’re waiting for the results, I'd recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids. And if they continue after a week despite the fluids, or if you develop any new symptoms – like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or abdominal pain – please call the office immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Plenty of fluids, and watch out for any new symptoms. I will do that. Thank you so much for taking the time to look at this. It’s a bit silly, being bothered by hiccups, but I was starting to get worried. I appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. It’s never silly to address your concerns. We want to make sure everything is alright. And honestly, persistent hiccups can be a sign of something else, so it’s good you came in. Let’s get that blood test done, and we’ll go from there. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I feel much better now, just knowing we’re looking into it. Thank you again for your time and your patience. And thank you for not thinking I was being silly!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. And definitely not silly at all. Just let me know if anything changes, or if you have any questions down the line. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day!
PATIENT: .
