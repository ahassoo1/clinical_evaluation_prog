DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It is lovely to meet you as well. Well… it’s my legs. They bother me something awful at night. Cramping, you see. Just…cramp right up. It wakes me. It’s been going on for… oh dear. A while now, I suppose. I don’t rightly recall when it started, but it’s not new.
DOCTOR: I understand. Leg cramping that wakes you at night can be very disruptive. It’s good you came in to discuss it. You mentioned it’s been going on for a “while now.” Could you describe the cramping for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… a tightening. A hard squeeze, mostly in the calf, I think. Both legs, usually. Not always at the same time, but… both of them get it. It just… hurts. A sharp ache. I try to stretch it out, wiggle my toes… sometimes that helps a little. But it always comes back. I don't know why it happens. It just… does.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so clearly, Ms. Bilstein. A sharp ache and tightening in both calves, often relieved somewhat by stretching. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger these cramps?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Triggers… that's a good question. I don't think so. Not that I've noticed, anyway. I try to walk every day, if the weather is nice. And I drink plenty of water… or at least, I try to. Maybe… maybe if I sit for too long? But I don't sit that much. I really can't say. It just happens… randomly, I suppose. It's very confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Bilstein. Random occurrences are often the most difficult to pinpoint. Now, let’s try to get a bit more information. Beyond the leg cramps, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, my feet do get cold sometimes. Even in the summer. And… I get a little breathless if I climb the stairs. But I've always been a little breathless going up stairs! I’m an old woman, Doctor. Things just… ache a bit. Is that what you mean? I don’t feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… old.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Bilstein. It’s important to distinguish between normal changes with age and something that might need attention. Cold feet and shortness of breath with exertion are good things for us to discuss. Now, regarding your medical history, do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. I saw a doctor many years ago… when my husband was still alive. He checked me over, but I don’t rightly recall what he said. I think… I think he said my blood pressure was a little high, once. But he gave me a little pill for it, and I took it for a while. But I stopped, eventually. It didn’t seem to make much difference. And… no, I don’t have anything else that I know of. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. Aside from these legs, of course. And the stairs.
DOCTOR: Thank you. It’s helpful to know that you were told your blood pressure was elevated at one point, and that you discontinued medication. And no other diagnosed medical conditions. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. Surgeries… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing major, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, but that was so long ago, I hardly remember it. And… I was in the hospital once, when I broke my wrist. Fell off a ladder, trying to reach some peaches. But that was decades ago. Just a simple break, they set it and I healed right up. Nothing else that I can recall. Honestly, Doctor, I've been very lucky.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Bilstein. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or problems with circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… now that’s a question. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She tired easily, and she passed away when she was quite young. And my brother… he had swelling in his legs, near the end. But I don’t know what caused it. We didn’t have doctors like we do now, back then. Things were different. Everyone just… got old and passed away. It was sad, but… that’s just how it was. I don’t know if that’s helpful. It’s all very vague, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Bilstein. A family history of heart weakness and leg swelling gives us some important information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your daily habits. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not me. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband used to smoke, but I always made him go outside. And alcohol… well, I might have a little glass of sherry on Christmas, but that’s about it. I don’t care for it much, honestly. I prefer a nice cup of tea. And I try to eat a healthy diet… lots of fish, and vegetables from my garden. I’m a Tlingit woman, Doctor, we respect the land and take care of ourselves. That’s what my grandmother taught me.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Bilstein. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Now, one last question regarding your background. Do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I’ve taken a few pills over the years, for headaches and colds, but nothing ever bothered me. My skin is a little sensitive, sometimes, but that’s just from the sun. I’m very careful to wear a hat and sunscreen when I’m outside. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. I’m a pretty simple woman, Doctor. I don’t need much to make me happy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bilstein. That was very thorough. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulses, and take a look at your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had a good check-up in… well, a very long time. It's probably a good idea. Just… try not to poke too hard, dear. My bones aren't what they used to be. But do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bilstein. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, take a deep breath in for me… and out… good. Again… and out. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. We’ll need to keep an eye on that. Your lungs sound clear. Your pulses are a little weak in your ankles, but present. Now, I’m checking your legs. I do notice some slight discoloration of the skin on your lower legs, and a little swelling around your ankles. Your calves feel firm. Do you experience any pain when I gently press here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's a little tender. Not terribly painful, but… a bit uncomfortable. Right there, on the back of my calf. It feels… tight. Like a knot. It's probably the same place where the cramping happens, I think. It's been like that for… oh dear, I don't know how long. A long time. It doesn't bother me all the time, just when you press on it. And when I walk too far, sometimes. But I try not to overdo it. I'm an old woman, you know. I have to pace myself.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Bilstein. Flexibility seems slightly limited in your ankles. Alright, Ms. Bilstein, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms related to peripheral artery disease, or PAD, combined with some venous insufficiency. The weak pulses in your ankles, the discoloration of your skin, and the swelling suggest reduced blood flow in your legs. The tightness you feel in your calves could be related to muscle fatigue and cramping from the reduced circulation. The murmur I heard in your heart could be contributing to this as well. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Peripheral… artery… disease? That sounds… serious. And venous… insufficiency? I don’t understand, Doctor. I’m just an old woman with cramping legs. Is it something bad? Will I have to have surgery? I've never had surgery before, and I don’t want to have surgery. I just want to be able to walk to the garden again without my legs hurting so much. Is that too much to ask? I don’t understand all those medical words. Could you… explain it to me in plain English?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bilstein. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed by medical terms. Let me explain it in plain English. Your arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood away from your heart to your legs and feet. When you have peripheral artery disease, those arteries become narrowed, making it harder for blood to flow. Think of it like a garden hose that's partially clogged. It still lets some water through, but not as much as it should. That reduced blood flow can cause cramping, especially when you’re active. It also causes the symptoms you're experiencing like the discoloration and swelling. Venous insufficiency is when the veins – which carry blood back to your heart – don’t work as efficiently. It’s like the drain in the bathtub being a little slow. It causes the swelling and discomfort. Now, it’s important to remember that many people have some degree of PAD and venous insufficiency as they get older. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need surgery right away. We can often manage it with lifestyle changes and medication. Would you like me to explain the options for treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes a little more sense, dear. A clogged hose… I can picture that. And a slow drain… yes, I’ve had those! So, it’s not all bad, if we can manage it? That's a relief. Lifestyle changes… what does that mean? Do I have to give up my garden? And medication… what kind of medication? I don’t want anything that will make me sleepy or confused. I need to be able to think clearly. I’m an old woman, but I still have my wits about me, thank you very much. Could you tell me a little more about what we can do? Just… take it slow, dear. My head is spinning a little.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bilstein. We will take it slow. It’s perfectly alright for your head to be spinning a little – it’s a lot to take in. Lifestyle changes primarily mean making some adjustments to improve blood flow. That includes regular, gentle exercise – walking is excellent, but we’ll start slowly. We’ll focus on short walks and gradually increase the distance as you feel comfortable. It doesn’t mean giving up your garden – it means taking breaks and avoiding prolonged standing or heavy lifting. And it’s very important to avoid smoking, if you haven’t already, and to maintain a healthy diet. Regarding medication, there are several options. We can try a medication to help improve blood flow to your legs. There’s also medication to help reduce swelling and manage any pain. And, depending on the results of some further tests, we might consider a medication to prevent blood clots. None of these should make you sleepy or confused, but we will start with a low dose and monitor you closely. Before we start any medication, however, I’d like to order a couple of tests. An ankle-brachial index, or ABI, is a simple test that measures blood flow in your legs. And I’d also like to do a blood test to check your cholesterol and overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, I suppose so. As long as they don’t involve needles. I don’t like needles. Not at all. And as long as they don’t take too long. I have to get back to my garden, you know. The tomatoes are ripening, and I don't want them to go to waste. Ankle-brachial… index? That sounds complicated. What exactly will they do? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to wait weeks and weeks. I need to know what's going on soon. And if it turns out to be something serious… well, I don’t want to think about that right now. But I do want to know. Just… please take it slow, dear. And explain everything clearly. I’m an old woman, but I’m still a smart woman. I just need a little time to understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bilstein. I completely understand. We will take it very slow, and I will explain everything clearly. The ankle-brachial index is very simple and doesn’t involve any needles! It's a non-invasive test where we measure the blood pressure in your arms and ankles using a cuff, just like when you have your regular check-up. The technician will compare the readings to see how well the blood is flowing in your legs. It takes about 15-20 minutes. The blood test will also be a simple draw, but it does involve a needle. However, it’s usually very quick, and the phlebotomist will be gentle. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back from the lab. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, continue with your routine as much as possible, but listen to your body. If you experience any pain or discomfort while walking, take a break and rest. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. No needles for the index test is good. And a few days for the blood test… I can wait. As long as you promise to explain everything clearly when the results come back. I’ll try to listen to my body, but sometimes I get carried away in the garden. The tomatoes are my pride and joy, you know. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it. Just… please don’t use too many medical words when you call. I’m an old woman, and my head can only handle so much. I think… I think that’s all for now. Unless you have any other questions for me?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. I’m happy to help in any way I can. And I promise to explain everything in plain English when the results come back. No medical jargon, I assure you. And no, I don’t have any other questions for you at this time. I’ll have the nurse schedule the tests for you before you leave. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable before you head home?
PATIENT: No, dear, I'm alright. Just a little tired, I think. All this talking… it's been a bit much for an old woman. Thank you again, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease, at least a little. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I think I'll just go home now and have a cup of tea. And maybe tend to my tomatoes. Thank you. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And enjoy your tea and your tomatoes! Have a good day.
