DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It's been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to become a bit bothersome. I find myself drinking a lot more water than usual, and still feeling quite parched. And I’m always reaching for a snack, even after a proper meal.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry… for a few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly three or four weeks now. It's not constant, mind you, but it happens several times a day. I wouldn't say it's interfering with anything major, but it’s… noticeable. And a bit worrying, to be honest. I just thought I'd get it checked out, rather than let it become a bigger issue.
DOCTOR: And has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been eating… the same sort of things, I suppose. Nothing drastically different. Usual fare – I cook most nights, mostly simple meals. Though… now that you mention it, I have been having a bit more salt than usual, perhaps. Trying to keep up my energy levels, being on my feet all day at the warehouse. Does that sound foolish?
DOCTOR: Not foolish at all. Increased salt intake could contribute, though it’s rarely the sole cause. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I’ve noticed, no. I suppose I've been a bit more tired than usual, but I put that down to the long hours at work. And maybe a little… irritable. But honestly, Doctor, I’m not one to dwell on such things. Just trying to get through the day, you understand. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Fatigue and irritability… potentially. Have you noticed any changes in your urination habits?
PATIENT: Urination habits? Well… now that you ask, I have been going to the toilet more often. Especially at night, which is a bit of a nuisance, to be frank. I usually don't have to get up at all, but recently I’ve been up once or twice a night. I thought it was just… getting older, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Increased urination, particularly at night… Right. Let's move on to some medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Nothing serious, anyway. I had a bout of the flu a few years back, and a sprained ankle playing football when I was younger, but that was it. Nothing a bit of rest and a bandage couldn’t fix. My doctor back home – in Scotland, you see – always said I was as healthy as a horse. I’m divorced, if that’s relevant. I have private insurance, thankfully.
DOCTOR: No known medical conditions… Private insurance. Very good. Any family history of… diabetes, perhaps?
PATIENT: Diabetes? That's a good question. My mother had… some sort of trouble with her blood sugar, I think. It was years ago, and I wasn’t terribly involved with her medical affairs, to be honest. She passed away when I was quite young. My father was always fit and healthy, so far as I know. He was a crofter, worked the land his whole life. Not much call for doctors in the Highlands, you see. I’m not sure if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Vague family history… Right. And do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I pride myself on avoiding such things, if I can help it. A bit of paracetamol for a headache now and then, but that's it. I’m not one for popping pills, you understand. Prefer to let nature take its course. Is this… standard procedure, Doctor? I have a rather pressing appointment after this, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Standard procedure, Mr. Erxleben. It’s important to have a complete picture. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you'll permit. Just some basic checks. Blood pressure, pulse, perhaps listen to your heart and lungs. And a quick blood glucose test. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you insist. Though I must say, I feel perfectly fine, apart from the thirst and hunger. A bit of poking and prodding seems… unnecessary, but I suppose I should cooperate. Let’s get it over with, then. Quickly, if you please. I have a delivery to arrange this afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Please have a seat. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Hmm. 210 milligrams per deciliter. That is… elevated. Mr. Erxleben, these results are concerning.
