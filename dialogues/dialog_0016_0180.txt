DOCTOR: Hi Hedy, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have a lot of time. Just... tired. Real tired. And I keep… wanting to eat dirt. It's stupid, I know. Don't ask me why. Just… is there a pill for it?
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. It's good you came in to get this checked out, even if it feels a little strange to talk about. And no, it's not stupid. It's important to figure out what's going on. “Real tired” and craving dirt… those are definitely things we need to explore. Let’s start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling this tired?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. A while. Months, I guess? Hard to say. Everything just… blurs together these days. Longer than it should be, that’s for sure. I used to be able to get things done. Now… forget it. I just want to sit. And sleep. A lot. It's not like I'm doing anything exciting to be tired from anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, months of fatigue… and it's impacting your ability to function. That's significant. And you said it's different than just being tired after a long day?
PATIENT: Different, yeah. Like… heavy. It’s not just needing a nap. It's like… carrying rocks around all the time. And then… this dirt thing. It started around the same time, I think. Maybe a little after. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly. It’s embarrassing. Don't tell me I have some kinda… deficiency. I eat fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Hedy. There’s no judgment here. And you’re right to want to figure out what's going on. Craving non-food items like dirt – that’s called pica – can sometimes point to underlying issues, like a nutritional deficiency, but it can also be related to other things. Let's talk about your eating habits a little more. You said "mostly" fine... could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Look, it’s not fancy, okay? Coffee in the morning. Sometimes toast. Lunch is usually leftovers if I bothered to make extra the night before. Otherwise, a sandwich. Dinner… whatever’s easiest. Frozen meals, sometimes. I used to cook more… when my husband was alive. Now… what’s the point? I don't really pay attention to what's in it. Just… food. Does that help? I'm not a nutritionist.
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it's understandable that your eating habits may have changed. And it’s good you’re being honest with me. Okay, so we have fatigue and pica, and a change in eating habits… and the loss of your husband. Grief can absolutely affect both appetite and nutritional status. Before we jump to any conclusions, I'd like to ask a few more questions to get a better picture of what's going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and craving dirt?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. I get headaches sometimes. But I always get headaches. So that’s nothing new. And… my hands ache. A little. I thought it was just getting old. I keep losing things too. Not important things, just… stuff. Keys, mostly. But the memory thing… is getting worse. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if there's something wrong with my brain.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, hand aches, losing things, and memory issues… Those are all things we need to consider. It's good you brought those up. It is possible something is going on, and we’ll definitely investigate. Now, I’m going to ask some questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… the usual old lady stuff. High blood pressure, maybe? I forget. I had a doctor once, but… it’s been a long time. He retired. And then… well, after my husband… I didn’t bother with doctors. What’s the point? They just tell you you’re getting old.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you haven't had regular medical care in a while. That's okay. We can start from scratch. High blood pressure is something to be aware of, though. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. And… something with my appendix? A long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, it was so long ago I barely remember. I don’t even remember the names of the doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and possibly appendectomy. We'll note that down. Now, can you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history? That's a long story. My mother… she had arthritis, real bad. And my father… heart problems. I think. They’re both gone now. Lots of old people problems, I guess. Look, can we just get to the point? Is there a test I can take? A pill I can swallow? I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy, and I want to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. You're right, tests will help. But I need to ask a few more questions first to make sure I order the right tests. To help me understand, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? I live alone. I used to have friends, but… they moved away or… passed on. Now I mostly just stay home. Watch TV. I don't really do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone and mostly stay home. That’s good to know. And just to be thorough, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. My mother smoked, and it killed her. Alcohol… maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. When I'm feeling… lonely. Not every night. Just… when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Except maybe… people. Look, can we please get to the tests now? I'm getting a headache just thinking about all these questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. No known allergies. And you're right, let's move on to tests. Given what you've told me – fatigue, pica, changes in eating habits, memory issues, occasional wine, and a history of loss – I want to order some blood work. This will check for things like iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and inflammation. It will also give us a baseline for other potential problems. I also want to do a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and coordination. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The sooner I know something, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… could you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Ugh. Hurry it up, will you? I have things to do. Even if I don’t remember what they are.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are a little diminished. And I’m going to do a quick balance test… could you please stand up and try to balance on one foot for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Woah there! Steady now... See? This is what I mean! Everything is just… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That was helpful. Now, I’m going to write an order for the blood work. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll be expecting you. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It typically takes 2-3 business days for the results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend you try to eat a balanced diet, even if it's just small portions. And if you're feeling lonely, please reach out to someone – a friend, family member, or even a support group. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… get the tests done. And tell me what's wrong with me. I don't want to wait three days. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy. I'll do my best to expedite the results. The lab staff will help you schedule a follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before then. Take care, Hedy. We'll figure this out together.
