DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… Lind-sey, actually. Bohnett. My cholesterol’s been lookin’ a bit high, the nurse said. Got a letter, and she thought I ought to come in and chat about it. Didn't really understand what it all meant, to be honest. Just know it wasn’t a good number.
DOCTOR: Lindsey, right. My apologies. It’s… common for people to get letters without a full explanation, I suppose. "High cholesterol," yes. It's a very common issue these days. And you’re right to get it checked. Can you tell me, has a doctor previously diagnosed you with high cholesterol, or is this the first time you've been told about it?
PATIENT: No, never been told before. Not that I recall, anyway. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course – broken bones when I was a kid, the usual sniffles and aches… But no one ever mentioned anything about cholesterol. This is all new to me, really. I always thought I ate pretty good, too. Lots of fish, you know? My wife always made sure of that.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it can develop at any time. It doesn't necessarily mean you’ve done anything “wrong.” It's often genetic, unfortunately. So, let's try to get a clearer picture. Do you happen to know what your specific cholesterol numbers were?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… No, I don’t think so. The nurse just said it was too high, and gave me this appointment. I’m terrible with numbers. Always have been. My wife, bless her, she handled all that sort of thing. She used to say I couldn't even balance a checkbook. Is it important what the numbers were?
DOCTOR: It is important, actually. "Too high" is rather vague. There are different types of cholesterol—HDL, LDL, triglycerides—and the specific levels tell us a lot about your risk. Fortunately, I have your lab results here. Okay, let’s see… Your total cholesterol is 245, LDL is 160, HDL is 35, and triglycerides are 180. Does that mean anything to you?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Those just sound like… numbers. You might as well be speakin’ Swedish for all I know! Is that… bad? Is it really high? I don't want to start takin’ a lot of pills if I don't have to. My wife, she had a bad reaction to some medication once, and I swore I’d avoid ‘em as much as possible after that.
DOCTOR: Yes, those numbers are… elevated. Your LDL, the "bad" cholesterol, is quite high. Ideally, we want that below 100, and yours is at 160. Your HDL, the "good" cholesterol, is a little low – we like to see that above 40. And your triglycerides are borderline high. So, it's not just one number, it's the whole picture. Now, before we even discuss medication, let's talk about lifestyle. Are you currently exercising?
PATIENT: Exercising? Well… not really. Not anymore. Used to walk a lot with my wife, down by the lake. But she passed, oh, it’ll be five years this November, and I haven't really kept up with it. I mostly just potter around the house, you know? Watch a bit of television. I used to enjoy gardening, but my back’s been botherin’ me lately, so I don't get out there much either. Mostly just sit. It’s… lonely, doing things by myself.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss makes it difficult to maintain routines. Alright. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, my wife always made sure we ate well. Lots of fish, vegetables… not much fried food. Since she's been gone… I admit, I haven't been as disciplined. I eat a lot of frozen dinners, to be honest. Easy, you know? Don’t have the energy to cook for one. And I do enjoy a biscuit with my tea in the afternoon. Maybe two. Don’t tell her. She’d have a fit.
DOCTOR: Right. So, primarily frozen meals, limited exercise, and… some biscuits. Look, Mr. Bohnett, with your cholesterol levels and your current lifestyle, you are at increased risk for heart attack and stroke. We need to address this, and frankly, relying on medication alone is not the best approach. It's about more than just the numbers; it’s about your overall health. Are you willing to consider making some changes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Heart attack and stroke… that doesn’t sound pleasant at all. Well, I don’t want those, that’s for sure. I suppose… I suppose I could try. It’s just… hard, you know? Getting old isn’t easy. My back aches, I get tired… and I really enjoy my biscuits. But… if it’ll help me stay healthy… yes. I’m willing to try. What sort of changes are you thinkin’? Something… not too strenuous, I hope.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll start small. First, we need to drastically reduce the frozen meals and biscuits. Focus on fresh fish – salmon, tuna – at least twice a week. Plenty of vegetables. Small portions. We'll aim for a 30-minute walk, three times a week, even if it’s just around the block. And I want you to start a food diary, so we can monitor what you’re eating. I'm going to refer you to a registered dietitian. They can help you create a meal plan that's tailored to your needs and preferences. Now, I'm not saying you can never have a biscuit again, but it needs to be a very occasional treat. And I’m going to prescribe a low-dose statin to get your cholesterol levels under control. It's not a high dose, but it will give us a head start while you make these lifestyle changes. I’ll also order a repeat cholesterol test in three months to see how you're progressing. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a lot. A dietitian… another doctor? And a statin… is that a pill? What sort of side effects does that have? I don’t want to feel sick all the time. My wife always said pills are the worst, and she was usually right. And thirty minutes… can I break that up into smaller walks? My back, you know… it doesn’t like long stretches. And is it alright if I have a biscuit with my tea on Sundays? Just one? It’s… tradition.
DOCTOR: Yes, a statin is a pill, Mr. Bohnett. It’s a very common medication for lowering cholesterol. Most people tolerate it well, but potential side effects can include muscle aches and fatigue. It’s rare, but it's important to be aware of it. If you experience any muscle pain, contact me immediately. Yes, you can break up the walks into smaller stretches. Ten minutes three times a day is fine, as long as you’re getting some activity. And… fine. One biscuit on Sundays. But that’s it. I'm sending a referral to a dietitian now. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. I will also give you a prescription for atorvastatin, 10mg, to be taken daily. We'll recheck your cholesterol in three months. If it’s not improving, we may need to increase the dose of the statin. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Atorvastatin… sounds complicated. What if I forget to take the pill? I’ve got a terrible memory, you know. And… what if I feel bad after I take it? Should I stop takin’ it right away? And… is there anything else I should be doin’? Like… special foods to eat, or things to avoid? I just want to make sure I do everything right. I don't want to end up in the hospital. It’s just… a lot to remember. And I’m an old man, you know. Old men forget things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, I’ve explained everything I can. Yes, if you experience muscle pain or severe fatigue after taking the statin, stop taking it and contact me immediately. As for forgetting, set an alarm, use a pill organizer, ask a friend or family member to remind you. The dietitian will provide you with a detailed meal plan and a list of foods to eat and avoid. I cannot hold your hand through every detail. I’ve given you the information you need. Follow the instructions, and we’ll see where we are in three months. Now, if you don't have any further urgent questions, I need to see my next patient.
