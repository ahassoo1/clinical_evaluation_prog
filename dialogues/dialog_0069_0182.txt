DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, you know. It's about this… procedure. My daughter insisted I get a check-up first. Something about needing “clearance”. Honestly, a waste of time, but here I am. It's a face lift, alright? Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a facelift. I understand. Your daughter is very thoughtful to want you to be fully checked out beforehand, and it is always best to be sure you’re in good health before any procedure. It won’t take long, Mr. Orwin, I promise. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What does that even mean? I’m eighty-one years old! What do you expect? I get a little tired, sometimes. My knees ache. I take a couple of pills. That's about it. I used to be strong as an ox, building floors, but that was… a long time ago. I don’t go around complaining, if that’s what you’re after.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. It’s good you’re generally active, even with some aches and pains. And it’s perfectly normal to have a few things slow down as we get older. "Overall health" just means getting a good picture of everything going on, so we can make sure you’re as healthy as possible for the facelift. You mentioned a couple of pills. Can you tell me what those are for?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. One is for my blood pressure. The doctor – some young fellow, can’t even remember his name – said it was a little high. The other… let me think. Oh, yes. For my cholesterol. Apparently that was “borderline”. Honestly, I feel fine. Never smoked, never drank much. I eat sensible. These doctors just like to give out pills. It’s a racket, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure and cholesterol medications. That's helpful to know. It's good you've been taking care of yourself and it’s very common for those to need attention as we age. I understand your skepticism – we always want to make sure medications are truly necessary. Do you know what your most recent blood pressure and cholesterol numbers were, if you happen to have that information handy?
PATIENT: Numbers? Heavens, no. I don’t keep track of all that… nonsense. My daughter handles all the paperwork. She's very organized, thankfully. I wouldn't know a diastolic from a… a dandelion, probably. She has the latest reports from my check-ups. She'd have the numbers, if you really need them. I don't see why they're so important, though. I feel alright.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Orwin. We can certainly ask your daughter to share those reports with us. It's very common for family members to help manage medical information. Having those numbers would just help us get a clearer picture. In the meantime, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Hmm. Let me think. When I was a boy, I had my tonsils out. That was… a long time ago. And… oh, yes. I broke my wrist a few years back, falling on the ice. Besides that, no. Nothing serious. I've always been a healthy man. Tough as nails, really. Never needed much doctoring, until recently. This whole thing is a bother, frankly. I just want to get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a wrist fracture a few years ago. That’s good to know. It sounds like you've had a pretty healthy life overall, despite the recent attention. Have you ever had any major surgeries besides those?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve never needed major surgery. I told you, I’m a tough man. I’ve had a few stitches here and there, cuts from working with terrazzo… that’s about it. I’ve never been under the knife, and I’m not looking forward to starting now. Honestly, this whole procedure feels… unnecessary. But my daughter… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been very fortunate to avoid major surgery for so long. We'll do everything we can to ensure the facelift goes smoothly and safely. Now, a quick question about family history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Family history... My mother lived to be ninety-two, but she was always frail. A lot of aches and pains, like me, I suppose. My father… he died of a heart attack, I think. A bit of a shock. My sister had some sort of… cancer, later in life, but she didn't talk much about it. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to all that family stuff. Everyone's different, aren’t they? It doesn't really matter, does it? I feel fine. That’s what matters. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: I understand your point, Mr. Orwin, and it's true that everyone is different. Knowing the family history can sometimes help us understand potential risks, but it doesn't guarantee anything. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. My father used to smoke a pipe, but I always hated the smell. No, never smoked. And I don't drink much either. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that's about it. A sensible life, I tell you. A sensible life. Can we please hurry this up? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Orwin. That's very good to hear. A sensible life is a healthy life, indeed. One last question before we move on to a brief physical exam. Are you allergic to any medications or anything else, such as food or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing. Never had any allergies. I eat everything. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’m a very… robust man, as I’ve mentioned. Honestly, I find all these questions… quite insulting, frankly. As if I’m some frail, delicate thing. I just want to get this over with and go home. Are we finished yet?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. No known allergies. I understand your frustration, and I apologize if the questions felt insulting. We ask these things as a standard part of the assessment to ensure your safety. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general health. It won't take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But hurry, please. I really have to go. And don’t poke and prod too much. I’m not made of iron, you know, even if I feel like I am. Let's just get this done.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit back and relax. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound good, Mr. Orwin. Your pulse is strong, and your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. We’ll keep an eye on that. I’ll just take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Everything looks good here as well. Now, just a quick check of your reflexes... Your reflexes are normal, and your muscle strength seems good. Overall, you appear to be in good health for your age. Is there anything else you'd like to tell me before we discuss the next steps?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely nothing. I've told you everything. I feel fine. My daughter just worries too much, that’s all. She’s a good girl, but… well, you know how daughters are. Look, can we just get to the part where you tell me if I can have the procedure, or not? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Based on my assessment and what you’ve told me, you appear to be a suitable candidate for the facelift. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, at 142/88 mmHg. I recommend that you inform your primary care physician about this reading so they can monitor it and ensure it’s well-controlled before the procedure. Would you mind providing me with your primary care physician’s name and contact information?
PATIENT: Fine. It’s Dr. Eleanor Vance. I think her number is… …555-1234. She’s good, I suppose. But she always wants to give me pills too. Honestly, doctors these days… Can we please be done now? I really do have to go. Lunch, you know. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dr. Vance. Thank you. I will send a brief note to her office regarding your slightly elevated blood pressure reading. So, to summarize: you're a suitable candidate for the facelift, pending a review of your blood pressure by Dr. Vance. If she gives you the clearance, we can proceed with scheduling the procedure. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just… how long will the whole thing take? And will it hurt? I don't like pain. And will I look… ridiculous afterwards? My daughter keeps talking about "recovery time" and… it all sounds very unsettling. I just want to look a little… fresher, not like one of those… plastic dolls. Is that too much to ask? Can you promise me I won’t look like a plastic doll?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Orwin. Let’s address them one by one. The procedure itself typically takes between two and three hours, depending on the extent of the facelift. As for pain, we use local anesthesia with sedation to ensure you're comfortable throughout the process. You will likely experience some discomfort afterwards, but we’ll provide you with pain medication to manage it. The discomfort typically subsides within a week or two. And finally, your concern about looking "ridiculous" or like a "plastic doll" is very valid. Our goal is to enhance your natural appearance, not to drastically change it. We focus on a subtle, natural-looking result. We will discuss your expectations in detail beforehand, and we’ll tailor the procedure to achieve a look that is flattering and age-appropriate. We want you to look like a refreshed version of you, not someone else. I can assure you that we have extensive experience in achieving natural-looking facelifts. Would you like to schedule a consultation with our surgical team to discuss the details further and see some before-and-after photos?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. My daughter would want me to. But… I don’t want any pressure. Just… a clear explanation. And I want to see pictures of real people, not those… airbrushed models. And… I want to know what the risks are. Don’t sugarcoat it. I’m a practical man. I need to know what I’m getting into. Can we do that? And… how much will it cost? My daughter handles the finances, but I need a ballpark figure. Honestly, all this is… a bit overwhelming. Can we just get it sorted quickly? I have a golf game next week. I don't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Orwin. We can certainly arrange that. I completely understand your concerns, and we’re happy to provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision. We'll schedule you for a consultation with Dr. Ramirez, our lead facial plastic surgeon. During the consultation, she will: Discuss your goals and expectations in detail. Perform a thorough examination of your facial structure. Show you before-and-after photos of real patients with similar facial characteristics. Explain the risks and benefits of the procedure in detail – no sugarcoating, as you requested. Provide you with a detailed cost estimate. We can also discuss a payment plan if needed. The initial consultation is typically around an hour, and there is a fee of $150. How does that sound?
PATIENT: $150… Alright, fine. But I want a guarantee. A guarantee that I won’t look like a… a caricature. And I want it scheduled as soon as possible. The sooner this is over, the better. And tell Dr. Ramirez… no pressure tactics, alright? I don’t like being pushed. Just the facts. That’s all I want. Can you get that arranged? I’m really trying to be cooperative here, but this is… a lot. And tell her I play golf. I need to be able to see the ball.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Orwin. I understand. I will personally ensure that Dr. Ramirez is aware of your concerns – no pressure tactics, a focus on facts, and that you play golf and need good vision. We’ll make a note about that. I’ll have my assistant schedule you for the earliest possible consultation with Dr. Ramirez. I believe the next available appointment is Wednesday at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Wednesday at two… Alright. Fine. Wednesday at two. But if she tries to upsell me anything… I’m walking out. And tell her… I want a natural look. Emphasize that. Just a little… freshening up. Not a whole new face. Here. Is there anything else I need to do now? I really do have to go. Lunch is waiting. And here's my insurance information. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Orwin. I have everything I need. My assistant will contact you to confirm the appointment and provide you with any necessary pre-operative instructions. We appreciate your cooperation, and we look forward to seeing you on Wednesday. If you have any questions before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good lunch and a pleasant afternoon.
