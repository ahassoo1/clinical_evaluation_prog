DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's very nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… about the cancer. I was told to come speak with someone.
DOCTOR: Okay. “About the cancer…” Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t… I don’t really know what kind it is. My husband… he handled all the appointments and stuff. He passed away last month, and after that… things are just a bit blurry. I got a letter saying I should follow up, but I haven’t really had anyone explain it to me since then.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's a lot to deal with, and it's completely okay that things are unclear right now. Losing your husband must be incredibly difficult. We’ll take our time and figure this out together. Do you recall where you were receiving cancer care?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is… hard. We went to… the big hospital in Phoenix. I think it was… St. Joseph's? He liked Dr. Ramirez there, a long time ago. I wasn't always with him for those appointments though. Mostly just drove him.
DOCTOR: Okay, St. Joseph's. Let me see… Ah, yes, I see a record here for a Chellsea Lucht, date of birth matches… It looks like you were diagnosed with Stage 1 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the breast, approximately six months ago. It was treated with a lumpectomy, and then radiation therapy. Does any of that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Breast cancer… yes. That does… sound right. A lump… and then the surgery. And… the machine. It didn’t feel good. Radiation… yes, that’s what it was. Six months ago… around February, maybe? I'm sorry, I just… it was a lot at the time. I was trying to be strong for him, too.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense that you were focusing on your husband. That’s perfectly alright. It’s not a test, Chellsea. We're just trying to get a clear picture of what happened. The letter you received was likely a follow-up reminder. Standard protocol after cancer treatment is regular check-ups to monitor for recurrence. Right now, I’d like to get a good understanding of how you’ve been feeling since the radiation ended. Have you noticed any changes?
PATIENT: Well… things felt sore for a long time. Still do sometimes, if I move a certain way. And… my arm on that side feels a little… heavy, like it’s harder to lift. Nothing too bad, just… noticeable. I haven't really told anyone, because I didn't want to worry them. It feels silly, compared to… everything else. I've also been… very tired. More tired than usual, even for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, soreness, heaviness in the arm, and fatigue. Those are all important things to note. The soreness and heaviness can be common side effects of radiation, even months after treatment ends, and fatigue is very common as well. It doesn't sound silly at all, Chellsea. These things can significantly impact your quality of life, and we want to address them. To get a better understanding, can you rate your fatigue on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no fatigue at all and 10 being the worst fatigue you can imagine?
PATIENT: Hmm… on a scale of one to ten… I’d say… maybe a six? Some days it's better, but others… I just can't seem to get going. It's not like I'm sick tired, just… really, really drained. I have to nap almost every afternoon. I used to be able to get everything done. Now… it’s hard to even make dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: A six is significant. And it’s helpful to know it fluctuates. It sounds like it's definitely impacting your daily life. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your surgical site, feel the lymph nodes in your armpit, and assess your range of motion. I’ll also listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. I just… want to feel normal again, if that makes sense. I don’t know what normal is anymore.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. It’s okay to not know what “normal” is right now. We’ll work towards that together. Okay, your surgical site looks well-healed, with no signs of infection. There’s some expected tenderness to palpation, but no new lumps or masses. Your lymph nodes feel slightly enlarged on that side, but they are soft and mobile. That’s not necessarily cause for alarm, but we’ll keep an eye on them. Your range of motion is a little limited, which is likely contributing to the heaviness you’re feeling. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I'm also going to check your blood pressure and pulse now. Blood pressure is 120/80, and pulse is 72.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… good? I guess? I don't really understand what all of that means. The limited range of motion… that makes sense, I haven't been using my arm much. I just… get tired trying to. What happens now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is good. Those are all within normal limits. Everything seems consistent with expected post-treatment changes. Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. It sounds like you're experiencing some ongoing side effects from the radiation and surgery – the soreness, limited range of motion, and fatigue. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any other potential causes of your fatigue, like anemia or thyroid issues. It's a routine precaution. We can also get an X-ray of your shoulder to get a better look at the bone and rule out any fractures. I think physical therapy would be very beneficial for your range of motion and strength. They can teach you exercises to help regain function in your arm. Finally, I'm going to prescribe a low-dose medication to help with fatigue and overall well-being. It's not a cure-all, but it can sometimes provide a little extra support. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: That… yes, that sounds reasonable. Blood work and an x-ray… okay. And physical therapy… I think that would be good. I don't like feeling so weak. A medicine for the tiredness… that sounds good too. Will the medicine make me feel… sleepy? Because I already feel so tired. I don't want to be more tired.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. The medication I’m thinking of, it's called methylphenidate, it can sometimes cause sleep disturbances, especially when you first start it. But we start with a very low dose, and we can adjust it if needed. It's more likely to improve your energy levels and focus. We'll monitor you closely, and if you experience any significant side effects, we can stop it or reduce the dose. It’s not a guarantee, of course, but it's worth trying. I’ll write you a referral for physical therapy, and the orders for the blood work and X-ray. I’ll also give you a prescription for the methylphenidate, and we can discuss any concerns you have about it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. I… I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And for not making me feel like I'm silly for being tired all the time. I think… I think I understand everything now. Thank you. What should I do first? Get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. And you are absolutely not silly for being tired. It's a very common side effect, and it's important to address it. Yes, I recommend getting the blood work done first. The lab is just down the hall, and you don’t need an appointment. Once you have the results, you can schedule an appointment with me to review them. We can also discuss setting up physical therapy at that time. I'll print out the lab orders, the referral for physical therapy, and the prescription for you now. Do you have any questions before I do?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you again, Doctor Beinborn. You’ve been very kind. I… I feel a little better, knowing there’s a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. It's my pleasure. Remember, we’re a team, and we’ll work through this together. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. Here are those papers. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
