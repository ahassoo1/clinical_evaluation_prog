DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Let's get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Memmolo. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue, though I believe your file already has that information. I am here today regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks and other protective equipment. I have some difficulties with them, and I was hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps a suitable alternative. I understand this is a sensitive topic, and I appreciate you taking the time to hear me out.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, these… accommodations. Right. So, you're having trouble with the masks at work. What specifically is the trouble?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s not that I want to have trouble. I understand the need for safety, truly. But the masks… they make it difficult to breathe, and it causes a great deal of anxiety. I work with vulnerable people, and I need to be calm and focused to provide the best care. The feeling of restriction… it affects my concentration. I've tried different types, the paper ones, the cloth ones, even the tighter-fitting N95s. They all seem to have the same effect, unfortunately. It feels like… like I’m being suffocated, a little. It also makes it difficult for the people I work with to understand me when I’m speaking.
DOCTOR: Anxiety, you say. And difficulty breathing. Have you been formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven't been formally diagnosed with anything. I’ve never really needed to see a doctor about it before. I’ve always been a strong, independent person. But this mask situation… it's brought it to the surface, you could say. It’s a new feeling, this level of… panic. It’s not something I’m used to, and it's interfering with my ability to do my job effectively. I feel a sense of… confinement, and it causes me a good deal of distress. I'm not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no prior history. And this is solely related to the mask requirement. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I need to listen to your lungs, check your oxygen saturation, and take your blood pressure. It’s standard procedure. Sit back.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need to rule things out. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I appreciate you taking the time to do a thorough examination. Please, proceed at your own pace. I’ll just sit here, and do my best to relax. Though, if you don't mind, could you tell me what you're listening for specifically? Just so I have a better understanding of what's happening.
DOCTOR: I'm listening for any wheezing, crackling, or diminished breath sounds. Essentially, anything that would indicate a respiratory issue. And the oxygen saturation just confirms you’re getting enough air. Blood pressure is just a baseline. It's…routine. Deep breath… and again. Okay. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Oxygen saturation is 98%. Lungs sound…clear. No obvious abnormalities. So, physically, you seem fine. Which, frankly, makes this more…difficult.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. I suppose it is frustrating when things aren't easily explained. I appreciate you being so thorough, even when it doesn't yield a clear answer. I've always been a healthy individual. I spend a lot of time outdoors, maintaining my physical well-being. I walk several miles each day, and I eat a balanced diet. This anxiety… it truly feels like something new, something triggered by the mask itself. Perhaps it’s a psychological response? I’m not sure I have any experience with such things, truthfully. I’m a Protective Service Worker, I spend my days assisting others, not… examining my own feelings. Is there anything else you would like to check?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Knabenshue, I'm a medical doctor, not a therapist. You’re describing symptoms of… anxiety. And honestly, it sounds like you're experiencing a situational anxiety response. There's no medical reason preventing you from wearing a mask. I can write a note recommending you see a psychologist. They can help you develop coping mechanisms. But I won't be signing off on a medical exemption. It’s not appropriate.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. And I appreciate you being honest with me. I suppose I was hoping for a different outcome, but I respect your professional opinion. It’s… disheartening to hear, but I realize you must adhere to certain medical standards. A referral to a psychologist… that’s something I hadn’t considered. I suppose it’s worth exploring. If you could provide me with a list of practitioners in the area, I would be very grateful. I’ve never had to seek such assistance before, and I’m unsure where to begin. Would Medicare cover such services, do you know? I would, of course, want to ensure it’s financially feasible. I just… I want to continue to be able to provide the care my clients deserve, and I want to do so safely, for everyone involved. Perhaps with some professional guidance, I can overcome this…obstacle.
DOCTOR: Here. List of psychologists who accept Medicare. I have no knowledge of their individual practices, it’s simply a list. As for coverage, you'll need to verify with your insurance provider. I can't provide financial advice. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Memmolo. That is very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to compile that list for me. I will certainly follow up with them and inquire about coverage. No, I believe that is all for today. I apologize for taking up so much of your time. I understand you have other patients waiting. I appreciate your honesty and professionalism, despite my… unusual situation. Thank you again for your assistance. .
DOCTOR: Right. Have a good day. .
