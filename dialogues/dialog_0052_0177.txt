DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Shely, you say? Hmm. Well, it's...down there. Something's not right, you know? It's…leaking. A little bit, anyway. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. It's kinda gross, if you wanna know the truth. I haven't been with anyone for...well, a long time. So it's not like a regular thing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Genard. Thank you for sharing that with me. It takes courage to discuss these things, and I appreciate your honesty. When you say "leaking," could you describe that a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, courage? It's just...it's there. And it's wet. Not like when you pee, not that color. More…cloudy. And kinda smells a little funny. Not bad bad, just…different. You know? I don't know what else to tell ya. I haven't noticed any pain or anything, thankfully. Just…the wetness. And the smell. It’s been going on…a few days, maybe? I lose track, you see. Old lady problems.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Genard. It's helpful to have that detail – that it's not the same color as urine and that there's a noticeable odor. And you're right to mention the lack of pain; that's important. A few days… approximately. Okay. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, dear. That's...a long time ago. I don't really go to doctors much. Never have, really. I used to have a doctor back on Guam, but that was…ages and ages ago. I think I had the measles when I was little. And maybe chickenpox. But nothing serious. I'm pretty tough, you see? I don't get sick easily. I had a baby a long time ago, a son. He's…gone now. But that was a normal birth, as far as I remember. I don't take any medicine regularly, and I'm not allergic to anything that I know of. Does that help? I'm not good with dates and names these days.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Genard, thank you. Knowing you haven’t had significant medical issues in the past is important. And I understand it’s difficult to recall details from a long time ago. Just to confirm, you said you had a son who has passed away. I’m very sorry to hear that. And you’ve never had any surgeries or been hospitalized before?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital. Not for anything serious, anyway. I broke my arm once when I was a teenager, climbing a mango tree. But it just needed a cast. They fixed it right up. And no surgeries. Never needed those. Just the cast, that's all. It was a long time ago. This leaking…is it something bad, Doctor? Is it catching? I don’t want to be…you know…sick with something awful. I live alone, you see. Don't have anyone to take care of me if I get really sick.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Genard, especially living alone. It's good you're being proactive about this. Based on what you've told me so far, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing the leakage, but it doesn't sound like a contagious condition. There are several possibilities, and we’ll need to do a gentle examination to get a better understanding. To begin, could you tell me about your current living situation?
PATIENT: Oh. An examination? Well, I live in a small apartment, downtown. It's kinda noisy, but it's safe enough. I have a little balcony, where I grow some flowers. I like to sit out there and watch the people go by. I mostly keep to myself. Don't have many visitors. It’s…lonely, sometimes. I don’t…I don’t really do much. Just watch TV and read. And worry, I guess. Mostly worry. This examination…will it hurt? I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know. I'm a delicate flower, even if I am old.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension, Ms. Genard. I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. The examination will be a visual inspection and a mild pelvic exam. I will explain each step before I do it, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. It's important to rule out any potential causes for the leakage, and this is the best way to do so. Before we proceed, could you please tell me if you are currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. Well…no. Not for…a very long time. Not since my husband… passed. It's been…decades. A long, long time. I haven't even thought about that sort of thing in years. It’s…not something I do. It’s a private matter, you know? But no. Definitely not. It's just...this leaking is embarrassing enough without having to talk about all that. I just want it to go away. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Genard, that is not too much to ask at all. And I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. It's important for me to ask these questions to get a complete picture of your health, but I understand your privacy is paramount. Okay, thank you for sharing that. Now, with your permission, I would like to perform a quick physical examination. We’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and finally, perform a gentle pelvic exam to assess the source of the leakage. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. All that? Listening to my heart and lungs…that sounds…intrusive. And the pelvic exam…I really don’t like the sound of that. But…I suppose if it’s the only way to find out what’s wrong… I don’t want this to just keep happening, you know? It's embarrassing, and I worry it might be something serious. Alright. But please…be gentle. And tell me what you're doing every step of the way. I get nervous easily. And if it hurts…I want to stop. Can we do that? If it hurts, I stop?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Genard. You are in control, and we will stop immediately if you experience any discomfort. I will explain everything before I do it, and you can tell me to stop at any time. First, let's take your vital signs. I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm to check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not overly concerning. Your pulse is 72, and your temperature is 98.6, which are both normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, if you're comfortable, we can proceed with the pelvic exam. Would you like a moment to prepare?
PATIENT: A moment…yes. Please. It’s just… I haven’t been…down there…in so long. I’m rusty, you see. And it feels…vulnerable. Is there…a gown or something? I don’t want to be…exposed. And will you have to…look directly at it? That sounds awful. I know it’s your job, but…it's still embarrassing. Please just be quick, Doctor. And gentle. Very, very gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. I completely understand your concerns. Please take your time. Yes, we have a paper gown available. You can change in the private room over there. You can keep your underwear on for the exam, and we'll provide a drape to cover you as much as possible. I will only examine the external areas and do a gentle internal exam. I will explain each step before I do it, and I will only expose what is necessary for the examination. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please take all the time you need to get changed. Let me know when you are ready, and I will return. You can also ask the nurse to stay with you during the exam if that would make you more comfortable.
PATIENT: The nurse? Oh…that might be nice. Yes, please. Ask the nurse to stay. It makes me feel…less alone, you see. And tell me again…what exactly are you looking for? Is it something awful? Is it…cancer? I don't want to hear bad news. I'm old. I don't think my heart could take it. Just…please be honest with me, but be gentle. And have the nurse stay. Please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Genard. I will ask the nurse to stay with you during the examination. Having someone there for support is perfectly fine. To answer your question, I’m looking for any signs of infection, inflammation, or abnormalities in the vaginal and pelvic area. The leakage could be caused by several things – a urinary tract infection, a vaginal infection, or weakening of the pelvic muscles. It’s also possible that it's related to hormonal changes, which are common as we age. While it's important to rule out all possibilities, including cancer, it is not necessarily what we’re looking for. We will perform a thorough examination and, if necessary, order some tests to get a clear diagnosis. I will explain everything to you step-by-step, and we will discuss the results together. I promise to be honest and gentle with you, and we will work through this together. Let me get the nurse, and then we can proceed when you're ready. Would you like me to give you a moment alone before she comes in?
PATIENT: Yes. A moment alone. Please. It's okay. It's just an examination. But what if it is something awful? What if I'm too old to…fight it? I wish my son were here. He always knew how to calm me down. Oh…this is awful. Just breathe. Just breathe. Okay. I think…I think I'm ready. But tell the nurse to be gentle, too. Very, very gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. I’ve asked Nurse Anya to assist us today. She’s here to provide support and help make you feel more comfortable. Nurse Anya, this is Ms. Genard. Nurse Anya: "It's lovely to meet you, Ms. Genard. Dr. Shely has explained everything, and I'm here to help in any way I can. Just let me know if you need anything at all.” Now, if you're ready, we can begin. You can lie down on the examination table, and we’ll cover you with a drape. Remember, you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. Just relax, and take deep breaths. We will do our best to make this as comfortable as possible. Do you want me to explain the steps again before we start?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. Explain it again. I need to know what’s going to happen. I get scared easily, you see. It's just… being down there…it feels so…vulnerable. And I don't want any surprises. What exactly will you do? Will it hurt? Will it be quick? And will you tell me everything you see? Even if it's bad? Just tell me everything. And please…be gentle. Very, very gentle. And if it hurts…I want to stop. Can we agree on that? Stop immediately?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Genard. We absolutely agree on that. Stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. Your comfort is my top priority. Let me explain the steps again. First, I’m going to ask you to lie down on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the table. We’ll cover you with a drape to keep you warm and maintain your privacy. I will begin with a visual examination of your external genitalia to check for any signs of redness, swelling, or discharge. Then, I will gently insert a speculum – a small instrument – into your vagina to visualize your cervix. This may cause some mild pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately, and we can stop. After that, I will perform a gentle internal examination with my fingers to assess the size and shape of your uterus and ovaries. Again, this may cause some mild pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. The entire examination should only take a few minutes. I will explain everything I'm doing before I do it, and I will tell you everything I see. If I find anything concerning, I will discuss it with you and recommend further testing. Nurse Anya will be here throughout the entire examination to provide support and reassurance. She will also assist with draping and provide any assistance you may need. Before we begin, do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A speculum? That sounds…awful. Will it hurt? I’ve heard stories…about things hurting. And what if you find something bad? Will you tell me right away? Even if it’s…cancer? I don’t want to be kept in the dark. I need to know the truth, no matter how bad it is. And can I…can I ask the nurse to hold my hand? I think I need to hold someone's hand. Just…to get through this. And please…be quick. Very, very quick. And gentle. Remember…stop immediately if it hurts. Can we all agree on that? Stop immediately?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Genard. We all agree. Stop immediately if it hurts. That is my promise to you, and Nurse Anya's. The speculum can feel a little uncomfortable, especially if you’ve never had one before. But it shouldn’t be painful. We use a warm, lubricated speculum to minimize any discomfort. If you feel any pressure or pain, please tell me immediately, and we will stop. We can also take breaks if you need them. I understand your concern about finding something bad. I promise to be honest with you about anything I find, even if it’s not good news. I will explain everything in detail and discuss all of your options with you. We will work together to make the best decision for your health. And absolutely, you can ask Nurse Anya to hold your hand. That’s a wonderful idea. Nurse Anya?
PATIENT: Nurse Anya: "Of course, Ms. Genard. It's my pleasure. Squeeze my hand as tightly as you need to. We're here for you, and we'll get through this together." Okay…okay. But…what if I need to…pee? Will that be embarrassing? I have a weak bladder, you see. And what if…what if I cry? I get embarrassed easily. Just…tell me everything you're doing, step-by-step. And don’t rush. And remember…stop immediately if it hurts. Can we all agree on that? Stop immediately? This is awful. Just…awful. But I need to know. I need to know what’s wrong. But please…be gentle. Very, very gentle. And stop immediately if it hurts. Can we all agree? Stop immediately?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Genard. We all agree. Stop immediately if it hurts. That is my unwavering promise. It is perfectly okay if you need to pee during the examination. We can pause at any time for you to do so. It won’t be embarrassing at all. And it’s perfectly okay if you cry. Many women feel anxious during this examination, and it’s perfectly normal to shed a few tears. We are here to support you, and we won’t judge you in any way. I will explain everything I'm doing before I do it, step-by-step, and I will pause at any time if you need me to. We will take things at your pace, and we will work together to make this as comfortable as possible. Now, if you’re ready, I’m going to ask you to lie down on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the table. We’ll cover you with a drape to keep you warm and maintain your privacy. Then, I will gently begin the examination. Take a deep breath, Ms. Genard. You are doing great. And remember, we’re here for you, every step of the way.
PATIENT: Okay…okay. But please…be quick. Very, very quick. And gentle. And remember…stop immediately if it hurts. Can we all agree? Stop immediately? This is awful. Just…awful. But I need to know. I need to know what’s wrong. But please…be gentle. Very, very gentle. And stop immediately if it hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. I am now going to gently insert the speculum. I will warm it and lubricate it first to minimize any discomfort. This may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. If you feel any discomfort at all, please tell me immediately, and we will stop. Just breathe deeply, Ms. Genard. You're doing great. I’m just getting a better look now. Is that alright?
PATIENT: No…no, it’s…it’s cold! And…it hurts! Stop…please…stop! It’s too cold! And it’s…it’s uncomfortable! Please…please…stop! I can't…I can't do this! It hurts! Stop!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. I'm stopping right now. I'm so sorry. That was not comfortable, and I apologize. You are absolutely right to tell me to stop. I understand this was very uncomfortable for you, and I apologize again. We are not going to continue this examination right now. Is it okay if we discuss other options for getting to the bottom of what’s going on?
PATIENT: Other options? I don’t want any other options! I just want it to be over! I just want to know what’s wrong, but I can’t…I can’t do this! It hurts too much! And…and I’m embarrassed! I just want to go home! I just want to be left alone!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. I understand. It’s okay. You don’t have to do anything you’re not comfortable with. And it’s perfectly okay if you want to go home. I apologize again for the discomfort you experienced. We will not continue with any further examination today. Let’s get you cleaned up and dressed, and then we can discuss some alternative options for getting to the bottom of this, if you’re open to it. If not, that’s perfectly fine too. Nurse Anya, could you please help Ms. Genard get cleaned up and dressed?
PATIENT: Just…just let me go home. I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t want to see another doctor. I just want to be left alone.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. We will absolutely respect your wishes. Let’s get you dressed, and then we can arrange for a ride home. Before you go, Ms. Genard, I want to give you my card and the number for my office. If you change your mind and decide you want to explore other options, or if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call. I apologize again for the discomfort you experienced today. I wish you all the best. .
PATIENT: Just…just leave me alone now. I just want to go home.
