DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa, yes. Fifty-nine, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Fifty-nine. Look, if we could just… get on with it? I have a bit of a schedule today. It’s just… this hearing thing has been worrying me, you see.
DOCTOR: “Worrying” is a broad term. How long has this “hearing thing” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It comes and goes, you know? I… I can’t really put a date on it. Maybe a few months? It’s hard to say. It feels longer, honestly. And then the dizziness… that comes with it sometimes. It’s not every time, but… enough to be unsettling. I just want to know what's causing it, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: “Comes and goes,” right. That narrows it down considerably. So, dizziness with the hearing issue?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It’s like… everything spins for a bit. Not always a bad spin, but enough to make me hold onto something. It usually happens when the hearing gets muffled, but not always. My daughter keeps telling me I should come in, she’s worried about my balance, but… well, you know how it is. I don’t like making a fuss.
DOCTOR: Right, and is this dizziness constant, or is it… episodic?
PATIENT: Episodic, definitely episodic. It doesn’t just… stay with me. It comes on suddenly, lasts a while – maybe an hour, maybe a bit longer – and then it’s gone. Like a wave, almost. And then the hearing comes back, usually. Though sometimes it's not quite as clear as it was before. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Not that I've noticed, really. Sometimes I feel a little off if I’ve been bending over a lot, maybe gardening? But it's not like it always happens then. And sometimes it just… comes on for no reason at all. My late husband used to say I worried too much, and maybe that has something to do with it, but… I don’t know. It just happens.
DOCTOR: Gardening... alright. And any ringing in your ears, Terasa?
PATIENT: Ringing? Sometimes, yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine. Not constant, you understand. Just now and then. It’s usually when the hearing is a bit muffled, or before it goes completely. It's hard to describe. It's not loud, just… there. It's probably nothing, though, isn't it? I've always had sensitive hearing, my mother had the same thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, any headaches, nausea, or vision changes accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no headaches. And I haven't been sick with nausea. My vision’s been… well, it’s not what it used to be, but that’s just getting old, I think. No, nothing like that with the hearing and dizziness. It's just… the spinning and the muffled sound, mostly. It's unsettling, that's all. Honestly, I just want to know if it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's have a quick look in your ears. Just to rule out anything obvious. Then we can figure out what next steps are.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… sensible. I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. My schedule, you see… but please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Just sit here, Terasa. And try to stay still. Hmm. Ear canals look clear. Tympanic membranes are… a little dull. Could be fluid. Alright. And your blood pressure is… elevated. 140 over 90. Have you been stressed lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Elevated? Well, yes, I suppose. Things have been a little hectic since… since Walter passed. And my daughter worries so much, which… well, that stresses me out too, if you follow. Fluid? Is that bad? I don’t understand all the medical terms, you see. Is that what's causing the dizziness?
DOCTOR: “Fluid” can be a number of things. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. Look, it could be something simple like an ear infection, or it could be related to your blood pressure. And stress doesn’t help anything, does it?
PATIENT: No, stress certainly doesn’t help. Walter always said I worried too much. But if it’s not an infection… what could it be? My mother had some trouble with her balance when she got older, but she never went to the doctor much. Is it something… hereditary? I don't want to become a burden to my daughter. She has her own family, you see.
DOCTOR: We can’t diagnose things over a hunch, Terasa. It could be a number of things. I’m going to order a basic hearing test, just to get a baseline. And I’ll write you a referral to an ENT specialist. They can do more in-depth testing and figure out what’s going on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, an ENT specialist? That sounds… serious. I haven't really had many medications over the years. No, no allergies that I know of. Just a bit sensitive to strong smells sometimes. Will the specialist… will they have to do anything unpleasant? I don't like things being poked and prodded, you see. And this hearing test… how long will that take? I have a luncheon with the ladies on Thursday.
DOCTOR: It's better to be thorough, Terasa. The ENT specialist will assess your situation and determine the best course of action. A hearing test is non-invasive; it simply involves wearing headphones and responding to sounds. It shouldn't take more than an hour. I’ll have my nurse schedule that for you. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s all. As long as it won't take up too much time, of course. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… looking into it. I really just want to get back to normal, you see. I suppose I’ll let my daughter know. She worries so much. .
DOCTOR: Right. You’ll receive a call from the nurse. Have a good day. Another one…
