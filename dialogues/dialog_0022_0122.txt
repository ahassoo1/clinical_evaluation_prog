DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Meng Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure, I suppose. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, recently, things have been… slipping. My memory, you understand. It is concerning, especially with my… blood pressure. I do not want to be a bother, so let us be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. Memory concerns can be worrying, and it’s good you’re addressing them. And yes, we’ll certainly try to be efficient. It's not a bother at all, Ms. Alvara; that’s what I’m here for. When you say “slipping,” can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… difficult to explain. Small things, mostly. I will go to put the kettle on for tea, and then… forget why I went to the kitchen. Or I will speak to a neighbor, a very nice woman, and then… the topic of the conversation is gone. Completely. It is not… big things, not yet. But it is happening more and more often. And my husband… he always remembered everything. It is a little frightening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That sounds frustrating, Ms. Alvara, and I can understand why it's frightening. It’s good you're noticing these changes and bringing them to my attention. Forgetting why you started a task, or losing the thread of a conversation – those are definitely things we should investigate. And you mentioned your husband…was he someone who also experienced memory issues?
PATIENT: No, not at all. He had a… a very sharp mind. He was a lawyer, you see. Always remembered dates, names, everything. He… passed away five years ago. A heart condition. That is… why I am concerned about my blood pressure now. The doctor said it can affect… things. The memory, I mean. It is just… a worry, that is all. I do not wish to become… helpless.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Alvara. Losing someone with such a sharp mind must have been very difficult. And you're right to be proactive about your blood pressure; it absolutely can affect cognitive function. We’ll definitely want to get that well-controlled. To help me get a better understanding of what's going on with your memory, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Other than forgetting… not really. I sleep well, I think. Perhaps a little… restless sometimes, but nothing terrible. I eat… normally. I do not feel dizzy. I can still… manage my properties. It is a lot of work, you see. Community association meetings, tenants… everything. I haven’t… misplaced anything important, not yet. I just… feel a little… vague, sometimes. Like a fog. Is that a symptom? I apologize if I am not being clear. It is difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: You’re being very clear, Ms. Alvara, don’t apologize at all. It is difficult to describe these things. Feeling vague or “in a fog” is absolutely a symptom we should take note of. And the fact that you’re still managing your properties is good; it suggests things haven’t progressed significantly. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just the high blood pressure, Doctor. The doctor… my previous doctor, he diagnosed it about ten years ago. I take… a pill. A white pill. I believe it is twenty milligrams. Lisinopril, perhaps? I am not very good with names. And… I had my appendix removed when I was young. A very simple operation. Otherwise, I have been… quite healthy, all things considered. I do not smoke, I drink… a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg for high blood pressure, and an appendectomy in your youth. That’s helpful. And good to hear about no smoking and only moderate alcohol consumption. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Only the Lisinopril. I used to take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but… I stopped. I forget, you see. I simply… stopped taking it. I do not believe it was helping much, to be honest. Just the pill for the blood pressure. That is all. I assure you. I am quite… organized, usually. It is just… this. This memory. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the Lisinopril. It's understandable to have trouble keeping track of things when you're concerned about memory changes. Now, thinking about your family… are there any instances of memory problems or dementia in your family?
PATIENT: That is… a good question. My mother… she was a little… confused towards the end. Old age, the doctors said. She would repeat herself, mostly. And my… Uncle Dimitri, he had some problems as well. He was a very quiet man. I do not remember the details exactly. My father… no, he had a very sharp mind, like his daughter. He was a professor of history. But my mother’s side… yes, there were some difficulties. I apologize if this is not very helpful. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Alvara. Knowing there was some confusion in your mother and uncle's history is definitely relevant. We don’t need perfect details, just a general sense. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask about any allergies you have. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I am aware of. I have never had a… reaction to anything. No food allergies, no allergies to plants, no allergies to… animals. I once had a small rash from a mosquito bite, but that is all. I assure you. I am quite… unremarkable, in that regard. No allergies. Perhaps it is because I live in the city. Everything is… clean.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, Ms. Alvara, I would like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly fine. I understand it is necessary. The sooner we know, the better, yes? I am ready. Please, proceed. I wish to finish this quickly, if you do not mind. I have tenants waiting, you see. But do take your time. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Alvara. We’ll do everything as efficiently as possible. I understand you have tenants waiting. And I’ll take all the time I need to ensure a thorough exam. If you could please sit here, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150/90. We’ll want to address that. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Balance seems stable, though perhaps a little slow. Let's do a quick cognitive screening test now, just a few simple questions to get a baseline. It's nothing to worry about, just a standard part of the evaluation.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will cooperate. A little slow, you say? I am not as young as I once was, you know. But I still manage. Please, proceed with the questions. I trust your assessment. I simply wish to know what is happening. And, if possible, how to… fix it. The tenants can wait a little longer.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Alvara. Age is certainly a factor, and we'll take that into account. I appreciate your patience. This test will just help us get a clearer picture of your current cognitive function. Okay, I'm going to ask you a few questions. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date…? Let me see… It is… August. The second of August. 2025, yes? I believe so. It is a Tuesday, is it not? My neighbor mentioned it this morning. I usually know the date, but… things have been a little… muddled lately. But yes, August 2nd, 2025. I am quite certain.
DOCTOR: That’s right, today is August 2nd, 2025. Good. Now, can you tell me the name of this hospital?
PATIENT: Hospital…? This is… Doctor Tosca's clinic, is it not? I do not believe it has a… proper name. It is a private practice. On Elm Street, near the bakery? I apologize. I did not pay much attention to the name. I simply needed a doctor. Perhaps there is a sign? I am not certain. It is a very modern building, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Alvara. It's not a problem at all. Now, I'm going to show you three words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me. Then, I'll ask you to recall them again later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. I have them. A fruit, a piece of furniture, and a coin. I believe I can remember them. They are… simple words. Though, I must confess, my mind feels… a little foggy. But I will try my best. Apple, table, penny. Do you wish me to repeat them again?
DOCTOR: No, that's fine for now. We’ll come back to those later. Now, I’m going to ask you to subtract 7 from 100, and then subtract 7 again from that answer, and continue subtracting 7 five times. Take your time.
PATIENT: Subtract 7 from 100… that is 93. Then subtract 7 from 93… 86. Subtract 7 from 86… 79. Then… 72. And… 65. One more time… 58. Yes. 58, I believe. It is… a little difficult to concentrate. My mind wanders. But yes, 58. Is that correct? I apologize if I have made an error. Numbers are not my strong suit.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Alvara. You got through it. The correct answer is 55, but it’s not uncommon to make small errors. Now, let's try a simple drawing task. I’d like you to draw a clock, showing all twelve numbers, and set the hands to 10:10. Here’s a piece of paper and a pen. Take your time.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. It is… not perfect, I confess. My hands are not as steady as they once were. But I believe all the numbers are there. And the hands… I attempted to set them to ten ten. I hope it is sufficient. It is… a little crooked. I apologize for the mess. I have not drawn anything in many years.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. This is helpful. Alright, Ms. Alvara, that completes the initial assessment. Based on this examination and the cognitive screening test, your blood pressure is elevated, and there are some mild difficulties with recall, calculation, and visual-spatial skills. The drawing is a bit disorganized, and the numbers are not perfectly placed. These findings are not definitive, but they warrant further investigation. Before we discuss potential causes and a plan, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Further investigation…? What do you mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Is it… what my mother experienced? I do not wish to be… a burden. What are the potential causes? And… what is the plan? I trust your judgment, Doctor, but I need to understand. Is there something I should be afraid of? I apologize for the questions. I am simply… anxious. Please, explain.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Alvara, and I will explain everything as clearly as possible. It's good that you're asking questions. First, let me assure you that I'm not ready to make any definitive diagnoses. These findings could be due to several factors, and it's important to rule out other potential causes before we consider anything more serious. Elevated blood pressure, if left untreated, can contribute to cognitive changes, so addressing that is our first priority. Other possibilities include medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, stress, or even normal age-related changes. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few further tests. These include a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a vitamin B12 and D level, and a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more in-depth cognitive evaluation. They can perform more specialized tests and provide a more accurate assessment of your memory and thinking skills. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It… makes sense. Blood tests, a scan, and a neurologist. To rule things out. Addressing the blood pressure. That is… reasonable. I can agree to that. But… the scan. Is it… painful? And the neurologist… will they… think I am losing my mind? I apologize for the questions. I am simply… frightened. What if it is serious? What if… I become a burden to others? And, if the blood pressure is the cause… how long will it take to… fix it? Can it be reversed? I wish to be… proactive. I do not wish to simply… wait and see.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Ms. Alvara, and I’m glad you’re asking them. The MRI is not painful at all. You’ll lie inside a large machine, and it will make some noise, but it’s a non-invasive procedure. You’ll be able to communicate with the technician at all times. As for the neurologist, they are experts in brain function and cognitive health. They are there to help you understand what’s going on, not to judge you. They will perform a thorough evaluation and discuss the results with you in detail. Regarding your concerns about it being serious, it’s important to remember that we don’t have enough information yet to make any conclusions. Many of the potential causes are treatable. If it is related to your blood pressure, lowering it can often improve cognitive function, although the extent of improvement varies depending on the individual and the severity of the condition. We will work together to get to the bottom of this, Ms. Alvara. I will schedule the blood tests and the neurology referral today. In the meantime, let's focus on controlling your blood pressure. I will prescribe a medication adjustment and recommend some lifestyle changes, such as a low-sodium diet and regular exercise. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds reasonable. Medication adjustment, lifestyle changes, blood tests, and the neurologist. I can do that. I will try my best. But… the results. How long will it take to get them? And… what if the results are… bad? I do not wish to… dwell on it, but I need to be prepared. And… the neurologist. Do you have a recommendation? Someone… gentle? Someone who understands my… anxieties? I apologize for the questions. I am simply… overwhelmed. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, guide me.
DOCTOR: You’re not overwhelming me at all, Ms. Alvara. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when facing uncertainty. I want to address all your concerns. The blood test results typically take 3-5 business days. The neurology appointment may take a few weeks to schedule, depending on the neurologist’s availability. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a personalized treatment plan. Regarding the neurologist, I highly recommend Dr. Anya Volkov. She’s a very compassionate and experienced physician who specializes in memory disorders. She’s known for taking the time to listen to her patients and explaining things in a clear and understandable way. I will provide you with her contact information and schedule an appointment for you. In the meantime, please try not to dwell on worst-case scenarios. We will take things one step at a time. We will address your blood pressure, get the necessary tests done, and then develop a plan based on the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is… all. You have answered everything. You have… calmed me. I am… grateful. Please, schedule the tests and the appointment with Dr. Volkov. I will… do my best to follow your instructions. And… I will try not to worry. Thank you, Doctor Tosca. You have been… very kind. I apologize for the… anxiety. I suppose… I should go check on my tenants now. They are probably… wondering where I am. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. It was my pleasure to meet you. I will have my assistant schedule the tests and the appointment with Dr. Volkov. She will contact you with the details. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And please, don’t worry about the tenants. Take your time. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Take care, Ms. Alvara.
