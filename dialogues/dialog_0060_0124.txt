DOCTOR: Alright, Nykisha. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hi Dr. Nooruddin. It's…it's my skin, mostly. It's been getting darker, you know? And I’ve just been so tired lately. It’s hard to explain, but I just feel worn out all the time.
DOCTOR: Darker skin…and fatigue. Okay. How long has your skin been changing color?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a good question. It’s hard to say exactly when it started, but I think maybe…three or four months ago? It wasn't sudden or anything. Just…gradual. I noticed it more when the weather got warmer, I think. I spend a little time in the garden, you know, vegetables and things.
DOCTOR: Vegetable gardening…right. And where on your body are you noticing this darkening?
PATIENT: Mostly on my arms and face, I think. And my chest a little bit. Not…all over, thankfully. It's not like a sunburn or anything, it’s just…a deeper color than usual. And it feels…normal, you know? Not itchy or painful. Just…darker.
DOCTOR: Okay. And this tiredness…is it all day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty much all day, to be honest. It's not like I can't do things, but everything feels…harder. Like it takes more effort than it used to. Even just getting up in the morning. And I'm sleeping okay, I think. Maybe seven or eight hours. It's just…not refreshing, you know? I wake up still feeling tired.
DOCTOR: Right. And has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! My appetite hasn't been great lately. Not that I’m not eating, but I don’t feel hungry much. And I've noticed I’m a little more thirsty than usual, I suppose. Not a lot more, but enough that I’m drinking more water. Does that…matter?
DOCTOR: It could. Okay. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any health problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe ten years ago now. And I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just getting old, I guess. Nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing like that. I'm on Medicare, so they keep pretty good track of things, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal ten years ago, and some osteoarthritis. The EHR confirms that. Any other surgeries?
PATIENT: No, that was the only surgery I’ve ever had, as far as I know. And I don't take any regular medications, besides a little ibuprofen sometimes for my knees when they really bother me. Just over-the-counter stuff, nothing prescribed. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat all sorts of things, I haven’t had to worry about that. And I can handle most plants in the garden without any trouble, you know, weeds and flowers and things. I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with health problems, like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a tough one. My mother had high blood pressure, I think, but she lived to be pretty old, so it wasn’t too bad. And my father had some trouble with his heart later in life, but I don't know the details. We weren't very close, you see. My siblings…I don't really know much about their health either. We don’t keep in touch much. It's not a very close family, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. Never smoked a day in my life. And I maybe have a glass of wine once or twice a year, if that. Definitely don’t do any drugs. Never have. I try to stay healthy, you see. Gardening helps with that, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better look at things. Can you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Just let me take off my sandals. There you go.
DOCTOR: Alright, 60 kilograms. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Skin is warm and dry. I notice some increased pigmentation on your arms and chest, as you mentioned. It doesn't appear inflamed or irritated. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Some crepitus on range of motion, consistent with osteoarthritis. No swelling or redness.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds…normal, I guess? My knees have always felt a little creaky. I’m glad my lungs are clear, that’s good to hear. What do you think is causing the skin thing? Is it…serious?
DOCTOR: Well, the increased pigmentation, along with the fatigue and decreased appetite, is a bit concerning. While it could be a number of things – and frankly, given your lifestyle, some sun exposure is likely contributing – it could indicate a more systemic issue. To be thorough, I'd like to order some blood work. It will check your thyroid levels, iron, vitamin D, and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any underlying problems. It’s probably nothing serious, but better to be safe.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds…good. I mean, I'm glad you're checking, even if it's probably nothing. Blood work… alright. Will I need to fast before the blood work? And…how long will it take to get the results? I have a little gardening club meeting next week, I was hoping to make it.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. No food or drink, except water. As for the results, it usually takes about three to five business days. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they come in. If everything looks normal, we can discuss ways to manage your fatigue and pigmentation with lifestyle changes. If anything is concerning, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss it further. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Fast for eight hours, and call the nurse in three to five days. I can do that. Is there anything else I need to do before the blood work? Like, should I avoid being in the sun? Or anything like that?
DOCTOR: For now, try to minimize prolonged sun exposure, yes. Wear sunscreen, a hat, and protective clothing. But don't obsess over it. The blood work is the priority. The nurse will give you instructions on how to prepare for the draw when she calls to schedule the appointment. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I think you covered everything. Thank you, Dr. Nooruddin. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me. I’ll wait for the nurse to call.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome. The nurse will be in touch. .
