DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's this...this going to the bathroom thing. Seems like all I do is go, go, go. It's a nuisance, really. Not a big deal, I suppose, but my wife keeps nagging me about it. She says I'm up all night. I don’t rightly remember it being that bad, but women…they notice things.
DOCTOR: Right. Frequent urination. And it's primarily a nighttime issue, according to your wife. How long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time…time gets away from you, doesn’t it? A few months, maybe? Hard to say. It comes and goes, you know? Some nights are worse than others. I just figured it was part of getting older. Everything starts to…leak, eventually. Don’t ask me why, I didn’t go to school for this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: A few months of intermittent increased frequency… Alright. And during the day, is it significantly different?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn’t say significantly. I mean, I go to the bathroom like any other man my age. More than when I was a young buck, naturally. But it’s not like I’m running to the outhouse every five minutes during the day. It's mostly when I'm trying to sleep. Wakes me up, you see. It’s just…irritating.
DOCTOR: Irritating, yes. Okay. Have you noticed any change in the stream itself?
PATIENT: Stream? What do you mean, the…the flow? It goes in, it comes out. Seems normal enough. Not weak, not strong…just a regular stream. I don’t go examining it, Doctor. I just use it. Is there something wrong with it?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No noticeable changes in the stream. And have you experienced any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Burning? Heavens, no. If it burned, I’d know about it. I’ve had my share of aches and pains, believe me, but not that kind. This old body's just full of complaints, but not that one. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I know when something’s wrong, and this ain’t it. Just a nuisance, that's all.
DOCTOR: No pain, no burning. Alright. Let's talk about your medical history, Mr. Segretto. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical…history. Well, I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I’ve had the usual bumps and bruises. My wife keeps all the papers. She’s very organized. I think I had some trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but they gave me a pill, and that fixed it. And my knees, of course. Both of them. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? I don’t recall anything…serious. Not that I remember, anyway. She’d know better than me.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure, managed with medication. And knee issues. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me see… I think I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And they fixed my knee a few years back, but that was just a scope, I think. Nothing major. My wife handled all the arrangements, you see. I just showed up, they poked around, and I went home. I wasn’t really paying attention. It’s all a blur, honestly. A lot of doctors and a lot of waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendectomy, knee arthroscopy. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Medications… Well, let me see. The blood pressure pill, of course. And sometimes, when my knees are acting up, I take something for the pain. A little white one… or maybe it’s yellow? My wife gives it to me. I don't bother with names, too much to keep track of. It helps a little, anyway. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. They just make me feel…sluggish.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life. Pickled herring, sauerkraut, everything. Never had a reaction. Maybe a little heartburn now and then, but that’s just getting old. My wife always asks if I’m allergic to anything before I take something, but I always tell her no. Women worry too much, if you ask me. It’s probably just good sense, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father… he lived a long life, too. Strong man. Worked the land his whole life. I think he had some trouble with his heart towards the end, but I don't rightly remember. And my mother… she was a good woman. She died when I was young. I don’t recall any…fancy diseases in the family, if that’s what you’re asking. Just…old age, mostly. We weren't a family that went to doctors much. We just…dealt with things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family medical history known. Now, tell me a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, eh? Well, I used to smoke a pipe, back in the old days. But I gave that up years ago. My wife didn’t like it. And I enjoy a little glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Nothing fancy. Just a little red wine. And recreational drugs? Heavens no! I’m a farmer, Doctor, not a…a bohemian! I get enough excitement chasing weeds. A good honest life, that’s what I’ve lived.
DOCTOR: Alright. Former smoker, occasional alcohol use. Now, before we move on, is there anything else you think I should know?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, I suppose my wife will be wanting to know what you think. She worries something awful. And I do get up a lot at night, as I said. It’s just…annoying, more than anything. I don't feel sick, I don't have a fever… just…a full bladder. And my knees ache, but what can you do? Old age, I suppose. I don't want to be a bother, Doctor. I just wanted to get this checked out, so my wife doesn't fuss so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Given your age and symptoms, the most likely explanation is benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. That's an enlargement of the prostate gland, which is common as men get older. It can cause frequent urination, especially at night. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a PSA blood test to screen for prostate cancer. We should also do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Urinalysis? PSA…blood test? That sounds…complicated, Doctor. Infection? Cancer? Now you’re scaring me. I just thought it was old age! My wife will have a fit if she hears about cancer. Can’t we just give me a pill or something? I don’t like all these tests. Are they going to hurt? And what if it is cancer? I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, please don’t panic. These tests are routine. The urinalysis is just a simple urine sample to rule out an infection, which can cause similar symptoms. The PSA test is a blood test that can help detect possible prostate cancer, but a high PSA level doesn’t automatically mean you have cancer. Many things can raise the PSA level. We need to get these tests done to get a clear picture of what’s going on, so we can determine the best course of action. The physical exam is just to check your prostate gland – it’s a quick, relatively painless procedure. I understand your concerns, and I’ll explain everything every step of the way. We're being thorough, that's all. Would you be willing to proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Well…if you say it’s necessary. I don’t like all this poking and prodding, but I suppose if it will put my wife’s mind at ease… Alright, alright. Do what you have to do. But be gentle, Doctor. And explain everything, like you said. I don’t understand all that medical jargon. And don’t tell my wife about the cancer part until you know something. She’ll worry herself sick. Just…be gentle. And explain it to me in plain English. Let's get it over with, then. But if it’s bad news…promise you'll tell me straight. I don't want any sugarcoating.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Segretto. I promise to be gentle and explain everything in plain English. And I will certainly be honest with you, regardless of the results. First, let’s get the urinalysis done. The nurse will give you a cup and instructions. Then, we’ll draw some blood for the PSA test. After that, I’ll perform a quick physical exam. Let me call the nurse, and she'll get you started with the urine sample. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: .
