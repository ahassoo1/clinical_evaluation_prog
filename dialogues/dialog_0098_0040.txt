DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain… in my side, you see. It comes and goes, but lately it’s been more frequent. And with the pain, I keep getting these… water infections, the doctor calls them? UTIs, I think. They say it’s something to do with my kidneys. It’s been going on for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, side pain and recurrent UTIs… yes, I see. And you mentioned it's been going on for a while. Could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, not suddenly terrible, but just… there. It’s usually on my right side, lower down, and it feels… full, almost. Like something’s pressing. And it gets worse if I move too much, or if I drink a lot of fluids quickly. It doesn’t radiate anywhere, just stays put, mostly.
DOCTOR: Right side, lower abdominal pain, dull ache, worsens with movement and fluid intake… okay. And you said it feels "full," is that fullness constant, or does it come and go with the pain?
PATIENT: It comes and goes with the pain, I think. When the pain is bad, it’s definitely fuller, more… uncomfortable. When the pain is less, it’s… just a normal feeling, I suppose. Not really noticeable. It’s hard to explain, Doctor. It’s not like a balloon filling up, just… a heavy sensation.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Espinueva. It sounds quite bothersome. And the UTIs… how often have you been experiencing those in the past few months?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It feels like every month, at least. Sometimes more frequent. The doctor always gives me something to take, and it clears it up for a bit, but then it comes back. It’s a bit of a cycle, really. It's… tiring, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That does sound frustrating, a recurring cycle of UTIs. Okay. I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Have you had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting along with the pain or UTIs?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills that I’ve noticed. And no, not really nauseous or vomiting either. Just the pain and the… discomfort with the waterworks, you see. Sometimes a little tired, but I put that down to getting older, mostly. No, nothing dramatic like that, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. And you attribute the fatigue to age. Good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me a while back… about my kidneys. Said I have something called polycystic kidney disease. That's why I'm seeing you, I think? He said the pain and the infections are connected to that. Other than that… not much. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it's been alright since I started taking those little pills.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease and hypertension… yes, that explains a lot. And you are currently taking medication for your blood pressure, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A little white pill, once a day. Keeps things… manageable, mostly. I can’t remember the name of it, I’m afraid. I just take it every morning with my breakfast. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Espinueva. We can look that up in our records. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reasons?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, no surgeries, I don’t think. I had a bit of a bad flu when I was younger, and had to stay in the hospital for a few days, but that was a long time ago. And… oh! I broke my wrist when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree, but they just put it in a cast. Nothing major, you see.
DOCTOR: No major surgeries, childhood wrist fracture, brief hospitalization for the flu. Okay. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do you know of anyone in your family with kidney problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my uncle, on my father’s side… he was always sickly. The doctor said something about his kidneys when he passed, but I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago. And… oh, yes! My sister, she had diabetes, but she lived far away and we didn’t see each other much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of hypertension, kidney problems, and diabetes. That’s helpful to know. And finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not me. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol, not anymore. Used to have a small glass of wine with dinner, years ago, but I stopped that a long time ago. And definitely no recreational drugs! I'm a simple man, Doctor, a quiet life.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Espinueva. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I think it’s time to do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel your abdomen to see if we can pinpoint where the pain is coming from. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain as I do this. …There is mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Abdomen is soft overall, but with some fullness. No masses palpated. Okay. Based on the exam, there is some tenderness in your right lower quadrant, which is consistent with your pain. The fullness I feel could be related to your kidneys. I’m going to order some blood and urine tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll check your kidney function, look for signs of infection, and rule out other potential causes of your pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood and urine tests… alright. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s causing this pain. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for the examination. It’s good to know you’re looking into it properly. Will I need to make another appointment after the tests?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm happy to help. Yes, once the results are back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood samples now, and provide you with a container for the urine sample. Nurse, could you please draw blood for a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and urinalysis for Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Whatever needs to be done. Thank you both for your help.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva, you’ve done very well. Just collect a urine sample when you can and bring it back to the lab before you leave. The nurse will give you instructions on how to do that properly. Once the results are back, my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience a fever, chills, severe pain, or difficulty urinating, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… I hope it’s not something too serious. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel a little better knowing something is being done.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. We’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. It’s good that we’re investigating this now. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get well soon, Mr. Espinueva.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate your kindness. Oh, and Doctor? Could you please remind my staff to send the results to my home address? I don’t have email, you see. .
