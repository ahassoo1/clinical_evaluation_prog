DOCTOR: Hi Dorman, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s… this weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but… little by little. Makes things harder, it does.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A gradual worsening of weakness. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It started in my legs, I think. Just…feeling tired quicker when I walk. Now it’s…up higher. My arms too, sometimes. It’s not pain, not exactly. Just…heavy. Like trying to lift something very big, all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it began in your legs with fatigue during walking, and has gradually spread upwards to include your arms, feeling heavy even without lifting anything. Is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant, I would say. Some days are a little better, but…they are getting fewer and farther between. It’s like…a cloud hanging over me, always there, just heavier some days than others. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Dorman. Thank you for describing it so clearly. And it's helpful to know it's been progressively worsening. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Sometimes my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, and it goes away quickly, but it happens. And…my balance isn’t as good as it used to be. I stumble a little more. My wife, Leilani, has noticed it too. She worries, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and some difficulty with balance. That's important information. Has this blurry vision been in one eye or both?
PATIENT: Mostly in my right eye, Doctor. But sometimes…it’s hard to say, you know? Just a little fuzziness. It doesn’t last long, like I said. A few seconds, maybe a minute. I don’t make a fuss about it, usually. Thought it was just getting old!
DOCTOR: I understand. And it’s good you’re sharing it now. It’s important to mention these things, even if they seem small. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Oh…that. Well, yes. A little. I…it’s hard to explain. Sometimes it’s harder to…go. And sometimes I feel like I don’t empty everything, you know? It’s not every time, but more often than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, some difficulty with both initiating and completing bowel movements. Thank you for being so open, Dorman. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have been told by other doctors…years ago… that I have…Multiple Sclerosis. It was a long time ago, and they didn’t do much for it then. Just told me to…take it easy. I haven’t been to a doctor about it in a long time. And I have…high blood pressure, but I take a pill for that every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of Multiple Sclerosis, diagnosed some time ago, and currently managed hypertension. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… Leilani handles most of that. I believe it’s…Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. A small white pill, I think. I take it every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril daily. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky, that way. I can eat anything, take most pills… never had a bad reaction. Leilani always checks, of course, just in case.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And thank you to Leilani for being so thorough. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. Every day with breakfast. And…sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. But not often. Maybe once or twice a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, a daily multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll check your strength, reflexes, balance, and a few other things. It shouldn’t take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, Dorman, I'm going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. First, with this hand… Good. And now this one. Now, I'd like you to push against my hands with your feet. Push as hard as you can, and let me know when you feel me resisting. Okay, good. Now, let’s check your reflexes… And finally, I’m going to have you stand and walk a few steps for me, and then try standing on one leg for a few seconds. Just to assess your balance. Okay, thank you, Dorman. That was helpful. Alright, based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, your symptoms, including the weakness, blurry vision, balance issues and changes in bowel habits, along with your history of Multiple Sclerosis, are concerning for a possible MS exacerbation. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes, such as a stroke or other neurological conditions.
PATIENT: An exacerbation… that sounds…serious. What does that mean, Doctor? And what will we do now? I’m a little worried, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’re worried, Dorman. An exacerbation, or flare-up, of Multiple Sclerosis means that your symptoms are getting worse. It doesn’t necessarily mean permanent damage, but it does mean the disease is more active right now. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. This will help us see if there’s any new activity in your nervous system. I’ll also order some blood tests to rule out other possible causes, like vitamin deficiencies or infections. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. An MRI and blood tests… if that’s what you think is best, then yes, I’m happy to do it. I just want to know what’s going on, you see. And… hopefully, something can be done to help. Will the MRI… will it be uncomfortable? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. The MRI itself isn’t painful, but you will have to lie very still inside a large machine for about 30-60 minutes. It can be a bit claustrophobic for some people, so if you have any concerns about that, please let me know, and we can discuss options like anti-anxiety medication or an open MRI. The blood tests are quick and easy. As for the results, it typically takes a few days to get them back from the lab. Once I have both the MRI and blood test results, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail and come up with a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, severe weakness, or vision loss, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing… that sounds frightening. Okay, I’ll remember that. No, Doctor, I don't think so. Just…thank you. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for being so patient with an old man like me. One thing… can Leilani come with me to the next appointment? It might be good to have her there. She worries so much, and… well, she remembers things better than I do!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dorman. It's my pleasure. And absolutely, please have Leilani come with you to the next appointment. It's always helpful to have a support person, and as you said, an extra set of ears and a good memory can be very valuable. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you now, and make a note that Leilani will be attending. She can also help with any questions you might have about the MRI procedure or insurance coverage. Do you have any transportation arrangements for the MRI, or will you need assistance with that?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Yes, Leilani will drive me. She doesn't let me drive much anymore, bless her heart. She says my reflexes aren’t what they used to be! I think… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you again, Doctor Morenomartinez. You’ve put my mind a little more at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dorman. It was a pleasure meeting you. And you’re right to have Leilani looking out for you. I’ll see you again soon, once the results are back. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before then. .
PATIENT: It was good to meet you too, Doctor. Thank you for everything. .
