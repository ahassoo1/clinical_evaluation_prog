DOCTOR: Good morning, San. Welcome to San SCIARROTTA. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I’m here for… a card. A driver’s card, I think. For ride-sharing. Or a taxi, maybe? Commercial driver… something like that. I need it to keep doing what I’m doing, and someone said I needed to come see a doctor first. I hope that makes sense. I get a little mixed up with all the paperwork these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, San. It sounds like you need a medical certification to maintain your commercial driver's license, often called a DOT physical. No problem at all, we do those here frequently. It’s just a standard check-up to make sure you’re healthy and safe to drive. To start, can you tell me a little bit about what kind of driving you do?
PATIENT: Oh, DOT physical, that's right! See, I knew it had letters. I mostly drive folks around town. Nothing fancy, you know? Just regular people needing a ride to the store, the doctor… appointments like this one. Sometimes I pick up tourists, too. It’s mostly short trips, not long haul trucking or anything. I’ve been doing it for… oh, goodness, almost ten years now. It helps keep me busy, and I like talking to people.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, San. It sounds like a very fulfilling job. Ten years is quite a long time! Okay, so primarily local passenger transport, short trips. To get started with the exam, I'm going to ask you some questions about your medical history. Then, I'll do a physical exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Questions first, then the exam. I’m ready when you are. I don’t have any big secrets, if that’s what you’re worried about. Just an old lady trying to keep busy.
DOCTOR: No secrets at all, San! This is just standard procedure. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure, yes. The doctor put me on a little pill for that, maybe five years ago? It’s… lisinopril, I think that’s the name of it. And arthritis, of course. Both knees. That’s why I walk with a cane sometimes. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out, oh, goodness, twenty years ago? Everything went fine, though. No problems since. I think that’s it for the big stuff. I get the usual aches and pains, but who doesn’t at my age?
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure managed with lisinopril, arthritis in both knees, and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. Thank you. And have you had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! Yes. A hysterectomy. A long time ago. Maybe thirty years ago? I don’t really remember the details now. It was… routine, I think. No complications or anything. And… I had a small skin tag removed from my neck a few years back, but that wasn’t really a surgery, was it? Just a little snip.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hysterectomy thirty years ago, and a skin tag removal. That’s helpful, thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I eat just about anything. I used to get hay fever really bad when I was a kid, but that went away when I got older. No reactions to any medications that I know of. My daughter always asks, and I always tell her the same thing. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. No hives, no swelling, nothing.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No known allergies is good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the lisinopril?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just the lisinopril, usually. But sometimes I take… ibuprofen for my knees when they're really bothering me. And occasionally, if I can't sleep, I’ll take… Melatonin, I think it’s called? Just a little one. Not every night, though. Only when I’m really restless. That’s it, I promise. I don’t like taking a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril regularly, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and melatonin occasionally for sleep. That's very helpful. Now, to finish up with the history questions, do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… My mother had… diabetes, I think. Type 2, maybe? She was diagnosed when she was older. And my father… he had heart problems. He had a stroke when he was in his seventies. My older brother also has high blood pressure, like me. Seems like it runs in the family, doesn’t it? Nothing else I can think of right now. My sister was always very healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes, heart problems, and high blood pressure. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, do you use tobacco products or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband used to smoke, but I always made him go outside. And I don’t drink either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. But not very often. I prefer tea, you know? Much better for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no tobacco use, and very occasional alcohol consumption. That’s good to know, San. Now, let’s move on to the physical exam. I’m going to start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your vision and reflexes, and do a brief neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. I’ve had plenty of doctor visits in my seventy years. Just let me know if anything hurts, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, San. I will definitely let you know. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, let's check your vision. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Um… E… F… P… T… Okay… R… L… B… V… I think that’s… 20/30 on that line… and then… 20/25 on the next one? It’s a little blurry, Doctor. I’ve been meaning to get new glasses, but I keep putting it off. Old age, you know? Everything starts to go.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s about what I expected. 20/30 in your right eye and 20/25 in your left. It sounds like you would benefit from a new glasses prescription. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Good reflexes, San. Both knees respond normally. And finally, I’ll just do a quick neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. There we go… up and down… left and right… and around in a circle. No problem. I still feel pretty sharp, you know? I do the crossword puzzle every day. Keeps the brain working.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful! Excellent eye movement. And finally, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that tight enough? I try to keep my hands strong, but arthritis makes it a little difficult sometimes. It's not as easy as it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's good, San. A little bit weaker on your left hand, as expected with the arthritis, but overall, everything seems good. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Everything looks within normal limits for your age and medical history. Now, let’s discuss the results and what this means for your DOT physical. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, not really. It all sounds pretty good, doesn’t it? So… can I still drive? That’s the important question. Will the card be approved? I really need to keep doing what I’m doing, you know? It keeps me busy, and I enjoy it.
DOCTOR: Yes, San. Based on today’s exam, I believe you are medically qualified to maintain your commercial driver's license. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but it’s manageable and within acceptable limits with monitoring. Your arthritis is well-controlled, and doesn't significantly impact your ability to drive safely. However, I do have a few recommendations. First, I’d like you to schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to discuss your blood pressure and ensure it remains well-controlled. Second, it would be beneficial to get a new glasses prescription, as your vision has changed. And finally, I recommend continuing to exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I will complete the necessary paperwork for your DOT physical, and you should receive your card within a few weeks. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I already have a doctor, so I can schedule an appointment. And new glasses… well, I’ve been putting that off for a while, so it’s probably a good idea. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I was so worried I wouldn’t be able to keep driving. It means a lot. Is there anything else I need to do? Any forms I need to sign?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I’m glad I could help. Yes, just a few forms. This is the standard DOT medical examination form, and this is a form acknowledging your responsibility to report any changes in your health status. Please review and sign them when you’re ready. Also, here’s a copy of the exam results for your records. And here’s a list of local optometrists if you’d like a recommendation for getting new glasses. Once you’ve completed the forms, I’ll submit them electronically to the DOT. Do you have any questions about the forms or anything else we discussed today?
PATIENT: Okay, I see. This one… and this one… alright, all done. No, I don't think I have any more questions. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. Thank you again for your patience and kindness. I guess that’s everything then? I can go now? I should probably get going before the traffic gets too bad.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything, San. Here’s a copy of the submitted paperwork for your records. You can definitely go now. Please drive safely, and don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. It was a pleasure meeting you, San. Have a wonderful day!
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. You’ve made an old lady very happy. Have a good day as well!
