DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. My name is Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. Well, I received a letter after some tests... a GI endoscopy, I believe it was called? And the results weren’t quite as expected, so my primary physician suggested I come in for a proper discussion. I confess, I wasn’t entirely sure what to make of them myself.
DOCTOR: I see. An endoscopy follow-up. Yes, those reports can certainly be…dense. We'll go over everything together, Ms. Minatra. To start, can you tell me what symptoms led your primary care physician to order the endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, for several months now, I've been experiencing… discomfort. It's a rather vague feeling, honestly. Sort of a burning sensation, mostly in my upper stomach, and some… well, I suppose bloating would be the best way to describe it. And occasionally, a bit of nausea, though I haven't actually been sick. It comes and goes, you understand, but it's been persistent enough to warrant investigation, my doctor felt. I’ve tried adjusting my diet, but it hasn’t made a significant difference, sadly.
DOCTOR: Upper abdominal burning, bloating, intermittent nausea…and no vomiting. You've tried dietary adjustments with limited success. And this has been ongoing for several months now?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. It began, I believe, around… November of last year. It started subtly, just a little indigestion after meals. But it has gradually worsened, though not dramatically. It’s just… constant now, you understand? And it does seem to flare up after I eat, regardless of what I eat, which is rather frustrating. I used to be able to pinpoint certain foods, but that’s no longer the case.
DOCTOR: So, the symptoms are no longer reliably triggered by specific foods, despite your attempts to modify your diet. And it’s been consistently present since November?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. That’s a very good way of putting it. Consistently present, yes. Not severe, mind you. It doesn't interfere with my daily activities, but it's… unnerving. A constant low-level discomfort is difficult to ignore. I am, after all, a rather active woman, and I like to remain so. It’s just… unsettling to have something nagging at me constantly. And, of course, the test results added to my worry.
DOCTOR: I understand. A constant, low-level discomfort is certainly not ideal, and the test results are understandably adding to your anxiety. Before we delve into those results, let's get a more complete picture of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, not as such. I've been quite fortunate, health-wise, all my life. I had a bout of the flu a few years ago, but that was the extent of it. My blood pressure is occasionally a bit elevated, but nothing my primary doctor hasn’t managed with gentle reminders about salt intake. I've never been diagnosed with anything… chronic, you understand. And I don't take any regular medication, aside from an occasional pain reliever for aches and pains, if needed. I do, however, have rather sensitive skin, and I’m quite careful to avoid the sun. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No significant past medical history, occasional hypertension managed with lifestyle, no chronic conditions, no regular medications except for PRN pain relievers, and sensitive skin. I'll make a note of that. Alright, Ms. Minatra, and have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always been rather… resilient, I suppose. I've never needed any significant surgical intervention. Just the usual childhood vaccinations, of course, and a wisdom tooth removed when I was quite young. But nothing major. I consider myself quite lucky in that regard, truly. I’ve always preferred to avoid hospitals, if at all possible. They are… unsettling places, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: No surgeries, routine childhood vaccinations and wisdom tooth extraction. And… you prefer to avoid hospitals. Right. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any instances of gastrointestinal issues – ulcers, cancers, inflammatory bowel disease – within your family?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. That’s a bit… complicated. My mother’s side, they were all remarkably healthy, as far as I knew. Lived long lives, mostly. But my father… he wasn’t one for discussing medical matters, if I’m honest. I know his mother, my grandmother, suffered from… stomach problems. She had something… painful, she often complained, but I was quite young and didn’t pay much attention to the details. It wasn't a comfortable topic, you understand. And my father, he simply wouldn’t elaborate. He just… brushed it off as “female troubles.” I'm afraid that's not terribly helpful, is it?
DOCTOR: Vague history of maternal grandmother with unspecified stomach problems; father uncooperative regarding medical history. Adequate, I suppose. Ms. Minatra, and could you briefly describe your social habits?
PATIENT: Oh, my social habits? Well, I’m a widow, you see. My husband passed away ten years ago. I live alone, but I’m not entirely isolated. I have a close circle of friends, mostly from my church group. We meet regularly for coffee, and sometimes we’ll go on outings. I enjoy gardening, and I volunteer at the local library a couple of times a week. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I wouldn’t say I’m a particularly… social butterfly, but I certainly enjoy the company of others. Is that helpful, Doctor? I confess, I haven't thought much about my "social habits" in quite some time.
DOCTOR: Widow, active social life with friends, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Now, finally, do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I’ve always been able to eat anything and everything without incident. I’ve never had a reaction to any food, medication, or… insect stings. My skin is sensitive, as I mentioned earlier, but that's not a true allergy, you understand. Just a tendency to become easily irritated. I occasionally get a mild rash if I use certain soaps, but that’s easily remedied by switching brands. I've never required an epinephrine pen or anything of that nature. I truly believe I’m quite fortunate in that regard. It would be such a bother to have to worry about allergies, wouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Very well. No known allergies. Now, Ms. Minatra, let's discuss the results of your endoscopy. As you know, the procedure was performed to investigate the source of your upper abdominal discomfort. The findings indicated some inflammation in your esophagus and stomach. Specifically, there was evidence of mild esophagitis and some superficial gastritis. There were also a few small polyps identified in your stomach. We need to determine the significance of these findings.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Inflammation… and polyps. That doesn't sound very pleasant at all. Esophagitis… gastritis… I confess, I don't understand what any of that means, exactly. Is it… serious, Doctor? What caused it, do you think? And these polyps… are they dangerous? I do apologize for my ignorance, but I’m not a medical professional, you understand. I simply want to know what this means for my health. Is it something I need to worry about? And what are the next steps, if you don't mind my asking?
DOCTOR: The inflammation suggests irritation or damage to the lining of your esophagus and stomach. The cause can be varied – acid reflux, certain medications, or even infection. The polyps… these are small growths. Most are benign, but we need to determine their nature. We will need to perform a biopsy of the polyps. This involves taking a small tissue sample during a repeat endoscopy. That will allow us to determine if they are precancerous or cancerous. As for the immediate next steps, I am ordering a proton pump inhibitor, a medication to reduce stomach acid. And I will schedule you for the repeat endoscopy with biopsy as soon as possible. I understand this is unsettling, but early detection is key. Do you have any questions regarding that?
PATIENT: Oh my. A biopsy… that sounds… invasive. And precancerous… that's a very frightening word, Doctor. A proton pump inhibitor… will that have any side effects? And how long will the endoscopy take? I confess, I've never been particularly fond of medical procedures, you understand. Is it painful? And what happens if… if the polyps are something serious? I apologize for all the questions, but I am quite anxious, as you can imagine. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to alleviate the discomfort? Any dietary changes, perhaps? Or anything else? It’s just… all of this is rather overwhelming. I feel quite helpless.
DOCTOR: The endoscopy itself is not typically painful; you will be sedated. Common side effects of the proton pump inhibitor are bloating, nausea, and headache, though most people tolerate it well. As for dietary changes, avoid spicy foods, acidic beverages – citrus fruits, tomatoes – and caffeine. Smaller, more frequent meals may also help. We won’t speculate on worst-case scenarios until we have the biopsy results. Unnecessary worry serves no purpose. We are taking all the necessary steps for proper diagnosis and management. I am ordering the medication and will have the endoscopy scheduled for next week. My assistant will contact you with the details. Any further questions for today?
PATIENT: I… well, yes, actually. If you don’t mind. You mentioned my assistant will contact me… what is their name? And what if I experience a… severe reaction to the medication? Who should I contact then? And… this endoscopy next week, will I need someone to drive me home? I do live alone, you understand, and I don't want to be alone if I’m feeling unwell. I just want to be prepared, you see. It’s just… all of this feels so rushed, and I feel as though I’m not fully understanding everything. And one last thing, Doctor… is this something I should be worried about for the long term? I apologize for the continued questions, but my peace of mind is paramount at this time.
DOCTOR: My assistant, Ms. Evelyn Reed, will contact you. The emergency contact number is listed on the paperwork she will provide. You absolutely should have someone drive you home following the procedure. And regarding long-term concerns… Until we have the biopsy results, speculation is unhelpful. Long-term management will depend entirely on the findings. I have provided you with the necessary information, and frankly, Ms. Minatra, I must attend to other patients. Do you have any further questions that pertain to the immediate next steps – medication and the scheduled endoscopy – or shall we conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: No… no, I believe that is all for now. I apologize for taking up so much of your time, Doctor. I truly do. I shall await Ms. Reed’s call. And I will… arrange for transportation to and from the endoscopy. Thank you… for your time. I suppose… I shall see you next week then.
