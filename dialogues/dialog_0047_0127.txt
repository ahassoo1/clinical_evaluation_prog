DOCTOR: Right. Gedalya Schaust, 25 years of age. And you’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Press. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve been getting weaker, slowly, over the past few months. And my eyelids… they’re drooping. It’s making it hard to keep them open sometimes.
DOCTOR: "Slowly getting weaker," you say. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It started, I think, with my legs. Just feeling tired after walking, more than usual. Now, it's… it's harder to get up from a chair, or to climb stairs. Small things, at first. And it’s not really pain, just… a lack of strength, I suppose. It’s difficult to explain. It's like there's no… oomph.
DOCTOR: And the eyelids… when did you first notice them drooping?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, maybe… six weeks ago? My wife—ex-wife, now—pointed it out. Said I looked tired. I didn't really notice it myself at first. But it's gotten worse, definitely. It’s more noticeable at the end of the day, I think. And sometimes, I have to… sort of lift my eyebrows to keep them open. It feels a bit silly, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anyone else in your family had anything… similar?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. To the best of my knowledge, no. My mother… she has arthritis, but that’s about it. And my father was… fairly healthy, until he passed a few years ago. Nothing like this, though. I don’t think so, anyway. I wasn’t very close to my grandparents, so I wouldn’t know about them.
DOCTOR: And just to clarify, this weakness… is it all over, or is it worse in certain areas?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my legs, I would say. And my arms feel a bit heavy sometimes, but not as bad as my legs. And it’s… strange. It’s worse later in the day, like I said. I work in facilities management, so I’m on my feet a lot. But even after a full night’s sleep, it doesn't really feel much better the next morning. It just… stays.
DOCTOR: Facilities management… so you do a fair amount of lifting and carrying?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Not heavy lifting, usually. Boxes, equipment… things like that. It's not a strenuous job, but it requires a bit of physical work. And walking around a lot, checking things. I mostly work alone, so there’s no one to help me if I need it. Which… is probably why I’m here now. I noticed it was getting harder to do even the simple tasks.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any trouble with your vision?
PATIENT: Trouble with my vision? Not particularly. I wear glasses, but I’ve worn them for years. My eyesight’s just… not very good. But it hasn't gotten any worse recently, if that’s what you mean. It’s stable, I think. I had an eye test last year, and they said everything was fine. Just the usual prescription.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Any difficulty swallowing, or changes in your voice?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Swallowing is fine, and my voice… well, I don't think it's changed. My ex-wife is usually very quick to point out when something’s wrong with me, and she hasn't mentioned anything about my voice. So, I assume it’s normal. I haven’t noticed anything unusual myself, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. It might be a little… wobbly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just stand normally for a moment. Now, could you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Like this? I… it’s a bit awkward, I apologize. I try not to… overdo it, you see. I don’t want to fall. It feels… weaker when I move quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit back down. I’m going to check your reflexes now. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. Just relax. Diminished reflexes bilaterally. And now, I'm going to check your muscle strength. Can you push against my hand?
PATIENT: Push against your hand? Of course. Just let me know how hard. Is that enough? It feels… harder than it should.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. Both legs demonstrate weakness. Now, I’m going to check your eye movements. Just follow my finger with your eyes. And finally, let me take a look at your throat. Alright. Thank you. This is all… quite suggestive.
PATIENT: Suggestive? In what way, Doctor? Is it… serious? I’m starting to get a bit worried, if I’m honest. My ex-wife said I should come see someone right away, but I didn't expect… this much examination. Is it something I should be really concerned about?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Schaust, your symptoms—the progressive weakness, the drooping eyelids, the diminished reflexes—they point towards a possible neuromuscular disorder. Now, I’m not going to jump to conclusions, but we need to investigate further. The most likely, though by no means definitive, possibility at this stage is Myasthenia Gravis. It’s a condition that affects the nerves and muscles, causing weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. Now, it can be managed, but requires specific testing and potentially long-term treatment. I'm going to order a blood test to check for specific antibodies associated with Myasthenia Gravis. I also want you to have an MRI of your brain and an Electromyography—an EMG—to assess your muscle function. And, frankly, given the possibility of a serious underlying condition, I’m referring you to a neurologist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Neurologist? Myasthenia… what was it? It sounds… serious. Antibodies? MRI? I… I think I understand, but it’s a lot to take in. It’s causing weakness, you said? And it gets worse when I… move around? Is there… anything I can do? While I wait for the tests? And… what is the treatment like? Long-term… does that mean… for the rest of my life?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schaust, it can be a long-term condition, requiring ongoing management. As for what you can do now… try to avoid strenuous activity. Rest when you feel fatigued. And avoid anything that exacerbates your symptoms. We'll need the test results to determine the severity and appropriate treatment plan. Treatment typically involves medication to improve muscle strength, and in some cases, more invasive therapies. I’m writing you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurologist at St. Jude’s Hospital. She’s excellent. The lab requisition for the blood tests and the referral form will be sent electronically to your pharmacy and to Dr. Vance’s office. I also want you to call Dr. Vance’s office immediately to schedule an appointment. And frankly, given your level of weakness, I would advise someone to drive you to your appointments. Don’t attempt to drive yourself. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Drive myself… no, that’s… probably sensible. I live alone now, so… I’d have to ask a friend, I suppose. The medication… are there side effects? And how long will it take to get the test results? I have… work commitments. Although, I guess I should be thinking about my health first. And… is it contagious? My ex-wife… we still see each other sometimes. This is… a lot to take in, Doctor. It's just… a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: As for side effects, they vary depending on the medication, and Dr. Vance will discuss those with you in detail. As for the test results, it typically takes 5-7 business days for the lab to process everything. I understand you have work commitments, but your health is the priority. As for contagiousness, no. Myasthenia Gravis is not contagious. It is an autoimmune disorder, meaning your body’s immune system attacks its own tissues. Frankly, Mr. Schaust, I’ve provided you with a referral to a specialist. She is the best equipped to answer your questions and develop an appropriate treatment plan. I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with Dr. Vance as soon as possible. I'm not going to speculate further without the test results. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I’ll… schedule the appointment. And I’ll try to… rest. Thank you again.
