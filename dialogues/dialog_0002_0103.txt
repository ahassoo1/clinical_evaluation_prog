DOCTOR: Hi Albino, welcome! I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor Ranjan, nice to meet you too. My back... it hurts. Low down, you know? Been hurting for a little while now. Not a new thing, but it's… more now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Low back pain that's been getting worse recently. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like if you fall. More like… a dull ache, all the time. Some days it’s worse, some days a little better. Getting up from a chair is the hardest. And bending over… oof. That’s not good. I try not to do that much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache that's constant, but fluctuates, and is worse with getting up and bending over. That gives me a little more to work with. Is there anything that makes it better – like, does resting help, or maybe a warm bath?
PATIENT: Resting… a little, maybe. Not a big help, really. Warm bath feels good while I’m in it, but it doesn’t last. Mostly, I just try to move slow. And… well, I try not to think about it too much. That helps sometimes!
DOCTOR: Okay, so temporary relief with a warm bath, but not a lasting effect. And you manage it by moving slowly. I appreciate you telling me that – sometimes just acknowledging the pain helps. Now, has anything specific happened recently that might have made it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? Not that I can think of. No falls, no lifting anything heavy. I did help my grandson with some boxes last month, but that wasn't too bad. He's a strong boy, mostly did the work. I just… watched and gave advice. No, nothing new happened. It just… got worse little by little.
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific injury or event. Gradual onset. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiating? You mean… going down my legs? Sometimes, a little. Not bad, mostly just a… a tightness. Down the back of my legs, but not all the way to my feet. And it’s not always there, just when the back is really bad. Like now, a little bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, some tightness radiating down the back of your legs when the back pain is particularly bad. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I'll just need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll check your range of motion, reflexes, and feel for any tenderness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. My bones… they aren't what they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Take your time. No need to rush. And don't hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable or painful during the exam. We’ll go slow and gentle. Okay, if you could lie flat on your back for me, that would be great. I’m just going to gently feel along your spine and check how you move. I'm noticing some tenderness right here… and here. And when I ask you to lift your leg…… a little discomfort there as well.
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, that spot… that’s where it hurts. And lifting my leg… yes, a little bit of a pull. Not too bad, but I can feel it. It’s been like that for a while now, you know? My wife used to rub that spot, said it helped. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the tenderness and discomfort with leg lift are consistent with what you’re describing. And it sounds like your wife had a good instinct, rubbing that spot probably provided some temporary relief. Your reflexes seem normal, and sensation is intact. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain or a mild disc issue. It's not something that requires immediate emergency care, but it's important to address it to prevent it from getting worse. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Just the ache, and the tightness sometimes. I'm glad it's not anything serious. I worry sometimes, you know? Old bones… they don't bounce back like they used to. So, what do you think I should do?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No numbness or tingling is reassuring. I agree, it doesn’t sound like anything immediately serious. Based on everything, it seems like a muscle strain is most likely, possibly with some mild pressure on a disc. We can start with some conservative management. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen to help with the inflammation and pain. Heat or ice packs can also be helpful – try 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off. Gentle stretching and low-impact exercise, like walking, can also help strengthen your back muscles. I’m going to give you a handout with some specific stretches you can try. It's also important to avoid any activities that aggravate the pain. We can also consider physical therapy if the pain doesn’t improve with these measures. Would you be open to discussing a referral to physical therapy?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Pain relievers, heat, stretching… I can do that. And a handout would be helpful, I forget things so easily these days. Physical therapy… maybe. Let's try the pain relievers and stretching first, see if that helps. I don’t want to bother anyone if I don’t need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. We’ll start with conservative management. I'll write you a prescription for a short course of naproxen, just to get the inflammation down. And I'll print out that handout with the stretches for you. I also want to emphasize the importance of proper posture and lifting techniques. Avoid bending over from the waist – instead, bend your knees and keep your back straight when lifting anything. I want to see you back in two weeks to check on your progress. If your pain worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms like numbness, weakness, or difficulty controlling your bladder or bowels, please call the office right away. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Naproxen, stretches, good posture… I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor Ranjan. You've been very helpful. And… thank you for being patient with me. Old men aren’t always easy patients, you know?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Albino. And don’t worry about it at all! It's my job to be patient, and I'm happy to help. It was nice meeting you. Here’s the handout with the stretches, and your prescription. The nurse will be in shortly to go over discharge instructions with you. If you have any questions after you leave, don’t hesitate to call the office. Take care, and I'll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day now. I will see you then.
