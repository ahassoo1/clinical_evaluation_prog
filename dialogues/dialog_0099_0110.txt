DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you. Well, to put it plainly, I feel… a bit worn out. Like an old engine that needs a good tune-up, you know? I’m hoping you can help me get a “reset,” as I call it. A jumpstart to feeling like myself again. I’m eighty-seven years young, and while I’ve lived a good life, I just want to feel a bit more… vibrant.
DOCTOR: Vibrant, yes. Understandable. Eighty-seven is… a significant milestone. "Worn out" is rather vague, though. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. I apologize. Vague is not very helpful, is it? Well, it’s not any one thing. It’s just… everything takes more effort. Getting up in the mornings is harder, even though I sleep well enough. And I used to enjoy gardening so much, but bending and kneeling… it’s become quite a chore. I don't have much energy for it anymore. And, truthfully, I’ve been forgetting little things – where I put my glasses, names of people I’ve known for years… nothing major, but enough to bother me. I still teach kindergarten part-time, you know, and I want to keep doing that. I don’t want to slow down, but I feel like I am slowing down. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… somewhat more descriptive. “Slowing down” at eighty-seven is… common. But we should investigate. Let's start with a bit of a review. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Goodness, yes. My appetite isn’t what it used to be. I used to enjoy a good meal, a hearty Chamorro dish, you know? But lately… I just don't feel as hungry. I have to make myself eat sometimes, and even then, I don’t eat as much as I used to. It’s not that I don’t like food, it just… doesn’t appeal to me the same way. And I’ve lost a little weight, I think. Though, truthfully, I haven’t been keeping very close track.
DOCTOR: A decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss… alright. And have you experienced any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve noticed I get cold more easily than I used to. Even when it’s warm, I’m the one reaching for a sweater. And sometimes, I feel a bit… shaky, like my hands are trembling. It’s not constant, just comes and goes. Oh, and my skin feels very dry, even with lotion. Is that helpful, Doctor? I’m trying to remember everything. It’s like a puzzle, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is… a puzzle. And a somewhat fragmented one, at that. We'll try to assemble it. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… that's a bit of a personal question, isn't it? I suppose I have been… more constipated lately. It’s not severe, but it’s definitely more of a struggle than it used to be. I’ve tried drinking more water, but it doesn’t seem to help much. I used to have a very regular schedule, but that’s… changed. Is that what you were asking about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s what I was inquiring about. Constipation… alright. Now, any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I suppose I am going to the bathroom more frequently than I used to, especially at night. It’s not terrible, but it interrupts my sleep sometimes. I don't have any pain or burning, just… the urge to go more often. I thought it was just age, you know? Getting older and the bladder not being as strong. Is that a concern, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be, Ms. McNabb. But we need to rule things out. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, many years ago – probably forty years ago now – I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. I took medication for it for a long time, but my doctor eventually took me off of it, saying it had come down on its own. I’ve been checked regularly since then, and it’s usually been fine. And I had a hip replacement about fifteen years ago, which went very well. Other than that… I've been quite healthy, thankfully. I've always been a strong Chamorro woman, you know? But those are the major things. Does that help?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, history of being treated… and a hip replacement. And any surgeries besides the hip?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, just the hip. I had a very good surgeon, and it healed wonderfully. I was back on my feet in no time. I believe I had my appendix out when I was a young woman, but that was so long ago, I barely remember it. It was before I even came to the States, I think. Just the hip replacement really. I’ve been very lucky in that regard. Mostly just the usual bumps and bruises of a long life, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… Well, my husband passed away about ten years ago. We had three children, two sons and a daughter. My daughter lives in Guam, and my sons are here in the States, one in California and one in Texas. They all have families of their own now, so I have several grandchildren and even a few great-grandchildren. As for medical history… my mother had arthritis in her later years, and my father had some heart trouble. But nothing major that I’m aware of. They both lived to be quite old, thankfully. Is that what you were wondering about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: And what about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just a few. I take a daily multivitamin, of course, and I have a small dose of medication for my cholesterol – a statin, I think my doctor calls it. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take some over-the-counter ibuprofen. That's really it. Nothing major, Doctor. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know? I like to keep things as natural as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any reaction to any medication, thankfully. And no allergies to food or anything else, either. I’ve always been a very lucky woman, in that regard. I can eat anything, praise God. Is there anything else I should tell you, Doctor? I want to be as helpful as possible. It's just… I want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McNabb. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then we'll discuss some potential next steps. Could you please step up onto the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Here we go. It’s a little higher than I remember, but I’ll manage. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m a bit unsteady on my feet these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, please. And another… good. Lungs are clear. Now, let's listen to your heart. A slight murmur, but not unexpected at your age. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let's take a look at your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal. No swelling. Now, can you tell me if anything hurts when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn't hurt. And no, that doesn't hurt either. Oh, that’s a little tender, but it’s not painful. It’s just… sensitive. I get a little indigestion sometimes, you know? Is that what you were checking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Possibly. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but that's also not uncommon at your age. And finally, let's take a look at your feet. Some mild swelling in your ankles, and your skin is quite dry, as you mentioned. Alright, Ms. McNabb, you can go ahead and get dressed. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it appears you may be experiencing some symptoms consistent with… several things. We need some blood work to get a clearer picture. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid levels, your vitamin D levels, and a complete blood count. We'll also check your kidney and liver function.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests, Doctor. But if that’s what it takes, I suppose I trust your judgment. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. Will the blood work tell us what’s causing me to feel so… tired and worn out? And is there anything I can do in the meantime? Should I be resting more, or eating anything special? I just want to get back to teaching my little ones.
DOCTOR: The blood work will help us rule out several possibilities – thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, and other underlying conditions. For now, continue taking your multivitamin and try to stay as active as you comfortably can. Don’t push yourself too hard, but gentle exercise – walking, gardening – can be beneficial. As for your diet, ensure you’re getting enough protein. And stay hydrated. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we'll discuss a more targeted plan. I’m also going to order a urinalysis just to rule out any infection. The nurse will draw the blood and collect a urine sample before you leave. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that all makes sense, Doctor. Protein and staying hydrated… I can certainly try to do that. And a urinalysis… alright. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. It’s reassuring to know someone is trying to figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? And get back to my kindergarten class. They miss me when I’m not there. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you with the blood work and urinalysis. Once those are completed, you’re free to go. We'll be in touch with the results as soon as they’re available. Try not to worry unduly. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
PATIENT: .
