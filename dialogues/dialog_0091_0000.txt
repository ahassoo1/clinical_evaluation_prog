DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's...fine. Honestly, I don't usually bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. But this leg thing is just annoying. I had a bit of a cold last week – nothing major, just a sniffle and a cough – and now my legs feel like jelly. It started a couple of days ago, and it's not getting any better. It’s just…weakness, I guess. Both of them.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness in both legs following a cold. Thank you for explaining that. To help me understand this better, could you describe the weakness in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Detail…right. It’s not like I can’t move them, you understand. It’s just…harder. Like walking through thick mud, or trying to lift something really heavy when you haven't had your coffee. Especially going up stairs. And standing for long periods is…uncomfortable. It feels like they’re going to give out, you know? I had to sit down at the grocery store yesterday, which is just ridiculous. I don't do sitting unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the weakness is more pronounced with exertion, such as walking or climbing stairs, and worsens with prolonged standing. That’s helpful information. When you say it started a couple of days ago, was there anything specific that you were doing when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was… honestly, I was probably rearranging my plants. I have quite a collection, you see, and they require… attention. I stood up to move a particularly large fern, and that’s when I noticed it. It wasn’t sudden, more like a…slight wobble. I thought I just hadn’t had enough water, to be honest. But then it didn’t go away. And it’s been progressively worse since then. Honestly, I don’t usually pay attention to these sorts of things. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. A gradual onset of weakness after moving a heavy object, following a recent cold. Thank you. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But honestly, who isn’t tired these days? And my appetite hasn’t been quite as good, but that could be the heat. It’s been dreadfully hot, hasn't it? I haven’t had a fever, no. No numbness or tingling. Just the legs, and the general…feeling of being a bit run down. I really don’t think it’s anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand. No fever, numbness, or tingling, just fatigue and decreased appetite along with the leg weakness. Thank you for that information. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… Let me see. No, nothing like that. I’ve always been quite healthy, really. I eat well – mostly – and I keep active. My mother had… well, she had some trouble with her joints when she got older, but that was just age. And my father… he was a very strong man, always working. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but I recovered quickly. Other than that, nothing to speak of. I’m on Medicare, of course, but that’s just…standard for someone my age.
DOCTOR: Thank you. No significant medical history, and your mother had some joint issues with age. And you had the flu a few years ago. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been very careful. I avoid hospitals like the plague, honestly. Too many germs. And surgeries… absolutely not. I prefer to let my body heal itself, if possible. I had a rather bad sprain in my ankle when I was younger, playing volleyball, but I just rested it and it got better. I don't believe in unnecessary interventions, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your preference. No surgeries or hospitalizations, just a sprained ankle in the past. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember. And I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s about it. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in natural remedies, you know? A good night's sleep and a cup of chamomile tea can fix most things, honestly. I don't like filling my body with chemicals unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Just occasional ibuprofen and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, travel quite a bit, and have never had any problems. I’m generally very careful about what I put in my body, you know? I don't just eat anything that's put in front of me. I suppose I could be allergic to something, but I haven't encountered it yet.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of your current situation, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical examination. Well… I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have plans this afternoon, you see. And I really don’t enjoy being poked and prodded. But if it’s necessary… go ahead. Just be gentle, please. And explain what you’re doing as you go along. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Now, let’s assess your leg strength and reflexes. Could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Fine. All perfectly normal, I assume? Honestly, I told you I was fine. Now, what exactly are you going to do to my legs? I hope it doesn't involve bending them at awkward angles. And please, don’t make me feel foolish. I have a perfectly good sense of balance, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I will not make you feel foolish. We'll start with some simple tests. First, could you please extend your legs straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: There. Is that straight enough? Honestly, this table isn't very comfortable. And it's rather cold on my legs. You wouldn't happen to have a blanket, would you? It’s just… I prefer to be comfortable when someone is poking around.
DOCTOR: My apologies. Much better?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. That’s much better. Now, what are you looking for exactly? And how long is this going to take? I really do have things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I am assessing your strength by asking you to resist as I try to bend your knees and lift your legs. Okay, I'm noting some weakness in both legs, particularly when resisting extension and flexion. It’s mild, but present. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Do you experience any pain with these movements?
PATIENT: No, not exactly pain. More like… discomfort. A slight ache, really. Especially when you try to lift them. It's not sharp or anything, just… tiring. It feels like I'm exerting a lot of effort for very little result. Honestly, it feels like my legs are made of lead. And it's slightly more noticeable on this side.
DOCTOR: I understand. Slight discomfort and fatigue, more pronounced on the left leg. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I lightly touch your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, of course I can feel it. I’m not completely numb, you know. Honestly, I have perfectly good feeling in my legs. Just do it quickly, please. I don’t want to sit here all day.
DOCTOR: Sensation is intact bilaterally. Alright, Ms. Firestone, that completes the physical examination. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination findings – weakness in both legs, more pronounced on the left, fatigue with exertion, and normal reflexes and sensation – I have a few possibilities in mind. Given your recent cold, the weakness could be post-viral myalgia, or muscle pain after an infection. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, such as vitamin deficiencies or, less likely, a more serious neurological issue.
PATIENT: Neurological issue? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. You don't think it's anything like… paralysis? Or something awful? Honestly, I told you it was just a bit of leg weakness. You’re making a mountain out of a molehill, Doctor. And post-viral what? I really don't understand all this medical jargon. Just tell me plainly what you think is wrong, and what we’re going to do about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. Please, let me assure you, I am not suggesting anything serious at this point. Paralysis is highly unlikely given your normal reflexes and sensation. "Post-viral myalgia" simply means muscle pain that occurs after a viral infection, like your recent cold. It's relatively common, and usually resolves on its own. However, to be thorough and rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a few blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels – particularly Vitamin D and B12 – and also look for any signs of inflammation or other underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Honestly, it’s just more poking and prodding, isn’t it? And waiting around for results. I suppose… if you think it’s necessary. But I really don’t want to spend my entire afternoon in a lab. And please, tell me how long it will take to get the results, and what exactly you’re looking for. I want to be informed, you know? I don’t like being kept in the dark. And are they going to take a lot of blood? I faint easily.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. It will only be a standard blood draw, and the phlebotomist is very experienced. They will be careful to minimize any discomfort. As for the amount of blood, it's typical – a few vials. We can take a break if you start to feel faint, and the nurses are trained to handle that. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I’m looking primarily for any vitamin deficiencies, especially Vitamin D and B12, as those can cause muscle weakness and fatigue. I'll also check for signs of inflammation. In the meantime, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible, staying hydrated, and continuing to eat a healthy diet. Avoid strenuous activity until we have the results. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Reasonable, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t involve too much disruption to my schedule. And I expect a clear explanation of the results, in plain English, not all this medical jargon. And if it turns out to be something serious, I want to know all my options. Don’t sugarcoat it, Doctor. I prefer honesty, even if it’s unpleasant. So, blood tests, rest, hydration… Anything else? And where do I go to get these tests done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Honesty is always my priority. No sugarcoating, I assure you. The only other thing is to contact me immediately if you experience any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, difficulty breathing, or worsening weakness. You can have the blood tests done at the lab across the street, at 123 Main Street. Here’s a requisition form. The nurses there will explain the process. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything… for now. Just please, don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. And if it turns out to be something minor, I expect an apology for all this unnecessary fuss. Honestly, I had a perfectly good afternoon planned. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll go get these tests done. .
