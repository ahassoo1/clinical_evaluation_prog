DOCTOR: Hi Tierney, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I decided it was time to get tested for HIV. I just… wanted to know my status, really. It’s been on my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a really good step, Tierney, and I commend you for taking charge of your health. It’s perfectly normal to want to know your status. We can absolutely do that today. Before we get started, can you tell me a little bit about why now?
PATIENT: Well, it's not anything specific, Doctor. Just… getting older, I suppose. Thinking about my health more. My husband and I… we haven’t been as careful as we used to be, and I want to be sure for both our sakes. It’s better to know, isn’t it? I’d rather face things head-on than worry about them.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Tierney – it is better to know. That’s a very sensible approach. And thinking about your health as we get older is incredibly important. Okay. To give you the most accurate information and make sure we do everything correctly, I’m going to ask you a few questions, if that’s alright. It’ll cover some of your medical history, and some things about your risk factors. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, ask whatever you need to. I’ll answer as best I can. I hope I remember everything… it's not always easy these days.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Tierney, we can take our time. I can always repeat questions if needed. Let's start with your past medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My blood pressure has been a little high at times, the doctor back home mentioned it a few years ago, but I haven’t been on any medication for it. Other than that… no, I don't believe so. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, things like that, but nothing serious as an adult. Just the aches and pains that come with age, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, but nothing currently managed with medication. And typical childhood illnesses. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes, actually. I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. It was quite painful, but the surgery went well and I recovered quickly. And… that’s it, I think. No other surgeries.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago. And no other surgeries. That’s helpful. Now, a little about your family… Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of serious illness – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else that runs in the family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother had diabetes, I believe, towards the end of her life. And my father… he passed away from heart problems, a stroke, I think it was. On my husband's side, his sister has breast cancer, but that’s about all I know. We weren’t very close to his family, sadly. It's difficult to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of diabetes with your mother and heart problems with your father, and breast cancer in your husband’s sister. I understand it can be difficult to keep track of family history. Now, let’s talk a bit about your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My husband used to smoke a pipe, but he gave that up years ago. We both believe in keeping our lungs healthy. It’s a terrible habit, really.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: We both enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, perhaps two or three times a week. Nothing excessive, though. We don’t drink to excess, and certainly not every day. Just a little something to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a couple of glasses of wine with dinner a few times a week. That’s good to know. And lastly, I need to ask about any allergies you may have. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication. I’m not allergic to any foods that I know of. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I eat shellfish, but that’s a mild reaction, not a true allergy. Just a little discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just mild itching with shellfish. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I'm not. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I prefer to let my body heal naturally, if it can. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional multivitamins. Alright, Tierney, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, before we proceed with the HIV test, I just want to confirm we’ve discussed all your risk factors. You mentioned wanting to be sure for both you and your husband, and that you haven’t been as careful as you used to be. Is there anything else you'd like to share in that regard?
PATIENT: Well… it's a little embarrassing to talk about, Doctor. My husband and I… we've been together a long time. And sometimes, we forget to use protection. It’s not frequent, but it has happened. I suppose that's the reason I'm here. I just want to be certain, you understand? It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially at our age. I wouldn't want to worry him unnecessarily. Or, worse, be unwell and not know it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Tierney. It takes courage to be honest about these things, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It's very responsible of you to want to get tested, and you’re right - it's always better to be safe. There's no judgment here at all. Now, we can proceed with the HIV test. We can do a blood draw here in the office. It’s a quick process. It takes a little bit of time for the results to come back, typically a few days. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. Would you like me to explain the testing process in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. I've never had this test before, so I would appreciate it if you could explain what to expect. Just… tell me everything that will happen. And how long will it take to get the results, exactly? A few days is… a little nerve-wracking.
DOCTOR: Certainly. So, the test itself is a simple blood draw. A phlebotomist – that’s a person trained to draw blood – will clean the inside of your elbow with an alcohol swab, and then insert a small needle into a vein. You might feel a little pinch, and there will be a small amount of blood taken. It usually takes just a few minutes. Afterward, you’ll get a small bandage on your arm. It's very routine. As for the results, we send the sample to the lab, and it takes them a few days to process it. Typically, we can expect results back within 3-5 business days. We’ll call you as soon as they are available. I understand that waiting can be nerve-wracking, so please don't hesitate to call us if you have any concerns during that time. We can also discuss what the results mean, and what the next steps would be, depending on what they show. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense, Doctor. A simple blood draw, a few days for the results… I think I can handle that. And I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It does put my mind at ease a little. Let's go ahead and do it then. When is a good time?
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. Our phlebotomist, Maria, is available right now. We can get it done quickly. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be perfect, Doctor. Let's do it now, if Maria is ready. I’d like to get it over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll let Maria know you're ready. She’ll come in shortly to get you set up. Just relax, and she’ll walk you through everything. I'll be right here in the office if you have any questions afterward, or if you just want to talk.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tierney. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get through this together. Maria, could you please come in here when you have a moment?
