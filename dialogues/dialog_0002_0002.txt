DOCTOR: Hi Zoie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s…well, it’s my waterworks. They just aren’t workin’ like they used to. Takes a bit of time, you know? Not painful, just…slow. My husband, he says I should get it checked. He worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with urination – it’s taking longer than usual to empty your bladder, and your husband is rightly concerned. That’s good he’s looking out for you. Now, just to get a little more detail, has this been a sudden change, or has it been developing gradually over time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Gradual, I think. It didn’t just happen one day. Maybe a few months now? It’s hard to say, my memory isn't what it used to be. Things just…fade, you know? I do remember my husband noticing before me, he’s got a good ear. He always does.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's very common for changes to happen slowly, and it's helpful that your husband has noticed. So, a few months of gradually becoming more difficult to urinate. And is it difficult to start urinating, or is it difficult to completely empty your bladder once you’ve started?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I think…starting is the hard part. Like it needs a little…encouragement, you know? Once it gets goin’, it’s alright. Not a strong stream, mind you, but it goes. Just takes a bit longer than it used to. I don't rush things these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you’re having trouble initiating your stream, and it’s weaker than it used to be, but you are able to empty your bladder eventually. And you've noticed it takes longer. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me think. Not really, no. I sleep alright, though I do get up once or twice at night. But that’s just old age, I reckon. My legs swell a bit if I sit for too long, but that's nothing new. Nothing to do with the waterworks, I don't think. Oh! Sometimes I feel a little… shaky, but that’s just when I haven’t had my tea. Everything's connected, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so waking up once or twice at night, some leg swelling, and occasional shakiness when you haven’t had tea. We can definitely explore those things a bit further later if you'd like, but for now, we’ll focus on the urinary issues. Now, have you ever had any urinary tract infections, or UTIs, in the past?
PATIENT: UTIs…oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. I don’t think so. I’ve been to the doctor plenty of times over the years, for this and that, but I don’t recall anyone mentionin’ a UTI. Old age, you know. Things get forgotten. My husband remembers more than me, always has. He'd know if I had one of those… infections. He’d be all worried and fussin’.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. It’s perfectly understandable if you don't recall. It’s good your husband is so attentive. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, Zoie?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… just the one. For my blood pressure. A little white pill. I take it every morning with my tea. And sometimes, if my arthritis is bad, I take a little something for that, but not every day. Mostly just try to move it around, you know? Keep it greased. That's what my mother always said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a medication for blood pressure, taken daily, and something for arthritis as needed. Do you happen to know the names of those medications, Zoie?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Names… that’s the tricky part. The blood pressure one… it’s a little white one. I think… Lisinopril? Is that right? My husband fills the prescription, he handles all that. The arthritis one… hmm. Something with a ‘C’ in it? Celebrex maybe? I’m not very good with names, you see. Numbers, too. It all just blurs together after a while. Don’t worry, my husband knows everything. He’ll be able to tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and possibly Celebrex for arthritis. That's very helpful. Alright, Zoie, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright with you. We'll just check your abdomen and do a quick neurological exam to see if everything is working as it should. It won’t be anything uncomfortable, I promise. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, an exam? Well… alright. As long as it’s not too rough. I’m a bit… fragile, you know? Old bones and all that. And I do get cold easily. But yes, go ahead. I trust you, dear. Just be gentle, alright? My husband always says I bruise easily. He worries so.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. I will be very gentle. I'll make sure you're comfortable, and we'll take things slowly. Okay, just taking a feel of your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Hmm…no, not really. A little…squishy, maybe? But not painful. Just…old. Everything's a bit saggy these days, you know? Like a deflated balloon. But no pain, dear. Not at all. Though that reminds me, I should probably get more exercise. My husband keeps telling me…
DOCTOR: Okay, and I’m just checking your reflexes here. Tap, tap, tap. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, Zoie. Nothing to worry about. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Okay, Zoie, everything sounds and feels relatively normal, but based on what you've told me, and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention – meaning your bladder isn’t emptying completely. The slow stream and difficulty starting are typical symptoms. It could be due to a number of things, including weakening of the bladder muscles, prostate issues – although that's less common in women – or even medication side effects. It's also possible there's a blockage, though that’s less likely.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A blockage? That sounds…scary. My husband won’t like that. Weak muscles… that’s what he said. He always says I need to do more exercises. But it’s hard, you know? Old bones and all. So…what do we do now, dear? Do I need any…tests? Will it hurt? I don’t want to worry my husband. He gets so flustered.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you're thinking of your husband. A blockage is less likely, but we need to rule it out to be sure. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a couple of tests. First, a urine analysis to check for infection. That’s a simple sample, and doesn’t hurt at all. And then, a bladder scan – which uses sound waves to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. It’s completely painless and non-invasive, like the ultrasound they use during pregnancy. It won't bother you at all. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and the best course of action. If the results show significant retention, we might consider a referral to a urologist – a specialist in urinary problems. They may recommend further testing or treatment, such as medication or pelvic floor exercises. Does that sound alright to you, Zoie?
PATIENT: Oh, tests… well, alright. As long as they don’t poke and prod too much. A urine sample I can manage. And the… scan, you say? No poking? Good. No, I don’t want to bother a specialist unless it’s absolutely necessary. My husband gets so worried when I have to see new doctors. He fusses over everything. Pelvic… what did you call them? Exercises? I’m not very good at exercises. Old bones, you know. But if it helps… I’ll try. Just don’t tell my husband I said that. He’ll make me do them all day long. Can we do the tests today, dear? I want to get this sorted out quickly. It’s been weighin’ on my mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. We can certainly get the tests done today. I’ll have the nurse come in and collect a urine sample from you first. Then, we’ll do the bladder scan right here in the exam room. It will only take a few minutes. And don’t worry about the pelvic floor exercises – we can discuss those later, and you can try them at your own pace. We’ll start slowly, and see how you feel. No pressure at all. I'll have the nurse in right away to get the urine sample. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me, Zoie?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s alright, dear. Just… please be gentle with the tests. And don’t tell my husband I said that. He’ll fuss. He always fusses. Thank you, Dr. Ranjan. You’ve been very kind. It’s nice to have someone listen. My husband always listens, but… well, he worries too much. He’ll be so relieved when I tell him everything’s going to be alright. I hope it is alright. Old age is… difficult, you know? Everything just… slows down. But I’m still here. Still ticking. And that’s what matters, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Zoie. Still ticking is what matters most. And we'll do everything we can to keep you ticking for a long time to come. I’ll let the nurse know to come in. And don’t you worry, I won't mention a word about you wanting to keep things quiet from your husband. Thank you for coming in today, Zoie. I’m glad you felt comfortable enough to share your concerns with me.
