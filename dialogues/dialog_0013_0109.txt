DOCTOR: Hi Mitchell, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is… is Morenomartinez, yes? Nice to meet you too. I have… a headache. Back of my head. It hurts sometimes. Not all the time, but… yeah. It’s been a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell, a headache for a few days. That’s good to know. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… more? It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not a sharp pain. Like… someone is squeezing the back of my head. Sometimes it feels like it goes up my neck a little bit. I was working… with the trains, you know. All day. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don’t know. I am… old now. Things hurt more.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache at the back of your head, sometimes going into your neck, and you were doing some work with trains recently. It's completely normal for things to ache more as we get older, but we still want to figure out what’s going on. When did you first notice the headache?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was… maybe Tuesday? Yes, Tuesday I remember. After work. I came home, and it was there. Not bad at first, just a little… annoyance. But then Wednesday it was worse. And today… today it’s still here. Not terrible, but… present. Always present.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started Tuesday after work, gradually worsening over the last few days. And you said it's consistently there now. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… Better… no, not really. Nothing makes it go away completely. Maybe… when I sit very still, it’s a little less. But I have to stay still. Not easy! Worse… when I bend over, yes. Like… picking something up from the floor. That makes it hurt more. And… when I turn my head quickly. That’s not good. Makes me dizzy a little bit too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bending over and quick head movements worsen the pain and can cause some dizziness. Sitting still provides a little relief. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… No fever, I don’t think. No… blurry vision. No… feeling sick to my stomach. My hands… sometimes they feel a little… tingly. Not all the time, but… yes, tingly. Like when they are cold. But it’s not cold. Strange. And… I am a little tired, but I am always a little tired. Old man, you know? Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Mitchell. Tingling in your hands occasionally, and feeling tired, which is understandable. No fever, no blurry vision, no nausea. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history, if that’s okay. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, medical history. Okay. Let me think… My heart… the doctor, a long time ago, said it wasn’t… regular. He gave me some pills. I took them for a while. Stopped after a few years. No problems since. And… my knees. They are very bad. Old age. No doctor for those, just… pain. That’s all. And… nothing else, I think. I had a fall last year, but nothing broken. Just… bruised. Is that enough? I’m not very good at remembering doctors’ names and things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay, Mitchell. You're doing great. So, you have a history of an irregular heartbeat that was treated with medication, and you have some knee pain. You also had a fall last year, thankfully without any fractures. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides what you mentioned for your heart in the past?
PATIENT: No, no medications now. Stopped the heart pills a long time ago, like I said. Just… pain relievers sometimes. When my knees are really bad. But not every day. Just… when I need them. I buy them at the store. Nothing special. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's good to know you're only using over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had one. Not to food, not to pills, not to anything. My wife… she was allergic to bees. But I am not. Lucky me. She would… swell up. Terrible. But me? No problems. I can eat anything, take anything. Good for a man, yes?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mitchell. No allergies is definitely a plus. Now, just a few more questions about your family history. Do you know of any family members—parents, siblings, or children—who have had similar headaches, heart problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… My mother… she had headaches, yes. Always complaining about headaches. But… just old lady headaches, I think. Not like mine. My father… he had heart trouble, like me. But he didn’t go to the doctor much. Stubborn man. And my sister… she had diabetes. But that’s all I remember. No one else… really. We didn’t talk about those things much. Is that enough? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mitchell. A history of headaches in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and diabetes in your sister. Okay, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, okay. Exam is fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please. Old bones, you know. And… if it hurts, I will tell you. I’m not afraid. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mitchell, I will be very gentle. Okay, Mitchell, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can, Doctor. There. Like that? Is that good? My eyes… they sometimes get tired. Old age. But I can see it. I think. Is it too fast? Tell me if it’s too fast.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Mitchell. You're doing great. Your eye movements are a little slow, but that’s not necessarily a cause for concern at your age. Now, can you squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that good? Not very strong, but… it's something. My hands… they are not what they used to be. Working with the trains… not easy on the hands. Is that enough squeezing? Should I squeeze harder?
DOCTOR: That’s good, Mitchell. Your grip is a little weak, but that’s understandable. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to tap your knees with this little hammer. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I am ready. Tap away. Just… be careful. Old bones, you know. Don't break anything!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. Your reflexes are a little slow, and your gait is a bit unsteady. Now, I'm going to listen to your neck. I don't hear any bruits or feel any tenderness. Everything seems normal there. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing tension headaches, likely exacerbated by your work and possibly contributing to some neck stiffness. The diminished reflexes and unsteady gait are likely age-related changes, but we'll want to keep an eye on them. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Tension headaches… you think so? That sounds… right, I think. I am always tense. Worrying about things. Old age. Work… is hard work. So, not something serious? Not… a tumor or something? I worry sometimes. My wife… she always worried. Is that what you think? Just tension? What can I do about it?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mitchell, and it’s good you asked. Based on your history and the exam findings, a tumor is very unlikely. There are no red flags suggesting anything more serious. The most likely explanation is tension headaches, possibly with some muscle strain in your neck. These are very common, especially with stress and physical exertion. To help manage this, I recommend a few things. First, try to reduce stress as much as possible. Easier said than done, I know! But things like gentle exercise, spending time with loved ones, and relaxation techniques can help. Second, try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen when you have a headache. Third, I would like you to try some gentle neck stretches a few times a day. I can show you some examples. We can also discuss some physical therapy if the stretches aren't enough. Would you like me to show you those stretches now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. The stretches would be good. I used to do some stretching… a long time ago. But I forgot. Show me what to do. And… how often? And… should I do them even when I don’t have a headache? I always worry about doing things wrong. Old man problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell, first, we’ll do a gentle neck tilt. Slowly tilt your head towards your right shoulder, keeping your shoulders relaxed. Hold it for about 15-30 seconds. Then repeat on the left side. Do this 5-10 times on each side. Next, we’ll do a neck rotation. Slowly turn your head to the right, as if you’re looking over your shoulder. Hold it for 15-30 seconds. Repeat on the left side, 5-10 times on each side. Finally, we’ll do a chin tuck. Gently pull your chin towards your chest, as if you’re making a double chin. Hold for 5-10 seconds, and repeat 10 times. It's important to do these stretches slowly and gently. Don’t force anything. You should feel a mild stretch, but not pain. And yes, you should do these stretches even when you don’t have a headache, to help prevent them. It's like exercising any other muscle. Do you feel comfortable trying those?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Tilt… rotation… chin tuck… This one feels a little… strange. Am I doing it right? It’s been a long time since I stretched. I’m afraid I’ll pull something. Old bones, you know. Maybe… maybe I should just stick to the pills. But you said… prevention is good. I will try. How often? Every day? Morning and night? Or just when I remember?
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Mitchell! The chin tuck can feel a little odd at first, but you're doing it correctly. It’s excellent you're being cautious! Don't push yourself, and stop if you feel any pain. As for how often, aim for 2-3 times a day if you can. Morning and night is ideal, but even just doing them when you remember is better than nothing. Consistency is key. We can also discuss a referral to physical therapy if you’d like more personalized guidance. They can teach you additional exercises and stretches to help manage your neck pain. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… maybe later. Let me try the stretches for a week or two. See if they help. I don’t want to bother anyone if I don’t need it. No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for your time. And… for not laughing at the old man. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mitchell. I’m glad I could help. And please, don't worry about being an "old man"! You’re taking good care of yourself by seeking medical attention and trying to improve your health. It was a pleasure meeting you. If your headaches worsen or don’t improve with the stretches, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. And remember, consistency is key! Here's a handout with the stretches we discussed, and my contact information. Have a good day, Mitchell!
