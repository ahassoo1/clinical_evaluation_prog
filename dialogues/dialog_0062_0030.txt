DOCTOR: Hi Kerriann, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in my… body odor. It’s not a bad smell, exactly, just… different. I can’t really describe it. It started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all, Kerriann. These things happen, and it's good you're bringing it up. Changes in body odor can sometimes indicate something going on, so it's worth investigating. When you say “different,” can you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay, let me think. It’s…sweeter, maybe? Not like I’m covered in perfume or anything, just a faint sweetness. And it seems to be… stronger after I’ve been working. I do a lot of physical labor with my job, laying floors, you know? It’s not like a typical workout smell though, more… floral, almost? I know it sounds weird.
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful, actually. Floral and sweeter, especially with exertion… that gives us a bit more to work with. And you’ve noticed this for a few weeks now?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Maybe four or five? It's hard to pinpoint exactly. It wasn't sudden, it just gradually became noticeable. I thought maybe it was the soap I was using, so I switched brands, but it didn’t make a difference. I haven't changed anything else – diet's the same, no new lotions or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you’ve already considered some of the simpler things like soap. And no other changes in your routine. Let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions – like diabetes, for example?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had a check-up about a year ago, and everything was fine. My doctor at the time just said I was healthy for my age. I’m on Medicare, so they do a pretty thorough job, I think. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. I do get a little arthritis in my hands sometimes, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. And you said arthritis in your hands - is that managed with medication?
PATIENT: No, not really managed. It just flares up sometimes, especially after a long day at work. I just try to take it easy when it’s bothering me, use some heat packs. I don’t take anything regularly for it. It's just a bit of an annoyance, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, actually. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. And I had a C-section when I had my daughter, but that was…oh, goodness, almost thirty years ago now! Other than that, nothing major. Just the usual bumps and bruises from work.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a tough one. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had…I think it was heart problems. He died when he was pretty young, actually, in his sixties. I don’t really know much beyond that, to be honest. My family wasn’t big on talking about health stuff. I have a sister, but we aren’t very close, and I haven’t spoken to her in years. I don’t know anything about her health history.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It's common for families not to discuss those things. We can work with what we have. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking any regular medications. Just the occasional ibuprofen for aches and pains after work. Nothing daily or anything like that. I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible. Oh, sometimes I'll take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, just ibuprofen as needed and occasional Vitamin D. And you mentioned you don’t smoke, and you drink very little alcohol, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Never been a smoker. And I maybe have a glass of wine once or twice a year, usually with a nice meal. I'm not much of a drinker. I prefer tea, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all very helpful, Kerriann. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look at your overall condition. Then, depending on what I find, we can talk about possible causes and next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Skin appears normal, no rashes or unusual pigmentation noted. Everything seems relatively normal on initial examination. The change in body odor is a bit unusual, and given the sweetness you described, we should consider a few possibilities. I want to order some blood work, just to rule out any underlying metabolic issues or diabetes, even though you said your previous check-up was normal. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood work is fine. I’d rather be safe than sorry, you know? I trust your judgment, Doctor. What kind of blood work are we talking about? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you feel that way. We’ll do a basic metabolic panel – that checks your blood sugar, kidney function, and electrolyte levels. We’ll also check your thyroid levels, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause changes in body odor. And a complete blood count just to get a general picture of your health. Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. So, no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. You can drink water. The lab will give you specific instructions when you go. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. No food after midnight, water is okay. Eight hours. Thyroid, metabolic panel, blood count… I can definitely do that. When should I go to the lab? And is there anything else I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Great. The lab is right down the hall, room 203. You can go any time tomorrow morning, after you've fasted. No special preparation other than the fasting. Just bring your insurance card. While we wait for the results, I’d also like to ask you about your stress levels. Have you been experiencing any significant stress lately?
PATIENT: Hmm. Stress… not really more than usual, I suppose. My job is physically demanding, and I’m divorced, so there's always a bit of…life stuff. But nothing major has happened recently. I try to keep busy, you know? Stay active. I do worry about my finances sometimes, that’s probably the biggest source of stress. But it’s nothing I can’t handle.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It’s good you have coping mechanisms. Sometimes, stress can contribute to changes in body odor, even if it’s not a direct cause. Alright, so to recap: we've ordered blood work to check your metabolic panel, thyroid levels, and complete blood count. You’ll need to fast beforehand. I’ve also noted your stress levels. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. That will likely be in a few days. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything pretty thoroughly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not dismiss my concerns. It's just… nice to have someone investigate it properly. I’ll go to the lab tomorrow morning, and I’ll look out for a call with the results.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I understand it can be frustrating when something feels off and you don't know why. That’s what I’m here for. We'll call you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if you notice any other symptoms – like unexplained weight loss, excessive thirst, or fatigue – please don't hesitate to call the office. Otherwise, have a good evening, and I'll talk to you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will.
