DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit silly, really. I've had the hiccups for… oh, let me think… more than two days now. Just won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for more than two days. That is a bit unusual. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started, I think, after I laughed really hard at a comedian on Tuesday night. A pretty funny guy, actually. They were just normal hiccups at first, you know, the kind you get after a fizzy drink. But they haven't stopped since. They come and go, but they're always there, lurking somewhere. It's exhausting, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. That does sound frustrating. So they started after a good laugh on Tuesday, and they’ve been persistent since then. Are they constant, or do they come in bouts?
PATIENT: They come in bouts, definitely. Not constant, thank goodness. But almost everything sets them off. Drinking water, eating… even just talking sometimes! It’s like they’re waiting for me to relax and then – hic – there they are again. It’s really disruptive at work, you know? I manage events, so I have to talk all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they’re triggered by pretty normal activities like eating, drinking, and talking. And they are interfering with your work, which is understandably stressful. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. No, not really. No fever, no stomach pain, nothing like that. I’ve just been… tired, I suppose. But that’s probably just from being kept awake by the hic… well, you know. I haven't been eating much, either, because I'm afraid of setting them off. But that's a consequence, not a cause, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no pain, just fatigue and decreased appetite likely related to trying to avoid triggering them. Have you tried anything to get rid of them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, lots of things! My grandmother always said to hold your breath, so I’ve been doing that. And drinking water upside down, like you’re supposed to. I even tried a spoonful of sugar, which didn’t do a thing. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit ridiculous. Nothing seems to work, and I'm running out of ideas.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and it's good you've tried those common remedies. It doesn't sound like those have been effective. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’m generally pretty healthy, to be honest. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was all. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I don't take any regular medication, either. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, but that’s it. I had a divorce a few years back, that was stressful, but I’m alright now. Does that count?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ivette. Life events like that definitely can contribute to overall health. No other major medical issues, no regular medications, gallbladder removal ten years ago… that’s good to know. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, thankfully. I'm not a picky eater at all. I used to get hay fever as a child, but I haven't had it in years. It seems to have gone away with age, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. And finally, do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, cancer, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had arthritis. His sister had diabetes, I believe. Nothing else really springs to mind. No history of anything serious, like heart disease or cancer, on either side of the family, thankfully. We weren’t a very long-lived family, to be honest, so it’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of hypertension, arthritis, and diabetes. Thank you for sharing that, Ivette. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look in your throat and ears. Just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. I just want these hiccups to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, could you open your mouth wide and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: "Ahhh…" Is that okay? It's a bit dry in here, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. Your throat looks a little dry, but otherwise normal. No redness or swelling. And your ears look clear as well. Okay, everything seems normal so far. Given your history and the exam findings, these persistent hiccups are likely benign, but unusual. It's possible it's a nerve irritation or a bit of a prolonged spasm. However, since they’ve been going on for over two days, and are affecting your daily life, I want to be cautious. We can try a few things, but I also want to rule out anything more serious. Would you be okay with getting a chest X-ray and some blood work just to be on the safe side?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will rule things out, then I’m happy to have the tests. I just want to get to the bottom of this. It’s really quite annoying, and it’s interfering with my work. A chest X-ray and blood work… alright. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll write you an order for both. The X-ray can be done here in the clinic, and the blood work can be done at the lab across the street. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a medication called baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help with persistent hiccups. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you respond. Here’s the prescription, and I’ll give you some instructions on how to take it. It’s important to follow the dosage carefully. I also recommend staying well-hydrated, avoiding carbonated drinks, and trying to manage your stress levels. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today to review the results and see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. A week from today is fine. Baclofen… I'll take it carefully, as you said. And I'll try to stay hydrated and avoid fizzy drinks. Stress… that’s a bit harder, but I’ll do my best. Thank you very much, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here's a printed summary of everything we discussed today, including the prescription instructions and the lab orders. Let’s get you scheduled for that follow-up. .
