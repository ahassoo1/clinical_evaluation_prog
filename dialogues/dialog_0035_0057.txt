DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well… it’s about the cancer. I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see here you were recently diagnosed with cancer. That must be a lot to take in. Can you tell me a little bit more about what you were told?
PATIENT: It is… a lot. The other doctor said it’s in my… well, he said a tumor. And it’s growing. He wanted me to get a second opinion, so here I am. I don’t really understand all the… the words he used.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed when you’re facing something like this, and medical jargon doesn’t help. Let's take things slowly. Do you know where the tumor is located?
PATIENT: He said… in my lung. My left lung, I think. It's hard to remember everything. I was so scared I don’t think I heard half of what he was saying. Is that okay? I feel bad I don’t remember more.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay, Chellsea. It’s very common to not remember everything when you’re feeling scared or anxious. Don’t worry about it at all. So, a tumor in the left lung. Do you know what kind of tumor it is?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don't think so. He said something about… cells? And that’s why it was… bad. He said they needed to do more tests. Is it important what kind of cells? I don’t want to bother you if it’s something I should already know.
DOCTOR: It's very important, Chellsea, and you're not bothering me at all. The type of cells helps us determine the best course of treatment. It looks like you had a biopsy done. Do you recall when that was?
PATIENT: Yes, I remember that. It was… maybe two weeks ago? They numbed the area, and then… they took a small piece. It didn’t hurt too bad, just felt… strange. They said it would take a while to get the results. Is that what you’re looking at now? The results?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I’m looking at. Okay, the report indicates you have… adenocarcinoma. It's a type of lung cancer that starts in the cells that make mucus. Now, before you get too worried, it's important to understand there are different stages and treatment options. Do you have a family history of cancer, Chellsea?
PATIENT: Um… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had something. She was very sick, a long time ago. I think it was… in her stomach? But she passed away before I was born, so I don't know much about it. My mother didn't talk about it much. Does that matter? It probably doesn’t. I don’t know anything about stages, either.
DOCTOR: It's good to know about your grandmother, thank you. Family history can be relevant, so it's helpful information. And it's perfectly okay that you don’t know about stages – that’s what I’m here for. Staging tells us how far the cancer has spread, which helps us determine the best treatment plan. Based on the report, it appears your cancer is… Stage 1. It means the tumor is relatively small and hasn’t spread to other parts of your body. Have you had any other symptoms, Chellsea?
PATIENT: Oh… Stage 1… that sounds… not as bad as I thought. I’ve been… tired, a lot. And I’ve had a cough, but I thought it was just a cold. It hasn’t gone away, though. And sometimes… sometimes my chest hurts. Not all the time, just… when I breathe deep. Is that normal? I’m sorry, I’m asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Chellsea. It’s good you’re asking. Fatigue, cough, and chest pain can all be symptoms of lung cancer, especially with breathing. I’d like to listen to your lungs, if that’s alright. Then I’ll check your oxygen saturation. This will give me a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Yes, please do. I just… I really appreciate you explaining everything. The other doctor… he just seemed so rushed. It’s nice to talk to someone who takes the time to… to explain things.
DOCTOR: Of course. That's my job. Okay, deep breath in… and out… good. I’m hearing some decreased breath sounds on the left side, and a few mild wheezes. Not alarming, but consistent with a tumor and inflammation. Now, let’s check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen level is 96%, which is good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Not that I know of. My mother always said I was lucky that way. She said I could take almost anything. I don’t take any regular medication, either. Just… sometimes ibuprofen, for headaches. Is that important? I feel silly bringing up headaches. It’s not like that has anything to do with cancer, right?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not silly at all, Chellsea. It's good to know everything. Ibuprofen is fine, and doesn’t interact with any potential treatments. Okay, so Stage 1 adenocarcinoma, no significant allergies, no other medications. Given your symptoms and the imaging results, I recommend we proceed with a PET scan to see if the cancer has spread anywhere else. It's a more detailed scan than what you've already had. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A PET scan… okay. If that’s what you think is best. It sounds… scary, but I trust you. I just… what if it has spread? I’m trying not to think about that, but it’s hard. I lost my husband two years ago, and… I don’t really have anyone else.
DOCTOR: I understand that’s a very scary thought, Chellsea. It’s okay to be afraid, and it’s good you’re sharing this with me. We will take things one step at a time. The PET scan will give us more information, and then we’ll discuss all your options. Even if it has spread, there are still treatments available, and we will make sure you have all the support you need. Do you have any other questions for me right now, or would you like me to explain the PET scan procedure?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. That… that sounds good. Could you explain the PET scan? What does it involve? And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m just… trying to figure out what to expect. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A PET scan stands for Positron Emission Tomography scan. It involves injecting a small amount of radioactive sugar into your bloodstream. The cancer cells absorb more of this sugar than normal cells, so it helps us see if there are any other areas of cancer in your body. You’ll lie on a table inside a scanner – it's a large, donut-shaped machine – for about 30-60 minutes. It’s painless, but you need to lie very still. After the scan, you’ll need to drink a lot of fluids to help flush out the radioactive sugar. The results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Okay… a radioactive sugar. That sounds… weird. But not painful, that’s good. And 2-3 days for the results. I can manage that. I think. Drink a lot of fluids… I can do that. What happens if they find something? What are the options? Just… so I know what to expect. I don't want to be surprised. I really appreciate you explaining everything.
DOCTOR: Of course. If the PET scan shows the cancer has spread, the options depend on how far it has spread, and to where. Generally, we’d discuss chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and potentially surgery. For Stage 1, since yours is relatively small, surgery is often the primary treatment option. We would also discuss immunotherapy, which uses your own immune system to fight the cancer. We’ll discuss the risks and benefits of each option, and we’ll make a plan together. It’s important to remember that there are many different treatments available, and we’ll find the best one for you. Before we move on, I want to make sure you know about the support resources available to you. We have social workers and counselors who can help you cope with the emotional challenges of cancer. Would you like me to connect you with them?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… helpful. I don’t really have anyone to talk to, and… I’m scared. A social worker… that sounds good. And surgery… is it… dangerous? I’m sorry, I’m asking so many questions. I just… I need to know everything.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions, Chellsea. It’s good to be informed, and I’m happy to answer them. Surgery, like any procedure, has risks. But in your case, since it’s Stage 1, it’s considered a relatively low-risk procedure. The risks include infection, bleeding, and pain, but we’ll take all the necessary precautions to minimize those risks. We’d discuss the specific risks and benefits of the surgery with the surgeon, and you’d have plenty of time to ask questions. I'm going to schedule a PET scan for you next week. I will also have a social worker reach out to you within the next day or so. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… you’ve really helped me feel a little bit better. I was so scared, and… I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t explained everything so clearly. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re in this together. The nurse will come in shortly to give you the paperwork for the PET scan. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. .
