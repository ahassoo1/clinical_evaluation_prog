DOCTOR: Hi Nani, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Please, call me Nani. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s… difficult to explain. I just feel… low. Very low. And I thought it best to get it checked, you know? I don’t want it dragging on.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani, that’s perfectly reasonable. It’s good you’re getting this checked out. “Low” can mean a lot of things, so let’s try to narrow it down. Can you tell me a little more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s not… sadness, exactly. Though there is some of that. It’s more like… everything is muted. Like looking at the world through a grey veil. I don’t enjoy things like I used to. My grandchildren visit, and… well, I should be thrilled, but it feels… distant. And I sleep a lot. More than I need to, I think. It’s hard to get up in the mornings. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand, Nani. That sounds really difficult, and it’s good you’re able to articulate that. It's helpful to know it’s not just sadness, but this feeling of being… disconnected and fatigued. When did you start noticing these feelings?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It wasn't sudden, you see. It crept up on me, bit by bit. Perhaps… six months ago? Around the time my ex-husband moved even further away. Not that he matters anymore, mind you. But it was a change. A disruption. And things just… haven't felt right since. It's a bit hazy, to be honest. Six months… give or take. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Nani. Knowing the timeline helps us figure things out. Six months of this… that tells me we need to explore this a bit further. You mentioned a disruption with your ex-husband moving. Was that a particularly stressful event for you, even if you don’t feel it should have been?
PATIENT: Stressful? Well… it wasn’t the move itself, exactly. It was… the finality of it, I suppose. We haven’t spoken properly in years, you understand. But knowing he’s even further removed… it brought up a lot of old feelings, regrets, things I thought I’d dealt with. Silly, isn’t it? An old man moving a few states over causing me this trouble. I’m a strong woman, Doctor. I’ve dealt with worse. But… it stirred something up. A lot of… loneliness, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Nani. Often, things we think shouldn’t bother us do, and that's perfectly valid. It sounds like that move re-opened some old emotional wounds. Besides the loneliness, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My appetite hasn’t been the best. I used to love cooking, Nigerian cooking, proper jollof rice and stew, but now… it feels like a chore. And I've lost interest in my garden. Used to spend hours out there, tending to my vegetables and flowers. Now… it just sits there, overgrown. And… I get irritated easily. Small things, you understand? A grandchild dropping crumbs, a slow driver in front of me. I wouldn’t normally get bothered by such things. It’s… unlike me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani, that’s helpful. Loss of appetite, loss of interest in hobbies, increased irritability… those are all things we need to consider. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep other than sleeping more?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it. I wake up… very early. Long before sunrise. And I can't get back to sleep. I just lie there, staring at the ceiling. Thinking. Mostly about… nothing, really. Just my thoughts running around in circles. And I feel… anxious, even when there’s nothing to be anxious about. It’s a strange feeling. Like a weight on my chest. And… sometimes I feel quite shaky. Not all the time, but… often enough to notice. Do you follow? It’s all rather unpleasant, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, Nani, I absolutely follow. Early morning awakening, difficulty falling back asleep, anxiety, shakiness… these are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Though I’m generally a healthy woman, all things considered. Years of hard work, you see. I had high blood pressure, years ago. Controlled with medication, thankfully. And… arthritis in my knees. That’s why I don’t ski as much anymore. Aside from that… nothing serious. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. Oh, and I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but that cleared up completely. Is that sufficient? Or do you need more details? I have a list at home, if you require it.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Nani. High blood pressure, arthritis, and a past history of pneumonia. And you said your blood pressure is controlled with medication?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Controlled. I take it every morning, religiously. A small pill, nothing bothersome. And I see my primary care doctor regularly to monitor it. She’s a good woman, Doctor Adebayo. Very thorough. She's the one who suggested I see someone about… this. She said I might be suffering from something more than just… old age. Which, frankly, is a bit insulting, but I understand her concern.
DOCTOR: I understand. Dr. Adebayo sounds like a good doctor, and it's good you have a regular check-up. And don't worry, Nani, it's good to rule things out. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Just the occasional ibuprofen for my knees, when they’re particularly sore. Nothing regular, mind you. And a vitamin D supplement, Doctor Adebayo recommended that as well. She said I wasn’t getting enough sunlight. But that’s all. No other pills, potions, or anything of the sort. I prefer to rely on good food and hard work, if you don’t mind me saying so. Though lately… even that hasn’t been helping much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nani. Just ibuprofen as needed and vitamin D. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Perhaps that’s why I’ve lived so long. And… well, I haven’t spent much time around things that might cause allergies, if you don’t mind me saying so. Mostly indoors, working, you see. Not much pollen around my kitchen. Is there anything else you need to know? I’m starting to feel a bit tired, if you don’t mind my saying so. It’s all rather draining, talking about myself.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Nani. We’ve covered a lot. No known allergies is good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, things like that. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Go ahead. I suppose it can’t hurt. Though I doubt you’ll find anything wrong with my heart. I’ve always had a strong one. But… do as you need to, Doctor. Just… try not to take too long, if you don’t mind my saying so. I have some grandchildren expecting me later this afternoon. And frankly, I'm starting to feel a bit… faint. Just a little bit, mind you. But I think a lie-down might be in order later.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, 145/90. Not dangerously high, but something we should keep an eye on. I also noticed a slight tremor in your hands when I checked your reflexes. It’s subtle, but present. Overall, everything seems within normal limits for your age and medical history, but these are things to note. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family suffered from depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we don’t talk much about such things. Not openly, you see. But… my aunt, my mother’s sister, she was… different. Quiet. Withdrawn. She spent a lot of time alone, and… well, she died young. They said it was a heart condition, but… there were whispers. Whispers about her sadness. And my cousin, on my father’s side, he drank. A lot. To… quiet his demons, he said. But… that’s about it. We didn’t have… doctors, you see. We had… faith healers, herbal remedies, strong spirits. Not much talk of… depression or anxiety. Is that helpful? I’m afraid my family history isn’t very… clear. Mostly just stories and whispers.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nani. Stories and whispers are helpful. It sounds like there may be a history of mood issues in your family, even if it wasn't formally diagnosed. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I've never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. My mother always said it was the devil's brew. And smoking? Never. It’s bad for your health, you see. And recreational drugs? Don't be ridiculous. I’m a respectable woman, Doctor. I have grandchildren! I get enough excitement from tending to my garden and cooking Nigerian food. No need for anything… artificial. Though, lately… even those things haven’t been bringing me much joy. But that’s beside the point. No, Doctor. I lead a very… clean life. Always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani. That’s good to know. A clean lifestyle is certainly a positive. Now, thinking about your daily routine, are you generally around other people, or do you spend a lot of time alone?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit of both, Doctor. Since my divorce, it’s mostly been me. I have my grandchildren visiting, of course, but they’re not here all the time. And I have a few friends, we chat on the phone, sometimes have tea. But… mostly it's just me. I used to be very active in the community, volunteering at the church, helping with the local school. But… my energy hasn’t been the best lately. And… frankly, I haven’t felt much like socializing. It’s easier to just… stay home. Keep to myself. Which, I suppose, isn’t very healthy, is it? But it’s… comfortable. It’s less draining. Do you understand? It's easier to avoid disappointment when you don't expect much.
DOCTOR: Yes, Nani, I understand perfectly. It sounds like you've experienced some social isolation, and that your energy levels have been impacting your ability to connect with others. Based on everything you’ve told me—the low mood, loss of interest in hobbies, sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, increased anxiety, and family history—it's possible you are experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes first. I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels, vitamin D levels, and basic metabolic panel. These tests will help us identify any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Blood work sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary, then do it. Though I doubt it will show anything. I’m a strong woman, Doctor. I don’t get sick easily. But… if it will put your mind at ease, then I’m willing. Just… try not to poke me too much. And please, try to be quick. I have some grandchildren expecting me later. I promised to bake them some chin chin. It wouldn't do to keep them waiting. Are there any instructions I need to follow before the test? And… where will I be able to get it done?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nani. I'll be as quick as possible, and I promise it won’t be painful. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare for the test – just come on an empty stomach. The lab is just down the hall, Room 3. I’ll write you a requisition form, and the lab technician will take it from there. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. After the results come back – usually within a few days – we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any thoughts of harming yourself, please don’t hesitate to contact me or go to the nearest emergency room. Here’s the requisition form, and a brochure on managing low mood. We will talk soon. Do you have any questions for me before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. Thank you for your time. And thank you for… listening. It's good to know someone is taking me seriously. I suppose I'll go get this blood work done, and then… try to enjoy my afternoon with my grandchildren. Though, frankly, I don’t have much energy for enjoying anything these days. But I’ll try. Yes, I'll try.
