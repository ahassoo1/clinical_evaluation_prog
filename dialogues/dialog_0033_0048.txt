DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor…Dech-ene, is it? It’s just… things haven’t been right, lately. My wife, Srey, she's the one who made the appointment, really. She says I’ve been… confused. I don’t like being told I’m confused, mind you. I've always been a very clear thinker. But… I forget where I put things. Small things, mostly. And sometimes… I just don't know what day it is. It's very irritating.
DOCTOR: Right. “Confused.” Yes. And how long has this… irritation, as you put it, been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It's hard to say exactly. A few months, I suppose. Maybe longer. It started slowly. Srey noticed it first, of course. She always notices everything. I just thought I was… preoccupied. I’ve been working on that mosaic for Mrs. Henderson, very intricate work, you know. Lots of tiny tiles. That'll take the focus off things, naturally. But it's gotten worse. More frequent. Yesterday, I went to the market for fish, and I couldn’t remember why I was there. Standing right in front of the fishmonger! It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: And this mosaic… how much time are you spending on it each day, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, a good bit. Most days, six, eight hours easily. It’s a large piece. Mrs. Henderson is very particular. She wants every tile just so. I’ve been a tile setter for… well, for a long time. Since I was a young man, really. Always prided myself on my precision. But this one… it's demanding. I don't get much chance to rest, you understand. Srey tries to get me to slow down, but a craftsman has to finish his work, doesn’t he? It’s a matter of… honour. Though, maybe she’s right. Maybe I am pushing myself too hard. But I doubt that's the reason for all this… confusion.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s try to be systematic. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Like… a cold? I had a bit of a cough last month, but that's gone now. Other than… well, the forgetting, and not knowing the date sometimes. And… sometimes I feel a little unsteady on my feet. Not falling, mind you, just… wobbly. Like I might. And… now that I think about it, I haven’t been sleeping very well. I wake up several times a night. But I’ve always been a light sleeper. Srey says I talk in my sleep too. She doesn’t understand what I’m saying, though. Khmer, mostly, I suppose. She doesn't speak the language. Is that what you mean by symptoms? It’s all very… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Khmer… Yes. Alright. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Well, Srey makes excellent food, always has. I still enjoy my meals. Though, I haven't been as hungry lately, I suppose. Not a huge difference, mind you. Maybe I take smaller portions. But I still eat. Rice, fish, vegetables… the usual. She makes a wonderful fish amok, you know. Very fragrant. I suppose if I was really unwell, I wouldn’t be eating at all. It’s just… things don’t taste quite as strong as they used to, perhaps. Not that I'm complaining. Srey is a very good cook. I just… notice things. A craftsman notices details, you understand. It’s part of the job.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had malaria when I was a young man, living in the countryside. Very bad fever. But that was… a long time ago. And my knees ache sometimes, getting old, you know. Srey rubs them with balm. Nothing serious. I’ve never been one for going to the doctor, to be honest. Always preferred to tough things out. Srey insisted on this appointment, she worries too much. I've had no other… significant illnesses. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. Just a bit of aches and pains. Old age, mostly. I’ve lived a good life, a hard life, but a good one. I’m a strong man, usually. It’s just… this confusion is unsettling. It's not like me.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see... Nothing major. When I was in the service, they removed my appendix. Very quick, back in the 1970s. And… oh, yes! A small growth on my back, a few years ago. Srey insisted on having it removed. A simple procedure, nothing to worry about. And… that’s it, I think. No broken bones, no major operations. Just the appendix and the growth. Nothing that would explain… all of this. Honestly, Doctor, I don't understand what's happening. I feel… diminished. A craftsman should be precise, should be strong. This confusion… it’s making me feel useless.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my father lived to be quite old, a very strong man. He was a rice farmer. But he… he wasn't very clear in his later years. Srey says it runs in the family, this… fading. But I always dismissed it. I thought I was stronger. My mother died young, illness. And my sister… she had some problems with her memory, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t recall the details. We didn't have much contact, to be honest. It's not something we talked about. They lived in the countryside, a very different life. I’ve always been… independent. I don’t rely on others. This confusion… it’s making me feel vulnerable. It's not like me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. My eyesight is still quite good for my age, you know. I’ve always had steady hands. There. Is that alright? Perfectly steady, aren’t I? Though, sometimes… I do find myself squinting a bit when I’m working on those intricate mosaics. Very small tiles, you understand. Requires a lot of concentration. But my eyes… they’ve always been reliable. Perfectly reliable.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. Is that alright? Strong grip, isn’t it? Still plenty of strength left in these hands. I’ve been a tile setter for a long time, you know. Requires a lot of physical work. I can still lift heavy loads, though I try not to these days. Srey tells me to take it easy. But a craftsman needs his strength. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Alright. Stand up and walk for me, please. A straight line.
PATIENT: Very well. There. Is that alright? A little unsteady, perhaps. My knees ache sometimes, you know. Srey says it’s the weather. But I can still walk. Perfectly capable, still. It's just… sometimes I feel a little wobbly. A little off-balance. But nothing to worry about. Is that straight enough?
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you. We'll need to do some blood work to rule out some deficiencies. And I'm going to order an MRI of the brain, just to get a clearer picture. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: An MRI? An MRI… What for? Is something seriously wrong? I told you, it’s just a little confusion. A little forgetfulness. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. A hard life. Perhaps it’s just… old age. I don’t like the sound of an MRI. Is it painful? Will it take a long time? I have work to do, you know. Mrs. Henderson is expecting that mosaic. And… I don't understand why you need to look at my brain. I feel perfectly fine, otherwise. A little wobbly, perhaps, but… fine.
DOCTOR: It’s not painful. It’s a scan, to see what’s going on. It's best to be thorough, Mr. Lason. We need to rule things out. It’s standard practice. And frankly, your symptoms warrant further investigation. I'll have my nurse schedule it for you. It will take about an hour. We’ll get the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to refer you to a neurologist for a consultation. They specialize in these kinds of issues. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A neurologist? You think I need to see a specialist? Is it that serious? I told you, it’s just a little confusion! A little forgetfulness! I've always been a clear thinker. A craftsman needs his mind. I don’t like the sound of this at all. Are you saying I'm losing my mind, Doctor? Because that’s what this sounds like. And I don’t appreciate being told I’m losing my mind. I still have work to do. I have a reputation to uphold. Mrs. Henderson is counting on me. And… and Srey will be very worried. This is… unsettling. Very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I am not saying you are “losing your mind.” I’m a physician. I’m suggesting we investigate the cause of your symptoms. It could be a simple vitamin deficiency, or something else entirely. But we need to rule out more serious possibilities. The neurologist will perform a more detailed neurological exam. It's a standard protocol. I understand you're concerned, but this is the responsible course of action. My nurse will contact you to schedule both appointments. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I suppose not. Just… I don't like this. I don't like it at all. I've always been a practical man. Always solved my own problems. Are you sure it's not just old age, Doctor? That's all I want to know. Are you sure it's not just… time catching up with me? I just… I don’t want to be a burden. Not to Srey, not to anyone. Very well. Schedule the appointments. But I still think you’re overreacting. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose.
