DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been getting in my side, mostly. And…trouble with waterworks, if you understand me. It keeps happening, you see. It's been going on for a little while now, and my daughter suggested I come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain in your side and some trouble with urination. Let's start with the pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a dull ache, low down on my left side, mostly. Sometimes it feels like a pressure, you know? And it comes and goes. Some days are worse than others. I’ve noticed it seems to flare up after I’ve eaten, but I’m not sure. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache, low on the left side, sometimes a pressure, and it seems to be worse after eating. Hmm. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say precisely. It's not new new, you understand. It’s been… on and off for maybe six months, I think? But it’s been more frequent lately, and that’s what worried me enough to finally come see someone. The trouble with the waterworks, that’s come on in the last couple of months as well, along with the pain getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of intermittent pain, worsening recently, and trouble with urination for the past two months. Let’s talk about that trouble with urination. Can you describe what you mean by "trouble"?
PATIENT: Well, it's… I have to go to the bathroom quite often, you see. More often than I used to. And sometimes it burns when I go. Not every time, mind you, but often enough that it’s… unpleasant. And I don’t always feel like I’ve emptied my bladder completely, even after I’ve just been. Does that… explain it alright? It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, I suppose.
DOCTOR: No, it’s perfectly alright, Mr. Espinueva. These things happen, and it’s important to talk about them. Frequent urination, burning sensation, and a feeling of incomplete emptying… Okay. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? No, not that I’ve seen. No, thankfully. It’s just the burning and the feeling like I need to go all the time. My daughter, she said it could be a water infection, maybe? But I didn't want to just assume. That's why I thought I best come in and get your opinion, Doctor. I do try to drink plenty of water, but even then...
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood in the urine. Your daughter’s suggestion of a urinary infection is certainly a possibility. Now, let's go through some other things. Have you had any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever or chills that I've noticed. I've felt a bit tired sometimes, but I put that down to my age, you know? Old bones getting creaky. I haven't been feeling generally unwell, just this pain and the trouble with going to the bathroom. Is it alright if I ask what you think it might be? I'm a bit worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Espinueva. It’s good to ask questions. Based on what you’ve told me, a urinary tract infection is a strong possibility, but we need to rule out other things as well. To do that, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. And then I'd like to order a urine test to check for infection and other issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A physical exam and a urine test… yes, alright. I trust your judgement. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to find out what’s going on. Where do we start with the exam? Just tell me what you’d like me to do. I hope it won't be too unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently press on different areas to check for any tenderness. Then, I’d like to do a quick digital rectal exam, just to check the prostate, if that's alright. It’s a standard procedure, and it will give me some more information. We’ll take it slowly, and if it’s uncomfortable at any point, please let me know.
PATIENT: Oh. A rectal exam… right. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I suppose it must be. It’s just… not something I was looking forward to, if you understand. But yes, alright. Let’s get it over with. Just… try to be gentle, please. I'm an old man, you know. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Espinueva. I will be as gentle as possible. I understand your concern. First, let's listen to your abdomen. Deep breaths, please… Alright, everything sounds normal so far. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not there, Doctor. Just feels… normal, I suppose. A bit of pressure, but no sharp pain. Maybe a little uncomfortable, but nothing too bad. And… is it alright if I ask what you're looking for exactly? I’m just trying to understand what's going on, you see. It's hard to relax when I don't know what you’re doing, if you understand. It's not that I don't trust you, but… old habits, I suppose. A bit of a worrier, always have been.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Espinueva. It’s perfectly reasonable to ask. I'm checking for any areas of tenderness, swelling, or masses. I’m also trying to get a sense of the size and shape of your organs. Now, for the digital rectal exam. I will be wearing a glove, and I'll use a lubricant to make it as comfortable as possible. I'm checking the size and shape of your prostate gland, and looking for any abnormalities. This will help me rule out any potential problems there. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Alright. As ready as I’ll ever be, I suppose. Just… please be quick, Doctor. And gentle, as you promised. It’s not a pleasant thought, if I’m being honest. I hope we find something out from all this discomfort. Just… let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. This will only take a moment. I’m going to apply some lubricant, and then gently insert my finger. Just try to relax as much as possible. Alright. I did not feel any significant masses, and your prostate feels slightly enlarged, which is common for someone your age. It wasn't particularly tender, but it’s a bit firm. Now, I’ll order that urine test. It will tell us if you have an infection and help us rule out other causes for your symptoms. It will take a little while to get the results back. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh. Slightly enlarged… that doesn’t sound too good, does it? But not tender is good, I suppose. And I understand it’s common for my age, you said? So, it could just be… a bit of an infection, then? Is that what you're thinking? And how long will we have to wait for the results, Doctor? I’m not good at waiting, you see. It makes me worry even more. And… will I need any medicine right away?
DOCTOR: It's good you asked, Mr. Espinueva. Slightly enlarged is very common with age, and doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. It's when it becomes significantly enlarged or tender that we become concerned. Yes, an infection is definitely a possibility, and that's what we'll be checking for with the urine test. As for the results, it usually takes about 24 to 48 hours for the lab to get them back to us. We'll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild antibiotic as a precaution. It’s unlikely to cause any harm, and it may help clear up any potential infection. It’s a standard procedure while we wait for the results. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A mild antibiotic as a precaution… yes, alright. Better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. And 24 to 48 hours… I can manage that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel much better. And… is there anything I should be doing while we wait? Drinking more water, or… anything like that? I don't want to make things worse. And… will I need to come back for another visit after we get the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. Yes, definitely continue to drink plenty of water – at least eight glasses a day. It will help flush out any potential infection and keep your urinary tract healthy. Avoid caffeinated drinks and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. And try to urinate whenever you feel the urge – don't hold it in. As for a follow-up visit, yes, I'd like to see you in a week, regardless of the results, just to check how you’re feeling and discuss the next steps. We can schedule that now, if you like. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, a week sounds fine, Doctor. Plenty of water, no caffeine, no alcohol, and don't hold it in… I can manage that. And scheduling the visit now is good, gets it out of the way. Yes, please go ahead and schedule that for me. I appreciate all your help. You've been very kind and patient with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: Alright, I have you scheduled for a follow-up appointment next Thursday at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfect, Doctor. Next Thursday at 10:00 AM. I'll make sure to be here. Thank you again for everything. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, or at least what you're checking for. I think that’s everything, isn’t it? I suppose I should get going, then.
DOCTOR: Yes, I think that’s everything for today, Mr. Espinueva. Just remember to drink plenty of water, and if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as a fever, severe pain, or blood in your urine – please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to help. Here’s the prescription for the antibiotic, and the appointment card for next week. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Espinueva. And try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will do that. And I’ll try not to worry. Easier said than done, mind you! But I will. You have a good day too, Doctor. And thank you again for everything.
