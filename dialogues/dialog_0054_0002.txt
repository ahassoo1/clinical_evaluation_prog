DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brought me in? Let me think… it’s something with… going to the bathroom. It’s hard, you know? Not easy like it used to be. My husband, he says I take too long in there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with bowel movements. Could you tell me a little more about what “hard” means?
PATIENT: Bowel… oh, you mean…pooping? Yes. It’s not… pushing isn’t the right word… it’s just… takes effort. And sometimes, it doesn’t… come out all the way. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A little while ago, I think. Things just…slowed down.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for explaining. It's perfectly alright to discuss these things. It sounds like you're experiencing both difficulty initiating a bowel movement and a feeling of incomplete evacuation. You mentioned it’s been happening for a “little while.” Could you estimate how long?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A little while… hmm… maybe… a few months? Maybe longer. I get confused with dates, you see. My mind isn’t what it used to be. It’s not sudden, not like a stomach bug or anything. Just…gradual. Like…the water slowing down in the pipe, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual change over months. And you’ve described it nicely – like the water slowing down in a pipe. That’s helpful. Besides the difficulty and feeling of incomplete evacuation, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes…let me think. Oh! Sometimes…sometimes it’s very thin. Not like normal. And… sometimes, a little blood. Not much, just…a spot. My husband noticed that’s why he told me to come see you. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s good your husband is looking out for you. The changes you’re describing – thin stools and spotting blood – are important. Have you experienced any abdominal pain or cramping along with these changes?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really pain. More like… discomfort. A little ache, low down. Not sharp, just… there. It comes and goes, you know? Doesn't keep me up at night or anything. Mostly just…notice it after I try to go to the bathroom. And… I’ve been feeling a little tired lately, now that you mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort in the lower abdomen, especially after attempting a bowel movement, and some fatigue. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… oh dear. That’s a good question. I don’t know… my daughter usually tells me if I’m losing weight. She’s very observant. I haven’t asked her, and I haven’t really been paying attention. I eat pretty much the same as always. Maybe my clothes feel a little looser, but I thought that was just… old age.
DOCTOR: That’s fair. It’s easy to attribute changes to getting older. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… The doctor told me I have…high blood pressure. A long time ago. I take a little white pill for it, every morning. And… I had a bad hip once, a long time ago. They fixed it with a new hip, though! That was good. I don’t remember much else, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with a white pill, and a previous hip replacement. Have you ever had any surgeries besides the hip replacement?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Oh! I had my gallbladder out. A long time ago. My daughter told me that too. She keeps track of these things. It hurt for a little while after, but I’m fine now. Nothing else, I think. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is… like a sieve. Everything just… slips away.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s very common to have some memory difficulties, especially as we get older. Your daughter sounds very helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – things like colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or other digestive problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother…she had… something with her stomach, I think. She was always sick. But I don’t know what it was. It was a long time ago. And… my brother, he had a weak heart. But he smoked too much. Everyone on my side of the family was very strong, though. They all lived long lives, even if they had some troubles. I don't really know much about what caused their troubles, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. It's common for family medical histories to be incomplete. Okay. Lastly, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not really. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, that I remember. Sometimes I get a little itchy after eating shrimp, but that’s all. Nothing serious. And I don't use any fancy creams or anything like that. Just… soap and water.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It's very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me – the difficulty with bowel movements, the incomplete evacuation, the thin stools, the spotting of blood, and the discomfort – I’d like to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle, if you don't mind. My old bones aren’t as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, I’ll lightly palpate, or feel, your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. I'll explain everything as I go. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Explain as you go, that's helpful. I’m a little nervous, but I know you’re trying to help. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, I'm just listening to the sounds in your abdomen. I’m checking to see if everything sounds normal. The bowel sounds are present, though a little quiet. That's not necessarily a cause for concern, but we’ll keep that in mind. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or masses. I’ll let you know if I feel anything unusual. This might feel a little strange, but shouldn’t be painful. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. I’m noticing a little bit of tenderness in your lower left quadrant. It's not severe, but it's worth noting. Are you feeling any pain right now when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes… a little. Just a little ache. Not sharp, like I said, but…there. It’s funny…it feels a little better when I push back. It's a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information, Ms. Stoffregen. The fact that it feels a little better when you push back suggests there might be some muscle tension in the area. Now, I’m going to do a quick rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. I know this is a sensitive area, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Would you like me to explain what I'll be doing, or would you prefer I just proceed?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a rectal exam? Well… I suppose I should know what you’re doing. Explain it to me, if you don’t mind, Doctor. I trust you, but… it’s a little embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. It is a sensitive exam, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a little embarrassed. I'm going to insert a gloved and lubricated finger into your rectum to check for any abnormalities, like masses, tenderness, or blood. It will only be for a few seconds. It helps me to assess the lower part of your colon and check for any signs of inflammation, polyps, or other issues. We can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. I'll let you know what I'm doing as I go. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Just… quick, like you said. And tell me what you’re doing. Quick and tell me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m going to ask you to lean forward slightly. I’m applying a little lubrication now. Then, I'm gently inserting my finger into your rectum. This may feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’m just checking for any masses or tenderness… …I’m feeling the walls of your rectum now. Everything feels smooth, but I do notice a small area of tenderness on the left side… It's not large, but it’s worth noting. Okay, that’s all done. I’m seeing a small amount of stool on the glove, which is normal. No blood was detected. The exam was quick, as promised. I noted the tenderness on the left side of your rectum. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the findings from the exam, I'm thinking we should order some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. What kind of tests? Are they… painful?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I think a couple of tests would be helpful. First, I want to order a Complete Blood Count to check for signs of inflammation or anemia. It’s a simple blood draw, and shouldn’t be too painful – just a quick pinch. Second, I want to order a Stool Occult Blood Test to check for any hidden blood in your stool. You’ll need to collect a small sample at home. Finally, I think a Colonoscopy would be the most helpful test. It involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It does require some bowel preparation beforehand, which can be a little unpleasant, but it gives us the clearest picture of what’s going on. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a camera? And…prep? The blood test… that’s alright. The stool test too, I suppose. But a camera… and prep? What does prep mean, exactly? I don't think I can do something unpleasant, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Stoffregen. A Colonoscopy is the most thorough way to investigate these issues. The “prep” involves drinking a special liquid solution the day before the test to completely empty your colon. It can cause some diarrhea and cramping, which is the unpleasant part. However, it's essential for a clear view during the test. We'll provide detailed instructions, and there are different options for the prep solution, so we can find one that might be more tolerable for you. Alternatively, we could consider a CT Colonography, which is a special type of CT scan that can visualize the colon. It requires less bowel preparation than a traditional colonoscopy, but it doesn’t allow us to take biopsies if needed. We can discuss the pros and cons of each test. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A CT… what was that? Less… unpleasant? No biopsies… that sounds better. I don’t like the idea of taking things out. If that CT scan doesn't need much prep, maybe that’s the best option. A camera sounds scary, and I don’t want anything taken out. Yes, let’s talk about that CT scan. What exactly does it involve? And how long does it take?
DOCTOR: Okay, a CT Colonography, sometimes called a virtual colonoscopy, is a good alternative. It involves lying on a table while a special CT scanner takes images of your colon. Before the test, you will need to drink a special solution to help inflate your colon with air. This helps to get a clearer picture of the colon walls. The scan itself only takes a few minutes – about 10-15 minutes. After the scan, the radiologist will analyze the images to look for any abnormalities. The main disadvantage is that it’s not as thorough as a traditional colonoscopy. If we find anything suspicious, we might need to do a colonoscopy afterward to take a biopsy or remove any polyps. However, it does require significantly less bowel preparation – typically just drinking a special liquid a few hours before the test. Does that sound more manageable for you, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: A few hours… yes, that sounds much better. No camera, less prep… I think that’s the one for me. What do I need to do to schedule that CT scan? And will my insurance cover it? I’m on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I think that's a very good choice, Ms. Stoffregen. I will write you a referral for a CT Colonography. You can schedule the appointment at [Clinic Name/Radiology Center]. They will be able to verify your Medicare coverage, but generally, CT Colonography is covered for individuals who are at risk for colon cancer. I'll also write you a prescription for a bowel prep solution. They’ll give you specific instructions on when and how to take it. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully to ensure a clear view during the scan. Before you go, do you have any questions about the CT scan or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… make sure they know I’m old, and don’t want anything unpleasant. You’ve been very patient with me, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m happy I could help. I will make a note on your chart about your concerns, and I will make sure the radiology center is aware. If you have any questions or concerns after the scan, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here are your referral and prescription. I wish you all the best, and I’ll see you for a follow-up appointment after your scan.
PATIENT: .
