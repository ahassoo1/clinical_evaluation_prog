DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, feels like a tight band. Been botherin' me for… oh, maybe a week now? Not constant, comes and goes, but when it is there, it’s a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: A week, you say. And a “tight band” sensation… right. Is there anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I haven't really noticed anything specific, to be honest. Maybe… when I’m really concentratin’ on somethin’ for a long time? Like lookin’ at numbers, doin’ finances for clients. But even then, not always. It just… happens. And it doesn’t seem to get better with anything either, not really. Tried some over-the-counter pain pills, didn’t touch it.
DOCTOR: Finances… well, that’s hardly surprising. Stress, naturally. Has this been a recurring issue, Mr. Gibbel, or is this a new development?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, not usually like this. I mean, I get a little tension sometimes, everyone does, right? But this… this is different. It’s more… persistent. And it doesn’t feel like a normal tension headache, if that makes sense. It's more… deep. I haven’t had one this bad in… well, a long time, maybe ever. I'm 84, Doctor, things change! But usually a little rest does the trick. This one… not so much.
DOCTOR: "Deep," you say. Alright. And you've tried rest, with minimal effect. Any other symptoms accompanying these headaches?
PATIENT: No, not really. No dizziness, no blurry vision, no nausea or anything like that. Just the headache. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, but I figured that's just from gettin' old and sleepin' funny. I haven’t felt sick or anything, just… uncomfortable. It’s mostly just the headache, really. It doesn’t keep me from sleepin’ or eatin’, or anything, but it's a worry, you know? Don't like feelin' this way.
DOCTOR: No associated symptoms… Very well. Let’s move on. Do you have any significant medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see… I had pneumonia when I was younger, maybe 40 years ago? Nothing serious, recovered just fine. And my blood pressure used to be a little high, but it's been pretty stable lately, I get it checked every six months. Other than that… not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, all things considered. My wife, bless her heart, had some issues with her knees before she passed, but that was a few years back. I try to stay active, you know? Walkin’ a little, keepin’ busy. It's important.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia… and controlled hypertension. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. Always avoided them if I could. I always figured if it wasn’t absolutely necessary, it wasn't worth the risk. Still feelin' pretty good for an old man, you know? I mostly just try to take care of myself, eat right, get some exercise, and stay out of trouble. Worked pretty well so far! Though, this headache… this is somethin' new. It's got me a little concerned.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have you follow my finger…and look left…right… Any issues with your vision?
PATIENT: No, no problems with my vision. Seems pretty good to me. I still read the newspaper every day, you know? And I can see my clients just fine. Though I do need my glasses for close up work, of course. Everything looks clear. Just a little tired sometimes, but that's just gettin' old, I reckon. Though I am worried about the headache...
DOCTOR: Reflexes are intact. Cranial nerves appear normal. It's likely a tension headache, exacerbated by stress. I recommend limiting your workload and ensuring adequate rest. Over-the-counter analgesics may provide some relief, though you've already indicated they’re ineffective. I can prescribe a muscle relaxant if you wish, but I don’t anticipate significant improvement.
PATIENT: Well… that’s… not what I was hopin’ to hear, Doctor. I mean, I am tryin’ to rest, but I have clients to take care of, you know? Can’t just put my life on hold because of a headache. And I really don’t like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. Is there… anything else we can do? Maybe something to find out why I’m gettin’ these headaches in the first place? I don't want to just mask the pain, I want to fix it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gibbel, with all due respect, you are 84 years of age. A certain degree of discomfort is to be expected. While I understand your concerns, extensive testing is unlikely to yield significant results and would be… unnecessary. However, if it will alleviate your anxiety, we could consider a CT scan of your head to rule out any serious pathology, though I highly doubt we will find anything. It will involve radiation exposure and is not without risk. Would you like me to order one?
PATIENT: Oh… radiation exposure… that doesn’t sound good. No, no, I don't think so. I… I don’t want to be exposed to radiation. I guess… I guess I'll just try to manage it. But what if it gets worse? What if it is somethin' serious? Is there anything… anything at all I can do, besides rest and pills, to keep an eye on it? Like… symptoms I should watch out for, that would mean I need to come back right away? I don't want to be caught off guard.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you experience any sudden changes in vision, weakness on one side of your body, difficulty speaking, or a severe, unrelenting headache – unlike anything you’ve experienced before – you must seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, continue with conservative management. I will document these instructions in your chart. Are we finished here, Mr. Gibbel?
PATIENT: Sudden changes in vision… weakness… difficulty speaking… Yes, I can remember that. That’s… helpful, thank you. Yes, I think we’re finished. I appreciate you takin’ the time, Doctor. I still wish we could’ve figured out why I’m gettin’ these headaches, but… I understand. Thank you again. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day as well, Mr. Gibbel. .
