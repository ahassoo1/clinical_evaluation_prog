DOCTOR: Hi Claudene, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, hello. Well, it's… it’s this trouble I’ve been having. Down there, you see. It keeps coming back. A… a discomfort. I don’t rightly remember when it started, but it’s been a while. A nuisance, really. I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, a discomfort "down there". I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Hmm… vague recollections, yes. That's alright, we'll figure it out. Could you tell me a little more about this discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, I wish I could. It’s… burning, sometimes. And a… a need to go. Often. Not a lot comes out, though. Just… frequent. It's mostly just irritating, if I’m honest. And it wakes me up at night. I really don’t sleep well. Is that… is that enough information? I’m afraid my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Burning, frequent urination, waking you up at night… yes, that paints a bit of a picture. And it's perfectly alright about the memory – we’ll take things slowly. So, just to clarify, is the burning sensation during urination, or is it more of a constant burning feeling?
PATIENT: Oh dear… constant, I think. Though sometimes it feels worse when I go. It’s hard to say, truthfully. They sort of… blend together, you see? It’s just… uncomfortable. I don’t enjoy it, that’s for certain. And I don't understand all the medical questions, if you don't mind my saying. It's all a bit… much.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all. It's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed – it is a lot. We can absolutely take it slower and I’ll try my best to explain things clearly. Constant discomfort with a worsening sensation during urination… okay. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I don’t… I don’t think so. Not that I recall. Everything is a little… hazy. I try not to look, if I’m honest. It’s unpleasant. I just know it hurts, and I want it to stop. I'm terribly sorry I can't be more precise. Is that… is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s not a problem at all. It’s good you're telling me what you do remember, and it’s perfectly understandable you wouldn’t want to look. Okay, no blood that you're aware of. Now, I’m going to ask some more general questions, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you had any fevers, chills, or back pain recently?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I felt a bit chilly last week, but I just put on a sweater. And my back… well, my back always aches, you see. Old age, I suppose. It's not a new pain, if that makes sense. A dull ache, always there. I wouldn't say it's related to this… trouble. Is that… helpful? I do wish I could recall more.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. A constant dull back ache, and a slight chill last week… okay. And it sounds like those aren't new symptoms. Now, have you had any issues with constipation or diarrhea recently?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… well, sometimes. It… comes and goes, you see. Old age again, I expect. Everything slows down, doesn’t it? I take something… a little something to help. I can’t recall the name, though. It's a… a pink pill, I believe. Does that… matter? I really just want this… discomfort to be over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent constipation, and you take a pink pill to help. We can look up what that pill is later if you're comfortable with that. It might be helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I saw a doctor years ago… when I was married, I believe. But I don't remember what they said. I had a lot on my mind then. And… and I’ve had a few surgeries, I think. But again… the details are… gone. I'm terribly sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. My head feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright, truly. We'll do the best we can. Vague recollections of seeing a doctor years ago and having had some surgeries… okay. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, not that I know of. I eat most things. I used to react to… something, when I was a child, but I've long forgotten what it was. It wasn't serious, I don’t think. I haven't had any trouble with anything lately. Really, I just want to know what’s causing this… this problem. It’s very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I'll need to do a quick pelvic exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a… a pelvic exam? Well, Doctor… I’m not sure. I haven’t had one of those in… a very long time. Is it absolutely necessary? I'm… a little embarrassed, if I'm honest. And I'm not very flexible anymore. Perhaps we could… skip that part? I'd prefer it, if that's possible. It’s… a bit intrusive, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Claudene. It is a bit intrusive, and you have every right to feel uncomfortable. However, given your symptoms, a pelvic exam would be very helpful in trying to determine the cause of your discomfort. It allows me to check for any tenderness, inflammation, or other abnormalities. I promise to be as gentle and respectful as possible. We can take things very slowly, and you can tell me to stop at any time. If you're still uncomfortable, we can discuss other options, though it might make getting a diagnosis more difficult. Would you be willing to let me explain the exam a little more, so you know exactly what to expect?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. Well, explaining it… perhaps. But I don’t know if knowing what to expect will make me any less… apprehensive. I just don’t like people… down there. It feels… vulnerable. But I do want to know what’s wrong. Very well. Explain it, Doctor. But I’m not promising anything. And please, be quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I understand. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, so the exam involves me using a speculum – it's a smooth, curved instrument – to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix. It might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll also do a bimanual exam, where I use two fingers to gently feel your uterus and ovaries for any abnormalities. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but again, you can tell me to stop at any time. I'll also be listening to your abdomen and checking your vital signs. The whole exam should only take a few minutes. I’ll explain everything as I go, and I’ll respect your boundaries every step of the way. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A… a speculum… and you'll be… looking? Oh dear. It all sounds very… clinical. And… and what if you find something? What if it's… bad? I don't want to know if it's something terrible. I just want this… discomfort to be gone. Perhaps… perhaps I should just leave it. It’s been bothering me for a while, but it's not… life-threatening, is it? It’s just… irritating. I don't want to make a fuss. I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. I think I’m getting too worked up.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel worked up, Claudene. You're understandably anxious, and it's brave of you to come in to get checked out. You're right, it is clinical, but it's necessary to determine what's going on. And you're right to ask about what if we find something. We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it, and I'll explain everything clearly if we do. It might be nothing serious at all, and that's what we're hoping for. But, if it is something more serious, knowing is always better than not knowing, because it allows us to start treatment as soon as possible. I understand you don't want to make a fuss, but your health is important, and this discomfort deserves to be investigated. I can completely respect your decision if you still don’t want to proceed with the exam. However, without it, I’m limited in what I can do to help you. We can discuss other options, like a referral to a gynecologist, who might be better equipped to address your concerns. But that might involve waiting for an appointment, and potentially undergoing the exam anyway. Would you like to take a moment to think about it?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor… you're very patient. I appreciate that. And you're right. Knowing is better. Even if it's… bad. It's just… frightening. Very well. Let’s… let’s get it over with. But please… be gentle. And explain everything as you go. I don’t want any surprises. And if it becomes too much… I will tell you. I'm terribly sorry for being so… difficult. I just don’t like doctors. Let's begin.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. That’s very brave of you. I promise to be as gentle and respectful as possible, and I'll explain everything every step of the way. You can tell me to stop at any time, and we will. First, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This will help me check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Take a deep breath for me, please. And another one. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: It's… a little uncomfortable. But not painful. Just… a pressure. And my stomach always feels… rumbley. Old age, you see. Everything is… unsettled. But no, not pain. Just… a general discomfort. Like a… a dull ache. But that's always there, Doctor. It’s not new. Please, hurry. It’s making me nervous, all this poking and listening.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Just a general discomfort and rumbling – that's helpful. And I'll be as quick as I can. Now, I’m going to ask you to lie back on the examination table. I'll provide a sheet for you to cover yourself with. Then, I’ll gently perform the pelvic exam. I'll use a warm speculum, and plenty of lubrication to minimize any discomfort. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Lie… lie back? Oh dear. A warm speculum… that sounds… slightly better. But still… No… no questions. Just… hurry, please. And be gentle. I'm terribly sorry for being such a… a bother. Let's… let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. You're not a bother at all. I’m just going to take a look at the external area first. I’m checking for any redness, swelling, or sores. Do you feel any discomfort here?
PATIENT: A little… a little pressure. It's… awkward. And… and cold. Everything feels… cold. And… and exposed. Please… please hurry. I don't like this at all. Just… just get it over with. I'm terribly sorry for being so… difficult. I just don't like anyone… touching me down there.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. I understand this is very uncomfortable, and I'll be as quick as possible. I’m just going to gently insert the speculum now. This will allow me to visualize the cervix. You might feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Take a deep breath for me. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That’s… that’s very uncomfortable. And cold. And… and tight. Please… please stop. It’s… it’s too much. Please… just stop. I can’t… I can’t do this. I want it out. Now. Please… just stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. You’re right to tell me to stop. I apologize for causing you discomfort. I understand this was too much, and we’ll stop right here. I’m very sorry this didn't go as planned. We can certainly discuss other options, like a referral to a gynecologist who might be more comfortable managing this, or we can just focus on managing your symptoms without further investigation. Are you alright?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Thank you. It’s… it’s alright. I just… I don’t like doctors. And I don’t like anyone… touching me down there. A gynecologist… perhaps. Someone who is… used to this. I just want this… this discomfort to be gone. I don't want to have to go through that again. Thank you… for stopping. You were very kind. I think… I think I’ve had enough for today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Claudene. Your comfort is my priority, and it’s perfectly alright to stop when you’re uncomfortable. Okay, so we’ll schedule a referral to a gynecologist. I’ll also write you a prescription for a medication to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. It’s an antibiotic, to rule out any infection, and should help with the burning sensation and frequent urination. I'll give you some written instructions about the medication, and a list of recommended gynecologists in the area. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: An antibiotic… yes, that sounds… helpful. And a list of gynecologists… thank you. No… no questions, right now. Just… thank you. For being patient. And for stopping when I asked. I think… I think that’s all I need for today. I just want to go home. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Claudene. I’m glad I could help, even a little. Here’s the prescription and the list of gynecologists. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, you’re not alone in this. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: .
