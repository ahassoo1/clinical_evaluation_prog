DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Venus. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, my memory has not been quite right lately. It is concerning. I have been… forgetting things. Small things, mostly, but… it worries me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Venus. It’s good you’re addressing this. It's certainly wise to get these things checked out. "Not quite right" can mean a lot of things, so let's try to get a clearer picture. When you say "forgetting things," could you give me some examples of what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Hmm… let me think. Just yesterday, I went to the market for milk and bread. I knew I needed those things. I wrote it on a list! But… when I got there, I completely forgot why I went. I stood there, looking at the fruits… and the meats… and I had to call my neighbor, Dimitri, to remind me. He was very kind, but… it is embarrassing. And… I think I left my purse at home, so I had to go back again. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Venus. That sounds quite disruptive, and it's completely understandable why you're concerned. Forgetting the reason you went to the market, despite having a list, is a good example. Has this type of thing been happening frequently, or is this a relatively new experience?
PATIENT: It is… new. Perhaps the last month, maybe six weeks. Before that, I always remembered things. Always. I managed many properties, you see. Many details! I had to remember everything – rent payments, repairs, complaints… It was… a lot. But my memory was always very good. So, this is… different. It is unsettling. And… I also find myself repeating questions sometimes, even if someone just answered them. That is also new.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a relatively recent change, occurring over the past month or so, and it's impacting your ability to recall things you previously had no difficulty remembering, like the reason for errands, and you've noticed repeating questions. That’s helpful information. Now, let’s broaden the picture a bit. Besides the memory issues and repeating questions, have you noticed any other changes – any difficulty with language, like finding the right words?
PATIENT: No, not the words themselves. I can still say what I mean. It is just… remembering why I am saying it, sometimes. Or remembering things that happened… earlier in the day. It is not that I don't know what things are… it is… like a blank spot. A small blank spot. And… no, no trouble with language. I speak English… passably, I suppose. It is not my first language, you understand. But I can communicate. No problems there.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Venus. Your English is excellent, by the way – perfectly understandable. It sounds like this is primarily affecting your recall, rather than your ability to express yourself. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Yes. I… have high blood pressure. The doctor… Dimitri’s wife, she is a nurse, she checks it often. It is usually… quite high. She says I need to be more careful with salt, and… more exercise. But it is difficult. And… that is all. No diabetes. My heart… I have had some palpitations, sometimes, but the doctor said it was just stress. Otherwise… I am… reasonably healthy for my age. I used to walk a lot, but… with the blood pressure, it is harder now. I get tired easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, and you experience some fatigue and palpitations. We'll definitely need to consider that as potential factors. Have you ever had any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: No. Never. I have been… fortunate. No surgeries. No broken bones, either. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older. I had my tonsils out as a child, a very long time ago, but… that is all. Nothing serious. Just… normal things. I try to avoid the doctor as much as possible, you understand. I do not… enjoy hospitals. They are… unsettling places.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Venus. Many people feel that way. Alright, let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes. I take a small pill… for the blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it is called. A small white pill. And… sometimes, I take an aspirin, if I have a headache. But that is it. No vitamins. No supplements. Dimitri’s wife, she says they do not help much. Just… the Lisinopril, and sometimes the aspirin. I try to follow her advice. She knows what she is doing.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I eat… most things. I do not eat shellfish, because I do not like the taste, but… it is not an allergy. Just a preference. I am quite… robust, in that regard. No allergies. Never.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Venus. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My mother… she was very forgetful in her later years. But she was also… very dramatic. She often said she forgot things to… avoid unpleasant tasks. So, it is hard to say. My father… he died young, from a heart attack. No memory problems, as far as I know. And… I do not have any siblings. I was an only child. So… perhaps my mother. But it may not have been… a serious condition. Just… her personality. It is difficult to say for certain.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Venus. It's good you've thought about that. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I live alone, in a small house just outside of town. I used to work very hard, managing properties. But… I retired a few years ago. Now, I mostly… keep house. I watch television. I read. I visit with neighbors sometimes. I do not… travel much anymore. It is too tiring. I used to enjoy gardening, but… with the blood pressure, it is difficult. I eat… reasonably well. Not much salt, Dimitri’s wife makes sure of that. I do not drink alcohol, and I do not smoke. A quiet life, mostly. A very quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venus. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a simple neurological assessment – things like checking your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is… fine. I suppose it is necessary. My blood pressure is probably very high. Dimitri’s wife said so. I will… sit still and do as you say. Just… please be quick? I have some errands to run this afternoon. I need to go to the market again, actually. I forgot to buy… onions. It is embarrassing, really. But… yes. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venus. We'll be as quick as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 160 over 95. As expected, it’s a bit elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly forceful. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Balance seems stable, but she does take a few extra seconds to regain her footing after standing from a seated position. Okay, everything appears normal so far, but the blood pressure is definitely something we need to address. I’m also noting the slight difficulty with balance. Do you experience dizziness or lightheadedness often?
PATIENT: No, not dizziness, exactly. More… a feeling of being unsteady. Like… my legs are a little weak sometimes. Especially when I stand up quickly. It is… not severe. I just need a moment to… steady myself. And… sometimes, I feel a little… disoriented. Not confused, exactly, but… like I am not quite… present. It is a strange feeling. It happens only… occasionally. But… yes. Unsteady legs and… a feeling of being disoriented sometimes. It is probably just… old age. But… I wanted to mention it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Venus. Those symptoms – the unsteady legs and occasional disorientation – are important details. While it could be related to age, we need to investigate further to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a few blood tests to check your overall health, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. We'll also order a CT scan of your brain to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I know that sounds like a lot, but it’s important to be thorough. These tests will help us identify the cause of your symptoms and develop a plan to get you feeling better. In the meantime, it’s important to continue managing your blood pressure as best as you can – follow Dimitri’s wife’s advice regarding salt intake and try to get some gentle exercise, even if it’s just a short walk each day. Do you have any questions about these tests or anything we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… serious. Is something… very wrong? I… I do not like hospitals, you understand. And… blood tests are fine, I suppose. But a CT scan… Is it necessary? And… will these tests be expensive? I… do not have insurance. It is… complicated. I used to have it, but… after my husband passed, it became too difficult. Yes… a CT scan… Is it truly necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Venus. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious about a CT scan, especially given your aversion to hospitals and concerns about cost. Let me explain why I'm recommending it. A CT scan helps us rule out any structural problems in the brain that could be contributing to your symptoms – things like a small stroke, a tumor, or any other abnormalities. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong, but it gives us valuable information to work with. As for the cost, I understand you don’t have insurance. I'll do my best to find you the most affordable options. We can explore financial assistance programs and see if we can negotiate a lower price with the hospital. I also have a social worker on staff who can help you navigate these options. Before we proceed with the CT scan, we can discuss alternative tests, but they may not provide as much information. We could start with a more detailed neurological exam, but it may not be enough to identify the cause of your symptoms. I truly believe it’s important to be thorough, but ultimately, the decision is yours. Would you like to discuss alternative options first, or would you like me to connect you with the social worker to explore financial assistance for the CT scan?
PATIENT: Hmm… financial assistance… that sounds… sensible. I do not want to be a burden. And… a detailed neurological exam… perhaps that is a good first step. Something… less invasive. Yes. A detailed exam. If it… provides enough information, perhaps we can avoid the CT scan. It is… unsettling just thinking about it. Yes. Please. A detailed neurological exam, first. And… please, connect me with the social worker afterwards. Just… in case. Thank you, Doctor. You are very… kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venus. That’s a perfectly reasonable approach. We’ll start with a thorough neurological exam, and we’ll see if that provides us with enough information. It will take a bit longer than the quick assessment we did earlier, but it will be much more in-depth. I'll schedule that for you today. And I’ll have the social worker reach out to you after the exam to discuss financial assistance options. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms and let me know if anything changes. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all for now. You have been very… helpful. And… reassuring. Thank you for listening to me. And… for being so understanding. I… appreciate it. I suppose I will see you after the exam. Yes. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venus. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before the exam. I'll see you then. . .
