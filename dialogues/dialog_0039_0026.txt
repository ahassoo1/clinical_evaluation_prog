DOCTOR: Hello Ardelle, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just awful tiredness. Seems to come and go, but when it comes, I can barely lift a teacup. And the young man at the lab said something about… my muscles? It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I’ve been a commercial diver for… well, a long time. You wouldn’t believe the things I’ve seen. But this isn’t about that, is it? It’s about being tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, tiredness. That’s a good place to start. And you mentioned being a diver?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A commercial diver. Not one of those holiday ones with the pretty fish. Real work. Deep water, difficult conditions. My husband, bless his soul, he used to worry something awful. Said it was no life for a woman. But I was good at it. Very good. Strong, too. Was strong. Now… not so much. It's just… exhausting, even thinking about it.
DOCTOR: I can imagine. That sounds like very demanding work. When did you start noticing this tiredness, Ardelle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a difficult question. It comes and goes, you see? Like waves. But I'd say… maybe six months ago? It started with just feeling a bit more worn out than usual. Thought I was just getting old, you know? But it's gotten… worse. And the aches. My whole body aches when it's bad. Not like a pulled muscle, more… deep inside.
DOCTOR: Six months ago. And these aches… are they worse after any particular activity?
PATIENT: Well, yes, actually. After… well, after any sort of effort. Even just a bit of gardening. Or a longer walk with the grandchildren. Anything that requires… exertion. My husband used to say I never knew my own limits. Perhaps he was right. Although I always thought I was perfectly capable! It's… frustrating, to be honest. I’ve always been a doer.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration completely. It sounds like you’ve always been very active. And these symptoms started around the same time you began to notice the tiredness, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Though… it’s hard to say precisely. Things blur, you know? But… about six months ago, both the tiredness and the aches began to creep in. It wasn’t sudden. Just… a gradual fading of energy, if that makes sense. And… this young man at the lab, he kept mentioning something about my muscles. What was that about? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ardelle. The lab results showed an elevated creatine kinase level. That's an enzyme released from your muscles, and a higher level can indicate muscle damage or inflammation. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to investigate further to understand the cause. Have you noticed any muscle weakness, or any changes in the color of your urine – perhaps darker than usual?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Muscle… damage? That doesn’t sound good at all. I haven’t noticed any weakness, no. Not exactly. Just… tired. Very, very tired. And the color of my… water? No, I don’t pay much attention to that, to be honest. Really, I don't. My husband always took care of things like that. I suppose I should be more observant, but… well, I’ve always been busy. Doing things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned being a commercial diver. Did you ever experience any significant injuries while diving?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, injuries… well, it wasn’t all smooth sailing, you know? There were a few scrapes, a few bruises. Once, I got tangled in some netting. That was unpleasant. And another time, my air tank malfunctioned. My husband nearly had a heart attack. But… serious injuries? No, not that I recall. Nothing that required… a hospital stay or anything like that. Mostly just the usual bumps and bruises that come with the job.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Ardelle, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your strength and reflexes, and look at your muscles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine, dear. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Though… do try not to poke too much. My muscles are already aching as it is! And… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright. Your reflexes are normal, but your grip strength is a little weaker than expected, and I’m noticing some tenderness in your thigh and upper arm muscles. I'm also checking for any signs of muscle wasting, but I don't see any obvious signs. Do you feel pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! That’s… tender. Quite tender, actually. Not excruciating, but… definitely noticeable. Especially there, on my thigh. And… a little bit in my upper arm, as you said. It feels… almost like a bruise, but… deep inside. Not on the surface, you understand? My husband used to rub it with liniment. Said it helped. Though, I suppose that was just a temporary fix.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful to know. Given your history of commercial diving, your tiredness and muscle aches, and what I'm finding on the exam, I’m concerned about a condition called polymyositis. It’s an inflammatory muscle disease. However, there are other possibilities, and we need to do some further testing to confirm a diagnosis. I'd like to order a few blood tests, including a more detailed muscle enzyme panel, and an MRI of your thighs to look at the muscles more closely. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Polymy… what was that? It sounds… frightening. Inflammatory? Is that serious? My husband always said I worry too much, but… this sounds very serious indeed. MRI? Will that hurt? I don’t like being confined in small spaces, you understand. I used to get quite claustrophobic on the dive bell.
DOCTOR: Polymyositis is a condition that causes inflammation in your muscles, leading to weakness and aches. It can be serious, but it's treatable, and we’ll be able to manage it if that is what it turns out to be. We need to get a diagnosis first to know what we’re dealing with. As for the MRI, it’s a painless scan. You'll lie on a table inside a large tube, but it's not a confined space like a dive bell. You will have headphones on so you can listen to music, and a technician will be right there with you the entire time. We can also give you a mild sedative if you’re feeling anxious about it. It is important to get this scan, so we can fully understand what is going on with your muscles. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a sedative. Perhaps that would be best. I do get rather… flustered easily. And headphones sound nice. Music would be a welcome distraction. I suppose… if it’s necessary. My husband would always tell me to just get it done. He was a very practical man. Alright, dear. Yes, let's do the scan. And… the blood tests, of course. Whatever you think is best. Just… please, be quick about it. This whole thing is making me rather tired just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle. I will get those orders sent to the lab right away. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood tests. And we'll arrange for you to have the MRI scheduled as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help with the aches and pains. It won’t cure anything, but it should provide some relief while we wait for the results. I will also give you a referral to a rheumatologist – a specialist who deals with inflammatory conditions. They will be able to help us with the diagnosis and treatment plan. Here’s the prescription, and the referral information. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, a specialist, alright. Sounds… thorough. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very kind. Anti-inflammatory… I suppose that’s better than nothing. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… I do hope it’s not something too serious. I still have grandchildren to spoil, you know? And… well, I’d like to finish knitting that scarf I started. Thank you again, dear. You’ve put my mind at ease… a little.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on. We'll get the results of the tests as soon as possible and then discuss the next steps. Please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And I hope you get to finish that scarf soon! It’s important to keep busy with things you enjoy. Have a good day, Ardelle, and please take it easy.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You too. Take care now. .
