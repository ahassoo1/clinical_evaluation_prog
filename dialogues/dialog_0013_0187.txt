DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Sobkowic, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor, yes. Chest… feels funny. Like bird flapping. And my blood pressure… wife says it's too high. Always complaining. Just want quick fix, okay? I busy man.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're feeling a fluttering in your chest and your wife is concerned about your blood pressure. “Feels funny like a bird flapping” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More details? Why I need more details? It feels… like little bird inside. Not good feeling. Makes me nervous, okay? And then… dizzy sometimes. Just fix it, Doctor. I don't have time for stories.
DOCTOR: Alright, no stories, I promise. Just trying to get a clear picture. When you feel this fluttering, is it happening all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I… think too much. Or after I eat big meal. My wife, she always makes too much food. Big portions! Makes heart go fast, then… bird flapping. Not good. Now, you check blood pressure? I need to know if really so high.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be related to activity or large meals. And you notice it makes you feel nervous. We’ll definitely check your blood pressure. Can you sit here for me, and I’ll get that done quickly?
PATIENT: Quickly is good. Very good. Don't take too long, Doctor. I have things to do. Important things. Not just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 162 over 98. It’s not dangerously high right now, but it is higher than we’d like. Do you know what your usual blood pressure readings are?
PATIENT: Usual? How I know? Wife tells me numbers. Something like… 140? Maybe. She always worry too much. Numbers, numbers… just make head hurt. Just fix it, okay? What you going to do? Pill? I don't like pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around 140 is what your wife has mentioned. We'll try to avoid pills if we can, but sometimes they're the best option. Before we talk about that, I'd like to ask a few more questions, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Have you had any chest pain along with this fluttering?
PATIENT: Chest pain… sometimes. Not big pain. Like… squeezing. Not every time. Mostly when I get angry. My neighbor, he parks in my spot. Makes me so mad! Then… squeezing. And bird flapping. Very annoying. Now, are we done with numbers?
DOCTOR: Okay, squeezing with the anger and the fluttering. That’s helpful to know. No, we're not quite done with questions, but we’re getting there. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart problems before?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No! Never. I strong man! Work hard all my life. Never sick. Except… little cough last winter. But that just cold. My father… he had weak heart. But I not like my father. I strong! Now, what about this blood pressure? Is very bad? Need hospital? I don’t have time for hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father had a weak heart, and you’ve been generally healthy. It’s good you’ve stayed strong. Your blood pressure isn’t at hospital-emergency levels right now, but it is high enough that we need to address it. Before we talk about treatment, let’s quickly go through a few more things. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. No. I take nothing. Don't like medicine. Makes you weak. My wife, she always trying to give me something for… everything. But I refuse. Now, are you going to give me a pill? I tell you, I don't want pill! Just tell me what's wrong. Quick!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and you prefer to avoid medication. I understand. So, based on what you’ve told me – the fluttering, the squeezing with anger, the high blood pressure, and your family history – it could be a few things. One possibility is atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heartbeat that can cause the fluttering you feel. The high blood pressure could also be contributing to the symptoms. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and possibly order an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: EKG? What is EKG? Sounds… complicated. And listen to my heart? You going to put cold thing on my chest? I don’t like cold! Look, Doctor, I just want to know if I going to die from this bird flapping. Just tell me yes or no. No complicated tests. I busy man! Is very simple. Yes or no?
DOCTOR: Okay, an EKG is a simple test, it doesn’t take long, and it doesn't involve anything cold. It just measures the electrical activity of your heart. And I understand you want a straight answer. It’s impossible to say "yes" or "no" to whether you're going to die from this. That’s not how medicine works. However, ignoring this could lead to serious problems like stroke or heart failure. To be safe, I strongly recommend an EKG. If we can understand what’s causing the fluttering, we can figure out the best way to manage it. Would you at least let me listen to your heart and lungs first?
PATIENT: Stroke? Heart failure? Hmph. My wife always said I need to go to doctor. Always nagging… Fine! Listen to heart. But quick! No long listening. And then… EKG. But if it takes too long, I leave. I have important appointment. You understand? Quick, quick, quick! I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. I’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and some mild crackling in your lungs. It’s not alarming, but it supports the idea that we need to investigate further. Let’s get that EKG done. The technician is just down the hall; I’ll have them come get you. It will take about five to ten minutes.
PATIENT: Five to ten minutes… fine. But tell technician no cold things! And hurry! I have things to do. Important things. Now, go get them. Don’t waste my time.
DOCTOR: I will. And I’ll make sure they know about the cold things. .
PATIENT: .
