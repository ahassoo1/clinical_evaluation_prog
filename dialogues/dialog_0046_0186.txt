DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Yeah, well, I’m trying out for a… a sports team. Need to get checked out, make sure I’m still good to go, you know? I’m getting a little older, gotta be sure.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lamark. That's very wise of you to get a check-up before starting a new activity. It's important to make sure you're physically prepared. To get a better understanding of your current health status, could you tell me a little more about the sports team you're trying out for, and what the physical demands of the sport are?
PATIENT: Uh, it’s… Mongolian wrestling. It’s not, like, super high impact all the time, but there's a lot of grappling, strength, and… well, holding your own. It's what I grew up with. I haven’t done it seriously in a few years, so I just want to make sure my back and everything is alright. You know, old man stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Mongolian wrestling sounds like it requires a great deal of strength and endurance. And it’s smart to be proactive about checking your back, especially after a period of inactivity. To get a clearer picture, could you describe any specific symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Nah, not really symptoms. That’s why I’m here, right? Before it gets to that. Maybe just a little… stiffness in the mornings. And sometimes after I, uh, help my neighbor move stuff, it feels a bit sore. Nothing I can’t work through, honestly. Just want to be safe. I don’t want to pull anything.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent that you’re being so mindful of your body. Morning stiffness and soreness after exertion are good things to bring up. Let's do a quick review of your medical history to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. I had the flu a couple times, you know, regular stuff. And I think I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time, to be honest. I usually just push through things.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Lamark. It’s common for people to delay medical care. No worries at all. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Like I said, pretty healthy guy. Mostly. Just getting older now.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, regarding your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or any types of cancer?
PATIENT: Uh… my dad, he had… something with his heart, I think. When he got older. But he smoked, so… it was probably that. And my mom, she had high blood pressure, I think. That’s about it, really. Nobody else that I can think of. We weren't really big on talking about that kind of stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Thank you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. I live alone, pretty quiet life. I work… doing some media stuff. Mostly editing videos, not super physical. I eat okay, I guess. Try to have some vegetables. I don't drink much and I definitely don't smoke. I walk a bit, help my neighbors sometimes. Nothing too strenuous.
DOCTOR: That’s all good information, thank you. And just to finish up with the basics, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, no allergies. I can eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to any medicine either. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a good starting point, Lamark. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to assess your overall health and get a better understanding of your back, as you mentioned. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need. Let’s get it over with. I got things to do, but I understand you gotta check things.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, we’ll take a look at your back. I'll need you to remove your shirt so I can examine it properly. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point during the exam. If you could sit on the table for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Just let me know if you need me to move a certain way. I'm not as flexible as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will tell you exactly what I need you to do. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. A bit elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on that. Now, if you could turn around and bend over at the waist, keeping your knees straight, and touch your toes if you can.
PATIENT: Ugh, getting old. It’s not as easy as it used to be. Definitely feel a little pull in my lower back there. Not pain, exactly… just a stiffness.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I see some limited range of motion and a slight discomfort with forward flexion. Now, could you stand up straight and I’ll palpate your spine to check for tenderness or any abnormalities?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Go ahead. Just be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m going to press here… and here… any pain with that?
PATIENT: Ugh… yeah, a little bit there. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. It’s been there for a while, honestly. I just ignore it. And… yeah, a little bit here too.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I’m also going to check your reflexes and muscle strength in your legs. Could you sit back on the table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Alright. What are you looking for? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Just routine, Lamark. Checking to see if everything is functioning properly. Now, could you try to push your heels down into the table?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Good, thank you. Now, I'm going to check the range of motion in your hips and knees. Could you bend your knee up towards your chest?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is getting old, isn't it? It's a little stiff. Not bad, but not like when I was younger. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And now, can you rotate your hip outward?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. Ow… a little bit of a twinge there. Not sharp, just… noticeable. This hip hasn’t been the same since I was… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Lamark. That’s all for the physical exam. Based on the physical examination, and your history, you have some limited range of motion in your lower back, and some tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region. There is also some limited range of motion and tenderness in your left hip. Your reflexes and muscle strength are within normal limits, but you do have some discomfort with movement. Given your age and activity level, I suspect you are experiencing some age-related wear and tear in your back and hip, possibly some mild osteoarthritis. However, to confirm this, and rule out any other underlying causes, I recommend we order some imaging studies, specifically an X-ray of your lumbar spine and hip. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yeah… X-rays, huh? Alright, I guess so. If you think it's necessary. I just wanna get back to wrestling, you know? How long will it take? And… how much will that cost? I don’t have insurance, so…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lamark. X-rays will help us visualize the bones and identify any signs of arthritis or other structural abnormalities. The cost for the X-rays will depend on the facility, but I can have our billing department provide you with a quote before proceeding. We can also explore some options for financial assistance if needed. The X-rays can typically be completed within a few days, and the results should be available within a week. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action, which may include physical therapy, pain management, and lifestyle modifications. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any activities that aggravate your pain, and continue with gentle stretching and range of motion exercises. Would you like me to go ahead and order the X-rays for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Order them. I just… I just wanna get this sorted out, you know? The sooner the better. And please, can you have the billing department call me about the cost? I need to know what I'm getting into.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lamark. I understand. I will go ahead and order the X-rays right away, and I will also put in a request for our billing department to contact you with a cost estimate. In the meantime, as we wait for the results, I'm going to give you a handout with some gentle stretching exercises you can do at home to help manage your pain and improve your flexibility. I also recommend you take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're experiencing discomfort. Do you have any questions for me before I let you get dressed?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I think that's it. Just… try to get those results quick, okay? And thanks, Doctor. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. I really wanna get back to training.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lamark. I'll do my best to expedite the results. I've already noted your desire to return to training in your chart, and we’ll tailor a plan to help you achieve that goal as safely as possible. Here’s the handout with the stretching exercises. Please read it carefully and follow the instructions. I’ll have our billing department contact you within 24 hours with a cost estimate for the X-rays. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’re here to help. Have a good day, Lamark. And please, take it easy until we have the results. We’ll get this sorted out together.
PATIENT: Thanks, Doctor. You too.
