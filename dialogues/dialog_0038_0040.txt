DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been getting in my side, mostly. And… these water infections keep coming back. It’s been going on for a while now, and it’s starting to worry me a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain in your side and recurring water infections. Let’s start with the side pain. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's… hard to describe exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, but it’s been happening more often lately. Usually on my right side, lower down. Sometimes it goes around to my back a little. It doesn’t come on with anything specific, just… appears. And it can last for hours, sometimes a whole day.
DOCTOR: Right, a dull ache on your right side, lower down, sometimes radiating to your back, coming and going, and lasting for hours or even a full day. That gives me a little more to work with. And you said it’s been happening more often recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It used to be maybe once a month, or even less. Now… it feels like at least once a week, sometimes more. It’s just… unsettling. It’s not like anything I’ve ever experienced before. And it worries me because my sister… she had problems with her kidneys, years ago.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your sister's history. We'll definitely look into this. Okay, let's switch gears for a moment and talk about these recurring water infections. How often are you getting them, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It's hard to keep track exactly. But I’d say… maybe every couple of months, for the past year or so? Sometimes sooner. I always need antibiotics to clear them up, and then they just… come back again. It’s quite frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly every couple of months for the past year, requiring antibiotics each time. That is frustrating. And do you notice any specific symptoms when you're having these infections – burning when you pee, frequent urination, that sort of thing?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly that. Burning when I go to the toilet, and feeling like I need to go all the time, even if only a little comes out. Sometimes a bit of a ache in my lower stomach, too. And occasionally… just feeling generally unwell, you know? Tired and a bit weak. It’s never too bad, but it’s definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright, burning with urination, frequent urination, occasional lower abdominal discomfort and feeling generally unwell. That sounds consistent with urinary tract infections. Okay, let's go through some of your medical history now. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… the doctor told me a few years back I have something with my kidneys. Polycystic Kidney Disease, I think it was called. It wasn’t causing any problems at the time, just something they found on a scan. He said I’d need to keep an eye on it, but nothing more. Apart from that… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Polycystic Kidney Disease is important to know, thank you for telling me. And it's good you've been monitoring it. Okay, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. Just the usual doctor’s visits and check-ups, but never anything requiring an operation. I’ve always been quite lucky, health-wise, until recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, like I mentioned, my sister had kidney problems. She had to have dialysis for a while, and eventually a transplant. Apart from that… my father had high blood pressure, and my mother had diabetes, but nothing too serious on either side, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your sister with kidney problems requiring dialysis and transplant, and your parents with high blood pressure and diabetes. That’s helpful. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I live alone, Doctor. Always have, really. I used to work as a receptionist at the hospital, but I retired a few years back. I don’t drink alcohol, and I’ve never smoked. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruit and vegetables. I don’t do much strenuous exercise these days, just a bit of walking when the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, retired receptionist, no alcohol or smoking, healthy diet, and light exercise. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve taken all sorts of medicines over the years, and never had a reaction. No food allergies either, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications at all, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just some paracetamol now and then, for aches and pains. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor suggested it a while back because I don’t get much sun. That's it, really. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, just paracetamol occasionally and a vitamin D supplement. Thank you for all that information, Mr. Espinueva. It's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. It will just take a few minutes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. It’s good to get to the bottom of this, finally.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92, but not dramatically so. I did notice some tenderness on your right side, lower down, when I pressed on your abdomen. It doesn’t seem to be a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, as you described. I'm also feeling a slight fullness in that area.
PATIENT: Oh, I see. That tenderness… that’s where the pain is, usually. And a fullness, you say? Hmm… that doesn’t sound good, does it? What do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it something to worry about?
DOCTOR: It's hard to say definitively without further investigation, Mr. Espinueva. The tenderness and fullness on your right side, combined with your history of recurring water infections and the diagnosis of Polycystic Kidney Disease, raises a few possibilities. It could be a kidney infection, a blockage in the urinary tract, or even related to the cysts in your kidneys. The elevated blood pressure isn’t helping, either. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I want to check your kidney function with a blood test, and I’d like a urine sample to rule out infection. And I think a scan of your kidneys and bladder – either a CT scan or an ultrasound – would be very helpful to see what’s going on. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable indeed. Anything to get to the bottom of this, as you say. Blood test, urine sample, and a scan… yes, please. I trust your judgement entirely. When can we do these tests? And will they take long? I'm not very good with hospitals, you see. They always make me a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety about hospitals, Mr. Espinueva. We'll try to make it as smooth as possible. We can get the blood test and urine sample done here at the clinic today. They should only take about 15-20 minutes each. For the scan, we’ll need to schedule an appointment at the hospital radiology department. I’ll have my nurse arrange that for you. The scan itself usually takes about 30-45 minutes, and you'll just need to lie still on a table. While we're waiting for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics, just to address any potential infection. We’ll see if that helps to alleviate your symptoms. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Getting the blood test and urine sample done today is a relief, and scheduling the scan sounds manageable. And the antibiotics… yes, please, anything to feel a little better. I do get worried when the pain gets bad, you see. It’s just… unsettling. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. When will I hear back about the test results? And what should I do if the pain gets worse while I’m waiting?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could reassure you somewhat. The lab results should be back in about 2-3 business days, and I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they're available. We'll discuss the results and the scan findings then. In the meantime, if the pain gets significantly worse – if it becomes very sharp, or if you develop a fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting – please go to the emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious infection or blockage. Otherwise, just continue taking the antibiotics as prescribed and let me know if you experience any side effects. I'm going to write you a prescription now, and my nurse will give you some instructions on how to schedule your scan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to find out what’s going on. I appreciate your help very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. My nurse will be in shortly to go over everything with you. Have a good day, and please take care.
