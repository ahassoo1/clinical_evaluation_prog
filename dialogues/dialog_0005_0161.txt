DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Trefren. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hello Doctor… Donate, is it? Yes, well, to be quick, it’s about…preventative things. A friend mentioned something about a pill you can take before anything happens, to…well, protect you. I think it's called PrEP? Honestly, I don't really understand all the details, but she said it was good to look into.
DOCTOR: PrEP, yes. Pre-exposure prophylaxis. It's…a consideration. Frankly, at your age, it’s usually something we discuss with much more…active individuals. But alright. Let’s clarify. Your friend is right, it's a medication to help prevent certain infections. But it’s not just a blanket preventative measure. It’s specifically for HIV. Now, before we even think about a prescription, I need to understand your risk factors. Have you been… sexually active recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… that's a bit personal, isn’t it? Look, I’m single, alright? Have been for…a long time. There have been…occasional encounters, yes. But nothing regular. And it's not like I go looking for trouble, if that's what you mean. It's just… better to be safe, I guess. My friend, she…well, she’s a bit more adventurous, and she really stressed how important this was.
DOCTOR: "Adventurous" is one way to put it, I suppose. Look, Ms. Trefren, I'm not here to judge your lifestyle, but PrEP isn’t a free pass. It’s a medication with side effects, requires regular bloodwork, and frankly, isn't necessary for everyone. Let’s be clear. Have you had any sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a one. Honestly, that’s why I’m a bit surprised this is even being brought up. I always…take precautions. But things change, you know? And my friend said it’s better to be prepared before anything happens. It just feels…responsible. Plus, she said with my…age, things might be a little different. Does that make sense? I don't want to be… careless.
DOCTOR: "Responsible" is admirable. But age doesn't change the risk, Ms. Trefren. It changes the consequences potentially. Look, I need a complete medical history. Have you had a recent physical exam?
PATIENT: Yes, I had one with Dr. Khalil last year, right around this time, actually. He’s retired now, which is a shame, he was a good man. He did all the usual stuff - bloodwork, checked my heart, you know. Everything was fine, perfectly normal. I have the records somewhere… in a box… at home. I'll have to dig them out, but I can get them to you, if you really need them. Is that necessary? Honestly, I feel perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: “Perfectly healthy” and “PrEP consideration” don’t usually go hand-in-hand. And yes, I do need those records, Ms. Trefren. It’s standard procedure. I'll give you a moment to recall exactly when you saw Dr. Khalil. But let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright. Don’t get your knickers in a twist, Doctor. Dr. Khalil… let me think… it was August 12th, 2024, I believe. He was retiring at the end of the month. I remember because I brought him a little gift. And allergies… hmm. Nothing major. I get a little itchy sometimes with certain lotions, but nothing life-threatening. Oh! And penicillin gives me a bit of a stomach ache, but that’s about it. Is that helpful? Honestly, I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about medications.
DOCTOR: Penicillin sensitivity is good to know. Alright, let's talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything at all, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just… vitamins, really. A multivitamin, and sometimes fish oil for my joints. Getting old, you know? And I take something for my blood pressure now and then, when it gets a bit high. It’s nothing regular, though. Just a small dose when I’m stressed, which, admittedly, is fairly often these days. Do you need the names? I barely look at the bottles. My daughter usually handles all that.
DOCTOR: "Now and then" and "small dose" aren’t very helpful, Ms. Trefren. We need specifics. What is the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Let me think… it’s a white pill… small, round… um… I think it starts with an “A”? Honestly, I have no idea. Like I said, my daughter refills it, and I just take it when I feel…flustered. She’s very good at keeping track of things, much better than I am. Perhaps I should have asked her to come with me? This is… a bit stressful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, with all due respect, this is becoming… problematic. We cannot proceed with any medication discussion without knowing exactly what you’re taking. It's a matter of patient safety. I strongly recommend you bring your daughter, or a complete list of your medications, to a follow-up appointment. Until then, we will not be discussing PrEP. We need a complete picture of your health status. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, alright, yes I understand. It’s just… I thought it would be a simple thing. My friend made it sound so easy. I’ll… I’ll get the list. From my daughter. I promise. This is… fine. I can do that. Is there anything else I need to know right now? Or can I… go?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Trefren, there is nothing else at this time. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with a complete medication list. You may go.
