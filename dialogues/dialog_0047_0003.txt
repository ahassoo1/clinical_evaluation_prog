DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, it’s this…shaky thing. My hand, see? It just…trembles. Been happenin’ for a bit now, and it’s gettin’ old. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. Just want to know what it is and if it's serious, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. A tremor, you say. And you’ve noticed it worsening recently?
PATIENT: Worsenin’… yeah, I suppose. It's hard to say, really. Things just…blur together when you get to be my age. But it’s definitely noticeable more now. Makes it hard to hold a coffee cup, you know? Important things, coffee. Don’t get me started on the indignity of spillin’ coffee. Honestly, it’s probably nothin’ serious. Just old age, I bet.
DOCTOR: Well, we shouldn’t assume it’s just age, Mr. Baide. Tremors can have a number of causes. Now, is this shaking in your hand constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go? Hmm… now that you mention it, it’s worse when I’m tryin’ to do somethin’ precise. Like…writin’ or holdin’ somethin’ steady. When I’m just…sittin’ here, it’s not so bad. Not always, anyway. Look, are we gonna get to the point here? I have a lunch reservation, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting to the point, Mr. Baide. It’s helpful to know it's activity-related. So, it sounds like it’s worse with action, and better at rest. Does it happen in both hands, or just the one?
PATIENT: Just the right one, mostly. Though, sometimes I feel a little… twitch in the left, but it’s nothin’ like this one. Honestly, it’s probably stress. I used to run a pretty tight ship, you know? Producing… directin’… lots of pressure. Still do a bit, but not like the old days. Probably just nerves catchin’ up with me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Look, I'm eighty years old. What isn’t a symptom? My knees ache, my back cracks, I forget where I put my glasses… Oh, and my memory ain’t what it used to be, clearly. What are you lookin’ for exactly?
DOCTOR: I'm asking about things specifically related to the tremor, Mr. Baide. Any stiffness in the hand or arm?
PATIENT: Stiffness…hmm. Now that you say it, yeah, maybe a little. First thing in the mornin’, it feels…tight. Like I haven't used it in hours, even if I haven't. But it loosens up after a bit, you know? Just old age, I figure. Everything gets stiff when you get old. I don't see what this has to do with anythin' serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. It won't take long. Could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Look, I really don’t have time for this… Fine, fine. But make it quick, alright? I’m not gettin’ any younger. And be gentle, these joints aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are a little diminished, as expected. Now, can you tap your finger to your nose repeatedly with each hand?
PATIENT: Tap my nose? Really? See? Perfectly fine. A little shaky, maybe, but I can still do it. Honestly, you’re makin’ a mountain out of a molehill. My wife used to say I was a natural performer, good hand-eye coordination. Though that was… a long time ago. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I'm going to check your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, gettin’ up now… There. Happy now? I walk perfectly fine. A little slow, maybe, but what do you expect at my age? Can I sit down now? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Based on what I've seen, and your history, it’s possible you're experiencing the early stages of Essential Tremor. It’s a common neurological condition, particularly with increasing age. However, to rule out other possibilities – and it’s important we do that – I’d like to order some blood work. It will check your thyroid function and rule out any other underlying issues. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and possible imaging, such as a DaTscan. This will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and allow us to determine the best course of action.
PATIENT: Essential… what? Look, I don't like labels. And more tests? Seriously? I just want somethin’ to make it stop shakin’, not a fancy name and a bunch of poking and prodding. A neurologist? That sounds expensive. I'm on Medicare, you know? Honestly, I think I'll just… try and live with it. It can’t be that bad. And frankly, I have a lunch date. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your reluctance, but it’s important to get a proper diagnosis. While Essential Tremor is often benign, other conditions can mimic its symptoms. Ignoring it isn't the best approach. I can help facilitate the referral process with Medicare, and we can discuss affordable options for imaging if needed. However, if you absolutely decline further testing at this time, I will document your decision. I strongly advise against it, but I respect your autonomy. I can prescribe a low-dose beta-blocker to potentially manage the tremor, although it may have side effects. And I’ll document that you've declined the neurological referral and imaging. But please understand, this is against my medical judgment. Are you absolutely sure you want to proceed this way?
