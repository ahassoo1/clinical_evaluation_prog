DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. It’s been… well, a while now. Honestly, I can’t rightly say how long. Seems like it gets worse when I try to… do things. Little things, you know? Like holding a cup. It’s… bothersome. I just want it to stop, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a shaking, mostly in your hands, that’s been going on for a while. And it seems to worsen with activity, especially with fine motor skills like holding a cup. That is bothersome, I can imagine. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. When you say “a while now,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… oh, goodness. Years, I suppose. Maybe… five? Six? It started so gradually, I didn’t really notice it at first. My wife… well, my ex-wife… she pointed it out. Said I was spilling my coffee more often. That was… a while back. I don't keep good track of time these days. It just feels like a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, five or six years, gradual onset, noticed by your ex-wife initially. That’s helpful. And has it been steadily worsening over those years, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely gets worse. Some days are… better, I guess. But mostly, it’s just… there. And it's getting harder to ignore. It's like trying to hold something steady when you've got a little motor running inside your hand. And it seems to be spreading a bit, too. Not fast, but… I feel it in my arm now, sometimes. A little.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a gradual worsening over five or six years, with some fluctuations in severity, and now you’re noticing it in your arm as well. That's important to know. Now, besides your hands and arm, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think. I… I get tired easier, maybe? But I’m an old man, Doctor. Old men are tired. I wouldn't say that’s new. And… sometimes, my writing is a bit… shaky, even without the… the shaking. But I haven’t really paid much attention to it. Honestly, I haven't been feeling my best lately, but it’s hard to say what’s causing what, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can be hard to pinpoint things when things have been developing gradually. Fatigue and shaky writing… those are good things to mention. Now, have you noticed any stiffness in your joints, or any pain anywhere, besides maybe in your arm with the shaking?
PATIENT: Pain…? No, not really. A little ache now and then, but nothing I’d complain about. Old age aches, you know? I used to do a lot of work… down at the water treatment plant. Heavy lifting and such. Maybe it’s just leftover from that. My knees sometimes bother me, but that’s just getting old, I figure. No real… pain related to the shaking, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain directly related to the shaking. And you mentioned working at the water treatment plant – that involved heavy lifting. Do you have any history of injuries from that work, or any other significant medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Injuries… a few sprains here and there. Pulled a muscle in my back once, badly enough to be out for a week. Nothing… serious. I had… I think I had the flu, pretty bad, a few years back. But mostly, I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I don't go to doctors much. Waste of time, if you ask me. Until this shaking, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few old sprains and a bout of the flu, but generally healthy. I appreciate your honesty about not being a frequent doctor's visitor. It’s good to know your baseline health. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I used to take something for my… blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. But the doctor took me off it years ago. Said it was making me… dizzy. Now I don't take anything. Just coffee, mostly. And maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications besides the occasional aspirin. And you stopped taking blood pressure medication years ago due to dizziness. That's helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Have any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – experienced anything similar to your shaking, or had any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… family history… That’s a tough one. My mother… she had arthritis, pretty bad in her hands. She couldn’t knit anymore towards the end. My father… he was a strong man, always healthy. My brother… he had some trouble with his… nerves, I think. Kept forgetting things. But he wasn’t really one for doctors either, so I don’t know what it was. Everything feels so long ago, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to recall details from the past. Arthritis in your mother and some nerve issues in your brother – that’s good information. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Just… try to be quick, alright? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as efficient as possible. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. There. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm seeing a tremor in both hands, which is more pronounced with movement. Your muscle tone and reflexes are normal. Now, could you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Is that… enough? It feels silly walking back and forth like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Your walk is a little slow and deliberate, and your arm swing is reduced. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, there are a few possibilities. The tremor, its gradual onset, and the fact that it’s present in both hands suggest something called essential tremor. However, other conditions could cause similar symptoms. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. This will help rule out other potential causes, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding. Alright, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… get it over with quickly, alright? I don't like doctors much, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'll make sure it's as quick and comfortable as possible. The lab technician is very good. The blood tests will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and a general metabolic panel. We'll also check for any signs of inflammation. Once we have the results, we can discuss them further and determine the best course of action. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, if the shaking worsens significantly or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… No, I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? And… is this going to be expensive? I’m… not really insured these days.
DOCTOR: Good questions. The results usually take 3-5 business days to come back. We'll call you as soon as they're available. And regarding the cost, I understand your concern about being uninsured. Let me see what I can do. Okay, it looks like the blood tests will cost approximately $150. We do have a payment plan option available if that would be helpful. Also, our office does have a financial assistance program for patients with limited income. I can give you information about that as well. We can also explore some lower-cost options for follow-up care if needed, depending on the results of the tests. Would you like me to provide you with information about the payment plan and financial assistance program?
PATIENT: Financial assistance… Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. I’m not really good with all this paperwork, though.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand it can be overwhelming. Here you are. This form outlines the requirements for the financial assistance program. It just asks for some basic information about your income and expenses. Our office staff can help you fill it out if you'd like. They’re very good at navigating these things. The contact information on the sheet will allow you to speak directly with someone who can answer any questions you have about the program. Do you have any other questions for me at this point, or are you ready to head out?
PATIENT: No, I think… that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. And for not making me feel like a complete fool. I guess I'll go fill out that form.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. It was my pleasure. And you absolutely didn’t make me feel like a fool, not at all. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns while filling out the form. And remember, we’ll call you as soon as we have the results of the blood tests. Take care now, and I hope you have a good day. .
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Goodbye. .
