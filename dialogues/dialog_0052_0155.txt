DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. It's been… well, a while now. Not sure exactly how long. Seems to get worse when I try to… do things. Things I used to do, anyway. Water treatment, you know? Used to be good at that.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. A shaking, primarily in your hands, that's been present for some time and seems to worsen with activity, particularly tasks like water treatment. Could you describe the shaking to me in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Detail… right. It’s not constant. Comes and goes. Like… a little flutter at first. Then it gets… bigger. Harder to hold things steady. Like when I was… fixing pipes. Always had steady hands for that. Now… not so much. It's mostly when I try to do something precise. Just thinking about it sometimes makes it worse, actually. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Jezik. So, intermittent shaking, starting as a flutter and increasing in intensity, primarily affecting fine motor skills like fixing pipes, and even anticipatory shaking when thinking about performing those tasks. Yes, that is certainly something we need to investigate further. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this shaking?
PATIENT: First noticed…? Oh, dear. That’s… hard to say. A couple of years, maybe? Or was it three? Time… it all blurs together. I was still… working, I think. At the plant. It wasn't sudden, not like a switch flipped. Just… gradually got harder to do things. I remember… having trouble with a wrench. Dropping it a few times. Thought I was just getting old, you know? Old and clumsy. It's been getting worse lately, though. That's why I came.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that it's hard to pinpoint the exact start date, Mr. Jezik. Gradual onset is quite common. So, it began a couple of years ago, worsening over time, and has become more noticeable recently, prompting you to seek medical attention. Now, besides your hands, have you noticed any shaking in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Hmm. Other parts… not really. Maybe a little bit in my legs sometimes. But that could be… just weakness. Old age again. I used to walk a lot. Still do, when the weather’s good. But I get tired quicker. And sometimes… my balance feels a little off. But I haven't fallen or anything. Not yet, anyway. It’s just… a feeling. Like I could wobble. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. So, occasional sensation of instability or wobbliness in your legs, along with increased fatigue, but no falls as of yet. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Other conditions…? Not that I know of. Had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a while back. Doctor gave me some pills. Took ‘em for a bit. Don't remember if I still do. My wife… my ex-wife… she used to handle all that. Pills and appointments and such. I'm not much for remembering those things. She always said I was a terrible patient. Probably right. I mostly just try to ignore things until they bother me too much.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a history of high blood pressure, with medication prescribed at some point, but you’re unsure if you are currently taking it. That's alright, Mr. Jezik, we can sort through all of this. We have access to records, if available, that might help us piece things together. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Vitamins…? Oh, sometimes. My daughter sends me those chewable ones. The ones with the flintstones on them. But I forget to take them half the time. Supplements… no, not really. I used to drink a lot of beer. But I cut back. Doctor said it was bad for my… something. My stomach, I think. Mostly just water these days. Trying to be healthy, you know? It's hard. Everything’s a blur. I don't even remember what pills I used to take. Stop.
