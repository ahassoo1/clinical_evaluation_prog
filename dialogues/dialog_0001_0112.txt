DOCTOR: Alright, so… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pehrson. It’s… well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been going to the bathroom very frequently lately. More often than usual, and… I can't quite put my finger on when it started, exactly. It feels like it’s been a few weeks, perhaps? It's just… disruptive, really.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. It’s… difficult to plan anything, you see. And I find myself… constantly aware of where the nearest restroom is. It's rather unsettling. I apologize for being vague; my memory isn't what it used to be. It’s not a sudden thing, just… gradual.
DOCTOR: Look, a few weeks of needing to pee a lot… it happens. Is it painful when you go?
PATIENT: No, not painful, exactly. Just… frequent. And sometimes a bit urgent, even when I just went. It doesn’t burn, or ache, or anything like that. It's more of a… nagging sensation, if that makes sense. I really wish I could recall when it started properly, to give you a clearer picture. It feels like… after a hot day, perhaps? But I’ve had several hot days since then, and it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: Right. Any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting?
PATIENT: No, sir, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and I haven't been sick to my stomach at all. I've been feeling… relatively well, otherwise. Just… preoccupied, because of this. I've been trying to drink less water, thinking that might help, but it doesn’t seem to be making much difference, if I'm being honest. It's a bit frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your… bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… well, they’ve been… regular, I suppose. Not particularly different than usual. No changes there, thankfully. I apologize, Doctor; I’m not sure how relevant that is. Is it important that I mention everything, even if it feels… unrelated? I want to be as helpful as possible, but I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Look, it's all connected. Just gotta rule things out. Any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Oh! No, sir, no blood. Definitely not. I would have… noticed that, I think. That hasn’t happened. I’m fairly certain. I check, you know, instinctively, when something like this happens. Just to be sure. No blood, no pain, just… the frequency. It’s… rather perplexing, isn’t it? I'm sorry to be such a bother. Perhaps it’s just stress? Although, I haven’t been particularly stressed lately, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of… kidney problems?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Honestly, I’m not entirely sure. My family isn’t… terribly forthcoming with medical information. My mother passed away when I was quite young, and my father… well, we weren’t very close. I vaguely recall him mentioning something about a cousin having “trouble with her waterworks,” but that was years ago, and I don’t know any details. I apologize for being so unhelpful. It feels like I should know this sort of thing, but… things just weren’t discussed openly, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just take a quick listen to your abdomen, okay?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement completely. Please, go ahead. It's just… I don't usually have much cause to visit doctors, so I'm a little unsure of what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sounds… normal. Listen, it's probably just a simple UTI, even without pain or fever. But we gotta rule out anything serious. I'm gonna order a urinalysis.
PATIENT: A urinalysis, yes, that makes sense. I'm happy to do that. I appreciate you ruling things out, Doctor. It's good to know you’re being thorough. So, I’ll just… provide a sample? And then we wait for the results? Do I need to do anything special beforehand? I just want to be sure I understand correctly.
DOCTOR: Yeah, down the hall, first door on the left. Standard cup, try to get a mid-stream sample. I'll have the nurse take it from there. Should be pretty quick. And don't drink a ton of fluids before, you know, trying to get a clear sample. Don’t worry about it too much. Probably nothing.
PATIENT: Alright, a mid-stream sample, and not too much to drink beforehand. I can certainly manage that. Thank you, Doctor Pehrson. I appreciate your time and your help. I'll go do that now. Hopefully, it is nothing, as you say. I’ll let the nurse know I’ve left a sample. .
