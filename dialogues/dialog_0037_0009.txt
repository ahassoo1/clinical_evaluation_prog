DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…Alcorta, actually. Delano Alcorta. And truthfully? It’s my sight. It’s just not what it used to be. I’m starting to have trouble seeing things clearly, especially at a distance. It’s rather inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Thank you for the correction, Mr. Alcorta. I apologize for that. And I understand – changes in vision can certainly be inconvenient, and even concerning. Okay, so you're noticing difficulty with your vision, specifically distance vision. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I suppose. It didn’t happen overnight. More like…slowly getting worse over the last few months. I initially chalked it up to needing more light, or perhaps just fatigue. One doesn’t simply lose their eyesight, you know. It’s not as if I’ve been neglecting my health entirely. Although, truthfully, keeping up with things has become…challenging since the divorce. But that’s neither here nor there. The point is, it’s noticeable now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're addressing it now. It is common for vision to change gradually, and attributing it to fatigue initially is understandable. And thank you for sharing that context, Mr. Alcorta. Stress can certainly impact many aspects of our health. To get a better understanding, could you describe how things look blurry?
PATIENT: Blurry…well, it’s not as if everything is simply out of focus, if that makes sense. It’s more…muted. Colors don't seem as vibrant, and distant objects lack…definition. Like looking at a painting that hasn't quite dried. Everything is…soft. And at night, it’s considerably worse. Streetlights become halos, you see. Rather unpleasant. I haven’t been driving after dark for a while now, frankly. It’s a hazard.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. “Muted” colors and halos around lights, especially at night. That gives me a clearer picture. Have you noticed any difficulty with close-up vision at all – reading, for example?
PATIENT: Reading…yes, actually. Not terribly, but I do find myself holding things further away to get them in focus. And the smaller print? Forget about it. I used to enjoy the newspaper, but now…it’s just a strain. I’ve been relying more on the television, which isn't ideal, I assure you. All those flashing images. It's rather…stimulating. Perhaps too stimulating. Do you need me to elaborate on the detrimental effects of modern media?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Alcorta, that's quite alright. You’ve given me a very good understanding of what you're experiencing. So, difficulty with both distance and near vision, worsening over months, with muted colors and halos. Now, let’s go through some routine questions. Have you ever had any eye injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: Injuries? No, nothing significant. A childhood scrape or two, but nothing that would affect my sight now. Surgeries…no. I’ve never been one for doctors, truthfully. Preventative care is…overrated, in my opinion. If something isn't broken, why fix it? But here I am, needing to see one, so…ironic, isn’t it? And rather inconvenient. This whole process is taking up a perfectly good morning.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Alcorta. It's good to hear you haven't had any previous eye trauma or surgery. Next, are there any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. High blood pressure…the doctor mentioned it once, years ago, but it wasn't anything serious. Just a slightly elevated reading. And arthritis…well, I have my aches and pains, as one does at my age, but nothing officially diagnosed. I prefer to manage things myself, you see. A good walk, a healthy diet…those are far more effective than pills and procedures. Although, admittedly, the diet has slipped a bit since…well, never mind. The point is, no serious conditions. Nothing that would be directly impacting my vision, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Occasionally, a multivitamin. But nothing regularly. Prescription medications…no. I pride myself on avoiding them, as much as possible. They invariably have side effects, you see. Far better to rely on natural remedies, if one can. Although, frankly, I haven’t found a natural remedy for deteriorating eyesight. Which is why I’m here, of course. It’s a rather frustrating situation, to say the least. Are we nearly finished with these…inquiries?
DOCTOR: Almost, Mr. Alcorta. Just a couple more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. Dust bothers me occasionally, but I hardly consider that a true allergy. A slight irritation, perhaps. But nothing that requires medication or…intervention. It’s a rather simple existence, truthfully. Minimal sensitivities, minimal complications. Which makes this…vision issue all the more perplexing, you see. It’s throwing everything off balance.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you. And finally, do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoked? Good heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother wouldn’t allow it. And frankly, the very idea is rather distasteful. I’ve always prided myself on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. A good walk, a balanced diet, minimal stress…well, more minimal stress in the past, at least. So, no, no smoking. Never have, never will. This vision problem is particularly frustrating, as it’s not due to any of my…poor habits. It's simply…happening. Are we finally finished with these questions? I do have a rather full schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, we are finished with the questions. Thank you for your patience and thoroughness. Now, I’d like to perform a brief eye exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It won't be painful or uncomfortable. We’ll just check your visual acuity, peripheral vision, and the health of your eyes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An exam…yes, I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t involve anything…invasive. I’m rather sensitive, you see. And time is of the essence. I have commitments, you understand. But proceed, if you must. Just be quick about it, if you wouldn’t mind. I’d like to get this sorted out as efficiently as possible. And please, no startling noises. I detest startling noises.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. No startling noises, I promise. Alright, if you could please sit here and look straight ahead. First, we’ll test your vision with this chart. Can you read the smallest line you can see?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, these charts are rather…dimly lit. It’s hardly conducive to accurate assessment, you see. But proceed. I shall do my best. Though I suspect my vision is not what it once was. It’s rather frustrating, to say the least. Go ahead, then. Let's get this over with. Quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. Please cover your left eye with your hand. Now, starting with the top line, can you read the letters for me?
PATIENT: Right…let’s see. E…F…P…T…O… Oh, this is rather difficult. The letters are…fuzzy. P…T…O… I can make out a few, but they’re hardly crisp. E…F…P…T… No, this isn’t good. Not good at all. Are you certain this chart is properly illuminated? It’s rather…subtle. This is a waste of time, frankly. I knew this would be fruitless.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. And you're right to point that out – the lighting wasn't ideal. Let's try again with a brighter setting. Alright, again, cover your left eye, and read the letters, starting from the top line. Take your time.
PATIENT: E…F…P…T…O…L… Oh, this is marginally better, I suppose. P…T…O…L…D… But still…fuzzy. The letters lack definition. E…F…P…T…O…L…D…C… No. No, I can’t quite make out the last one. It’s…blurry. C… I think it’s a C, but I’m not certain. Honestly, this is rather exasperating. Are you sure your equipment is functioning correctly? I’m beginning to suspect a malfunction. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Alcorta. That gives me a good starting point. Now, let’s cover your right eye and test your left eye. Can you read the letters on the chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Very well. Although I suspect the results will be…similar. Honestly, I fail to see the point of this exercise. My vision is clearly deteriorating. It’s rather obvious. E…F…P…T…O…L… Yes, the top line is…manageable. P…T…O…L…D… But it’s becoming increasingly difficult. E…F…P…T…O…L…D…C… No. No, I can’t quite make out the last one. The letters are…wavering. C…? Perhaps. I think it’s a C, but I’m not certain. Honestly, this is quite frustrating. Are you certain this is a properly calibrated chart? I’m beginning to doubt the validity of this entire process.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. And I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. We’ll ensure everything is properly calibrated. Let’s try a different method. I’m going to hold up this card, and I want you to tell me which direction the fingers are pointing. Can you see the fingers clearly?
PATIENT: Fingers…? Honestly. Very well. Though I suspect the results will be equally…disappointing. I fail to see how this will provide any meaningful insight. But proceed, if you must. Though I must warn you, my patience is wearing thin. And I have a rather important appointment later this afternoon. Tell me...what colour are they?
DOCTOR: Alright. Before the direction, can you tell me what colour the fingers are, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Colour…? Honestly, Doctor, are you questioning my perception of colour? Of course I can see colour. They are…a rather muted shade of grey. Perhaps a slightly darker grey on the left side. But certainly, they are grey. This is a rather basic observation. Are you suggesting I have a colour deficiency? This is becoming rather insulting, frankly.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Alcorta. I apologize if I caused any offense. I am simply trying to gather as much information as possible. It is helpful to know your colour perception. Now, can you tell me which direction the fingers are pointing on this card?
PATIENT: Direction…yes, let me see. They seem to be pointing…upwards, I believe. Or perhaps slightly to the right. No, upwards. Definitely upwards. Although…they are rather blurry. It’s difficult to be certain. Are you sure this card is properly aligned? It seems to be wavering. Honestly, Doctor, this is a rather fruitless exercise. I suspect my vision is simply deteriorating, and this elaborate testing is only confirming the obvious. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Your responses are very helpful. Now, I’m going to wiggle my fingers here, and I want you to tell me when you can see them. Keep your eyes focused straight ahead. Can you see my fingers when I wiggle them in your peripheral vision?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision… Honestly. Very well. Though I suspect the results will be equally…disappointing. Keep my eyes focused…yes, yes, I understand. Wiggle your fingers, then. But do try to be swift about it. I have a rather important engagement later this afternoon, and this elaborate testing is consuming a considerable amount of time. Can I see them...? No. No, I can't. Not at all. Although...I think I might detect a slight flickering in the corner of my eye. But it's very faint. It's difficult to be certain. Honestly, Doctor, this is a rather pointless exercise. I suspect my vision is simply deteriorating, and this elaborate testing is only confirming the obvious. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Alcorta. Based on the findings of this brief exam – the decreased visual acuity, the muted colour perception, and the diminished peripheral vision – it appears you are experiencing a significant visual impairment. It’s difficult to determine the exact cause without further investigation, but it could be due to a number of factors, including age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts, or other underlying medical conditions. I recommend a comprehensive dilated eye exam with an ophthalmologist as soon as possible. They will be able to perform a more thorough evaluation and determine the underlying cause of your vision loss and recommend appropriate treatment options. I can provide you with a referral if you would like. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts… Honestly, Doctor, you’re throwing around a rather alarming array of medical terms. This is precisely what I feared. A cascade of complications and expensive procedures. A comprehensive dilated eye exam…yes, I suppose so. Although, I must warn you, I am not particularly fond of medical interventions. I prefer a more…natural approach, if possible. A referral, you say? Very well. If you could provide me with a list of ophthalmologists in the area, I will consider it. But I make no promises. Frankly, the entire situation is rather disheartening. And tell me, Doctor, what are the probabilities of these…complications? Are we talking about complete blindness here? Be frank with me. I prefer honesty, however unpleasant. And don't sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Alcorta. It’s natural to feel apprehensive when faced with a potential vision impairment. And you are right to ask about the probabilities and potential outcomes. Based on the findings today, it’s impossible to say with certainty whether you are at risk of complete blindness. However, the symptoms you are experiencing do warrant further investigation to rule out serious conditions. If it is age-related macular degeneration, early detection and treatment can often slow the progression of the disease and preserve your remaining vision. If it is glaucoma, early treatment can help to lower the pressure in your eyes and prevent further damage to the optic nerve. If it is cataracts, surgery is often very effective in restoring your vision. The good news is that many of these conditions are treatable, especially when detected early. Ignoring the symptoms will only increase the risk of permanent vision loss. I’m going to provide you with a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected ophthalmologist in the area. She will perform a comprehensive dilated eye exam and discuss your treatment options with you. It’s important to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Dr. Reed, you say? Very well. I suppose it's worth consulting with her. Though I remain skeptical. Doctors often have a vested interest in prescribing expensive procedures, you see. And what is your professional opinion, Doctor? Based on your assessment today, what is the most likely cause of my vision impairment? Be candid. I prefer to know the worst, if that is the case. And don’t attempt to sugarcoat it. Honesty is paramount, however unpleasant. And don't attempt to upsell me on any unnecessary treatments. I'm not easily swayed.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, given the gradual onset of your symptoms—the decreased visual acuity, the muted colour perception, and the diminished peripheral vision—the most likely cause, in my professional opinion, is age-related macular degeneration. However, without a comprehensive examination by an ophthalmologist, I cannot definitively diagnose you. Age-related macular degeneration is a common condition that affects people over the age of 50. It causes a gradual breakdown of the macula, the central part of the retina, which is responsible for sharp, central vision. There are two types: dry and wet. Dry AMD is more common and progresses slowly, while wet AMD is less common but progresses more rapidly. The reason I am referring you to Dr. Reed is because she has the specialized equipment and expertise to perform a thorough evaluation, determine the type of AMD you may have, and recommend the most appropriate treatment options. These options may include lifestyle modifications, nutritional supplements, or injections to slow the progression of the disease. I understand your concerns about unnecessary treatments, and I want to assure you that I would never recommend anything that is not in your best interest. Dr. Reed is a highly respected ophthalmologist who is known for her ethical practice and patient-centered care. She will discuss all of your treatment options with you and help you make an informed decision. Do you have any further questions about this, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Injections… Honestly. That sounds rather… unpleasant. And costly, I presume? I suppose I should inquire about the financial implications of these… procedures. I'm not one for frivolous spending, you see. And what is the success rate of these injections? What are the potential side effects? Be frank with me. I prefer to know all the risks before committing to anything. And don't attempt to downplay them. Honesty is paramount, however unpleasant. This entire situation is rather disheartening, you see. I had hoped for a simpler explanation, a less… invasive solution. But it appears my vision is simply deteriorating, and I am at the mercy of these… medical interventions. Very well. I will schedule an appointment with Dr. Reed, if only to obtain a definitive diagnosis. But I make no promises. I remain skeptical, you see. And I will be thoroughly scrutinizing her recommendations. Don't expect me to simply accept them at face value.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Alcorta. You are right to be thorough and ask questions. It's important to be fully informed before making any decisions about your health. Regarding the financial implications, the cost of the injections will depend on your insurance coverage. I can provide you with a referral to a financial counselor who can help you navigate the costs and explore your options. The injections are generally safe, but they do carry some potential side effects, such as eye pain, bleeding, infection, and retinal detachment. However, these side effects are rare, and Dr. Reed will take all necessary precautions to minimize your risk. It's important to remember that Dr. Reed will perform a comprehensive evaluation to determine the best course of treatment for your individual needs. She may recommend other options besides injections, such as lifestyle modifications or nutritional supplements. I want to assure you that Dr. Reed is a highly skilled and compassionate ophthalmologist who will work with you to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific goals and preferences. She will answer all of your questions and address any concerns you may have. Here's some information about age-related macular degeneration and a list of resources that you may find helpful. I wish you all the best, Mr. Alcorta. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I shall schedule an appointment with Dr. Reed. Though I remain skeptical, you see. I appreciate your candor, Doctor. Though I suspect this entire situation is rather… disheartening. I had hoped for a simpler explanation, a less… invasive solution. But it appears my vision is simply deteriorating, and I am at the mercy of these… medical interventions.
