DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is...a physical, yes? For the insurance. I have Medicare now, and they require this check-up before it is...complete. It is all very confusing, these papers.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A welcome physical to get everything sorted with Medicare. Those papers can be quite confusing. No worries at all, we'll get through it. It’s a pretty standard check-up. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health...hmm. I work, you know? In the food place. Processing. It is...fine. I do not sit all day, which is good. I lift things. Heavy things, sometimes. Aside from that...I eat. Normal food. I think. I do not have…problems. Serious problems, anyway. What do you mean, “tell you”? Like, what specifically?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re staying active with your work. And yes, you’re right to ask for specifics. I just want to get a good picture of how you’ve been feeling generally. Let’s start with this: have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy... hmm. It is hot, you know? This summer is very hot. Makes everyone tired. But… no, not really. I am always a little tired after work, but that is normal. Lifting boxes all day… it takes it out of a man. I do not feel more tired than usual. Is that what you are asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I’m asking. And you’re right, the heat can certainly take a toll. So, no new or worsening fatigue. Good. Now, have you experienced any pain anywhere in your body recently?
PATIENT: Pain...sometimes. My back, maybe? After a long day lifting. It is not a bad pain, you understand. It is…a working pain. Like when you use a muscle too much. Rub it, and it goes away. I take…what is it called… ibuprofen? For it sometimes. Not every day. Only when it hurts. Is this what you want to know? If I am broken? I am not broken.
DOCTOR: No, not at all! Definitely not worried about you being broken. It sounds like you're describing some typical muscle soreness from your work. That's helpful to know. You’re very self-aware, which is good. Ibuprofen is fine for that, as long as you’re not needing it every day. To be thorough, have you noticed any pain in your joints – your knees, elbows, wrists, shoulders – anything like stiffness or aching?
PATIENT: Joints... hmm. No. No stiffness. Sometimes my hands are…tired, after working with the food. All the washing and the…the boxes. But not pain. Just…weariness. Like when you use them too much. Like my back. Is this the same thing? All this… using my body? You ask many questions. Are you sure it is important?
DOCTOR: It is a lot of questions, I apologize. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your health, and you're right, a lot of it sounds related to the physical demands of your job. And yes, what you’re describing sounds like typical muscle fatigue. Just to be sure, have you noticed any swelling in your joints – your hands, knees, ankles – anything at all?
PATIENT: Swelling... no. No swelling. My hands, maybe a little in the summer? Everything swells in the summer heat. But not...big swelling. Not like a balloon. Just… normal summer puffiness. My wife says I should drink more water. She is always telling me to drink more water. Is that important? The water?
DOCTOR: Your wife is very wise. Staying hydrated is important, especially with physical work and in this heat. So, no significant swelling. That’s good. Let’s move on to other things. Have you had any changes in your weight recently – either gained or lost weight without trying?
PATIENT: Weight…hmm. No. Not really. I always eat the same amount. Maybe a little more in the winter. It is cold, and you need more food when it is cold. But not now. Not big changes. I am… solid. Always solid. I do not go up and down like some people. Is this a trick question? Are you trying to find out if I am eating too much?
DOCTOR: No trick question at all! And no, I’m not trying to find out if you’re eating too much. You’re very honest, which is good. Just trying to get a complete picture. Okay, let’s talk about other systems. Have you been having any problems with your digestion?
PATIENT: Digestion...? Hmm. Sometimes, yes. A little…slow, maybe? When I eat too much. Especially…the spicy food my wife makes. It does not agree with me sometimes. But nothing serious. I take…what is it called… something for it. From the store. It makes it… move. Is that what you mean? Problems with… the inside? It is not broken, either.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s what I meant. And you’re right to clarify. Occasional constipation, especially with spicy food, is very common. And it sounds like you’re managing it okay with something over the counter. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urination – the frequency, the amount, or any pain or discomfort when you go?
PATIENT: Urination... hmm. No. Everything is normal there. I go… when I need to go. The same as always. No pain. No…different colors. No problems. You ask very personal questions, you know? Is this what doctors do? They ask about…everything? It is very strange. Is this for the insurance? They want to know if I… leak?
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a lot of personal questions. It can feel strange, I understand. We ask these questions because they can give us clues about your overall health. And yes, the insurance requires us to gather a lot of information. You're right to clarify. No, I’m not asking if you leak. I’m just trying to rule out any issues with your kidneys or bladder. Okay, let’s move on. Have you had any fevers, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fevers, chills… no. Nothing like that. It is hot, so I sweat a lot. But not at night. I sleep… normal. My wife says I snore, but that is always. She sleeps in the other room sometimes because of the snoring. But no fever. No shaking. Just… normal summer sweating. Is this almost finished? You have been asking for a long time.
DOCTOR: We’re getting there! Just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Vision…hmm. It is…blurry sometimes, when I wake up. But I rub my eyes, and it goes away. My wife says I need glasses, but I do not want glasses. I can see fine. Hearing… yes. Sometimes, I do not hear my wife when she speaks quietly. She says I am ignoring her. But I am not! My ears are fine. Are you trying to say I am old? Is that it?
DOCTOR: No, not at all! It’s completely normal for vision and hearing to change as we get older. It sounds like you might just need a little help seeing up close, and maybe speak up a little to your wife. But nothing to be worried about. One last question: Have you had any skin changes recently, like new moles, or any sores that aren’t healing?
PATIENT: Skin...no. Nothing new. Sometimes, my skin is dry in the winter. But that is normal. I use lotion. My wife buys me lotion. She worries about everything. No new spots. No…oozing. No problems. Is that all? Can we be finished now? I need to go back to work. I am losing money sitting here.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all the questions. Thank you for being so honest and patient with me. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it is quick. And as long as you do not find anything…broken. I told you, I am solid. But… alright. Do what you need to do. Just… be gentle. And hurry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Gentle and quick, I promise. Please have a seat on the table, and we’ll get started. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright. But do not press too hard. It hurts when people press too hard. And hurry, please. I have boxes to lift. <I take a deep breath, but it sounds a bit forced and shallow.>
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths. In and out... Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. <I document "Heart regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally."> Now, let’s check your blood pressure. <I wrap the blood pressure cuff around his upper arm and inflate it, listening with the stethoscope. After a moment, I release the pressure and note the reading: 130/80 mmHg> Blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is slightly elevated, but not a cause for immediate concern. <I document "BP 130/80 mmHg."> Now, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears… <I gently insert an otoscope into his ears and examine the ear canals.> Ears look clear, no signs of infection or wax buildup. <I document "Tympanic membranes clear bilaterally."> And finally, let’s just open wide and say “Ah”… <I use a tongue depressor to gently depress his tongue and examine his throat. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. <I document "Oropharynx clear, no erythema or exudates."> Alright, everything looks good. You’re in good shape. <I remove the tongue depressor and close the chart.>
PATIENT: Good. So, I am not broken? As I said. Now, what about the insurance? Is this enough for them? Do I need to come back? I do not have time for this. Tell me quickly.
DOCTOR: No, you are absolutely not broken. As you’ve repeatedly said! And yes, this physical exam should be sufficient for Medicare. I’ll submit the results electronically to them. They may require some additional paperwork from you, but I can have my office staff help you with that. I'll also print out a summary of today’s visit for your records. <I begin typing on the computer.> Based on today’s exam, you appear to be in good overall health. We discussed some minor elevation in your blood pressure, but it’s not a major concern at this time. We’ll monitor it at future visits. I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and getting regular exercise. Are there any questions you have about that?
PATIENT: Exercise... yes. Lifting boxes is exercise, no? And I drink water when I am thirsty. Is that not enough? My wife is always telling me what to do. No, I think that is all. Just… send the papers to the insurance quickly, please. And thank you… I suppose. It was…thorough. But a waste of time. <I stand up, adjusting my tie.> .
DOCTOR: Yes, lifting boxes is exercise! And drinking when you're thirsty is a good start. My office staff will send the paperwork to Medicare right away. They’ll let you know if they need anything further from you. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Barban. And you’re welcome. If you have any concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to call. <I offer a friendly smile and extend my hand for a handshake.> Have a good day, and be careful lifting those boxes!
