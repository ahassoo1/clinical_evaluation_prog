DOCTOR: Hi Wynell, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s… well, it’s about this foot thing. Honestly, all this fuss… I don't really do doctors. My ex-husband, bless his soul, was always dragging me to someone or other. Always something. And frankly, I’ve lived a long life, and I think I know what’s best for myself. It’s just… they want me to have… procedures. Nonsense, I say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You've had a lot of experience with doctors, and you prefer to manage things yourself. That's perfectly alright. Let’s talk about this foot thing then. Can you tell me a little more about what’s going on?
PATIENT: Well, it aches, naturally. It aches when I walk, mostly. And it looks… not quite right. Swollen, I suppose. But aches and pains come with age, don't they? I’ve been managing it with Epsom salts. That usually does the trick. Though lately… not so much. It’s just… I don’t want anyone poking and prodding. I really don't. I heard stories, you know. Dreadful stories.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation. We'll take things at your pace, and I'll explain everything before we do anything. It’s good you've been trying Epsom salts, that can definitely help with inflammation. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me where exactly on your foot it's aching?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where exactly… hmm. It’s… the top, I think. Near the… the little bendy bits? I’m terrible with names for things. Not the heel, definitely not the heel. It’s more towards the… the toes, but not in the toes. It's just… a general ache, really. It’s hard to pinpoint. It’s not like a sharp pain, thank heavens. It's just… bothersome. And it’s getting worse, slowly but surely.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like it’s aching on the top of your foot, around where your toes bend. And it’s more of a general soreness than a sharp pain. That helps. Has this been a sudden thing, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: Oh, building up, definitely building up. Not like I woke up one morning and… BAM. No, no. It’s been… creeping along, slowly but surely. I probably should have come in sooner, but honestly… I just hoped it would go away on its own. Like everything else does eventually. I've always been a 'wait and see' kind of person. Though, as I said, it's starting to be more than a bothersome ache. It's just… frustrating. I like to keep busy, you know? This slows me down.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re here now. Waiting to see often works, but sometimes things need a little extra attention. And I definitely appreciate you wanting to stay active. Now, have you noticed any redness or warmth around the foot?
PATIENT: Redness… hmm. Let me think. Not particularly, no. Maybe a little, but I have poor circulation, you know? My ankles swell easily, and things get… discolored sometimes. It's hard to tell what's normal and what's not. Warmth… no, not really. It feels… normal temperature, I suppose. Though, like I said, my feet are usually cold. I wear thick socks, always. Can’t stand cold feet. It's just the ache, really. That's the main problem. And this feeling that it’s getting worse. It worries me, a little. But I don’t like to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant redness or warmth, and you've noticed some circulation issues with swelling and discoloration. That's helpful to know. Would you mind if I took a quick look at your foot?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Look at it? Well… I suppose. But gently, please. And no poking! I really don't like being poked. And no bright lights, if you can avoid it. My eyes aren't what they used to be, you know. Just a quick look, you say? Very quick? I don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Just a quick look, very gently. No poking, I promise. And I’ll dim the lights. Okay… I see a little swelling around the base of your metatarsals – those are the long bones in your foot. And there’s some tenderness when I gently press here. It doesn't appear red or inflamed, which is good. Can you wiggle your toes for me?
PATIENT: Metatarsals, you say? Fancy name for bones. Alright, wiggling toes… . There. All wiggled. Though they feel a little… stiff, if I'm honest. Not as nimble as they used to be. Everything is getting old, you know? Even my toes. Is that bad? Don't tell me it's serious. I really don’t want to hear about anything serious. I’ve had enough trouble in my life, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. They’re moving, but you’re right, they don't have a full range of motion. It could be a sign of some stiffness in the joints. It's not necessarily serious, but we should investigate a bit further. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, it sounds like you might have some early signs of arthritis in the foot, possibly metatarsalgia, which is pain in the ball of your foot. It’s very common, especially as we get older. But I’d like to get an x-ray just to confirm that and rule out anything else. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Arthritis? Oh, goodness. My mother had arthritis. Dreadful pain, she used to say. Constant pain. And x-rays? Oh, dear. I don’t like radiation. Is it… safe? I heard stories about radiation… terrible stories. And what if it shows something awful? I really don't want to know about anything awful. I’m old, you know. What’s the point of poking around and finding something else to worry about? I just want the ache to go away. Is there anything else we can do? Epsom salts, perhaps? Stronger Epsom salts?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Wynell. It's completely normal to be worried about radiation, and I want to assure you that the amount of radiation from a foot x-ray is very, very low – less than what you get from a cross-country flight. It’s a quick and helpful way to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in the foot. And you're right, we don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with. However, knowing what’s actually going on allows us to manage the pain effectively. Stronger Epsom salts might help temporarily, but it won’t address the underlying cause. If it is arthritis, we can explore several options, like special shoe inserts, physical therapy, or medication to reduce inflammation. Before we decide, let’s talk about the benefits and risks of the x-ray again. We can also discuss alternative options if you’re really uncomfortable with it. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Alright, talk. Talk is good. I don't like surprises. You say very, very low radiation? Lower than flying? That's… something, I suppose. But what if it is arthritis? What does that even mean? Will I be crippled? Will I need a cane? I've seen people with canes… not a pretty sight. And medication… I don’t like taking pills. Pills make me sleepy. And the shoe inserts… will they fit in my good shoes? I have a luncheon next month, you see. Can't wear unsightly shoes to a luncheon. So… tell me. Tell me everything. But slowly, please. And no medical jargon. Just plain English.
DOCTOR: Okay, Wynell, let's take it one step at a time. You’re right to ask all these questions – it’s important to be informed. First, the x-ray. As I said, the radiation exposure is very low. It’s a small dose, and it allows us to see the bones in your foot and check for any signs of arthritis – like narrowing of the joint space or bone spurs. Now, if it is arthritis, it doesn't automatically mean you’ll be crippled or need a cane. Arthritis comes in many forms, and the severity varies greatly. Most people manage it very well with conservative treatment, meaning things like: Shoe inserts: These help support your arch and cushion your foot, taking pressure off the affected joints. We can find ones that fit in your good shoes – I promise! Physical therapy: This can help strengthen the muscles around your foot and improve your range of motion. Medication: If the pain is severe, we can consider pain relievers or anti-inflammatory medications. We’ll start with the lowest dose possible, and we can always adjust it if needed. Some cause drowsiness, but there are alternatives. Lifestyle changes: Simple things like avoiding high-impact activities and maintaining a healthy weight can also help. The goal is to reduce your pain, improve your function, and allow you to continue doing the things you enjoy – like going to your luncheon! We won’t know for sure until we get the x-ray, but I want to assure you that we’ll work together to find a treatment plan that’s right for you. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm. Alright. Alright, that sounds… less dreadful than I imagined. Shoe inserts, physical therapy… those don’t sound so bad. The pills worry me, but we can talk about that later. And you promise to find inserts that fit in my good shoes? They’re very important shoes, you know. Patent leather. But the x-ray… still. Still makes me nervous. But if it’s the only way to know… Alright. Alright, let’s do the x-ray. But be quick, please. And gentle. And no bright lights. And no surprises. And you tell me everything afterwards. Everything. And in plain English. Can you promise me that?
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise, Wynell. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. No bright lights, I promise. And I will explain everything to you afterwards, in plain English – no medical jargon. We'll get the x-ray done, and then we'll sit down and discuss the results together. We’ll take it one step at a time. Let me just get the order for the x-ray and then I'll have the technician come in to get you ready. Is there anyone you’d like to call while we wait?
PATIENT: No, no one to call. My ex-husband… well, let’s not talk about him. He wouldn't care either way. Just get it over with, please. The sooner it's done, the sooner I can forget about it. And make sure those technicians are gentle. I don’t like rough hands.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll make sure the technicians are aware of your concerns and treat you with the utmost care. I'll stay with you until you’re settled in, and then I’ll be right here when you’re done. Let's head over to the x-ray room. It won't take long at all.
