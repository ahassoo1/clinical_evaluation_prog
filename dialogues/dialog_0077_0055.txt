DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on and on about it. Says it's good for… everything. Honestly, I don’t quite understand it, but she’s very insistent. I suppose I just want to know if I qualify for one of those cards, you know? It seems a bit… much, but if it truly helps, and if a doctor recommends it…
DOCTOR: I understand. Your daughter believes medical marijuana might be beneficial for you, and you’d like to explore whether you meet the criteria for a card here in the state. That's perfectly reasonable. To assess that, I’ll need to gather some information about your current health. It's been…some time since I’ve discussed medical marijuana qualifications with a patient, if you don’t mind me saying. Now, to begin, can you tell me about any health concerns you're currently experiencing?
PATIENT: Well, some time is quite right. It's not exactly something one boasts about, is it? But alright. My knees, mostly. They ache terribly, especially in damp weather. And my sleep… oh, don't even get me started on the sleep. It comes and goes like a fickle friend. And honestly, I'm just… tired. Not the sort you fix with a good night’s rest, if you understand. It’s a… weariness of the soul, perhaps. Is that something you even treat with… this marijuana? Seems rather drastic for tiredness.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Chronic pain and difficulty sleeping can certainly be… draining. And yes, those are conditions that medical marijuana is sometimes considered for, though it's not a first-line treatment, naturally. We would need to explore other options first. Now, regarding your knees... how long have they been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Decades, dear. Decades! Since I was a young woman, really. I used to be quite the dancer, you know. Ballroom, mostly. But that was a long time ago. I’ve tried… creams, and those over-the-counter pills. They help a bit, for a few hours. But the pain always comes back. And stronger, if I’m honest. It’s not like a sudden, sharp pain, you understand. It’s a… constant dull ache. A throbbing, really. And it gets worse with the weather. Damp is the absolute worst. Ruins everything.
DOCTOR: Decades of pain, worsening with damp weather. And the over-the-counter remedies provide only temporary relief. I see. Have you ever been formally diagnosed with anything related to your knees, such as arthritis?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve seen doctors. Plenty of them, over the years. They poke and prod, and tell me it’s “wear and tear.” Old age, they say. As if that’s a diagnosis! No, I don’t have a fancy piece of paper saying “arthritis” or anything. Just told to take some pills and get on with it. Honestly, it's quite dismissive. As if a little pain is nothing. It affects my entire life, you know. I can’t garden, I can’t walk for long, I certainly can't dance anymore. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration completely. It sounds like your concerns haven't been adequately addressed in the past, and that's not acceptable. “Wear and tear” is, unfortunately, a common, and often unhelpful, diagnosis. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you experienced any other medical problems in recent years?
PATIENT: Oh, where to begin? My blood pressure fluctuates, they tell me. Nothing too serious, just need to “watch my salt.” And I’ve had some… digestive issues, if you must know. Nothing pleasant to discuss. Mostly just… discomfort. And lately, my memory hasn’t been what it used to be. Not forgetting everything, mind you. Just… names, sometimes. And where I put things. But I suppose that’s just part of getting old, isn’t it? Honestly, I’m not here because I’m falling apart, Doctor. It’s just… this darn knee pain. And my daughter keeps going on and on about this marijuana... It’s unsettling, really.
DOCTOR: Fluctuating blood pressure, some digestive discomfort, and some memory issues. I see. Now, regarding medications, are you currently taking anything regularly for any of these conditions, or anything else?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for the blood pressure, Doctor. A small white one. I think it’s called… Lisinopril? Something like that. And sometimes, when my stomach is particularly upset, I take something over-the-counter. Pepto-Bismol, mostly. That’s it. Nothing fancy. I don't like taking a lot of pills, if I can help it. It all feels so… unnatural. And frankly, I don’t trust half the things they prescribe these days.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril for blood pressure and Pepto-Bismol as needed. And you prefer to avoid medications when possible. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I’m aware of, dear. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, practically. And I've tried all sorts of lotions and potions over the years. Never had a reaction. Maybe a little sniffle with certain flowers, but that’s just a bit of hay fever, I think. Nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very… robust woman. I don't usually have allergies. It’s just this knee… and my daughter’s insistence on this… marijuana. It’s all rather unsettling, if you must know.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Very good. Now, just one final question before we proceed. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! I was raised better than that, dear. My mother would have had a fit! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I certainly wouldn't start now. It’s a dreadful habit. Bad for your health, bad for your complexion… just bad, bad, bad! No, I’ve never smoked a day in my life. This marijuana… it’s different, isn’t it? My daughter says you can take it in other ways. But still… it feels rather… unconventional.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ellan. That’s all the information I need for now. Now, I’m going to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your knees. It’ll just take a few moments. Please just lie back on the examination table, and let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please be gentle. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know. And do hurry, if you wouldn’t mind. I don’t particularly enjoy being poked and prodded. It brings back… unpleasant memories, if I’m honest. But alright, proceed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142/88, slightly elevated, but within a manageable range. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please bend your knees for me, as much as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s not very comfortable, Doctor. Not at all. It feels… tight. And creaky. Like an old door hinge, if you understand. And it's sore, naturally. Very sore. Stop, please. Stop now, before I really hurt myself. Honestly, it's not a very encouraging sign, is it? There. Much better. It's not that I'm trying to be difficult, you understand. It's just… painful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. My apologies. I didn't mean to cause any discomfort. Upon visual inspection, there is some mild swelling around both knees, and a visible bony prominence. Range of motion is limited, as you described, and there's some crepitus with movement. Tenderness is present on palpation of the medial joint line of both knees. It appears there is some degree of osteoarthritis affecting both knees, which would explain the pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. Now, I would like to discuss some potential treatment options with you. Would you be open to considering some conservative management strategies, such as physical therapy, weight management, and over-the-counter pain relief?
PATIENT: Physical therapy? Honestly, Doctor, at my age? It sounds… exhausting. And weight management? I’m a perfectly reasonable size, thank you very much. And I’ve already told you, the over-the-counter pills barely touch the pain. It's just… frustrating. Honestly, I came here because my daughter keeps talking about this marijuana. Is it truly an option? Is it safe? And will it actually help my knees? Or is it just another one of those… modern fads? I'm not interested in endless exercises and pills, Doctor. I want a solution, not another temporary fix. If it were not for my daughter, I would never have bothered coming. Frankly, it seems the most efficient solution would be the marijuana, should I qualify.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ellan. And you’re right to question the safety and efficacy of any treatment option. Medical marijuana can be a helpful option for managing chronic pain, but it’s not a magic bullet, and it's not without potential risks and side effects. It’s most effective when combined with other conservative management strategies, such as physical therapy, and weight management, but I understand your reluctance. Now, to determine if you meet the criteria for a medical marijuana card in this state, we need to consider your specific medical condition, and your response to other treatments. Given your long-standing knee pain, with limitations in range of motion, and limited response to over-the-counter medications, I believe you may qualify. However, I also need to rule out any other underlying causes of your knee pain, such as a meniscus tear or ligament damage. Would you be willing to consider getting an X-ray of both knees, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds… invasive. And frankly, I don’t see the point. I’ve lived with this pain for decades. I know it’s not a sudden injury. It’s just… wear and tear, as all the other doctors have said. I’m not convinced an X-ray will change anything. It’s just another delay, another expense… Honestly, if I can’t get a card without an X-ray, I may as well just give up. My daughter will be disappointed, of course, but at my age, one gets rather… resigned to things. Is it absolutely necessary? Or can we just… proceed with the marijuana evaluation, based on what we’ve already discussed? I really don’t relish the thought of being poked and prodded even more.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ellan. An X-ray is not absolutely necessary, but it would provide a more comprehensive assessment and help rule out any other underlying conditions. However, given your long-standing symptoms, and your limited response to conservative treatments, I am willing to proceed with the marijuana evaluation without it. Now, just to be clear, you do understand that medical marijuana is not a cure, and it may not completely alleviate your pain?
PATIENT: Of course I understand, Doctor. I'm not a fool. I've lived long enough to know there are no miracle cures. I simply hope it will provide some relief. Enough to allow me to garden without wincing every five minutes, perhaps. Enough to sleep through the night without being constantly disturbed by the pain. Honestly, if it only reduces the discomfort by a small amount, it would be a vast improvement. It’s not about eliminating the pain entirely, Doctor. It’s about making it… bearable. So, yes. Proceed. Let’s see about getting this… marijuana evaluation done with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ellan. I can certainly understand that. Now, to proceed with the evaluation, I need to complete a questionnaire regarding your medical history, and your current symptoms. It will also involve a discussion about the different forms of medical marijuana available, and the potential risks and side effects. It’s important to be fully informed before making a decision. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. Will my daughter be allowed to assist me with the… administration of this marijuana, should I be approved? She’s quite knowledgeable about it, you see, and I’m not particularly tech-savvy. Honestly, I'm rather worried about messing it all up.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ellan. Yes, your daughter is absolutely allowed to assist you with the administration of your medical marijuana, provided she is a registered caregiver. She will need to complete a separate application, and undergo a background check. The laws regarding caregiver assistance are quite specific, but I can provide you with all the necessary information and forms. It's important to ensure both you and your daughter are fully compliant with the regulations. Now, let's begin with this questionnaire. It shouldn't take too long.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Let’s get this over with. Honestly, all this paperwork… it’s enough to give one a headache. .
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ellan. I understand it can be a bit overwhelming. I'm here to help if you have any questions. .
