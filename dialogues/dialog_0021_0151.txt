DOCTOR: Hello, Ms. Uzarski. I'm Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s this tingling, you see. In my hands and feet mostly. It's been going on for… a little while now, I guess. Not terrible, but annoying.
DOCTOR: A little while… right. And when you say annoying, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, it's hard to explain. Like… pins and needles, but not always painful. Sometimes it just feels… numb, like they're not quite there. And it comes and goes, you know? It’s worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. I just want it to stop, really.
DOCTOR: Worse at night, hm. Interesting. And is this tingling constant, or does it come and go throughout the day as well?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely worse at night, like I said. During the day… it kinda fades in and out. I don’t really notice it when I'm busy, you know? Like when I'm on my route delivering the mail. But when I sit down to rest… that’s when it really starts. It’s just… distracting.
DOCTOR: Delivering the mail… so you do a fair bit of walking and being on your feet. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, well… not really. Same route for years, honestly. The weather's been hot, of course, but that’s normal for August. Maybe a little more walking because some folks are getting more packages these days... but nothing major, I don't think. My husband… he passed away last year, so that was a big change, but… I don’t know if that’s got anything to do with it. It just started a few months after that.
DOCTOR: I see. And… you said a few months after. Were you experiencing any stress or anxiety around the time it began, beyond the… the loss of your husband?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, who wouldn't be stressed after that? It was… it was a shock, you know? He was healthy as a horse one day and… gone the next. Everything was different after that. I tried to keep busy, keep things normal… but it wasn’t easy. I don’t think I slept properly for months. But I'm doing okay now. As okay as a widow can be, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. And aside from the tingling, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my feet feel a little cold sometimes, even when it’s warm. And maybe a little bit clumsy. I almost tripped over the porch step last week. But I figured I was just not paying attention, you know? Old age creeping up on me. I haven’t noticed anything else… not that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any changes in your diet or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I eat pretty much the same as always. A little soup, some bread, you know, Ukrainian food. I maybe lost a few pounds because I wasn't eating as much after… well. But I’ve put most of that back on. I like to cook, so I’m never really hungry. I’m probably a little heavy, if that matters.
DOCTOR: It can. And do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions that you’re currently being treated for?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies that I know of. And no, nothing I'm being treated for. I haven't really needed to see a doctor much in my life, thankfully. Just the usual check-ups when I was younger. I don’t have insurance, so I try to stay healthy and avoid going, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation in your hands and feet. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels painful. Then we’ll talk about what might be going on. If you’ll just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… fine. I hope it doesn’t take too long, Doctor. I have a route to finish this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. I'm going to start with your reflexes. Could you place your arms loosely by your sides?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: Not at all. Just a little tap. Hmm… a little diminished on both sides. Now, let's check sensation. Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel it. It's… a little numb, though. Not as strong as it should be, I think. Like… a dull feeling? It's hard to explain. It's not painful, just… not right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one too, but it's… fainter. Much fainter. It's mostly just… a coolness, like a breeze on my skin. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit strange. I don't understand what's going on. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Well, the reflexes are a little diminished and the sensation isn't quite what it should be, as you said. I also notice a slight coolness to your feet. It could be a number of things, honestly. Sometimes it's just circulation, especially if you're on your feet a lot. But, given your symptoms… and the fact that it’s been going on for a while… we need to rule out some other possibilities. Have you ever had any issues with diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother… yes, she had that. Diabetes, I think. She was sick for a long time before she… well, before she passed. She had to get shots, and she always complained about her feet. Could it be… that? Is that what you're thinking? I never thought about it, honestly.
DOCTOR: It's a possibility we need to consider, yes. Given your family history, and your symptoms… It's quite common for diabetes to cause neuropathy, which is nerve damage that can cause tingling and numbness in the hands and feet. I’d like to order some blood work to check your glucose levels and rule that out. It’s a simple test, and it will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If that's what we need to do, then let's do it. I just want to know what's causing it. It's unsettling, this tingling. And… is it something serious? Will I need… shots? I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. We need the results of the blood work first. If it is diabetes, there are many treatment options, and not all of them involve injections. We can discuss those in detail if that's the case. For now, I'm going to write you a requisition for a fasting blood glucose test, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. You can get that done at the lab down the street. They'll need to take a sample after you haven't eaten for at least eight hours. Do you have any trouble getting to the lab?
PATIENT: No, the lab is fine. Just a short walk from my route, actually. Eight hours, huh? That might be difficult. I usually have a little something with my coffee in the morning… but I can skip it, I guess. Is there anything else I need to know? Will it take long to get the results? I have a route to finish, you know.
DOCTOR: The results should be back in a couple of days. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they come in. And skipping the coffee is fine. Just water is best for the fasting test. Now, while we wait for the results, I recommend you try to elevate your feet when you're resting and avoid anything that might be constricting your circulation, like tight shoes. Also, I would advise against self-treating with any over-the-counter medications until we have a diagnosis. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds… very sensible. Elevate my feet, no tight shoes, no self-treating. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s been worrying me, this tingling. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. I really need to get back to work, honestly. Do I need to make another appointment to discuss the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the results are in. We can discuss them then and make a plan. Here's the requisition for the lab. Take this to the front desk on your way out, and they'll help you with any questions. Try not to worry too much, Ms. Uzarski. We’ll figure it out. And remember, if the tingling gets significantly worse, or you develop any other symptoms, please don't hesitate to call. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. . Have a good day. .
