DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Don't like it.
DOCTOR: I see. Dry eyes, and it's been bothering you for a while now. That’s certainly not comfortable. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Not much to tell. They just…itch. And feel like sand. Especially when I'm working. Lots of dust with cement, you know? Makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Dust exposure with cement work can definitely contribute to dry, irritated eyes. When you say “working,” could you tell me a bit about what your typical workday looks like?
PATIENT: Well, I pour the cement, smooth it out, make it level. All day, mostly outside. Been doing it a long time. Sixty years, maybe more. Hard to keep track now. Lots of sun, lots of wind.
DOCTOR: Sixty years is remarkable, Mr. Pipolo. That’s a testament to your dedication. Okay, so a lot of outdoor work, sun and wind exposure. Do you typically wear any eye protection while you’re working with the cement?
PATIENT: Eye protection? Sometimes. Glasses, mostly. Not always the best kind, though. Regular ones. I forget to put the special ones on, sometimes. They fog up.
DOCTOR: I see. Regular glasses offer some protection, but they don't create a complete seal around the eyes. Fogging up is a common issue with protective eyewear. Besides the dryness and itching, have you noticed any redness, blurry vision, or sensitivity to light?
PATIENT: Blurry sometimes, yeah. When it’s real bad. And the sun…it hurts. Brighter than it used to, I think. Redness…I dunno. Haven't really looked. Just try to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blurry vision and increased sensitivity to light, especially with sun exposure. We should take a quick look at your eyes to assess the irritation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Sure. Whatever you think is best. Long as it doesn't take too long. Got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I understand your time is valuable. If you could please have a seat, I’ll perform a brief examination. I'll check your visual acuity, and then I’ll use a special light to examine the surface of your eyes. It won't be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright. Hope it's quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pipolo, I'm going to have you read the smallest line of letters you can see on this chart. Please cover your left eye with your hand. … Alright, and now cover your right eye. Your vision is slightly reduced in both eyes, but not dramatically. Now, let's take a closer look at the surface of your eyes. I'm going to use a bright light to get a good view. This might be a little uncomfortable for a moment, but it will be quick. … Hmm. I'm noting some dryness and mild inflammation on the surface of both corneas. There's a little bit of debris present, likely from the cement dust. Your conjunctiva is also a bit irritated. It doesn't appear to be anything serious at this time, but it does explain your symptoms.
PATIENT: Debris? Like…sand? That sounds about right. So, what do I do about it? Just…keep working?
DOCTOR: It is likely similar to sand, yes – small particles of cement dust. While continuing to work is possible, we need to take steps to protect your eyes and prevent further irritation. Simply continuing as you have been could lead to a more significant problem. I recommend a multi-pronged approach. First, we absolutely need to improve your eye protection. Do you have access to safety glasses or goggles specifically designed for cement work?
PATIENT: No, just the regular glasses. Like I said, they fog up. And don't fit real good. I mostly just try to blink it away.
DOCTOR: Blinking can help temporarily, but it isn’t a long-term solution, Mr. Pipolo. Fogging and poor fit are common issues. I would strongly recommend investing in a pair of well-fitting, sealed goggles designed for dust and debris protection. They often have anti-fog coatings, and a good seal is crucial. In addition to that, I'd like to recommend artificial tears – lubricating eye drops – to help keep your eyes moist and wash away any lingering debris. You can use these several times a day, even when you're not working. Would you be interested in a prescription for some lubricating eye drops, or would you prefer to try an over-the-counter brand first?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter is fine. Don't need a fancy prescription. Just want something to make it stop itching. And…the goggles. Where do I get those?
DOCTOR: Certainly, over-the-counter will work just fine to start. Look for brands like Systane, Refresh, or TheraTears. They’re readily available at most pharmacies and drugstores. As for the goggles, any hardware store or safety equipment supplier should carry them. You want a pair that seals tightly around your eyes, has an adjustable strap, and ideally has an anti-fog coating. If you're unsure which ones to choose, the staff at the store should be able to assist you. I'm going to write down a recommendation for artificial tears and goggles, along with some general instructions for eye care. I also want you to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any significant pain, blurry vision that doesn't improve, or a feeling like something is stuck in your eye, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good. Hope it works. I got a job to finish.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pipolo. Protecting your eyes is crucial so you can continue your work safely. I'm optimistic that these steps will provide relief. Here's the information, and please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll also make a note to follow up with you in a week to see how you’re doing. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pipolo. Take care of yourself, and please prioritize your eye protection. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and safe working!
PATIENT: .
