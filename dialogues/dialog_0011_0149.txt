DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Neppl, you say? Hmm. Well, frankly, I don't much like being told what to do. And all these… procedures. My niece, bless her heart, insisted I come. Said I was being stubborn. I just… don’t want anyone poking around where they shouldn’t be, you understand? At my age, you just want a bit of peace.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to maintain your independence and comfort, especially at any age. My goal is always to work with my patients, not to impose anything upon them. We'll proceed at your pace, and I’ll explain everything thoroughly before we do anything. Could you perhaps tell me a little more about what specifically prompted your niece to suggest a visit?
PATIENT: Oh, that girl. Always fussing. It was my feet, I suppose. They’ve been… troublesome. Not painful, exactly. Just… not right. Swollen, mostly. And I can’t seem to find shoes that fit anymore. It’s embarrassing, really. I used to have such nice shoes. Now everything feels like torture devices. She said it might be something serious, needs “looking at”. Honestly, I think she watches too much television.
DOCTOR: I see. Swollen feet and difficulty finding comfortable shoes. That’s certainly something we should investigate. And it's good your niece is looking out for you – it’s always best to address these things. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me how long your feet have been swollen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long…? That’s a good question. Seems like… a while. Not overnight, certainly. Months, I suppose. Maybe even longer. Time just… slips away when you get to be my age, you know? It's hard to keep track. I think it got worse over the winter. Cold weather always makes everything ache, doesn't it? Though, to be fair, I barely left the house. It was a dreadful winter.
DOCTOR: Yes, cold weather can certainly exacerbate things. Several months of gradually increasing swelling, worse over the winter. That’s helpful. Has the swelling been constant during those months, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not constant. No. It gets better sometimes. When I put my feet up, mostly. Or if I… well, if I haven’t been on them all day. But it always comes back, doesn’t it? Especially by the evening. It’s just… irritating, really. And makes me feel so old and useless. I used to be able to dance all night, you know. Now… now I just sit.
DOCTOR: It sounds frustrating, Ms. Gunasekara, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s understandable that it impacts your quality of life. So, the swelling improves with elevation and rest, but returns with prolonged standing or activity. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm. Other symptoms… let me think. Well, my ankles feel a bit… stiff sometimes. Especially in the mornings. It takes a bit to get moving. And I suppose my skin is a little… discolored. Not painful, just… darker than it used to be. And… oh! I forget what you call it… when the little veins get all… visible. Like a roadmap. Is that a symptom? It’s just… old age, I expect. Everything falls apart eventually.
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the mornings, discoloration of the skin, and visible veins – what we call venous changes – those are all important details, Ms. Gunasekara. And you're right to mention them. While they can be associated with age, it's good we're considering everything. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam of your feet and ankles?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam. I suppose… if you must. But please be gentle. I bruise easily, you know. And don't go poking around too much. My niece will have a field day if I come home looking like a patchwork quilt. Just… be quick about it, alright? I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon. It's a rather important gathering.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Gunasekara. I will be very gentle. A quick and thorough exam is all I intend to do, and I will certainly respect your comfort. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m just going to take a look at your feet while you’re sitting. Then, I'd like to gently palpate—that just means feel—your ankles and feet to check for tenderness or warmth. And finally, I’d like to check your pulses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Pulses? Now, what do you need pulses for? Are you suggesting something serious is wrong? Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel quite anxious. I just wanted someone to tell me how to find comfortable shoes, not get subjected to a battery of tests! I don't like this at all. Perhaps I should just go home. My luncheon is far more appealing than all this… fuss.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, please don’t be anxious. I apologize if I’ve caused any alarm. Checking your pulses is a routine part of a lower extremity exam, and it helps me assess the circulation in your legs and feet. It’s a simple, non-invasive test, and it helps us rule out potential causes for the swelling. I completely understand your concern, and I assure you, I'm not suggesting anything serious at this point. But to provide you with the best possible care and give you an accurate recommendation, I need to gather all the necessary information. If you're truly uncomfortable proceeding with the exam, we absolutely can stop. However, without a proper assessment, I may not be able to offer much more than general advice regarding shoes. Would you perhaps be willing to let me simply take a look at your feet while you remain seated?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just look then. No poking, no prodding, no pulses. Just a quick look. But if you even think about touching me, I’m leaving. And don’t try to tell me it’s “routine.” I’ve lived a long life, Doctor, and I know what I do and do not want. Just… get on with it. But be quick, alright? My hair appointment is this afternoon too. A woman has to maintain appearances, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Gunasekara. Just a quick look, as you wish. I will respect your boundaries completely. I notice some bilateral edema—that’s swelling—in both feet and ankles. The skin appears slightly discolored, with some visible venous changes, as you mentioned. There doesn’t appear to be any open skin or signs of infection. Your toenails are well-maintained, which is excellent. I'm documenting these findings now. Would you mind if I briefly check the temperature of your feet?
PATIENT: Temperature? Honestly, Doctor, you're turning into a complete stranger. I come in here for a simple foot problem and it's turned into some sort of medical investigation! Is this what all doctors do now? No. Absolutely not. No temperature. Just tell me if I need special shoes or not, and let me be on my way. I have a reputation to uphold, and I don’t have all day to sit here while you take my temperature and poke around. This is ridiculous! I think I've had enough.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, please, sit down. I sincerely apologize for making you uncomfortable. It was not my intention to cause you distress. You are absolutely right to assert your boundaries, and I will respect your decision. I understand you are not comfortable with a full examination, and that is perfectly acceptable. Given your discomfort and unwillingness to proceed with further assessment, I can offer some general advice regarding footwear. However, without a proper evaluation, it’s difficult to determine the underlying cause of the swelling and provide a targeted recommendation. I would strongly recommend seeing a podiatrist—a foot specialist—who can provide a more comprehensive assessment and tailored treatment plan. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: A referral… yes. That sounds… sensible. Someone who specifically deals with feet. Perhaps they'll be less… inquisitive. Yes, please. A referral would be most appreciated. And please, no lectures about “health” or “preventative care.” I’ve lived a long and full life, thank you very much. Just the referral will do. And then, if you'll excuse me, I really must be going. My luncheon awaits, and I believe my hair appointment is fast approaching. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. I understand completely. I’m happy to provide you with a referral to a highly-rated podiatrist in the area. Here you are. This includes Dr. Eleanor Vance's contact information and a brief summary of our discussion today. She is excellent and very understanding. I wish you all the best with your luncheon and hair appointment. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
