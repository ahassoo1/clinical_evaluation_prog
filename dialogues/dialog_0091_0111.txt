DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, good morning to you as well. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s… my skin, you see. It’s darkening. And I tire easily. It’s rather bothersome, and my wife insisted I come. I don’t usually bother doctors with such… trivialities.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. While it may seem trivial to you, any change in your health is worth investigating. Thank you for coming in despite your reservations. Could you tell me a bit more about this darkening of your skin?
PATIENT: Honestly, I barely notice it. It’s… just darker. A bit brownish, perhaps. It's all rather vague, you understand. I’ve been… busy. Years of work, you see. Reinforcing iron. Very demanding work. And now… well, I simply feel… worn. It started… sometime ago. I couldn’t give you a precise date. Months, at least. Perhaps longer. It's not as if I keep a detailed log of my complexion.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that for me, Mr. Drahota. "Brownish" and "worn" are helpful descriptions. When you say "reinforcing iron," could you tell me what kind of work that involves?
PATIENT: It's… precisely what it sounds like. We build things. Strong things. Steel, concrete… supporting structures. It's physical labour. Very physical. Lifting, bending, welding… out in the sun, often. It requires a certain… fortitude. Though, these days, the younger workers… they lack the dedication. It’s not the same. I’ve been at it for… well, a very long time. Sixty years, at least. Perhaps longer. It’s not important. What is important is this… discoloration.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Drahota. That gives me a much better understanding of your background. Working outdoors for that length of time certainly can have an impact on one’s health. Regarding the discoloration, has it appeared all over, or is it localized to certain areas?
PATIENT: Localized? I haven't the slightest idea what you mean. It's… on my skin. All of it, I suppose. Or perhaps just my arms and face… I haven't made a particular study of it. It's just… darker than it used to be. Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather tedious. Is there not a simple cream you can prescribe? I haven't time for detailed examinations. My wife… she worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I apologize if my questions feel tedious. However, to determine the best course of action, and to ensure we’re not overlooking anything serious, I do need to gather some more information. It's important to rule out potential causes. Before we discuss potential treatments, let me ask a few more questions, then I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're willing. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this skin darkening?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms are you expecting? I’m tired, as I said. And a bit worn. Is that not symptom enough? No, I haven't been afflicted with… fantastical ailments. No rashes, no itching, no… swellings. Simply… this. And the fatigue. Though, at my age, one expects a degree of tiredness, doesn’t one? Really, Doctor, are you questioning my constitution? I've built bridges, you know. Physical bridges. Not… imaginary ones.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Drahota, I am not questioning your constitution. Your work history is quite impressive, and I appreciate you sharing that. I'm simply trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what might be causing your symptoms. Given the fatigue and skin darkening, have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite… hmm. I suppose I eat a little less. My wife prepares excellent meals, of course, but… one loses one’s enthusiasm after a while, doesn't one? As for weight… I haven't stepped on a scale in decades. What does it matter? I’m not a prize bull. No, no significant changes. Just… the usual decline of age. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to suspect this is a complete waste of my time. Perhaps a simple vitamin supplement is all I require. Is that an option? A quick prescription and I can be on my way. My wife has a bridge game this afternoon and I promised to be home in time for tea.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Mr. Drahota. I want to assure you that I’m taking them seriously. A vitamin supplement might be helpful, but it’s important to rule out other potential causes for your fatigue and skin changes first. While it could be a simple vitamin deficiency, it could also be related to other medical conditions. Let’s proceed with a brief physical exam. I'll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a closer look at your skin. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But make it quick. I haven't the patience for prolonged examinations. And please, be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be. Get it over with, Doctor. The sooner I’m out of here, the better. Just… hurry. And don't poke too much. I’m a man of steel, not a… a laboratory specimen. Do what you must, but efficiently. My wife will be displeased if I’m late.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Drahota. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, Mr. Drahota, but not critically high. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to examine your skin more closely. I notice some areas of hyperpigmentation on your arms and face, consistent with sun damage. However, there are also some areas of more diffuse darkening. Your skin feels a bit dry, but there are no immediate concerns. I would like to order some lab work to help determine the cause of your fatigue and skin changes. Specifically, I recommend a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Lab work? Honestly, Doctor, you’re determined to subject me to every indignity imaginable, aren’t you? Blood tests… It’s just what I needed. More delays. More inconvenience. Fine. Do what you must. But I expect a swift turnaround. And I want a clear explanation of the results. None of this… medical jargon. Plain English, Doctor. I’m an old man, not a medical student. And I trust you won’t keep me waiting for weeks on end. My wife… well, you understand. Just get it done. And then, perhaps I can finally go home. Is there anything else? Anything at all? Because, frankly, I’m losing my patience.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I assure you, I will expedite the lab orders and we’ll have the results as quickly as possible. I will also explain them to you in plain English, with no medical jargon. I'll send the orders to the lab now. They will contact you to schedule an appointment for blood draw. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay hydrated and eating a balanced diet. While we await the results, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, unexplained weight loss, or severe fatigue – please contact the clinic immediately. I also want to emphasize the importance of sun protection. Wear protective clothing, use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, and avoid prolonged sun exposure, especially during peak hours. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None whatsoever. I’ve wasted enough time here already. I appreciate… well, I suppose I appreciate your efforts. Though, frankly, I remain skeptical. Just send me the results when they’re ready. And try not to keep me waiting. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. I wish you a good day as well. If any questions arise before the results are available, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. We'll be in touch soon. .
