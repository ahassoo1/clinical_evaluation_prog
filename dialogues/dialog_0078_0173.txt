DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Solero, nice to meet you too! Well, I've been getting chills on and off for a couple of days now. It's a bit weird, honestly. Not like a fever chill, just… cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chills without a fever can be a bit puzzling. To help me understand what might be going on, can you tell me a little more about these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Well, they don’t really happen at a specific time. Sometimes it’s when I’m just sitting around, other times I’ll get them when I'm moving about. They usually last… I don’t know, maybe ten, fifteen minutes? And they aren’t terrible, just uncomfortable. It’s more like… a shiver, you know? Not shaking or anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. So, they're intermittent, lasting about ten to fifteen minutes, and you’d describe them as a shiver rather than a full-body shake. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: That's right. And no, not really. I haven't noticed anything specific that makes them start or stop. I’ve been trying to think about it, but nothing jumps out. I've been drinking plenty of water, and eating okay, I guess. No new foods or anything. It just… started happening.
DOCTOR: Okay. No triggers identified, and no recent changes to your diet. That’s helpful. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the chills—things like fatigue, muscle aches, headache, sore throat, cough, or any digestive issues?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have been a little more tired than usual, yeah. Just kinda blah, you know? Not like sick tired, just… drained. No muscle aches or a headache, though. Definitely no sore throat or cough. My stomach’s been okay. Maybe a little bit of bloating, now that you mention it, but I get that sometimes anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some fatigue and occasional bloating, but otherwise feeling relatively well. Have you had a fever at all, even a low-grade one that you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I haven’t taken my temperature, actually, but I definitely don't feel like I have a fever. No hot flashes or anything like that. Just the chills and feeling a bit worn down.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a broader picture, have you had any recent travel, or been exposed to anyone who’s been sick?
PATIENT: No travel recently, definitely not. And… hmm. My niece had a cold last week, but I only saw her briefly, and it seemed like a normal cold. Nothing too bad. She’s all better now. I haven't been around anyone else who's sick that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m pretty healthy, honestly. No chronic conditions or anything. I did have my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was ages ago and all healed up. Other than that, just the usual bumps and bruises, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no chronic medical conditions, and an appendectomy in your teenage years. That's helpful to know. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I can take most medications without any problems, and I don't have any food allergies either. Nothing like that to worry about.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin. Nothing else. I try to eat pretty well, but figured the multivitamin wouldn’t hurt. It's nothing fancy, just a basic one from the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a daily multivitamin. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, cancer, autoimmune disorders, or anything else that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Hmm, okay. My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some issues with his cholesterol, but other than that, not really. No major cancers or autoimmune disorders that I know of. My grandma on my dad’s side had arthritis, but that’s about it. Nothing that immediately jumps out as something I should be worried about, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history of high blood pressure and cholesterol, and arthritis in a grandmother. That's good to know. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I work as a health education specialist, so I try to practice what I preach, you know? I don't smoke, I drink occasionally – maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to get regular exercise – walks mostly, and I go to a yoga class once a week. I don’t have any really stressful habits. I’d say my lifestyle is pretty healthy overall.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Jailenne. It sounds like you're doing a lot of things right. Alright, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes, and take your temperature and blood pressure just to get a baseline. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you don’t mind, I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Your blood pressure is 122/78, also within a normal range. Everything sounds and feels normal so far. Given your symptoms—intermittent chills, mild fatigue, and a normal physical exam—it's unlikely to be anything serious. It could be a mild viral infection, a reaction to a subtle environmental change, or possibly even stress-related. However, to rule out anything more concerning, I'd like to order a basic blood test—a complete blood count and a metabolic panel—to check for signs of infection or other underlying issues. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Yeah, let’s do the blood test. I’d rather be safe than sorry, you know? Especially with how things are going around.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I agree. It's always best to be thorough, especially given the current health climate. I’ll write the order for the lab work now. They’ll need to draw a small sample of your blood. Once the results are back—usually within a day or two—we can discuss them and determine if any further action is needed. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and continuing to eat a healthy diet. If your symptoms worsen—specifically if you develop a fever, severe fatigue, muscle aches, or any difficulty breathing—please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds really good. I think you explained everything really clearly. Rest, fluids, watch for anything getting worse… I can definitely do that. Thank you, Dr. Solero. And just… where do I go to get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. I’m glad I could help. The lab is located just down the hall, in suite 203. The receptionist there will have my order and be able to assist you. They are open until 5 PM today. I’ll also have my nursing assistant, Maria, send a copy of the results to your patient portal as soon as they become available, so you can access them online. Do you have any trouble accessing your patient portal?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm all set up with the portal. I used it when I first made my appointment. So, I should see everything there. Okay, great. Down the hall to suite 203. Thank you again for your time, Dr. Solero. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before then. I’m glad I could help. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: You too, Dr. Solero! Thank you.
