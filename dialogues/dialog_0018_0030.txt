DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I've noticed a change in my body odor. It's...different than it usually is. I can’t really describe it, just that it's not me, you know? It started maybe a week or so ago.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Purtee. It’s perfectly alright to discuss these things; it’s a common concern, and we are here to help. It’s good that you’ve noticed a change and are bringing it to my attention. Could you describe the odor a little more specifically, if possible?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's the hard part. It’s not stronger, exactly, just…different. It’s not like sweat, not the usual underarm smell. It’s almost…sweeter? And a little bit musty, if that makes any sense. I’ve tried different deodorants, but nothing seems to help. It’s there no matter what I do. I usually use a regular stick deodorant, the kind I’ve used for years.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Purtee. “Sweeter and a little musty” is helpful. And you said it began about a week ago, and hasn't responded to changing deodorants. Have you noticed it all over your body, or is it localized to specific areas, such as your armpits, groin, or feet?
PATIENT: Mostly under my arms, I think. I haven't really paid attention to my feet, to be honest. And I haven’t noticed it… down there, if you don't mind me saying. Just mainly under my arms. It’s…noticeable when I move around a lot, when I’m working, you know? That's when I really smell it. It doesn’t seem to bother me as much when I’m just sitting.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s good information. And you mentioned it's more noticeable with activity. Have you experienced any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. Not really. My appetite’s been okay, maybe a little less than usual, but I put that down to the heat. I’ve been sleeping alright, nothing different there. I've been a little more tired than normal at work, but floor laying is hard work, so that’s not surprising. Oh! My divorce was finalized about six months ago. Does that count? It's been stressful, but I thought I was getting over the worst of it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Purtee. Stressful life events can certainly have an impact on our bodies, and it’s good to have a complete picture. Let's move on to a bit more medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had high blood pressure for a little while, a few years back, but the doctor put me on some medication and it's been fine ever since. I don't go to the doctor much, unless I really need to. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because I don't get much sun. Other than that, pretty healthy, I think. Oh! And I have Medicare. Just thought you should know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. That's helpful. And thank you for letting me know about your Medicare; that’s always important. So, you were treated for high blood pressure in the past, but it’s currently well-controlled with medication?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It was about five years ago, maybe six. The doctor said it was just a little high, and the medication fixed it right up. I get it checked every year, and it's always been normal since then. I don’t even think about it anymore. I take a small white pill every morning. I think it’s Lisinopril, but I’d have to check the bottle to be sure.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Lisinopril is correct, according to your EHR. And you've had no other significant illnesses or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Nope. No hospitalizations. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that was a long time ago. Nothing serious since then. I’ve been pretty lucky, really. I try to eat healthy, and I stay active with my job. It’s hard work, but I like it. Keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Purtee. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, heart disease, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. She was diagnosed when she was in her sixties. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had heart problems. He died when he was fairly young, I think in his seventies. Other than that, not really. My family tends to live a long time, but they don't always take care of themselves very well, to be honest. Lots of smoking in the old days. I made sure to stay away from that.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. That's good to know. And you've avoided smoking, which is excellent. Now, regarding your social history, do you drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Never been much of a drinker. And definitely no drugs. I don't even like the smell of cigarette smoke, so you can imagine how I feel about other things! I have a couple of cups of coffee in the morning, but that's it. I like my sleep too much to mess with anything like that.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear, Ms. Purtee. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. I can eat anything, take any medication. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. Honestly, Doctor, I'm just a healthy, hardworking woman who's noticing a weird smell! It's really starting to worry me, though. It's embarrassing, and I don't want it to affect my work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Purtee. It's good you brought this to my attention. Given your history and the description of the odor, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. It could be related to a change in your body chemistry, possibly hormonal, or even a mild infection. To help determine the cause, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to examine your underarms and skin in that area. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. I’d like to figure out what’s going on. The physical exam sounds good. I trust your judgment. I just want to get back to normal. It’s been bugging me, and I’m hoping it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll wash my hands and be right back. Alright, Ms. Purtee, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, if you’ll please raise both your arms, I’d like to examine your underarms. I don’t see any obvious signs of infection, like redness or swelling. However, I do notice a slightly unusual skin texture in that area. It's very subtle, but it's worth noting. And I don't detect any enlarged lymph nodes. Do you experience any pain or discomfort when I touch your underarms?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt at all, Doctor. It feels…normal. Just my skin, I guess. I do have a little bit of…texture there sometimes, but I figured it was just from working, you know? Rubbing against things all day. I don’t usually pay much attention to it. It’s not itchy or anything. Just feels a little rough sometimes. But I’ve never thought anything of it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. That's helpful. Given your description and the exam findings, I'd like to order a couple of simple lab tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'm thinking a Complete Blood Count to check for infection, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test to assess your thyroid function. These tests can help us determine if there’s a hormonal imbalance or other issue contributing to the change in your body odor. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, and get it fixed. Blood tests are fine. I’ve had those done before. Do I need to fast for any of them? Or… should I stop taking my vitamin D supplement? I don’t want to mess up the results.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Purtee. You do not need to fast for either of these tests. And it's fine to continue taking your vitamin D supplement as usual. It won’t affect the results of the CBC or TSH test. I’ll write you a lab requisition, and you can go to any lab that accepts Medicare. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have the results, I'll review them with you and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you notice any other symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, or fatigue, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I'm just relieved that you're taking this seriously. I was worried it was all in my head! So, just go to any lab, and they'll know what to do?
DOCTOR: That’s correct, Ms. Purtee. Simply take the requisition to any lab that accepts Medicare, and they’ll handle the rest. I’m glad I could reassure you, and I’m happy to help. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Here is the requisition, and a printed summary of our discussion today. Please contact the clinic if you have any trouble scheduling your lab tests, or if you have any questions in the meantime. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good day. .
