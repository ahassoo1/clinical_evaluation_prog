DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. Glad to meet you. I'm Dr. Billman. Now, you’re 87, that’s… good. A long life. But you're here today because…?
PATIENT: Well, bless you, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. And yes, 87 years... it’s been a journey, lemme tell ya! I’m here 'cause of this headache I been havin'. Right at the back of my head. It's been comin' and goin' for a little while now, but it's gettin' a bit more bothersome lately.
DOCTOR: A headache, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Right here, at the back. It doesn’t feel like a bad bad headache, you know? More like a constant… pressure. Not throbbing, not sharp. Just… there. It doesn’t keep me from doin’ things, but it’s definitely annoying, especially when I'm workin'. I do a lot of fine work with my hands, you see. Manicures, pedicures… gotta be steady.
DOCTOR: Manicures and pedicures, at 87?
PATIENT: Yes, sir! Been doin' it for… oh, must be close to sixty years now. Started helpin' my mother when I was a little boy, and just... stuck with it! It keeps my hands nimble, my mind sharp, and I enjoy makin' people feel nice. Still got a good clientele, bless 'em. But like I said, this headache is makin' it a bit harder to concentrate sometimes. Especially when I'm doin' detailed nail art. Need a steady hand for that, you know? It's important work!
DOCTOR: Right. Sixty years of… manicures. Okay. And how long has this headache been bothering you specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started... oh, I’d say about a month or so ago. At first, it was just now and then, after a long day at work. I figured it was just me bein’ tired. But it’s been happenin’ more often lately, even when I haven’t been workin’ too hard. It's not every day, mind you. Maybe three or four times a week? Sometimes it's just a little ache, other times it's more noticeable. It's hard to say exactly, really. Time slips away when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: And is there anything that makes it better, or worse?
PATIENT: Well, lyin' down seems to help a bit. And a nice cool cloth on the back of my neck. But honestly? It mostly just goes away on its own after a while. Not much makes it worse, really. Workin' for too long might bring it on, but even then it’s not terrible. Bright lights don’t bother it, loud noises don’t bother it... I haven’t really noticed anything specific that makes it significantly better or worse, to be honest. It's just… there. A bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Have you had any other symptoms along with this headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No fever, no dizziness… my vision’s still good as ever, thankfully. No blurry spots, nothin’ like that. I haven’t been feelin’ nauseous, haven't thrown up, no weakness or numbness in my arms or legs. No trouble speakin’, no confusion… I haven’t noticed anything else, really. Just the headache. That’s why I came, before it became something more serious, you see. I like to keep on top of these things. I'm a pretty healthy fella, all things considered! But 87 years... things do start to creak, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let's see... I had the measles when I was a boy, of course. And chickenpox. Nothing serious, mind you. When I was in my fifties, I had my appendix taken out. That was a bit unpleasant, but I recovered just fine. I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but it didn't last long. Other than that... not much. I’ve always been lucky, I think. I try to eat well, get enough rest… and I keep busy. I believe that keeps the mind and body strong. Oh! And I broke my wrist once, when I was tryin’ to fix my roof. That took a while to heal, but the doctor patched me right up. No other major illnesses, no heart problems, no diabetes, nothin' like that. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old, you know?
DOCTOR: Any surgeries besides your appendix and wrist?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. No, I don't believe so. No, nothing else. I had a few stitches when I was a boy, fallin’ off my bicycle, but those hardly count as surgeries! Just a bit of cleanin' and patchin' up. I've been very fortunate, really. I haven't needed much medical attention over the years. My mother always said a good diet and a busy life were the best medicine, and I think she was right. I try to stay active and positive, that's the key. It's important to have a good outlook on life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Ah, family history… That’s a good question. My mother lived to be 92, bless her soul. She had a bit of arthritis in her later years, but otherwise, she was healthy as a horse. My father… he passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I believe. But that was a long time ago. My sister… she had high blood pressure, but she was well managed with medication. And my brother… he had some problems with his knees, but nothing major. So, a little bit of arthritis, some heart trouble, some blood pressure… Nothing too serious, really. We’re a pretty sturdy bunch, all things considered. Though you never know, do you? These things can just pop up out of nowhere.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir, not a one. Haven't needed any, thankfully. Just a little bit of liniment for my aching joints every now and then, but that’s it. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself, you see. I eat a good diet, get plenty of rest… and I stay active. That’s my medicine. I don’t like to rely on chemicals if I can help it. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Though I understand sometimes they are necessary. Just not for me, at the moment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir, not a one. I've never had an allergic reaction to anything. I can eat shellfish, I can handle bee stings, I've never had a problem with pollen... Nothing bothers me, thankfully. I consider myself pretty lucky in that regard. My mother always said I had a strong constitution, and I think she was right. Though I've always been careful about what I put in my body, of course. You never know what might cause a reaction. But as far as I know, I don't have any allergies. Not a one.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well. Let's have a quick look at your blood pressure and listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds good. Perfectly alright with me. I trust your expertise. Happy to have a listen, if that will help. Whatever you need, just let me know. I’m ready when you are. I've always said a good doctor is worth their weight in gold.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Heart sounds are normal, though a little faint. It's probably just age and a little stress. Now, let me just… feel your neck and lymph nodes. Everything feels normal there. Well, everything seems normal. This headache… honestly, it doesn't sound like anything serious. Likely tension, given your age and activity level. But given your elevated blood pressure, I’m going to recommend you monitor it at home for a week. Take it twice a day, morning and evening, and write down the readings.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. I can certainly do that. Monitor my blood pressure… morning and evening, you say? I have a little notebook I can use. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to keep myself healthy. It's good to be proactive, you see. And yes, I do agree, it's likely just tension. I’ve been workin’ a bit extra lately, tryin’ to catch up with appointments. So, no cause for alarm, then? Just keep an eye on things? I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to my concerns, Doctor. A lot of doctors don’t bother listenin’ to old people like me, you know? It's good to know someone cares.
DOCTOR: Yes. Keep an eye on it. If it consistently stays above 150/90, call the office, and we'll discuss medication. I’m also going to recommend you try some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, if the headache becomes bothersome. And, honestly, Mr. Popova, try to slow down a little. I’m not saying there’s anything seriously wrong, but at 87, you can't push yourself like you're twenty. If things change – dizziness, blurry vision, weakness – you come in immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, perfectly clear. Blood pressure monitor, pain relievers if needed, slow down a bit… and come in immediately if things change. I understand. Dizzy spells, blurry vision, weakness… I’ll be sure to pay attention. I appreciate you bein’ so thorough, Doctor. It's good to know what to look out for. And you’re right, I probably do push myself a bit too hard sometimes. It's just… I enjoy what I do! But I’ll try to take it easy. I promise. I won't want to keep you busy unnecessarily. Thank you again for your time and your expertise. I feel much better now, just knowin' what's goin' on. Is there anything else I should be doin', or anything else I should know?
DOCTOR: No. Just follow these instructions, and call if you have any concerns. Oh, and… try to get some rest. And maybe delegate some appointments. That will be all, Mr. Popova. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Yes, sir, perfectly alright. Rest, delegate appointments… I’ll do my best. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been a great help. You have a good day too, Doctor. And thank you to your staff as well. Bless you both.
