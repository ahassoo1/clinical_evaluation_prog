DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagarís. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now. Not all the time, but comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A dull ache at the back of your head, coming and going for about three days. To help me understand a little better, could you describe when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when it started… let me think. I was… working on the rail yard, you know, with the dinky. Moving the cars around. It was hot that day, very hot. Maybe it started then? I don’t… I don’t really remember exactly. Just… woke up with it a couple days later. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: I see. You were working on the rail yard – moving cars around – and it was a particularly hot day. It sounds like it may have begun around then, although you’re not certain. And you were wondering if it might be related to age. It's good you're getting it checked out, regardless. Could you tell me a bit more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It's… it’s not a bad pain, really. Not like a toothache or nothing. Just… a heavy feeling. And sometimes, if I turn my head quick, it gets a little sharper. But only for a second. Mostly just… there. Like someone is pressing on the back of my skull.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s not a sharp, intense pain, more of a heavy, dull ache at the back of your skull. It’s aggravated by quick head movements, causing a brief, sharper sensation, but mostly it’s just a consistent pressure. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… no fever. Not dizzy. I been eating okay, I think. Maybe a little tired, but I'm always a little tired, you know? Ninety years… takes it out of a man. No… I don’t think so. Nothing else I can think of.
DOCTOR: Right, no fever, no dizziness, appetite is okay, and you’ve noted some general fatigue, which is understandable at 90 years young. Now, have you had headaches like this before, or is this a new experience?
PATIENT: No, never like this before. I get little headaches sometimes, you know? Like when I'm stressed or something. But they go away with a little rest and a cup of coffee. This… this is different. It just… stays. Doesn't really go away completely.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you experience occasional, mild headaches that resolve with rest, but this headache is persistent and doesn’t go away completely. Mr. Brum, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me think… the doctor, many years ago, told me my blood… my pressure was a little high. He gave me some pills, but… I stopped taking them after a while. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and they made me feel funny. Arthritis… yes, in my hands. Makes them stiff in the morning. But that's all I can remember. Nothing else serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of high blood pressure, treated with medication in the past but discontinued due to side effects, and arthritis in your hands. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmmm… let me see… When I was a young man, I broke my leg falling off a horse. Had to have an operation to fix it. That was a long time ago. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Maybe a few nights in the hospital with a bad cold, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken leg repaired with surgery many years ago, and a few overnight stays for colds. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Stopped taking the blood pressure pills like I said. Just coffee. Lots of coffee. Helps me stay awake for the day.
DOCTOR: Right, no current medications, vitamins or supplements, just coffee. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little sniffle with the pollen sometimes, but nothing bad. Never been to a hospital for allergies, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: Both my parents are gone, a long time ago now. I had a younger sister, but she passed away maybe ten years ago. Heart trouble. I don’t… I don’t know much about their health, really. We didn’t talk about those things much back then.
DOCTOR: I understand. Both parents deceased, and a sister passed away from heart trouble about ten years ago. And finally, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I haven’t had a drink in… oh, maybe forty years? Used to have a little beer with dinner sometimes, but it didn't agree with me. Stopped a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Very good. No smoking or alcohol. Now, Mr. Brum, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. Then, I’ll gently examine your head and neck. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. My head and neck… feels a little stiff, sometimes. But do whatever you need. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit up here for me, that would be great. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145 over 90. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your head and neck. Your neck is a little stiff, and there's some tenderness at the back of your head. No major concerns there, but we'll keep that in mind.
PATIENT: That doesn’t surprise me, Doctor. It's been feeling like that for a while now. Like a knot in my muscles, maybe.
DOCTOR: That’s a good description, Mr. Brum. Based on your history and the physical exam, the most likely cause of your headache is tension headache, possibly related to muscle strain in your neck and shoulders. The elevated blood pressure could be contributing to it as well. However, given your age and the persistence of the headache, I'd like to be cautious. I think it would be wise to get a CT scan of your head to rule out any other potential causes. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A… a scan? Like with the machine? I don't know… I don't like machines, Doctor. But… if you think it's important, I suppose so. I trust your judgement. Just… tell me what it involves.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. It’s perfectly understandable to be apprehensive. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of the inside of your head. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It's completely painless, and it only takes a few minutes. You'll need to lie very still during the scan so the images aren’t blurry. The main risk is a small amount of radiation exposure, but the benefits of ruling out anything serious far outweigh the risks in this case. We can discuss the results as soon as they’re available, and then decide on a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Radiation… hmm. Not good. But… you said it's quick, and it will tell you if something is wrong? If something is really bad? Then yes. Yes, let's do it. I want to know what’s going on. I don’t want to worry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Brum. That's a very sensible decision. It will help us understand exactly what's going on, and put your mind at ease. I’ll write the order for the CT scan now, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. It’s usually very quick – within a day or two. In the meantime, I can prescribe a muscle relaxant to help ease the tension in your neck and shoulders, and I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed. And please, make sure you are getting enough rest and staying hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant… that sounds good. Maybe that will help me sleep. And I will try to rest more. My daughter always tells me to rest more. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now, Doctor. Just… thank you. For listening to an old man complain. And for taking care of me.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Brum. It's my pleasure. It's important to me that you feel heard and taken care of. Here’s the prescription. It’s a low dose, so it shouldn’t make you overly drowsy, but please be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you. I’ll also give you a handout explaining the signs and symptoms of a serious headache that would warrant immediate medical attention. If you experience any of those symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room right away. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the CT scan as soon as they're available. Do you have any preferences for the time of the appointment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, any time is fine. Whatever is easiest for you. You're very kind, you know? I don't know what I'd do without good doctors like you. And thank you for the paper. I'll keep it safe.
DOCTOR: You are very kind as well, Mr. Brum. It’s my job to help, and I'm glad I could reassure you. The radiology department will be in touch to schedule your CT scan within the next day or two. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, if anything changes or worsens, don’t delay seeking medical attention. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Brum. I wish you a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss your scan results.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And… goodbye. .
