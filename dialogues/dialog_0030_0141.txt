DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. All over. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's just... annoying, you know? Not painful, just constantly itchy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ferneding. Constant itching can be very disruptive. “A little while now” – could you give me a better sense of how long you’ve been experiencing this itching?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... It started, I’d say, about three weeks ago, maybe a little longer. Around the 15th of July, I reckon. I was out doing some work in the garden then, and I thought maybe it was just bug bites at first. But it didn’t go away, and it’s not really in bite patterns, if that makes sense. It’s everywhere, arms, legs, back… even my stomach.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. And you said it's not in a pattern like bug bites. Has anything specific seemed to make it better or worse since it started?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. Nothing really makes it better, sadly. Lotion helps a little, just for a few minutes. And… hot showers seem to make it worse. Definitely worse. Cool showers are better, but even those don’t really solve it. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, not that I can think of. Same soap, same laundry detergent… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned lotion temporarily helps. What kind of lotion are you using, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Just a regular unscented one, Doctor. Aveeno, I think? The one in the blue bottle. Nothing fancy. My wife used to buy it, and I just kept using it after… well, after she passed. It's just moisturizing, nothing special added. It’s good for sensitive skin, that’s why she liked it.
DOCTOR: I see. I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Ferneding. It’s good you’ve been using something gentle like Aveeno. Let's move on to some other questions. Have you noticed any rashes, bumps, blisters, or changes in the skin's appearance along with the itching?
PATIENT: No, that's the thing, Doctor. No rash. No bumps. Nothing visible at all. That’s what’s so strange about it. The skin just... feels itchy. It's not red, it's not flaky, it's not anything like eczema or anything I've ever seen before. It just feels like… a deep itch, right under the skin. It's almost… internal, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is unusual. An itch without visible changes to the skin can be tricky to diagnose. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions. Have you had any fever, fatigue, weight loss, or any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been feeling fine, otherwise. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just getting older, I suppose! No fever, no weight loss... I eat like a horse, so losing weight would be a surprise. Honestly, the only thing is this itch. It’s just… persistent. It doesn’t stop. And it’s making it hard to sleep sometimes, scratching all night.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Ferneding. It sounds very bothersome. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no known allergies. My wife always teased me about it – she said I was boringly allergy-free. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. And I don’t take any regular medications, just an occasional aspirin for a headache. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, that's about it. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia about ten years ago, but I recovered fully from that. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Nothing chronic, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a tough one. My mother had some skin problems, I remember that. Sort of a rash, but it wasn’t like this. She used to use creams and lotions and stuff, but I don’t know what it was exactly. My father was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in his life. And my wife… she didn’t really have any major health issues either. We weren’t really a family that talked about illnesses much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just need to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin more closely, even though you haven’t seen any visible changes. It will help me rule out other potential causes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think will help. I'm happy to cooperate. I just want to get this itch figured out. It’s been driving me mad.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. If you could lie back on the exam table, please. Your heart and lungs sound good, and as you mentioned, your skin looks perfectly normal on the surface. I don’t see any obvious signs of a rash or other skin condition. However, the fact that the itching is so persistent and widespread, without any visible changes to the skin, is concerning. It could be a number of things. It could be related to dry skin even though it doesn't look dry, or perhaps a nerve issue, or even something systemic. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order some blood work. I’ll check your complete blood count, your liver and kidney function, your thyroid levels, and a few other markers. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the itching. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. Blood work sounds good. Whatever it takes. I'm happy to get some tests done if it will help figure out what's going on. I’m just relieved you’re taking it seriously, because it is frustrating when there's nothing visible to see.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration completely, Mr. Ferneding. It's easy to dismiss symptoms that aren't visible, but that doesn't mean they aren't real. Here's the requisition form for the blood work. You can take this to the lab downstairs, and they'll draw the samples. The results should be back in about 3-5 business days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to use the Aveeno lotion, and try to avoid hot showers and harsh soaps. Also, I'm going to prescribe a mild antihistamine, just to see if it provides any relief. It may not be the solution, but it’s worth trying. Here’s the prescription. Once we have the blood work results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. If the blood work is normal, we may need to consider a referral to a dermatologist or a neurologist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… well, it sounds like a plan, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not dismissing it. And yes, I can definitely go downstairs and get the blood work done. A dermatologist or neurologist… that sounds a bit scary, but if that’s what it takes, I’m willing to do it. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. It’s my job to listen and help you find answers. And don’t worry about the possibility of a referral. It's just exploring all the options to make sure we get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you head downstairs for the blood work?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I really appreciate your patience and kindness. It’s… well, it’s nice to be taken seriously, especially when it’s something so… invisible. Thank you again. I’ll go get the blood work done now and hopefully we'll have some answers soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I'm glad I could help, and I'm happy to hear you feel heard. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Please keep me updated. I hope you find some relief soon. Have a good day, Mr. Ferneding.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
