DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, my husband—a very practical man, you see—insisted I come. He's been reading things online, about…planning for things. About what happens if…one isn’t able to make decisions. He wants me to fill out some forms. Something about a directive, or a…POLST, was it? I confess, I find the whole thing rather morbid, but he’s quite insistent.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a little unsettling to think about, but your husband is actually being very responsible. It's good he's prompting this discussion. Those forms – a POLST, or Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, and an advance directive – essentially outline your wishes for medical care if you were unable to speak for yourself. Before we jump into the paperwork, though, I always like to get a complete picture of a patient’s health. It helps ensure the directives truly reflect what you would want. Do you have any current medical problems we should discuss?
PATIENT: Oh, I assure you, Doctor, I’m perfectly healthy. Always have been. A little height, perhaps—one gets used to bumping one’s head—but no problems. I don't go to doctors unless absolutely necessary, and my husband…well, he worries too much. He reads things on the internet, as I said. But, if you insist, I suppose my knees ache a bit when the weather changes. It's just age, I think. Not something to make a fuss over.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, good to hear you generally feel well. Knee pain with weather changes can be common, but it's good to document. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Thoroughness, yes. I suppose that is a good quality in a doctor. It’s just…it’s knees, Doctor. They ache. More in the damp, less in the dry. It’s not debilitating. I can still manage everything, thankfully. I teach literature, you know. One must be able to walk to the lecture hall. And stand. For hours, sometimes. It’s not something that prevents me from leading a full life. Really. Are we going to spend the entire morning discussing my knees? I thought we were here about these…directives.
DOCTOR: No, no, we certainly aren’t going to spend the entire morning on knees. I just want to be sure I have a complete picture. It's helpful when considering your overall wishes. Okay, let's move on then. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you’re making me anxious. I don’t have anything else. I eat a reasonable diet—mostly—and I get enough sleep. I lead a quiet life. Reading, teaching, a bit of gardening. No…excitement. I haven’t even had a serious illness in decades. My husband, he worries about everything. He’s convinced I’m secretly harboring some dreadful disease. It's quite tiresome, actually. Is this standard procedure, to interrogate a perfectly healthy woman about ailments she does not have? Perhaps he should be the patient, if you require a litany of complaints.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m causing you anxiety, Ms. Chilla. It’s not my intention at all. I understand your frustration. I ask these questions because even seemingly healthy individuals can have underlying conditions that might influence their preferences for medical care. It’s standard procedure, yes, but I assure you, I'm not trying to find something that isn't there. Just a few more quick questions, then we can focus on the advance directives. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh, goodness. Let me see… No. Never. Not for anything serious. When I was a young girl, perhaps, for tonsillitis. A very mild case. But that was… decades ago. And a minor appendix issue when I was in university, but it wasn’t serious. They removed it, and that was that. Nothing since. Absolutely nothing. Honestly, Doctor, I'm beginning to suspect my husband sent me here simply to prove a point—that I must be frail and in need of constant medical attention. It's rather insulting, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillitis as a child, appendix removed in university… good to know. No major medical issues since then. And I understand your frustration with your husband. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None that I know of. I eat everything. I've never had a reaction to anything. My husband tried to get me to avoid gluten a few years ago—another internet fad—but I refused. It’s all nonsense, if you ask me. Perfectly healthy people don't have allergies. Although… I do find some perfumes give me a headache. But that's not an allergy, is it? Just a dislike. A rather strong dislike, admittedly, but not an allergy. Really, Doctor, are we going to catalog every minor preference now? This is becoming rather tedious.
DOCTOR: No, we're not going to catalog every minor preference. I just want to be thorough, as you know. No known drug or food allergies, sensitivity to some perfumes… good. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements—anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I wouldn't dream of it. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. Vitamins? Perhaps a multivitamin occasionally, if I remember. But nothing regular. Supplements? No. I eat a balanced diet, as I said. I don’t require anything artificial. My husband, of course, tries to sneak fish oil into my food, claiming it’s good for my brain. But I always detect it. It’s quite disgusting, if you ask me. I find the whole notion of relying on pills and potions rather…vulgar. Are we quite finished with this interrogation, Doctor? I truly wish we could get to these directives now.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, we're almost finished with the questions. Just a few more regarding your family history. Has anyone in your immediate family – parents, siblings – had any serious medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Now there's a topic. My mother… she lived to be eighty-five, but she was always a worrier. High blood pressure, I believe. And a bit of arthritis. My father was a very stoic man. He died suddenly of a heart attack when I was quite young. A shock, it was. No one else… my siblings are both healthy, as far as I know. Though they live very…American lives. Lots of fast food, I suspect. Not exactly paragons of health. Honestly, I find dwelling on the ailments of others rather morbid. Is this truly relevant, Doctor? I simply want to understand these directives. What are my options? What would I even need to specify?
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure in your mother, sudden heart attack in your father… good to know. Family history can sometimes provide clues, as you said. Now, before we get to the directives, just a few final questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting to personal matters. Honestly, Doctor. I find your line of questioning rather… intrusive. I assure you, I lead a perfectly respectable life. I do not smoke. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner—a good Bordeaux, preferably—but that's it. And I certainly do not partake in any…recreational activities. My husband would be appalled. Honestly, I'm starting to feel rather judged here. Are all doctors so…nosy? I simply came to fill out a form, at his insistence, and now I’m subjected to this…thorough examination of my personal habits. It's quite upsetting, actually. Can we please move on to the directives now? I'm a teacher, Doctor, not a criminal.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I sincerely apologize if my questions have made you feel uncomfortable or judged. That was not my intention at all. I ask these questions not out of nosiness, but because they can provide important context for your overall health and preferences. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, I will be more mindful of your feelings going forward. You're right, you're a teacher, not a criminal, and I apologize for treating it as such. Now, let’s finally discuss these directives. As you mentioned, your husband is interested in a POLST form and an advance directive. An advance directive allows you to specify your wishes for medical care should you become unable to make decisions yourself. A POLST form is a specific type of advance directive, more often used for those with serious illnesses, and outlines specific medical orders. Do you have any initial thoughts on what you would like to include in these documents?
PATIENT: Well, finally. Perhaps if you had asked me about this first, instead of interrogating me about my wine consumption, we could have avoided this entire unpleasantness. As for my wishes… I suppose I would want to be kept comfortable. Dignity is important, you see. I do not want to be kept alive by machines if there is no hope of recovery. That's barbaric, if you ask me. And I certainly do not want any…heroic measures. Let nature take its course. That's all. Simple, really. I'm a pragmatic woman. I just want a peaceful end, if it comes to that. Though, honestly, I expect to live a long and healthy life. My husband is simply being overly cautious. But if it makes him happy to fill out these forms… then very well. Let's get it over with. Do I simply sign something? Is it terribly complicated?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Chilla. Comfort and dignity are very important considerations. And you’re right, it’s perfectly acceptable to want a natural course of events. The advance directive is a bit more detailed, outlining your preferences for various medical scenarios. The POLST form is more specific, with checkboxes for things like CPR, intubation, and feeding tubes. It can be a bit complicated, yes, but we can go through it section by section. I'll explain each option and you can decide what aligns with your wishes. There's no pressure to complete anything you're not comfortable with. First, let's start with the advance directive. It asks who you would like to be your healthcare proxy – the person who would make decisions for you if you were unable to. Do you have someone in mind for that role?
PATIENT: Of course. My husband. Who else would it be? He's the practical one, as I've said. He worries too much, but at least he's decisive. He’ll want everything done by the book, I’m sure. He’ll probably insist on all sorts of…heroic measures, despite my wishes. But, very well. Let him be the proxy. It's easier than arguing with him. He'll need to sign something, I suppose? And witnesses? Honestly, it’s all rather tedious. Is there a shorter version of this form? Something less…detailed? I'm a teacher, Doctor, not a lawyer. I haven’t the patience for all this legal jargon.
DOCTOR: Yes, your husband will need to sign as your healthcare proxy and we'll need a witness. Unfortunately, the advance directive is fairly standardized and doesn't come in a "shorter version." It's designed to cover a range of possible scenarios. I will walk you through each section, explaining the options in plain language. If you're unsure about something, just ask. I will also note your preference for avoiding heroic measures. Let’s start with section one, which concerns your general values and wishes. It asks what’s important to you in terms of quality of life…
PATIENT: Values and wishes? Oh, goodness. This is becoming rather philosophical, isn't it? Honestly, Doctor, I simply want to be comfortable and not a burden. Is that too much to ask? I believe in a natural end, as I said. No tubes, no machines, no…prolonging the inevitable. I value dignity, you see. And peace. Is there a box for that? “Maintain dignity and peace”? If not, I suppose you can just write it in. Please. Let’s just get this over with. I have a literature class to prepare for, and I’m wasting precious time here discussing my…values.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Ms. Chilla. I understand your frustration. We can certainly write that in. “Maintain dignity and peace.” I'll add that to the section on your general wishes. “Patient values dignity and peace, and wishes for a natural course of events.” Now, the next section concerns your preferences for specific medical treatments… Things like CPR, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. Would you like to discuss those options in detail, or would you prefer to simply indicate that you would not want those treatments in most cases?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I do not want those treatments. None of them. Tubes, machines, artificial anything… it’s barbaric. Write it all down. “No CPR, no ventilation, no artificial nutrition.” Just… get it over with. I find the whole idea rather morbid. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a teacher, not a medical expert. I simply want to be comfortable, as I've said repeatedly. Can we please just skip to the end? I have a syllabus to revise, and this is taking up valuable time. And, honestly, I’m starting to feel quite faint. All this talk of tubes and machines… it’s dreadful. Perhaps I need a glass of water?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. Let me get you some water. Here you are. And I will note your wishes for no CPR, no ventilation, and no artificial nutrition. Just to be absolutely clear, these wishes apply even if your husband believes those treatments might be beneficial?
PATIENT: Especially if my husband believes those treatments might be beneficial. He has a tendency to be…overly optimistic, you see. He reads too many articles online. He’ll want to prolong things at all costs, despite my wishes. He means well, of course, but he's not a doctor. I am the patient, Doctor, and these are my wishes. Write it down in bold. "No heroic measures, regardless of husband’s opinion.” Is that clear enough? I want it absolutely unequivocal. And, honestly, I think I’m quite finished discussing this. Is there anything else? Can we please just sign the forms and be done with it? I have a very important class to prepare for, and I’m wasting precious time here. And frankly, this entire process has been rather… distressing.
DOCTOR: “No heroic measures, regardless of husband’s opinion.” Yes, Ms. Chilla, this is the final section. It simply requires your signature and the signature of a witness. Your husband can act as the witness. Before you sign, do you have any final questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No. None whatsoever. I've made my wishes perfectly clear. And I trust my husband will abide by them, despite his… tendencies. Let's just get this over with. I have a syllabus to revise, a class to prepare for, and a life to live. And frankly, I’m quite relieved it's finished. Thank you, Doctor. Though, I must say, it's been a rather… stressful experience. Perhaps I should have just stayed home and read a good book.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. I have everything I need. I'll make a copy for your records and ensure your husband is aware of your wishes. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I'm glad we were able to clarify your preferences. And I apologize again for any stress or discomfort this process may have caused. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions in the future. Have a wonderful day, and a successful semester.
