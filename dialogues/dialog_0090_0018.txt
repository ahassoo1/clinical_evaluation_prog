DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I seem to be going to the restroom quite often. More than usual, certainly. I wouldn't have bothered coming in, but it’s become… disruptive. I find myself constantly needing to go, and it’s interfering with things. It's difficult to explain precisely when it started... sometime recently, I suppose. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say. I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out, even if it is a little difficult to talk about. "Recently" isn't terribly specific, Mr. Verbos, but we can work through it. Has there been any change in your bowel habits besides the frequency?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Bowel habits… Well, no, not that I recall. Everything else seems… normal, if that makes sense. Just the… the volume of water, I suppose. It's not painful, thankfully. And the colour is… well, it's the usual colour. I do drink a fair amount of water throughout the day, but it feels like more than that explains it. It's… a bit of a puzzle, really. I apologize for being so vague. It's difficult to pinpoint specifics.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Verbos. These things often aren’t straightforward, and you’re not expected to be a doctor. No pain, normal color… that’s good. Increased frequency and volume, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that sums it up rather nicely, Doctor. Increased frequency… and a rather… substantial volume. It’s… noticeable. And, if I may add, a little inconvenient when travelling. I took a short trip last week, and I had to… well, locate restrooms very frequently. It rather limited my enjoyment of the scenery, if I'm being honest. I don’t recall anything else unusual happening around the time this started. No changes in my diet, no new medications… although, I do take a daily vitamin. Nothing fancy, just a standard multivitamin.
DOCTOR: A daily multivitamin… alright. Now, tell me, Mr. Verbos, do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Let me think… Well, I believe my general practitioner mentioned something about slightly elevated blood pressure a few years ago, but it wasn't serious enough to require medication, as I recall. Just a recommendation to watch my salt intake, which I’ve… tried to do. Otherwise, I generally feel quite healthy. I walk regularly, and I maintain a reasonable weight, despite my fondness for… pastries. I’ve never been hospitalised for anything significant, and I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I think that covers it. It's so difficult to remember everything, you understand. Do you have a list of questions perhaps? It might jog my memory.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, attempting to manage your salt intake and claiming to be generally healthy aren't quite the same as a proper medical history, Mr. Verbos. Elevated blood pressure is relevant. Do you know what your recent blood pressure readings have been?
PATIENT: Oh dear. You're quite right, of course. I do tend to… gloss over details. No, I don’t know my recent readings, I’m afraid. My general practitioner retired last year, and I haven't found a replacement yet. I really should… I’ve been meaning to, honestly. It's just been… slipping my mind. And I suppose I haven’t felt particularly unwell, until this recent… issue. I apologize for being so unhelpful, Doctor. It’s not that I’m intentionally withholding information, it’s simply… gone. I assure you, I’m usually a more organised person. Do you keep records here? Perhaps you could contact my previous doctor, if you have the time? I believe his name was… Dr. Havel.
DOCTOR: We can attempt to obtain records from Dr. Havel, Mr. Verbos, though it can be a lengthy process. For now, let's focus on what is happening. You said this started sometime recently. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, other symptoms… Let me see. No, not that I’m aware of. No pain, no fever, no dizziness. I haven’t noticed any swelling in my ankles or feet. My appetite is normal, and I haven't lost any weight. I sleep reasonably well, although I do wake up occasionally to… use the restroom. But I wouldn't describe it as disrupting my sleep, precisely. I’ve not experienced any thirst, or increased hunger. It’s… remarkably isolated, this issue. Just the frequent urination. It’s almost… peculiar. Is it possible it's something I ate? Perhaps a certain type of fruit? I do enjoy melons, come summertime.
DOCTOR: Melons… Right. While dietary factors can contribute to urinary frequency, it’s unlikely to be the sole cause, given the extent of your symptoms. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That’s a difficult one. My parents both lived to a good age, thankfully. My mother passed away a few years ago from… old age, I suppose. My father suffered from… arthritis, I believe. Nothing particularly serious. My sister is still living, and she seems to be in good health, as far as I know. No history of diabetes, as far as I’m aware. No history of kidney problems, or heart disease. My grandfather, on my mother's side, did have… something with his prostate, I vaguely recall. But I don’t know the details. It was a long time ago, and my mother wasn’t one for discussing medical matters. I apologize for being so unhelpful. It seems I’m rather poor at recalling these things. Is there a specific condition you’re looking for? Perhaps that would jog my memory.
DOCTOR: Prostate issues are relevant, Mr. Verbos, given your gender. We’ll need to consider that. Now, tell me about your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh! No, never. I've never smoked a day in my life. My parents were very strict about that, and I’ve always been rather… averse to the smell. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I wouldn’t say I drink excessively. Perhaps one or two glasses, three at most on special occasions. I also enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning, but again, not to excess. I'm not a big socialiser, to be honest. I prefer quiet evenings at home with a good book. I do enjoy gardening, though. It's quite relaxing. I live alone, and I don’t have any pets. I do visit my sister occasionally, and I have a few friends that I see from time to time. But I wouldn’t describe myself as a particularly social person. Is that helpful, Doctor? I do hope I'm providing some useful information, at last.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, let's do a quick physical examination. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a brief abdominal exam. Then, I'll need to collect a urine sample. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgement entirely. I do hope it won't take too long, though. I have a… a rather important book waiting for me at home. But I certainly wouldn't want to delay matters unnecessarily. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare. And please, don't hesitate to ask if I can provide any further information, however vague it may be. I shall do my best to recall anything that might be relevant. Where would you like me to begin?
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat on the table. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Remove your left sleeve, please. I’ll explain everything as I go along.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Please, proceed at your leisure. I shall remain perfectly still, as instructed. I do hope I won't faint. I’ve always been rather squeamish, you see. But I shall endeavour to remain calm and cooperative. I trust you have a steady hand? It’s not the needle that bothers me, you understand. It’s the… the anticipation.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 150/90, Mr. Verbos. Elevated. As I said, we’ll take things slowly. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… deeper breath… and exhale. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear some slight wheezing in your lungs. Now, I’ll just gently palpate your abdomen… any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that’s a little uncomfortable, actually. Not painful, precisely, but… sensitive. It feels a bit tender around… here, on the left side. It's nothing severe, mind you. Just… a slight discomfort. Perhaps it's just gas? I do occasionally suffer from… digestive issues, you see. But it's usually nothing to worry about. It comes and goes. Is that normal, Doctor? Am I making a fuss over nothing? I do apologise for being so… troublesome. Perhaps I should have had a lighter lunch. Or perhaps it's just the anticipation, again. It's difficult to say, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I need to collect a urine sample. There's a container in the bathroom. Please try to provide a midstream sample, and bring it back to me when you’re finished. We’ll send it to the lab for analysis. It will help us determine if there’s an infection or any other abnormalities.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A urine sample. Yes, of course. A midstream sample, you say? I believe I remember something about that from a… a television program, perhaps. I shall endeavour to follow your instructions precisely. I shall return with the sample as soon as I am able. I do hope everything goes smoothly. This is all rather… unsettling, you see. But I trust your expertise entirely, Doctor. I shall return shortly.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I do hope I collected it correctly. It was rather… awkward, to be honest. I believe I managed a midstream sample, as instructed. But I’m not entirely certain. It’s difficult to be precise in such circumstances, you see. I do apologise for any… inconvenience. It's not something I enjoy discussing, you understand. Now, what happens next? Will you be able to tell me something definitive? Or will there be further… investigations? I do hope it's not too serious. I have a book waiting for me, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. We’ll send this to the lab for a complete analysis. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, based on your symptoms and the initial examination, I suspect a few possibilities. It could be a urinary tract infection, although the lack of pain makes that less likely. It could also be an issue with your prostate, or possibly a kidney problem. We need to rule out those possibilities. To be certain, I'd like to order a few tests: a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a PSA test to check your prostate. I’ll also order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a clearer picture of your kidneys and bladder. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A… a complete blood count? A metabolic panel? A CT scan? And a… a PSA test? That sounds… rather extensive, doesn’t it, Doctor? Are you saying it could be something… serious? Something requiring… treatment? A CT scan sounds rather… invasive. Will it involve radiation? And a PSA test… is that something to do with the… the prostate? I do apologise for my ignorance, Doctor. I'm not a medical professional, you see. I simply came in because of the… the frequent urination. I wasn’t expecting… all of this. What are the chances… what are the chances it’s nothing serious? Perhaps it's just a side effect of something I ate? Or perhaps… perhaps I'm simply drinking too much water? Is there anything else I can do? Anything at all? Perhaps a different diet? Or a special tea?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, it’s important to be thorough. While it may be something minor, we need to rule out serious possibilities. The CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but it's within acceptable limits. The PSA test is a blood test that checks for prostate abnormalities. As for a special diet or tea… those won’t address potential underlying medical issues. Worrying won't help. We’ll get these tests done, and then we can discuss the results. I understand you're anxious, but it’s crucial to follow the recommended course of action. The tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on, and then we can develop a treatment plan, if necessary. Here's a referral for the CT scan. You'll need to schedule an appointment. I'll also give you a lab slip for the blood tests. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I understand. A CT scan and blood tests. And a… a PSA test. I suppose I have no choice, do I? It’s just… a lot to take in. And the thought of… potential treatment… it’s rather frightening. Very well. I shall schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. And I shall go to the lab for the blood tests. But… how long will it take to get the results? And… what if something is… wrong? What if it's serious? Will you… will you be there to explain everything to me? I do hope I'm not being too troublesome. I simply… I need someone to guide me through this. I feel rather lost, you see. And I do have a book waiting for me… but I suppose that’s not important right now.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 3-5 business days. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I understand your concerns, Mr. Verbos. And yes, I will be here to explain everything to you. But I must stress that we don't have any definitive answers yet. Worrying prematurely won't help. We’ll take things one step at a time. Focus on scheduling the tests, and then we can discuss the results when they're available. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I don't think so. I suppose I just need to… process everything. And schedule the tests. And… wait. Thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. I do appreciate your… your patience. And your reassurance. I shall… I shall see you soon. I hope. Thank you again, Doctor. .
