DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Cannington. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my foot, dear. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, really. A nasty one, and it just won’t heal. I’ve had…well, let’s just say I’ve seen a few doctors in my time, and none of them seem to understand. It's probably the sugar, they all say. As if I don’t know that.
DOCTOR: Right. A sore on your foot that isn’t healing. And you suspect it’s related to your…blood sugar?
PATIENT: Suspect? Child, I know it’s the sugar. They told me years ago, didn’t they? But it’s more than that. It’s…it feels deeper. And it smells. Not a nice smell, I assure you. It’s not just a little scrape, you know. I keep it clean, though. Very clean. But it just…lingers. Do you even know how frustrating it is to have something just not go away?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we’ll get to the bottom of it. I need to ask some questions, alright?
PATIENT: Questions. Always questions. Very well. But don't expect me to remember every little detail. My memory isn’t what it used to be, though I recall perfectly well the doctor who misdiagnosed my cousin’s arthritis in ’68. Go on then, ask away. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's start with when you first noticed this sore. Can you recall roughly when it began?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…It was after the jubilee. Yes, the Queen’s jubilee celebration. That was…last year, wasn’t it? June of last year. I was walking barefoot on the beach, you see. Beautiful white sand, but I suppose something cut my foot. A shell, maybe. Didn’t think much of it at the time. Just a little scratch. But it never closed properly. Honestly, the sand isn't what it used to be. Full of debris.
DOCTOR: And you said it's been getting worse since then?
PATIENT: "Worse" is putting it mildly, dear. It’s not just the size, though it has grown. It's the…discharge. And the smell. It’s quite unpleasant, really. And the pain, of course. It throbs, especially at night. Makes it difficult to sleep. I’ve tried everything – antiseptic washes, bandages, even some of that ointment my niece, the nurse, sent me. Nothing seems to work. It's just…persistent. A truly stubborn sore. Honestly, you’d think with all the advancements in medicine…
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We're getting there. And you’ve mentioned pain, discharge, and smell. Have you noticed any redness around the sore?
PATIENT: Redness? Oh, yes, dear. Certainly. It’s quite red. A rather angry looking red, actually. And the skin around it is…warm. Not feverish, mind you, but definitely warmer than the rest of my foot. Though, to be fair, my feet are usually rather cold. Bad circulation, you know. It's a family thing. And there's a bit of swelling, too, now that you mention it. Honestly, it's a mess. A truly awful mess. Are you even looking at it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Cannington, I am looking at it. Now, have you had a fever or chills accompanying this sore?
PATIENT: A fever? Goodness, no. I don't get fevers. I’m a Marshallese woman, dear, we’re made of stronger stuff. Though, I have been a little…tired lately. Not that I haven’t always been tired. Getting old isn't for the faint of heart, you know. But no fever. Definitely no chills. Just…general discomfort. And the smell, of course. Can't forget the smell. It's rather distracting. Are you going to do something about it, or just keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to examine your foot properly. Please remove your shoe and sock. I’ll need to take a look at the sore, and I may need to take some measurements and perhaps a swab to send to the lab. This will help me determine the best course of treatment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Honestly, the indignity of it all. Very well. But be gentle, dear. My feet are…sensitive. And I expect a full explanation afterwards. No medical jargon, mind you. I want to understand what you’re doing and why. And please, don't make a fuss. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, this is…significant. It appears to be quite deep, and there is some surrounding cellulitis. The odor is concerning, and there’s some warmth to the surrounding tissue. Approximately 3 centimeters in diameter. And now, a swab for culture and sensitivity. This will help us identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. It looks like there may be some involvement of the deeper tissues as well. I’m going to need to order an X-ray to rule out any bone infection. It’s quite possible this has become osteomyelitis.
PATIENT: Osteo…what? Honestly, all these complicated words. You're scaring me now, dear. Bone infection? Is my foot going to have to be…amputated? My cousin lost a toe to diabetes, you know. A toe! Are you telling me this is that serious? I’ve always taken good care of myself. Well, relatively good. Honestly, I just wanted a simple ointment. This is all terribly upsetting. Do you even know how much I rely on my feet? I need to walk on the beach!
DOCTOR: Mrs. Cannington, please try to remain calm. I’m not saying you need an amputation. However, it is important we take this seriously. Osteomyelitis, or bone infection, is a potential complication of a prolonged infection like this. The X-ray will help us determine if that’s the case. I'm also concerned about the possibility of sepsis – a systemic infection. That’s why we need to identify the bacteria causing this quickly. We’ll start you on a broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately, and we’ll adjust it once we get the lab results. I’m ordering the X-ray now, and I'll get the lab to prioritize the swab. In the meantime, I want you to rest and elevate your foot as much as possible. Do not walk on it. I understand this is frightening, but we’re going to do everything we can to get this under control.
PATIENT: Sepsis? Amputation? This is dreadful, absolutely dreadful. Broad-spectrum…antibiotic? Sounds like something they use on livestock. I knew I should have just stayed home and put some vinegar on it. My grandmother always said vinegar cures everything. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here at all. What about the beach? Will I ever be able to walk on the beach again? And what if this antibiotic makes me sick? I have a very sensitive stomach, you know. I just want my foot to feel better. Is that too much to ask? Stop with the complicated words and just tell me what’s going to happen.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Cannington, I understand your concerns. Let’s focus on getting you feeling better, alright?
PATIENT: Easy for you to say, dear. You're not the one with the throbbing foot and the threat of…what was it? Osteo-something and sepsis! And no beach walks! Honestly, I'm beginning to think modern medicine is all hype. Just a lot of fancy words to scare old people. If you’ll excuse me, I think I need a lie-down. And perhaps a cup of tea. A strong cup of tea. I'm not sure I can handle much more of this. .
DOCTOR: Mrs. Cannington, please wait. Before you go, I need you to understand the importance of following my instructions. The X-ray results will be available this afternoon. I will call you as soon as I have them. Do not walk on your foot until I tell you it’s safe. And if you experience any fever, chills, or increased pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
