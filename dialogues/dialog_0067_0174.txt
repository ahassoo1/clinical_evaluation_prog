DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I wish the circumstances were better. I’m here because… well, to be frank, I haven’t been feeling myself lately. A bit down, you understand. I just want to get this sorted, if we can. I haven’t got all day, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get things checked out, and I'll do my best to be efficient. “Not feeling yourself” can mean a lot of things. Could you tell me a little more about what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to begin? It’s not… a specific thing, really. Just a general… lack of joy, I suppose. Things that used to please me… don’t anymore. And I’m tired. Very, very tired. Even after a full night's sleep. I used to be so active, you know, with the lifeguarding and skiing… now, even getting out of bed feels like a chore. It's been going on for… oh, goodness, a few months now, I'd say. Perhaps longer. Time… it slips away, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does. Thank you for sharing that with me, Nani. It sounds like this has been a frustrating experience for you. A loss of interest and persistent fatigue are definitely things we need to explore. To help me understand things better, could you tell me if anything specific happened around the time you started feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? Let me think. Well… my divorce was finalised about six months ago. It wasn’t… amicable, shall we say. A lot of… unpleasantness. And my son… he moved to Canada with his family. I don’t see them as often as I’d like. But… is that it? I don’t know. Life just… happened, I suppose. It’s difficult to pinpoint one thing. Perhaps it was a culmination of things. Honestly, Doctor, I haven't a clue. It’s all a bit muddled.
DOCTOR: That gives me a much better understanding, Nani. Significant life changes like a divorce and your son moving away can absolutely contribute to how you're feeling. It’s not unusual for those events to have a lasting emotional impact. Now, let's talk a bit about your symptoms physically. Besides the fatigue, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite… it’s practically nonexistent. I used to enjoy cooking, you know, Nigerian food… wonderful, spicy dishes! Now… I just don’t feel hungry. I’ve lost some weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself recently. I really don't bother with such things anymore. It just… doesn’t seem important. Everything feels… muted.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. A decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss are things we'll want to keep track of. Have you been experiencing any difficulty sleeping – trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s not that I can’t sleep, it’s more… restless sleep. I wake up several times during the night. Tossing and turning. My mind just… races. Thinking about… everything and nothing. And then, when I do finally get to sleep, it doesn't feel restorative. I wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. It’s quite frustrating, honestly. I used to be a very sound sleeper.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Nani. Restless sleep and feeling unrefreshed despite sleeping are common with what you’ve described. Now, let's move on to a quick review of other systems. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. My bowels… they're as regular as they ever were. Perhaps a little sluggish, now that I think about it. But nothing… dramatic. I don’t have any… issues in that department, if you understand what I mean. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for dwelling on such things.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Nani. That's good to know. And thank you for being so forthcoming. Now, have you been experiencing any unexplained aches, pains, or muscle weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my joints ache a bit. Not constantly, but… especially in the mornings. I thought it was just… old age, to be perfectly frank. I used to be so active, you know, swimming, skiing… I suppose it’s just the wear and tear of a long life. No real muscle weakness, though. I can still manage, just… everything takes a bit more effort. It's all a bit tiresome, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Joint aches, especially in the mornings, are good to note. Now, one last question for the review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, actually. That's been… concerning. I forget things now. Simple things. Names, dates… where I put my spectacles! It’s not… debilitating, but it’s definitely noticeable. And I find it difficult to concentrate. Reading a book, watching television… my mind wanders. I used to be a very sharp woman, Doctor. It’s… unsettling. It worries me, to be frank.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nani. Changes in memory and concentration are definitely something we need to take seriously. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years ago, but it was managed with diet and exercise. It’s been perfectly normal for years now. Otherwise, I've been quite healthy, all things considered. I've always been very active, you see. I don’t take any regular medication, except for a vitamin D supplement in the winter. And a little something for my arthritis, occasionally, when it flares up. But nothing consistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And I broke my arm skiing, decades ago, but that was just a simple fracture. Other than that, no. I've been very fortunate, I suppose. I've always avoided hospitals if I could. Not my favourite place, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant health conditions that run in your family – things like depression, heart disease, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult one. My mother… she suffered from what they called “the nerves” back in her day. A lot of anxiety and sadness. I suppose it could have been depression, but they didn’t really understand such things back then. My father… he had heart disease, but he smoked heavily, you understand. And my sister… she had cancer, but she was much older than me. Other than that… not really. A lot of longevity in my family, thankfully. But that doesn’t seem to be helping me much at the moment, does it?
DOCTOR: It does give me some helpful information, Nani. A family history of anxiety and depression is something we should be aware of. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I'm divorced, as we discussed. I live alone in my own home. It's a bit too large for me now, perhaps, but I’m quite attached to it. I have a son, who lives in Canada with his family. We speak on the phone occasionally, but it's not the same, you understand. I used to have a very active social life, but… things have changed. I don’t really go out much anymore. It's just… difficult to muster the energy, to be frank.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve experienced some significant changes in your life recently. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let's just quickly cover allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had any allergic reactions. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any issues with medication. As I said, I only take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, and a little something for my arthritis occasionally, when it flares up. It's… ibuprofen, I think. Just over-the-counter. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Thank you for being so thorough, Nani. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, if you please. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get home. Though I doubt I’ll be doing much once I get there. Just… try to be quick, Doctor. I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound good, Nani. Blood pressure is a little bit high, but that's not unusual with stress. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and coordination. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, alright. Is that alright? Do I need to do anything else? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good at these things. I haven’t done this since… well, a very long time ago. Just… get it over with, if you please. My arm is starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani. Everything seems within normal limits, though your reflexes are a little bit diminished, and your coordination is slightly clumsy. It’s not a major concern at this point. I'm also going to listen to your abdomen. No tenderness, no masses. Now, just one more thing. I'd like to do a brief cognitive assessment, just to get a better understanding of your memory and concentration. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? Honestly, Doctor. Must you? I told you, my memory isn't what it used to be. But… alright. Get it over with. The sooner this is done, the better. Just… try to be quick, if you please. And speak clearly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. We’ll take it slowly. I’m just going to ask you a few simple questions. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm… Today? August… the second? Yes, I think it’s the second. 2025, isn't it? Though I wouldn't swear to it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m terrible with dates. It all blurs together these days. Is that right? Am I correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct. That's good, Nani. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, I… I live in the countryside, don't I? It’s… a small town. Not much happens here. Is that what you want to know? The name of the town? Oh, goodness… it’s… It's on the tip of my tongue… I just can’t seem to recall it at the moment. Honestly, Doctor, this is embarrassing. It’s a perfectly ordinary little town, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Nani. It's perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling things. It doesn’t mean anything is seriously wrong. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. Listen carefully: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… um… what was the third one? Penny? No… plate? I’m not sure. Apple… table… something beginning with ‘p’… Honestly, Doctor, my mind is a complete blank. I used to have a very good memory. This is… unsettling. Apple… table… I just can't seem to recall it.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Nani. It's not a test, just an assessment. Now, let’s move on to a different type of question. Can you tell me what year the United States declared its independence?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, I haven’t a clue. Something to do with… history? I was never very good at history. Dates and names… it all blurred together. I’m afraid I can’t help you with that, Doctor. Honestly, this is… rather humiliating. I used to be a very intelligent woman. I just… don’t remember.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nani. It’s clear you’re experiencing some difficulty with your memory and concentration. This, combined with your fatigue, loss of appetite, and changes in mood, suggests we need to investigate this further. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of depression, possibly complicated by some cognitive impairment. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a brain scan – an MRI or CT scan – to get a better understanding of what's going on. And I'd like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests and scans… It’s all rather overwhelming, isn’t it? But… yes, yes, alright. Do what you think is best, Doctor. The sooner we get to the bottom of this, the better. I just want to feel like myself again. To be honest, I'm rather frightened. But… yes, do the tests. And the scan. And see the neurologist. Whatever it takes. Just… try to be quick, if you please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. I'll get the lab orders and referral paperwork ready for you right now. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. I'll also have my nurse contact you to discuss the details of the brain scan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low dose antidepressant to see if it helps improve your mood and energy levels. It may take a few weeks to see a noticeable effect, so it’s important to be patient. I'll also recommend some light exercise and healthy eating habits, if you're up to it. And, most importantly, if you're feeling overwhelmed or having any thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all rather a lot to take in. Just… do the tests and scans and see what happens. I suppose I’ll just have to wait and see. Thank you, Doctor. For… listening, I suppose. And for trying to help. I appreciate it. I just want my life back. Can I… go home now?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Nani. Let me walk you to the door. And please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will be in touch shortly to schedule your appointments. And remember, you're not alone in this. We'll work together to get you feeling better. Here’s the paperwork for the lab and referral. Take care, Nani. And please, try to rest and take things easy. .
