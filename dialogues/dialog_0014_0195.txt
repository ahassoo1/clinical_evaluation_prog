DOCTOR: Right. Janeth Micucci, 60 years old. Hello, Ms. Micucci. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Osterholm, is it? Yes, that’s right. Well, it’s not a problem, exactly. More… a little boost, you know? My daughter, she said I should come get a card. A “get well” card, or one of those encouragement ones. She says I’ve been… down. Honestly, I don’t see what the fuss is about. But she insisted. So here I am.
DOCTOR: Down, you say. Hmm. And how long has this… “down” feeling been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Months, I suppose. Not that I feel bad, exactly. Just… things aren’t right. People don’t seem to have the same respect anymore, you know? Always rushing around, no manners. It’s exhausting, honestly. And my husband, bless his heart, he just doesn’t get it. He says I worry too much. Men! What do they know? It's just… a general feeling, I suppose. A bit… disheartening. Is that good enough for a card?
DOCTOR: Disheartening… Right. So, it’s less about physical symptoms and more… a sense of things being off?
PATIENT: Exactly! You understand. It’s not like my joints ache or anything. I can still do everything I need to, though sometimes it is a bit much, all the running around after everyone. It's just...everything is so tiring. And nobody appreciates a good, clean house anymore. Honestly, you wouldn't believe the mess my grandson leaves. It's simply appalling. But it's not something you can explain to a doctor, is it? It’s just… life. A bit…much, lately. So, can I get the card, or…? I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, we do have a standard questionnaire for… emotional wellbeing. It might help us to rule out anything more… specific. It’s just a few questions. No harm in trying, is there?
PATIENT: A questionnaire? Honestly. I don't see what writing things down will do. I’ve told you what’s going on. But… alright. If it gets me the card, I suppose. Though I doubt a bunch of questions will capture the nuance of it all. Are they complicated questions? I don’t have a lot of patience for riddles. And is it one of those where they try to trick you? I’ve heard about those.
DOCTOR: No riddles, I assure you. Straightforward questions about how you’ve been feeling lately. It's just to get a baseline, Ms. Micucci. We need to be thorough, even if it seems… unnecessary. Just answer honestly, to the best of your ability. There's a section on sleep, appetite, and general energy levels. It shouldn’t take too long. And it will help us determine if a card is… sufficient, or if further evaluation is needed.
PATIENT: “Further evaluation”? Oh, for goodness sake. Honestly, I came for a card, not a… a diagnosis! My daughter will be insufferable if she thinks I need… help. Is there anywhere I can get my glasses cleaned? They’re a bit smudged, and I can’t read a thing properly. And… where do I even start on this form? It’s all tiny writing. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. Let’s take a step back. I understand you’re not looking for a… major intervention. And I assure you, we’re not jumping to conclusions. But we need to gather some information. I can certainly find a lens cloth for your glasses. There’s one in there. As for the form… perhaps we can go through it together. Just a few questions at a time. It might be easier. We'll start with the first one: "Over the past two weeks, have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Hopeless? Oh, goodness no! I wouldn’t say hopeless. Annoyed, certainly. Frustrated, absolutely. Disappointed in the younger generation, without a doubt. But hopeless? No. That's a bit… dramatic, isn’t it? Though… my grandson did leave his shoes right in the middle of the hallway again. And his room… honestly, it’s a biohazard. But that doesn’t mean I’m hopeless. So… what do I write? "Sometimes"? Is there a "Sometimes" option? Because "No" wouldn’t be entirely truthful. This is so unnecessarily complicated.
DOCTOR: There’s a scale, Ms. Micucci. Not just “Yes” or “No”. It ranges from “Not at all” to “Nearly every day.” We need to be specific. See?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A scale. Of course. Well, let me see… “Not at all” is certainly not right. “Several days” feels a bit… strong. Perhaps “More than half the days”? Because honestly, I do find myself sighing a lot lately. And rolling my eyes. Does rolling your eyes count as feeling down? My husband says it's just a habit. He doesn't understand the nuance of things, naturally. There. Is that alright? Can we move on to the next question, please? This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Over the past two weeks, have you had trouble falling or staying asleep, or have you been sleeping too much?
PATIENT: Sleeping? Oh, don’t even get me started! I sleep perfectly fine, thank you very much. Though I do wake up a lot thinking about all the things that need to be done. The dusting, the gardening, making sure my husband eats properly… and then there’s the grandson. Honestly, the messes he makes! So, I’m not sleeping enough, because I’m worrying. But I’m not having trouble falling asleep. It’s… complicated. Is there an option for “Sleep fine, but wake up worrying”? If not, I suppose “Some days” would have to do. Though it’s not entirely accurate. Honestly, this form is a complete waste of time. Can we please just get to the card?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, “Do you have little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: Little interest or pleasure? Oh, that's just preposterous! I enjoy plenty of things. I enjoy a clean house, a well-organized pantry, a properly set table. I enjoy nagging my husband about his health. Honestly, I’m very busy, I don’t have time to sit around feeling… unpleased! Though… I suppose I haven't been doing much gardening lately. It’s just too hot, and my grandson keeps trampling the flowers. So… maybe a little less pleasure. But definitely not “little interest”. Honestly, this is ridiculous. There! Are we done yet? Can I finally get my card? It’s just a silly card, I don’t know why this is taking so long. My daughter is going to be thrilled, and I have a whole afternoon of chores waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this… assessment, I can write a note for your daughter. It’s not a medical diagnosis, Ms. Micucci. It's simply a reassurance that you’ve been seen and we’ve discussed your… concerns. It suggests encouraging you to maintain your regular routine and reach out if things change. Here. It's not a formal document, but hopefully, it will suffice. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: A “note”? A note? Honestly, I came for a card, not a note! It's… underwhelming, to say the least. But… alright. I suppose it's better than nothing. No, that’s all. Thank you… I suppose. Though I really wish I could have just gotten a card. It would have been so much simpler. Well, goodbye then. And thank you again for… the note. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Micucci. Have a good day. Some people…
