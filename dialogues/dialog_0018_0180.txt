DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it's… it's this tiredness. I’m just always tired. And… well, it’s embarrassing, okay? I keep… eating dirt. Not like, wanting to, it just… happens. It's stupid, really. Just get it over with, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. It doesn't sound "stupid" at all, and you are not embarrassing me. It sounds quite concerning, actually. Thank you for sharing this with me. Let’s try to understand what’s going on. First, regarding this tiredness – how long have you been feeling this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, I dunno. A while. Months, probably? Everything just feels… heavy. Like wading through mud. And it's not like I've been laying around. I work, you know? CNC programming isn’t exactly a walk in the park. It requires… focus. Which is hard when you feel like this. Honestly, I just thought it was getting old.
DOCTOR: CNC programming is demanding work, you're right. It certainly requires significant mental energy. And feeling this way for months is a good reason to investigate further, regardless of age. When you say "heavy," can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s… like my limbs are filled with cement. Hard to explain. Everything takes effort. Even… talking. And the dirt… it's not like I crave it, it just… eases something. Not a good feeling, but… less bad than the tiredness, I guess? It started small. Little bits of clay when I was gardening, but now… I find myself… just picking at it. Don’t look at me like that.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Cantoran, I'm not judging you at all. It’s important to describe everything, no matter how unusual it may seem, so we can understand the full picture. The fact that the dirt-eating seems to provide some relief is a very important detail. And you mentioned it started with clay when gardening – is that the only type of dirt you find yourself consuming now?
PATIENT: No. Clay’s… easier to get, I guess. But I've... been digging. Found some red stuff. Earth, I think? I don’t… I don’t really know dirt, okay? I make computers, not gardens. It’s… embarrassing. Are you writing all this down? Don't tell anyone. I got a reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: I am writing everything down, Ms. Cantoran, and I want to assure you that everything we discuss is confidential. My primary concern is to understand what’s happening with your health and to help you feel better. You mentioned finding red earth – do you remember where you found it specifically?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? No. Somewhere near the river. Behind old man Hemlock's place, I think? It's all… blurry. I was just… wandering. Needed to… do something. It doesn’t matter, does it? It’s just dirt. And it’s stupid. Look, are we getting anywhere? I got a machine waiting on a program.
DOCTOR: The location could be helpful, Ms. Cantoran, as the composition of the soil varies geographically and might offer clues. But it’s alright if you don’t remember precisely. And it’s not stupid, Ms. Cantoran. This combination of fatigue and the unusual compulsion to consume soil—what we call pica—is something we need to investigate. It could be indicative of a nutritional deficiency, or something else entirely. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? What about it? I eat. I grab whatever’s easiest, okay? Sandwiches, usually. Sometimes soup. I don't have time for fancy cooking. My husband… well, he did most of the cooking. It's been a while. I don't really think about food. Just… fuel. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That answers the question, Ms. Cantoran. It sounds like your diet might be somewhat limited, which could be a factor. And I understand it's been difficult since your husband's passing. Can you recall approximately how many sandwiches or meals you eat in a typical day?
PATIENT: Ugh, don’t make me think so hard. One sandwich for lunch. Sometimes a bowl of soup for dinner. Maybe. Depends. If I'm busy, I just… skip it. I drink coffee. Lots of coffee. Is that what you want to know? Look, I'm a programmer, not a nutritionist!
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. I am not trying to quiz you, only gather information to help. Coffee doesn’t provide many nutrients, and skipping meals can lead to deficiencies. Let's talk about your past medical history, if you’re comfortable. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? I'm old. What haven't I got? High blood pressure, I think. The doctor said something about it years ago. Got a prescription, took it for a while, then forgot. I'm bad with pills. And… arthritis in my hands, makes typing difficult sometimes. That’s it. Honestly, I don’t really go to the doctor. Waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand. High blood pressure and arthritis are both important to note. And it is good that you remember those. Do you currently take any medications for either condition, even if infrequently?
PATIENT: No. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills ages ago. They made me dizzy. The arthritis… I just deal with it. Rub some cream on it sometimes. It’s not worth the hassle of going to the doctor again. Honestly, this is all a waste of time. I should be at my machine.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Cantoran. I understand your reluctance, but I truly believe that addressing these issues, even if it feels like a hassle, could improve your quality of life. Before we proceed, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Except beets. I hate beets. Is that an allergy? Look, are we done yet? I seriously need to get back to work. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: No allergies to note, and I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran. We are getting closer to understanding what’s going on. Now, a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, my family? Everyone died ages ago. Old age, mostly. My grandmother had… something with her heart, I think. My father… smoked too much. Cancer, probably. Honestly, I don’t remember much. It was a long time ago. And frankly, it doesn’t matter. It’s not like it’s going to change anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cantoran. Knowing about the heart condition and smoking history is helpful, even if the details are limited. Now, a sensitive question. I understand it may be difficult to talk about, but have there been any significant changes in your life recently, besides your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: Ugh, what kind of question is that? What do you mean, 'significant changes'? I work. I eat. I pick at dirt. My husband died, okay? That’s pretty significant. What more do you want? Look, this is ridiculous. I'm leaving. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, please don’t leave. I understand this is uncomfortable, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. It's simply that, taken together, the fatigue, the pica—the dirt eating—and the history you've shared raise a few possibilities. We need to rule things out systematically to get to the bottom of this. I would like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you are willing. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a general look at your hands and skin. It won’t take long, and it could provide valuable information. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Get it over with. But don't expect much. I'm a programmer, not a patient. And hurry up, okay? I got things to do. Just… don't touch my hands too much. They're sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cantoran. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a bit high, and I notice some mild swelling and redness in your hands, consistent with arthritis. Your heart rhythm is slightly irregular, which we should monitor. Now, if you could open your mouth, I’d like to quickly check your tongue and gums.
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You're poking around in my mouth now? Fine. But don't expect me to hold it open for long. I haven't been to the dentist in years. Just… get it over with. This is so undignified.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cantoran. Everything is done. Your gums are slightly inflamed, and your tongue appears a bit pale. Based on what you've told me—the fatigue, the pica, the family history, and the physical exam findings—I'm concerned about the possibility of iron deficiency anemia and potentially some other nutritional deficiencies. The pica—the dirt eating—is often a sign of this. To confirm this, I would like to order some blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, iron studies, vitamin B12 level, and vitamin D level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Seriously? What's the point? I'll bet it's nothing. Just… fine. Whatever you want. But don’t expect me to come back if it's just to be told I'm getting old. And… how long will it take? I got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran. These tests will give us concrete information so we can determine the best course of action. The tests should be processed within a few days, and the clinic will contact you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, I would also like to recommend a dietary assessment with a registered dietitian. They can help you identify any nutritional gaps and create a plan to ensure you're getting the nutrients you need. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Ugh, a dietitian now? Look, I eat sandwiches! I’m not going to sit around and talk about my meals. This is ridiculous. No. Absolutely not. Just… give me the results when they’re ready. And don’t bother calling me. I’ll call you. And… just to be clear, this is all confidential, right?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. We will respect your decision regarding the dietitian. And, yes, absolutely. Everything we discuss is strictly confidential, as I mentioned earlier. Your privacy is of utmost importance. I'll order the blood tests now, and the clinic will contact you with the results. If the tests confirm a deficiency, we can discuss treatment options, likely involving iron supplementation and potentially other vitamins. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. Just… don't waste my time. And send the results to my email. It's… cantoran.heedy@emailprovider.com. And… just let me know when they're ready. Honestly, this whole thing has been a waste of time. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cantoran. I will ensure the results are sent to cantoran.heedy@emailprovider.com as soon as they are available. I wish you well, and please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Goodbye, Ms. Cantoran. .
