DOCTOR: Hi Arthur, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Aye, good to meet ye too, Doctor. Well, it’s this mornin’ sickness, really. Not that I’m expectin’… well, never ye mind that! It started a few weeks back, just feelin’ queasy first thing. It's been happenin’ pretty regular now, and I’m a bit worried, seein' as my heart isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Morning sickness, even if unexpected, is certainly something we should look into. And it's good you mentioned your heart health – definitely important to keep that in mind. So, just to clarify, it's queasiness that's worst in the morning, you said?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. It's usually right when I wake up, before I've had anythin’ to eat. Sometimes it lasts for a good hour or two, even after I get a bit o’ toast down. Though, it has happened later in the day a couple o’ times, just a sudden wave o’ feelin’ unwell, ye ken? Not as bad, but still… unnervin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's primarily in the morning, but you’ve experienced it at other times too, just less frequently and less severe. And it does seem to improve somewhat with eating toast, although not always completely?
PATIENT: Aye, that sums it up nicely, Doctor. Toast helps take the edge off, usually. But some days it doesn’t matter what I eat, it's still there. And it's not just the feelin’ sick, it's a bit o’ lightheadedness sometimes, too. Not enough to make me fall, but enough to make me pause and hold onto somethin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, lightheadedness along with the nausea. That's good to know. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, besides not eating?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think… well, bein’ overly warm seems to do it. If I’m out workin’ in the garden on a hot day, even with a hat on, it tends to flare up later. And… if I lie flat for too long, like if I try to have a wee nap in the afternoon, it’s worse when I get up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heat and lying flat seem to be triggers. And you mentioned working in the garden – how strenuous is that work, generally?
PATIENT: It's not too bad, Doctor. Mostly just weedin’ and plantin’, a bit o’ diggin’ now and then. I used to be able to do a lot more, but I pace myself these days. I take plenty o’ breaks, and I try not to overdo it. Still, it's work, ye ken? Gets the heart goin’.
DOCTOR: Right, pacing yourself is good. And you mentioned your heart – have you been diagnosed with any heart conditions previously?
PATIENT: Aye, I have. Congestive heart failure, the doctor told me. Been dealin’ with it for… oh, must be eight, maybe nine years now? I take my medicine regular, keep an eye on my salt intake, all that. But it’s a tricky thing, ye ken? It flares up sometimes, even when I’m doin’ all the right things.
DOCTOR: Okay, congestive heart failure, managed with medication and diet. That’s important information. And you said it flares up sometimes despite doing everything right. Can you describe what those flares feel like?
PATIENT: Aye, well… mostly just short o’ breath, even when I’m restin’. And my ankles swell up somethin’ awful. That’s usually the first sign. Then it gets harder to walk, and I feel more tired than usual. That’s when I usually need to call the doctor and get checked. This mornin’ sickness… it just feels different, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so flares of your heart failure involve shortness of breath and ankle swelling. And you feel this nausea is different than those flares. That’s helpful. Let's talk about your other symptoms – have you noticed any changes in your appetite, weight, or bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Aye, good question, Doctor. My appetite’s been a bit off, to be honest. Not much o’ a hunger, even for things I normally enjoy. And I think I've lost a wee bit o’ weight, but I haven’t been weighin’ myself regular. As for… well, things haven’t been as regular as they used to be, either. A bit o’ constipation, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite, some weight loss, and constipation. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any fever, chills, or any abdominal pain along with the nausea?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, Doctor. And no abdominal pain, thankfully. It's just the queasiness, really. It doesn't hurt to be sick, if ye understand me. Just… uncomfortable. It's more worryin' than painful, if that makes sense. Especially with the heart, I keep thinkin' somethin' else is goin’ on.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good you're being proactive and listening to your body, especially given your heart condition. Okay, Arthur, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Then we can discuss some potential causes and next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds grand, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m happy to do whatever ye think is best. I trust yer judgement. Just let me know if there’s anythin’ ye want me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arthur, your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, which isn’t unusual given your heart condition and medication. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur, which we already know about. Your lungs are clear, no signs of fluid buildup that I can hear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a little bit of fullness in your lower abdomen, no tenderness though. I also noticed some mild swelling in your ankles when I checked your feet. Now, given your symptoms – the nausea, lightheadedness, decreased appetite, constipation, and the swelling – and your history of heart failure, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to your heart medication, or a worsening of your heart failure, even if it doesn't feel the same as before. It’s also possible it’s something else entirely. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count to rule out any other issues. I’d also like to get an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and an EKG… go right ahead. I’d rather be safe than sorry, ye ken? It's good to rule things out. Anything else ye need from me?
DOCTOR: No, I think that’s everything for now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and we’ll get the EKG scheduled right away. It usually only takes a few minutes. In the meantime, I want you to continue taking your heart medication as prescribed. If your symptoms worsen significantly – particularly if you experience severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness – please go to the emergency room immediately. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and we’ll discuss a plan from there. It's possible we might need to adjust your medication or refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate ye takin’ it so seriously. I’ll keep takin’ my medicine, and I'll head straight to the emergency room if things get worse. I'll keep an eye on things and wait for yer call. Thank ye kindly for yer time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arthur. It's my job to make sure we're addressing everything. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. We’ll get those tests done quickly and figure out what's going on. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Aye, ye too, Doctor. Thank ye again. I will.
