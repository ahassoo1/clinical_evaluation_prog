DOCTOR: Right, Colt Lason. 66 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Ruocco, it's… these little spells I've been having. My wife, Srey, she's the one who really insisted I come. Says I get… lost. Not lost outside, mind you. Lost in my head. It's… frustrating, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Lost in your head, you say. Hmm. And how long have these… spells been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months now? It started slowly, just forgetting where I put my tools. But it's gotten worse. Like yesterday, I was trying to explain to Srey how to fix the loose tile in the bathroom – I know exactly how to do it, I’ve been doing tile work for forty years! – and… well, the words just wouldn't come out right. It was like they were… stuck.
DOCTOR: Stuck, alright. And these episodes… do they happen at a specific time of day?
PATIENT: No, not really. That's the annoying part. Sometimes it's in the morning, sometimes after dinner. Once, it was right in the middle of laying a new floor – had to stop, just couldn't concentrate. Srey says I just stared off into space for a good ten minutes. She had to tell me what I was doing, step by step. It's… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Right. So, intermittent. Not tied to a specific activity or time. And Srey has noticed you just… blank out?
PATIENT: Blank out is a good way to put it. Like someone switched off a light. I'm aware I'm supposed to be doing something, or saying something, but the thought... it's just gone. And then it comes back, usually after a few minutes. It’s not like I’m not there, you understand? It’s just… a gap. A missing piece.
DOCTOR: A missing piece. Alright. And has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Not really. Srey and I, we keep to ourselves mostly. The kids visit when they can, but they're busy with their own lives. I still do tile work, although I’m taking on smaller jobs these days, my back isn’t what it used to be. We haven't gone on vacation in years. It's always been like this, a quiet life. I can't imagine what would change it.
DOCTOR: A quiet life. Sometimes, that's the problem. Let's talk about your medical history, then. Any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now. And my blood pressure's been a little high for a while, but the doctor put me on a pill for it. Other than that, I've always been a strong, healthy man. Worked hard my whole life, never really sick a day. I don’t understand why this is happening.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication. What are you taking, exactly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a small white pill. Srey handles most of the refills, so I don’t pay much attention. Something-pril… Lisinopril, I think? Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, I believe. She keeps it all organized.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Srey always double-checks when the doctor prescribes something, you see. She’s very careful. A good woman, Srey. Always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Old Man Hem, down the street, swore by them. Said it keeps your memory sharp. Though, clearly, that isn't working, is it?
DOCTOR: A multivitamin. Right. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. Though I don't see what poking and prodding will do. It's not like my body is the problem. It's… up here.
DOCTOR: We'll see. First, let's check your reflexes. And say "thirty-three" when I do this. Normal reflexes. Blood pressure is... 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Pupils are equal and reactive. No obvious neurological deficits on initial examination.
PATIENT: So? What does all that mean? You've poked and prodded, listened and shined lights… are you going to tell me what's wrong with me or not? I’m not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Lason, at your age, these… vague symptoms could be a number of things. Stress, mild cognitive impairment… it’s often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation. I'm not seeing anything drastically wrong, but given your concerns, and the reported episodes, I recommend we order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. And, frankly, a Vitamin B12 level, just to rule things out. Also, I’d like a referral to a neurologist. They can perform more in-depth cognitive testing and potentially an MRI to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Here. Take this to the lab. And schedule an appointment with Dr. Chen, the neurologist. We'll review the results when they come back. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? Now you're talking about machines and… tests. I don’t like the sound of that at all. All this fuss… for a few little spells. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I don’t need machines telling me what’s wrong with me. I'll… think about it. Maybe it's just a phase. Srey worries too much.
DOCTOR: As you wish, Mr. Lason. But I strongly advise against dismissing this. It's better to be safe than sorry. If the symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new changes, please come back immediately. Here's my card. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
