DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, thanks. It’s… well, it’s probably nothing, honestly. My family… they have a history. Lots of… things. My grandmother, and then my aunt… it's just always something. I want to make sure I don’t end up the same way, you know? It's probably silly, but I'd just like some reassurance.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Blain. Family history is incredibly important, and it's very responsible of you to be proactive about your health. Knowing what’s happened with your family can help us focus on preventative measures and early detection. Could you tell me a little more about what “things” your grandmother and aunt experienced?
PATIENT: Well, my grandmother… she had heart problems. A lot of them. Ended up needing a pacemaker, then… well, then she passed. Pretty quickly, actually. And my aunt… she had cancer. Breast cancer, I think. It was… a whole ordeal. Lots of treatments, and then it spread. It wasn’t good. Look, I’m not trying to be dramatic, I just… I don't want to end up like them. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very clear, Blain. Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s completely understandable to be concerned given your family history. We’ll definitely take that into consideration as we go through things. To get a better understanding of your current health and risk factors, let’s start with a little more detail. Do you mind if I ask about your own medical history?
PATIENT: Fine. But honestly, there isn’t much to tell. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I mean, I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, that sort of thing. But nothing major. No serious illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I don’t even really go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Blain. Still, it’s helpful to have a complete picture. Have you had any recent illnesses – even a bad cold or the flu – in the past year?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, I think I had the flu last winter. Or maybe it was a really bad cold. Honestly, I don't remember exactly. It knocked me out for a few days, but I just… rested. Took some over-the-counter stuff. Didn’t bother going to the doctor, like I said. It went away on its own. Are we getting anywhere with this? I mean, am I going to drop dead tomorrow?
DOCTOR: No, Blain, you're not going to drop dead tomorrow. It sounds like you had a typical viral illness, and it's good that you recovered. But it's important to document these things, just in case. Let's move on to other aspects of your health. Are you currently taking any medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Vitamins? No. Look, I eat okay. I try to. I had a phase where I was taking a multivitamin, but I stopped. Waste of money, if you ask me. No prescriptions either. I haven't needed any. I'm perfectly healthy, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. No, I don't think so. I mean, I’ve eaten everything, travelled everywhere. Never had a reaction. I think my mother would have remembered if I was allergic to something, and she definitely remembers everything. So, no. No allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I'm an engineering teacher, at the community college. It’s… stressful, sometimes. Lots of grading. I live alone, since the divorce. And… I try to eat reasonably well, I guess. I don't really exercise, if that's what you're asking. Don't have the time, or the energy. Is this going to be a lecture about how I need to start running marathons?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not! No lectures about marathons, I promise. Just trying to get a complete picture of your overall health. The stress from work is good to know, and we can discuss ways to manage that. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Seriously? No! I’m not that kind of person. I mean, look at me. Do I look like someone who smokes? I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. But that’s it. And absolutely no drugs. Never. I have standards.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Blain. That’s very helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history in more detail. You mentioned your grandmother and aunt. Do you know what specific heart problems your grandmother had?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. My mother talked about it a lot, but she’s not exactly… precise. Something about… irregular heartbeat? And high blood pressure, I think. She had a lot of tests, and then… well, then she got the pacemaker. And it wasn’t enough. That’s all I really know. It all happened a long time ago, and my mother mostly just complained about how stressed my grandmother was.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. Irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure are good starting points. And with your aunt’s breast cancer, do you know if she had any genetic testing done, or if there was a family history of cancer on her side?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. She didn't really talk about it much. It was… a difficult time for everyone. She just started getting… lumps, and then she went to the doctor, and then… treatments. I don't think they ever really talked about genetics, or anything like that. She was more concerned with just… getting better, I guess. And it didn't work out. Honestly, my mother just focused on the fact that my aunt didn't eat enough vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like there wasn’t a lot of detailed information available about either situation. To get a better understanding of your current health status, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. We can check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just get a general sense of how things are. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Uh… fine. But don’t be surprised if it’s not great. I haven’t been to the doctor in ages, like I said. And I've been stressed, okay? Don't tell me I need to meditate. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: No lectures, I promise. It’s just a routine check-up. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Fine. Hurry up, would you? I have grading to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 138/88. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. It could be due to stress, as you mentioned, or simply the fact that it's been a while since you had it checked. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good so far. Let’s check your pulse… Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, which is normal. I also want to take a look at your throat and ears… Can you open your mouth and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: Ah. Can we be done soon? This is… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks fine, no redness or swelling. And your ears look clear as well. Everything appears normal during the physical exam. Given your family history of heart problems and slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These will give us a better baseline understanding of your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and other important markers. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Really? More poking and prodding? Look, I don’t like needles. But… fine. If you have to. Just tell me it’s not going to take all day. And it's probably going to be expensive, isn't it? My insurance…
DOCTOR: It won't take long at all, just a few vials of blood. And we can check with your insurance to see what your out-of-pocket costs will be. Medicare should cover most of it, but it’s always best to confirm. I'm also going to order an EKG – an electrocardiogram – to check your heart’s electrical activity. It’s a quick, painless test. We just attach some stickers to your chest and it records your heart rhythm. While we wait for the results, I'd like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that can help lower your blood pressure and improve your overall health. Things like reducing stress, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise.
PATIENT: Exercise? Seriously? Look, I barely have time to sleep, let alone go for a run. And I already told you about the stress! It’s my job, okay? It’s stressful! I'm an engineering teacher. What do you expect? So, lifestyle modifications… that’s code for ‘you need to completely overhaul your life,’ isn’t it?
DOCTOR: No, not at all! It doesn't have to be a complete overhaul. Small changes can make a big difference. Maybe taking a few minutes each day to practice deep breathing exercises, or going for a short walk during your lunch break. We can work together to find things that fit into your lifestyle. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And can I get a copy of the results? I like to… research things myself. I'm not just going to blindly follow whatever you tell me, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You have every right to be involved in your healthcare, and I encourage you to do your own research. We'll make sure you get a copy of all your test results, and I'm happy to discuss them with you in detail at your follow-up appointment. I’ll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood. It will only take a few minutes. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No. That’s it. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get everything taken care of. Thank you for coming in today, Blain. .
