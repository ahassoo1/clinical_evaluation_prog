DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Norval is fine, please. Well, it's… I get full awful quick these days. Even with just a little bit of food. It's not like I'm eating a big meal or anything. Just a small plate and I feel stuffed. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And is this fullness accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. I don’t feel sick to my stomach, and I haven’t been throwing up. Just… full. And it kinda leaves me tired, I guess. Not like sick tired, just… worn out after eating. It’s just strange, ‘cause I used to have a good appetite. Always enjoyed a good meal.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how much weight have you lost, if any, over these past few weeks?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh, goodness. I haven’t really been keeping track, to be honest. My wife, Elsie, she’s the one who worries about things like that. I reckon maybe a little? I feel my pants are a bit looser, now that you mention it. But I don't know how much. Not a lot, though. It's not like I'm wasting away or anything.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in… well, you mean going to the bathroom? Now there's a question! Hmm… not really, no. Same as always, I suppose. Regular as clockwork, Elsie would say. No trouble there, thankfully. Is that important, Doctor? What does that have to do with feeling full so fast?
DOCTOR: It's important to rule out any underlying causes, Mr. Obarr. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. Well, I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. Other than that… not much, really. I’ve been a pretty healthy fella, all my life. Elsie always says I'm too stubborn to get sick. I haven’t got diabetes, that I know of. And my heart feels alright. Gets a bit tired climbing the stairs, but who doesn’t at my age? I’ve never been told I have any problems with it, though. No, I can't think of anything else. Nothing serious, anyway.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she lived to be 92, a strong woman. She didn’t have much trouble, as I recall. My father… he passed when he was in his 70s, something with his chest, but I don’t know the details. Didn’t talk about those things much in those days. And my sister, bless her soul, she had… arthritis, I think? In her hands, mostly. Nothing major, really. We weren't a family that was prone to sickness, if that makes sense. Not like some folks.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's discuss your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not me. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Elsie always said they were bad for you, and she was right about most things. And I don’t drink much, maybe a little bit of wine with dinner on special occasions. But not every night, and not a lot. And drugs? Goodness no. I’m an old man, Doctor, not a… well, you know. I’ve lived a good, clean life, mostly. A bit of fishing and carving is my idea of a good time.
DOCTOR: Do you take any medications, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Oh, that's right! Elsie reminded me just this morning. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, a tiny one. And another one for my arthritis, just when it’s acting up. But that’s it. Nothing fancy. A small dose of each, the doctor said. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, ‘cause we don't get much sun here. But that's just what the pharmacist recommended.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. I’m going to need to examine you now. Please, have a seat on the table. We’ll start with your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Hope I'm not too much trouble. Getting old ain’t for the faint of heart, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. Deep breaths. Blood pressure is… 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not alarming. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, but a slight murmur. Not new, I presume?
PATIENT: A murmur? Oh, yes, Doctor. I remember another doctor mentioning it years ago. Said it wasn’t anything to worry about, just an old man’s heart. Said it was common as dirt, you know. Never bothered me none. It just… is. You think it's related to me getting full so fast?
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No masses palpated. The murmur is unlikely to be directly related to your early satiety, Mr. Obarr, but it's something we should keep an eye on. Given your age, weight loss, and the change in appetite, I want to run some blood tests to rule out any underlying causes. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function, thyroid, and also a basic metabolic panel. I also want to check your Vitamin B12 levels.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests, eh? Been a while since I had those done. Is it something serious, you think? Not wanting to worry Elsie, you know. She gets anxious easy. Is it… cancer or something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, it’s far too early to jump to any conclusions. Many things can cause loss of appetite and early satiety. It could be something as simple as a decreased stomach capacity with age, or something more easily addressed. The blood tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and rule out more serious conditions. Worrying prematurely will only cause unnecessary anxiety. We’ll get the results back in a few days and discuss them thoroughly. In the meantime, try eating smaller, more frequent meals, and avoid foods that are high in fat or sugar. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood before you leave.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Smaller meals, you say. Elsie's always telling me to eat less. Maybe she's onto something. Alright. I trust your judgement. Just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? And try not to worry Elsie too much. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. What happens after the blood tests? Do I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to come back for a follow-up appointment once the results are available. The nurse will schedule that for you before you leave. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. Depending on the findings, we may need to order further tests, such as an endoscopy to examine your stomach, or a CT scan to rule out any structural abnormalities. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’ll start with the blood tests and see what they reveal. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, Doctor. You've been very thorough. I appreciate that. Endoscopy, you say? Sounds… unpleasant. But if that’s what it takes, I suppose I'll do it. I'm an old man, I've been through worse. Just hoping it’s nothing serious. Thank you again, Doctor Versace. I'll go find the nurse now.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will take good care of you. Satiety, weight loss, murmur. Rule out malignancy and structural causes. Please let the nurse know if you experience any new symptoms before your follow-up appointment. You’re dismissed, Mr. Obarr.
