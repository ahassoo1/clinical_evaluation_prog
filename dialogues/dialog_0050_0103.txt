DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you are 77 years of age. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, 77, that’s right. My back… it hurts. Low down, you know? Been hurting for… well, a while now. Not a new thing, but it’s worse lately. It makes it hard to… bend over, mostly. And sleep.
DOCTOR: I see. “Back pain, worsening.” And you say it interferes with bending and sleeping?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Bending is the worst. Like trying to pick something up off the floor… forget about it. And at night? Oof. Gotta move around a lot to get comfy, then it wakes me up again. It’s… tiring. I used to be able to do anything, you know? Not so much anymore.
DOCTOR: “Used to be able to do anything…” I understand. And when did you first notice this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe ten years ago? Just a little ache after gardening, nothing big. I ignored it, to be honest. Old man stuff, I thought. But it kept… creeping. Got worse each year. Now… well, now it’s a real problem. I think it was after I fell in the garden last spring, it really got bad. Didn't break anything, just a scare, but… something felt different after that.
DOCTOR: A fall last spring… that is pertinent information. And you've noticed a definite escalation of pain since that fall?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. Before the fall, it was just a little stiff in the morning, maybe a twinge if I lifted something heavy. After? Constant ache. And now… sharp pains sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to make me worry. And… my daughter, she keeps saying I’m shrinking. She’s a worrywart, but… she mentioned something about bones getting weak? I don’t know much about that.
DOCTOR: “Shrinking,” you say. And sharp pains, in addition to the constant ache. We'll need to investigate the possibility of vertebral compression fractures. It's not uncommon at your age, particularly after a fall. Now, besides the back pain, have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiating? You mean… going down my legs? Hmm… not really pain, exactly. Sometimes a little… tingling? Like pins and needles? In my feet, mostly. Not always, and it doesn’t last long. It's not a big deal, I thought it was just my circulation. I get cold feet easy. But you think it's… connected to the back?
DOCTOR: It could be. The tingling, or what's medically termed paresthesia, could indicate nerve compression. We'll need to assess that. Now, have you experienced any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. That’s a good question. I… I do get tired easier when I walk. Not like I can’t walk, but I need to stop and rest more than I used to. My daughter says I shuffle a bit when I walk, but she notices everything. I just thought I was… getting old, you know? Slower, weaker… it comes with the territory, doesn’t it? I haven’t fallen since last spring, but I feel less steady on my feet, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. A progressive decrease in stability and strength is concerning, and needs to be evaluated. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, let's briefly discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – arthritis, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, the doctor put me on a pill for it, but I don't take it anymore. He said I was okay after I lost some weight. Otherwise, just the usual old man aches and pains. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing major. And I definitely don’t have arthritis. My wife had that, terrible pain, this is… different. It’s more of a dull ache, mostly. Not like her sharp, stabbing pain. She used to say… oh, never mind. It’s just… different.
DOCTOR: “Different.” I understand. And you are no longer taking medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, sir. Stopped years ago. Doctor said it was under control with the diet. I used to walk a lot, kept me going. Not so much anymore with the back… makes it hard. Maybe I should start again? If I could just get this pain under control… it's frustrating, you know? I used to be a very active man. Helped with everything around the house, gardening, repairs… now I need my daughter to do everything. It's hard on both of us.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Vankampen. And you are correct, maintaining activity is important. But before we discuss a plan, let’s perform a brief physical examination. I need to assess your range of motion, reflexes, and check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Would you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. It's a bit of a struggle, to be honest, but I'll manage. Just need a moment. Don't want to fall again.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Take your time, Mr. Vankampen. No need to rush. I am here to assist you. Now, if you would please lie on your back, we will begin with a neurological assessment.
PATIENT: There… that’s a bit better. Neurological, you say? What does that involve? Just don't want to be surprised, Doctor. I don’t like surprises. Mostly just want this pain gone, if you know what I mean. It’s wearing me down.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Vankampen. A neurological assessment will help me determine if there is any nerve compression or damage contributing to your pain and tingling. It involves checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. First, I'm going to test your reflexes in your knees. Please keep your leg relaxed. "2+ bilaterally. Normal patellar reflexes."
