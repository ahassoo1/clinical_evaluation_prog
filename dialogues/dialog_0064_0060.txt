DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, it's probably nothing, honestly. My mother… she had a lot of health problems, and my aunt too. Just… a lot of worrying stuff. I want to make sure I don’t end up the same way, you know? I'd like some tests, I guess. Just to be safe.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's very sensible to be proactive, especially with family history being a concern. It’s always better to be safe. So, it sounds like you're not currently experiencing any specific symptoms, but you’re wanting a general check-up and some tests to rule things out?
PATIENT: Exactly. No aches, no pains, nothing like that. Just… preemptive. My mother always said, “Better to know than to be surprised.” She was… a very practical woman. I just want a baseline, I suppose. Something to compare to if… well, if something does start happening. And honestly? I’d feel a lot better just knowing everything’s okay.
DOCTOR: That’s a very wise approach, Blain. Your mother sounds like a very astute woman. We can definitely do that for you – establish a baseline and get some tests ordered. To help me get a good picture of your overall health, let's start with some questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing cricket, but that’s about it. No allergies that I know of. Standard vaccinations, I suppose. I… honestly can't remember all the specifics. It was a long time ago. I was never a sickly child. Probably why I’m so worried now, to be honest. Everything was always fine before.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No major illnesses or allergies is certainly a positive starting point. And it’s perfectly understandable to be more anxious when you’ve been healthy for so long. Let's talk about any medications you might be taking currently – even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements. Anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t really… take anything. I try to eat well, get enough sleep… you know, the basics. My ex-wife… she was always trying to get me to take vitamins. Said I wasn’t looking after myself. But I… I just didn’t bother. Waste of money, if you ask me. I'm perfectly healthy. Was perfectly healthy. Before all this worrying, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. That simplifies things. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history a bit more specifically, since you mentioned your mother and aunt had health problems. Do you know what those problems were?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, this is… complicated. My mother had… heart issues, I think. Something with the valves, maybe? She was in and out of the hospital a lot towards the end. And then… there was cancer. Not sure what kind. Lung cancer, probably? She smoked for a long time. My aunt… she had diabetes, really bad. Lost a foot, eventually. And… something with her kidneys, I think. It was all a bit of a blur, honestly. My father didn't really talk about it much. He just… dealt with it. Not very forthcoming, that man. It was a stressful time.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly difficult, Blain. It's understandable that it’s a blur when you were dealing with so much stress. Heart issues, cancer, and diabetes… those are all important things to note. And it’s common for families to not discuss these things openly. Knowing this family history is very helpful. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I… work. I'm an engineering teacher at the community college. Long hours, mostly indoors. I sit a lot. I used to play cricket regularly, but haven’t had the time lately. No kids, thankfully. Divorced, as you know. So, no family obligations like school runs or… anything. Mostly just work, and then I come home and… relax. Watch TV, read. Pretty boring, really. Definitely not very active. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I just want to understand your daily routines and habits. You've answered perfectly. It's good to know you’re working and enjoy reading. The lack of regular activity is something we can address. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline, as you mentioned. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. Honestly, I doubt anything’s wrong. But… fine. Just don't tell me I need to start running marathons, okay? I’m not that kind of person. I suppose it can’t hurt. But I’m warning you, I’m not a fan of doctors.
DOCTOR: I assure you, no marathons will be prescribed. We’ll just do a basic check of your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. It will be quick and painless. Just relax. Alright, let’s start with your height and weight. You mentioned your height earlier, but just to confirm… are you around 181 centimetres?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. 181, maybe a little less. I haven’t been measured in ages. And… what was that other thing you said? Weight? Ugh. Don't ask me that. I… I try not to think about it. It's probably not a number you want to hear. But… fine. Just get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We need the information for a complete picture, but we won't dwell on it. Alright, 60 kilograms. And your height is 180 centimetres. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. This might feel a little tight, but it won’t hurt. Just relax your arm and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Ugh. I hate this part. Always feels so… constricting. Okay, fine. Just… hurry up. I really don't like feeling like this. Is it normal that it feels so… pinched?
DOCTOR: It's normal to feel some pressure, Blain, but it shouldn’t be painful. I'm adjusting it now. Okay, your blood pressure is 120 over 80. That's within the normal range. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. In and out…
PATIENT: Okay… in and out… It’s… weird feeling someone listening to you like that. Are you hearing anything… bad? You're not frowning, are you? Just tell me if something’s wrong. I prefer honesty, even if it’s not good news. Don’t sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: No, I’m not frowning, Blain. It’s just a habit when concentrating. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good so far. Just to be thorough, and given your family history, I'd like to order some routine blood work. It will give us a better picture of your overall health, including cholesterol levels, kidney function, and blood sugar. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Good. That’s… reassuring. Blood work? Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. As long as it doesn’t involve needles the size of my arm, I guess. Is it going to be expensive? My insurance is… Medicare, I think. Will it cover everything? I really don’t want a huge bill.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair concern, Blain. We’ll keep it as minimal as possible, and Medicare usually covers most routine blood work. We’ll submit the claim for you, and our billing department will handle any necessary follow-up. The blood draw will be a standard procedure – just a small sample from your arm. It shouldn’t take long, and it's usually not very painful. While we're at it, I also recommend a basic urine sample. It's a quick and easy test that can provide additional information about your kidney function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Seriously? More samples? This is turning into a whole thing. Fine. Whatever. Just… where do I even do this? Is there a special room? I’d prefer not to be subjected to public scrutiny while… doing my business. This is ridiculous. But… fine. If you insist. Just tell me exactly what I need to do, and let’s get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can forget about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Blain. I assure you, we have a private bathroom specifically for collecting samples. You won't be subjected to any public scrutiny. I'll give you a collection cup and instructions. You simply need to collect a small sample of your urine and bring the cup back to me. It's really quite straightforward. Once we have the blood and urine samples, we’ll send them to the lab. The results usually take a few days to come back. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them in detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. A few days. Just… try not to scare me with bad news, okay? I’m already stressed enough. I'll go… do this thing. And then I hope we can actually discuss the results, not just get a list of things I need to worry about. Seriously, more samples. What a day.
DOCTOR: Alright, take your time. I'll be right here when you get back. And I assure you, we’ll discuss everything thoroughly and create a plan together, if necessary. .
