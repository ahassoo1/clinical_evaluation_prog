DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, I've been having a bit of a headache, right at the back of my head. Been going on for… let me see… about a week now, I’d say. Not a terrible one, but it’s just… there. Persistent, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A persistent headache can be quite bothersome, even if it's not severe. About a week, you said. Could you describe the headache a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a throbbing pain, not like a migraine. More of a… a dull ache. It feels like pressure, right at the base of my skull. Sometimes it goes down a little bit into my neck, but mostly back here. And it doesn’t really come and go, it’s just… constant. Like someone’s tightened a band around my head, but a loose one. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A constant, dull ache with pressure at the base of the skull, sometimes radiating into the neck. And it's been present for about a week. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse – certain activities, stress, or perhaps time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I don’t think anything specifically makes it worse, not that I've noticed. I do a bit of gardening, you know, mostly tending to my roses. Doesn't seem to bother it none. And I try to keep busy, so I guess I'm usually fairly active. Maybe when I'm really concentrating on something, like doing a particularly intricate nail design, it feels a little more intense, but that could just be me focusing on it, you know? It’s not like it stops me from doing things. Stress… well, who doesn’t have a bit of stress, eh? But nothing out of the ordinary lately.
DOCTOR: Right, gardening, nail designs, usual level of stress. Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No dizziness, no blurry vision, thankfully. No nausea or anything like that. And I haven’t felt feverish. I have been a little bit more tired than usual, maybe. Just a general feeling of being… run down. But I'm 87, Doctor! A little tiredness comes with the territory, doesn't it? My wife says I’ve been a bit more quiet too, but she says that when I’m concentrating on my work.
DOCTOR: That’s fair, a little tiredness is understandable. So, to recap: a week-long headache, dull ache at the base of the skull radiating into the neck, no associated dizziness, vision changes, or nausea. You've noticed some fatigue and your wife has observed increased quietness when concentrating. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I’ve been fairly lucky, all things considered. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago, but it was mild, and they put me on a little pill for it. Stopped taking it a while back, after a new doctor said it wasn't bothering me enough to warrant it. Otherwise… just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old, you know? No diabetes, no heart trouble, no major surgeries. I’ve always been a pretty active man, I think that helps. I’ve always eaten well too, my wife’s a wonderful cook.
DOCTOR: Excellent. So, a history of mild hypertension that was previously treated, but discontinued. And no other significant medical problems. Have you had any surgeries at all, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think really hard. Yes! When I was a young man, back in Jamaica, I had my appendix out. A simple one, nothing fancy. And… oh! And I had a mole removed from my back a few years ago, but that was just a little thing. The doctor said it wasn't anything to worry about. Other than that… nothing comes to mind. Just a few cuts and scrapes over the years, you know, life happens.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy in Jamaica and a mole removal. And no known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of, anyway. My wife always checks before I take anything new, just to be safe. She's a very cautious woman, and a good one. I can eat anything, I can drink anything, no hives, no swelling, nothing like that. I've never had a reaction to anything in my life, thankfully. That’s a blessing, isn't it? You hear about so many people with allergies these days.
DOCTOR: It certainly is a blessing. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like aspirin or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just a little vitamin D in the winter, Doctor. My wife says I don’t get enough sunshine. Otherwise… no, nothing at all. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. I prefer to eat well and get a good night’s sleep, you know? That usually does the trick. I don’t like the feeling of being dependent on anything, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just vitamin D occasionally. And finally, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical problems that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, cancer, dementia, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a bit of a tricky one, Doctor. My family wasn't much for keeping records, back in Jamaica. A lot of folks just… passed on naturally, you know? Old age, mostly. My mother lived to be 92, a very strong woman. My father… he passed on a little younger, maybe in his 70s, but he worked very hard all his life. I think there was an aunt who had some trouble with her heart, but I don't know the details. And… oh! My sister, she developed some memory problems towards the end of her life, but I don't know if it was dementia or just old age. It’s hard to say, really. We didn't have much access to good medical care back then. It's all a bit vague, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for family history to be vague, especially if it's from a long time ago. So, to summarize, a history of longevity in your family, with your mother living to 92. Some possible heart trouble in an aunt and potential memory problems in your sister. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and reflexes, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I’ve got nothing to hide! I always trust a good doctor to do their job. I'm used to check-ups. Go ahead and do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’ll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 142 over 88. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are good, regular, and lungs are clear. Now, I’ll just take a look in your ears and throat. Ears and throat look good as well. I’ll quickly check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything appears within normal limits, though your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Now, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing a tension headache, likely related to stress or muscle tension. It doesn’t seem to be anything serious, but we should monitor it.
PATIENT: A tension headache, you say? That sounds about right, I suppose. I do tend to carry a lot of stress in my shoulders. And I do work with my hands a lot, doing nails, you know. Maybe that's it. So, no need to worry then? What do you suggest I do about it? Anything I can take? Or is there something else I should be looking out for? I'm not a fan of taking pills if I can avoid it, as you know. Perhaps some exercises? A warm bath? What are your thoughts, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound like anything serious at all. I agree, given your occupation and reported stress, tension headache is the most likely culprit. You’re right to avoid medication if possible. Let's start with some conservative measures. A warm bath with Epsom salts can help relax your muscles. Gentle neck stretches and shoulder rolls can also be beneficial. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen are options if the pain becomes severe, but I wouldn't take them regularly. Staying well-hydrated and getting adequate sleep are also important. What I'm most concerned about is the slightly elevated blood pressure. While a single reading isn't definitive, it's worth monitoring at home. I can provide you with a blood pressure log and instructions on how to take accurate readings. If your blood pressure consistently remains elevated, we may need to consider a low-sodium diet or, in rare cases, medication. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: A blood pressure log, you say? Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I can certainly do that. My wife is very good with numbers, she can help me keep track of it. And she makes sure I eat right, most of the time! So, warm baths, stretches, and keep an eye on the blood pressure. No need to panic just yet, then? What sort of reading should I be concerned about? And how often should I be taking it? I don't want to bother you unnecessarily, you know. And just to be clear, there’s no need for any scans or anything like that, is there? You don’t think anything more serious is going on? I just like to be sure, you know, at my age.
DOCTOR: No, no scans are needed at this time. Based on everything we've discussed, your symptoms and exam findings don't indicate anything more serious. I understand your concern, especially given your age, and it's good that you're proactive about your health. For the blood pressure, aim to take it twice a day – once in the morning and once in the evening – for a week. Write down the readings and bring the log with you to your next appointment. Readings consistently above 140/90 mmHg would warrant further investigation, but don't panic if you get a high reading occasionally. Stress and activity can temporarily elevate blood pressure. We’re looking for a pattern. If you experience any new symptoms – such as vision changes, severe headache, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking – please contact me immediately. But for now, let's focus on managing the tension headache with conservative measures and monitoring your blood pressure. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds like a very sensible plan. Twice a day, keep track of the readings, and focus on relaxing and taking care of myself. And contact you if anything changes. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explaining everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns, even though it’s “just” a headache. I think that’s everything. I’ll take the blood pressure log and get started. Thank you again, Doctor Panjoj. You’re a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. It’s my pleasure. Remember, I'm here if you need anything. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Here's the blood pressure log and a pamphlet with some additional information on managing tension headaches. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you at your next appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too. And I will! .
