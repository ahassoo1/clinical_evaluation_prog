DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's get this over with. It's this…stuff. Coming up. Reflux, I think the lady on the phone called it. It’s quite unpleasant, you understand. And frankly, I haven’t got time for unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: Reflux, alright. And you’re experiencing this… “stuff” coming up, as you put it. Can you describe that for me a little more precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely? Honestly, Doctor, are you serious? It tastes…sour. Like vinegar, almost. And it burns. It burns going up, and it burns coming down. Is that precise enough for you? I'm a busy man, I don’t spend my time analyzing every little detail of my…digestive processes. It happens after I eat, usually. Big meals. Good meals. It's a trade-off, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Sour, burning sensation after meals. Alright. And how often would you say this happens, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Oh, it depends. If I have a proper Polish feast – kielbasa, pierogi, the works – then pretty much every time. Maybe not every time, but close. If I just have a…light snack, then not so much. Though frankly, what's the point of eating if you can't enjoy it? It’s usually after dinner, though. Definitely dinner. I suppose sometimes lunch, if it’s a substantial one. Look, is this going somewhere? I've got a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It is going somewhere, Mr. Altine, but I need a clearer picture. You mentioned big meals trigger it. Can you describe a typical meal that brings this on?
PATIENT: A typical meal? Honestly. Alright, fine. Let's say…roast pork, mashed potatoes with plenty of butter, gravy, a side of sauerkraut, and maybe some good rye bread. And a nice gravy. Not skimpy, you understand. And a large portion. A proper portion. And maybe a beer or two. Is that detailed enough for you? I eat like a man, not a…bird. And it usually happens within an hour or so after. It's not rocket science, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, rich, fatty foods, large portions, and alcohol. Do you experience any other symptoms along with this—chest pain, difficulty swallowing, a feeling of something stuck in your throat, perhaps?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. I'm not a weakling. Difficulty swallowing…no, not really. It just…comes up. It’s unpleasant, but I haven't felt like I'm choking or anything dramatic like that. A feeling of something stuck…well, sometimes, maybe a bit. Like a fullness, I suppose. But it's probably just the portion size. Honestly, I’ve been eating this way for sixty years. It's a bit late to start worrying about it now, isn’t it? Are you going to give me something for it, or are we just going to catalogue my eating habits all day?
DOCTOR: We need to rule out anything serious, Mr. Altine. Just because you’ve been eating this way for sixty years doesn’t mean it’s not potentially causing a problem now. Let's go through some basic medical questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m a sturdy Polish man. I don’t have allergies. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years. Painkillers, antibiotics…you name it. I’m not some delicate flower. Though, I did once have a reaction to a mosquito bite. But that doesn’t count. Look, I really must get going soon. This is taking up my valuable time. Are you going to prescribe something or not? I’m not here to be interrogated, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And you’re currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Old age, you know. Gotta keep the body going. Nothing else. And frankly, I doubt a multivitamin is causing me to regurgitate my dinner. It’s the kielbasa, Doctor, not the vitamins. I’m telling you, it’s a good Polish diet. It’s what keeps a man strong. Don't try to tell me I need to change it. I'm not interested. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Let’s proceed with a quick physical exam. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll palpate your abdomen. It will just take a few minutes. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I'll need to listen to your chest.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't expect miracles. I'm a healthy man, despite what my stomach might be telling you. And don't take too long. This is undignified. Just hurry it up, please. I've got important things to do.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the epigastric region. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Mild epigastric tenderness. Alright. It sounds like you likely have some degree of acid reflux, or GERD, as we call it. The tenderness suggests some irritation of the esophagus. Given your history, it’s quite common. We can start with some lifestyle modifications and medication.
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? Medication? What modifications? Am I supposed to stop enjoying my food? And medication… what kind of medication? Will it make me sleepy? I’ve got a meeting, Doctor. A very important meeting. I don't have time for side effects. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’ve lived a good life eating what I enjoy. Can’t you just give me something to stop the…burning? Something quick and simple? No lectures, please. Just a solution.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. We can try a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. It reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces. It's generally well-tolerated, but fatigue is a possible side effect in some patients. We'll start with a low dose. I'm going to prescribe Omeprazole, 20mg, once daily, before breakfast. And I strongly recommend avoiding large, fatty meals, especially before bed. Also, try elevating the head of your bed a few inches. I’ll also provide you with a handout detailing lifestyle modifications for GERD. It’s not about stopping you from enjoying your food entirely, but making some sensible choices. We can revisit this if the medication isn’t effective, or if you experience any significant side effects. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just give me the prescription. And the handout. I'll glance at it later. Honestly, this is all rather… unnecessary. But fine. Give me the paper. And tell me, how long before this…pill works? I’ve got a dinner engagement on Friday. A very important dinner engagement. I can’t have this happening again. Let’s just get this over with. I’m a busy man, you know.
DOCTOR: The medication usually takes a few days to reach its full effect. You should start to see some improvement within a week. If it doesn't improve after two weeks, or if your symptoms worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. I’m going to advise that if you experience any difficulty swallowing, chest pain, or black, tarry stools, you go to the emergency room immediately. Those are signs of a more serious problem. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Black stools. Chest pain. I got it. Honestly, you're painting a dreadful picture. Look, I understand. I’m not an idiot. I’ll see a doctor if something terrible happens. Can I go now? I really must be going. This has taken far too long. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. Please take care of yourself. And try to follow those recommendations. .
