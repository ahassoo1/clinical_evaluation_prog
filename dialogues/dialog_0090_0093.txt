DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, good morning. It's... sleep, mostly. And, well, I guess getting back into shape. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. Been a while since I really focused on things. Not that it matters much anymore, but… yeah. Sleep and feeling less like an old man. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: “Less like an old man,” you say?
PATIENT: Well, you wouldn’t understand. You look… energetic. I used to be able to, you know, do things. Lift things. Play for hours. Now? A bit of tuning and I’m knackered for the rest of the day. It's not a glamorous life, fiddling with violins all day, believe me. You wouldn’t catch you doing it.
DOCTOR: Right. So, let's try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? Look, I sleep… okay, I suppose. But not well. I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all. And then I'm tired all day. It’s just… a general feeling of being worn out, you know? I don't even remember the last time I had a proper eight hours. Does that count as specific enough for you? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: “Proper” is subjective, Mr. Redfern. When you say “worn out,” can you describe that?
PATIENT: Oh, you doctors and your… descriptions. Fine. It’s like… everything takes effort. Getting out of bed. Walking to the workshop. Even thinking feels exhausting. It's not pain, exactly. More like… a heavy weight. A constant drag. You wouldn’t get it unless you spent your life hunched over tiny bits of wood and string. It’s… delicate work. Requires concentration. And now, it just feels… harder. Is that descriptive enough for your charts?
DOCTOR: Fatigue, impacting daily activities. Let's move on. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Honestly, I couldn’t tell you. It sort of… crept up on me. After… well, after everything. It feels like years, at least. Maybe a year? Two? It's all a bit of a blur, like I said. I really don’t pay attention to dates, or… time, really. It just sort of… is. Does it matter? I'm tired now. That's the important part.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Redfern. Gradual onset suggests one thing, sudden onset another. Have there been any changes in your life recently, aside from what you've mentioned?
PATIENT: Changes? What changes could there be? I repair instruments. I eat. I sleep… poorly. It’s not exactly a thrilling existence. Look, I told you, everything changed after… never mind. It’s not relevant. Nothing happens in my life. I don’t go on holidays, I don’t have… friends, really. I just… exist. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to dissect my life story? I came here for sleep, not a therapy session.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s focus on the sleep then. Do you have any difficulty falling asleep, or is it staying asleep that’s the problem?
PATIENT: Both, I suppose. Sometimes I lie there for ages, just… thinking. Other times I nod off alright, but wake up a few hours later and can't get back to sleep. It’s always something. A noise. A thought. Just… being awake. And then I'm staring at the ceiling for hours. It’s incredibly irritating, to be honest. And then I just feel… worse. Is that helpful? I don’t know why I even bother explaining. You doctors always want specifics, and it’s just… a mess.
DOCTOR: Do you snore, Mr. Redfern?
PATIENT: Snore? Good heavens, no. I wouldn’t dream of snoring. It’s terribly uncouth. Besides, I live alone. Who would hear me? And even if I did, I highly doubt it’s anything worth mentioning. It's probably just… breathing. People breathe, you know. It’s a perfectly normal function. Honestly, you ask the strangest questions. Is this standard procedure?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? Look, I eat. I don’t bother with fancy meals or… health fads. I get a sandwich for lunch, something simple for dinner. Maybe a bit of fruit if it’s in season. I'm not a complicated man, Doctor. I need fuel to repair violins, not a five-course meal. It’s probably perfectly adequate. Though, admittedly, I haven’t been cooking much lately. It’s just… easier to grab something. Does it really matter what I eat? I'm tired, not… obese.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol, Mr. Redfern?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive, believe me. I don't need a crutch. It's… relaxing. Helps me switch off, I suppose. Though it doesn't seem to make much difference to the sleep, honestly. It's not like I'm drowning my sorrows or anything. Just a civilized beverage. Is everyone going to interrogate me about my personal habits? This is rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke, Mr. Redfern?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not! Good heavens, no. Disgusting habit. Filthy. I wouldn’t dream of it. I have… sensitivities. It’s bad for the instruments, you know. Dust. Resin. Smoke. All terrible. I take good care of my workshop, and my lungs, thank you very much. Really, Doctor, what are these questions? This is starting to feel like an accusation.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long time ago. I had… something. A bit of a cough, when I was younger. Nothing serious, I assure you. The doctor gave me some pills. I can’t remember what for. It cleared up on its own, eventually. And… well, after everything, I had a few check-ups, but… honestly, it’s all a blur. They said I was… stressed. Is that a medical condition? I don’t bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. They never seem to actually fix anything. It’s all just… pills and platitudes. Can we just get on with this? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries, Mr. Redfern?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. There was… something after everything. A small procedure, I believe. To… repair some damage. Honestly, it’s all very hazy. It was a long time ago, and I try not to dwell on it. I don’t remember the details. It wasn’t… major. A few stitches, perhaps. They didn’t tell me much. It’s all a bit of a blur, as I’ve said repeatedly. I doubt it’s relevant to my sleep. Honestly, you're asking a lot of questions about things I barely remember. This is rather… distressing, you know. I just want to feel rested. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, Doctor. It’s… complicated. My father… wasn’t around much. And my mother… well, she passed away a long time ago. I wasn’t close to either of them, to be perfectly frank. I don’t know anything about their medical conditions. They weren’t the type to discuss such things. I doubt it’s relevant. Really, I’m a bit of a lone wolf. I don’t have much in the way of… family ties. Is that a satisfactory answer? Honestly, this is getting rather personal. I came here for sleep, not a genealogical investigation.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's skip that then. Do you take any medications currently, Mr. Redfern?
PATIENT: Just… a few things for my nerves. Doctor gave them to me a while back. Helps me… calm down. Though they don’t seem to be doing much good lately. Can't remember the name. Small white pills. I take them before bed, sometimes. Or, well, when I remember. Honestly, I’m not very good with names or schedules. It's all a bit of a blur, as you know. They don’t seem to be helping the sleep, so I don’t bother much anymore. Is that helpful? This is rather pointless, isn’t it? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Really? Must we? I suppose… if you insist. It’s all rather undignified, isn’t it? But… fine. Lead the way. Though I warn you, I’m not very flexible these days. It’s probably a waste of your time, honestly. But… here we go. Just try not to poke too much. And be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your back, arms at your sides. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… Good. Heart rate is slightly elevated, 88 beats per minute. Lungs sound clear, but there’s some mild wheezing on expiration. Any pain here?
PATIENT: A little. Not… sharp, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. It’s always a bit tender, to be honest. I hunch over a lot, you see. Repairing instruments. Tiny screws, delicate wood… it’s not exactly a comfortable position. And… well, it’s been a bit upset lately. I haven’t been eating properly. Stress, I suppose. It’s probably just indigestion. Nothing to worry about. Really. It’s always been a bit sensitive. You’re poking quite hard, Doctor. Be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Extend your leg. Good. Reflexes are normal, 2+ bilaterally. No edema. Alright. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We also need to rule out sleep apnea, so I'm going to refer you to a sleep specialist for a study.
PATIENT: Tests? A specialist? Oh, goodness. Really? Must we? It sounds… complicated. And expensive, I imagine. I just wanted a few tips on getting a good night’s sleep, not a full medical investigation. I suppose… if you insist. But I warn you, I’m not very good with all this… medical stuff. And I don’t have a lot of time. I have instruments to repair, you know. Is there… anything else? Or can we just get on with it? I just want to feel normal again. It’s all very… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, while I understand your frustration, we need to investigate the cause of your fatigue and sleep problems. The tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. The referral to the sleep specialist is important to determine if you have sleep apnea, which can significantly impact your health. I’m also going to prescribe a low-dose melatonin supplement to help regulate your sleep cycle. Start with 3mg one hour before bedtime. We will review the test results and discuss a treatment plan at your follow-up appointment in two weeks. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? No, I don't think so. It all sounds… very complicated. Melatonin… right. 3mg. Before bed. I’ll try to remember. Honestly, I doubt it will make much difference. But… fine. I'll give it a try. Two weeks, you said? I suppose I'll have to make time. Instruments will have to wait, I guess. Is there anything else I need to know? Or can I just… go now? I'm feeling rather overwhelmed, to be honest. Just… give me the prescription. And the referral information. And… please, no more tests, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the prescription for the melatonin, and the information for Dr. Anya Sharma, the sleep specialist. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Mr. Redfern, I understand your reluctance, but it’s important to prioritize your health. If your symptoms worsen before your follow-up appointment, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I don't think so. Just… thank you. I suppose. It's all rather… a lot to take in. I'll try to remember everything. The melatonin… Dr. Sharma… the tests… Honestly, I'm not very optimistic. But… I'll try. Thank you again. And… good day. .
