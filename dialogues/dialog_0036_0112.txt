DOCTOR: Good morning, Keoni. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, certainly. It’s just… frequent, you know? I’m not sure if that makes sense. It’s been going on for a little while now, but it’s starting to become a bit disruptive.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Keoni, and you shouldn’t be embarrassed at all. It's good you're bringing this to my attention. Frequent urination can have a lot of different causes, so we'll figure out what's going on. When you say "quite a lot," could you give me a rough idea of how often you're going to the bathroom during the day?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It’s difficult to say precisely. I suppose… normally, I’d go maybe four or five times throughout the day? But now… it feels like every couple of hours, at least. Perhaps more. I really haven’t been keeping track, I’m afraid. It’s just… noticeable. And sometimes at night, too, which is… inconvenient. I apologize for being so vague. It’s hard to quantify, you know?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Keoni. It is hard to quantify. Every couple of hours, and waking you at night – that’s helpful information. Do you feel like you have to rush to the bathroom when you feel the urge, or is it more of a gradual feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… usually a gradual feeling, I think. Not a sudden, desperate need, thankfully. It builds slowly. But it is quite insistent, once it starts. I wouldn’t say I’m doubling over or anything, but I certainly can’t ignore it for long. I do tend to plan my outings around knowing where the restrooms are, just in case. Perhaps that sounds silly.
DOCTOR: That doesn’t sound silly at all, Keoni. It’s very practical! Okay, gradual onset, insistent urge, planning around restrooms… good. Now, when you are in the bathroom, is it difficult to actually go?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. It’s not… blocked, exactly. It’s just… sometimes the stream is a little weak. And sometimes it takes a moment to start. Not every time, though. It’s rather inconsistent, honestly. There’s no pain, thankfully. Just… not always a strong, steady flow. I hope that doesn’t sound strange.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. Weak stream, hesitancy… those are important details. And no pain is good to know. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I don’t believe so. It seems… normal, as far as I can tell. I haven’t really paid much attention, if I’m honest. It looks clear, I suppose. And I don’t recall any unusual odor. Though… I did have a bit of a cold a few weeks ago. Could that have something to do with it? I’m not sure if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Keoni, so thank you for mentioning that. Sometimes a cold can cause temporary urinary changes. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, urinary tract infections, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… that’s a tricky question. I had… a bout of bronchitis when I was younger, I think. And I broke my wrist once, years ago. But as for any diagnosed conditions… not that I recall. I haven't really been to the doctor much over the years, truthfully. I try to stay healthy, and usually things just… resolve on their own. I apologize for being so vague again. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Keoni. It's perfectly alright. We'll piece things together. No history of diabetes or UTIs is good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, I don't believe so. Nothing major, at least. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago. And… oh, I had a wisdom tooth removed once. But beyond that… no. No surgeries that I can recall. I’m quite thankful for that, actually. I don’t handle medical procedures very well.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like diabetes, kidney problems, or bladder issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some heart problems when he was older. As for anything specific like kidney or bladder issues… not that I’m aware of. My family wasn't really one for talking about medical things, if I’m honest. It was… considered a bit private. I’m afraid I’m not much help on that front. My memory is so patchy.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Keoni. High blood pressure and heart problems are good to know. Okay, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I find it quite unpleasant, actually. My mother smoked when I was a child, and I absolutely hated the smell. It’s one habit I’ve always avoided.
DOCTOR: Good. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Perhaps one or two times a week. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I wouldn't say I drink heavily. Just a little something to relax with. It's more of a social thing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not regularly. I take a multivitamin every now and then, but that’s about it. And I sometimes take ibuprofen for headaches, but it’s not a frequent thing. I try to avoid medications whenever possible, if I can. Oh! And I do use a topical cream for my hands, because they get dry in the winter. But that's it, I think. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, just a multivitamin occasionally, ibuprofen as needed, and a hand cream. Alright Keoni, based on what you've told me, we need to rule out a few things. Your symptoms – frequent urination, gradual onset, no pain, weak stream – could be caused by a variety of factors, including a urinary tract infection, diabetes, or even just changes in your fluid intake. I’d like to do a quick physical exam and then order a urinalysis and a blood glucose test to start. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I understand. If that's what's needed to figure out what's going on, then yes, absolutely. A physical exam and those tests… whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle? I’m not very good with medical things, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Of course, Keoni. I’ll be as gentle as possible. If you could just change into this gown, we’ll start with listening to your abdomen and then a quick neurological check. It’s pretty straightforward. I’ll explain everything as I go. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Neurological check? Is that… necessary? I haven’t noticed anything different about my… well, anything. But if you think it’s important… No, perhaps not. I trust your judgment. It’s just… I’m always a little nervous in these situations. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Take your time. And don’t hesitate to let me know if you’re uncomfortable at any point. Alright Keoni, if you could lie back on the table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope first. It might be a little cold. Good. Your abdomen sounds normal. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Could you cross your legs for me?
PATIENT: Is that… normal? That sounds normal, right? It doesn't sound… bad? I apologize for being such a worrywart. I just… I always get anxious in these situations.
DOCTOR: It is normal to be anxious, Keoni. And everything sounds normal so far. I'm just checking your reflexes to see if there’s any neurological component to your symptoms. Good. Those reflexes are normal as well. Now, I'm just going to do a quick neurological exam – checking your strength and coordination. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that enough pressure? I don’t want to hurt you. I have a surprisingly weak grip, sometimes. My husband used to tease me about it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Keoni. Just the right amount of pressure. Your strength is good. Now, can you wiggle your toes?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that okay? It feels a little… strange, wiggling my toes on command. I haven't wiggled my toes on command since I was a child, probably. My husband used to ask me to do silly things like that. It’s… it’s silly, isn't it? I apologize for rambling.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Keoni. It's perfectly normal to feel a little strange in these situations, and it's okay to talk about whatever's on your mind. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems normal so far, which is good. Now, we just need to get those urine and blood samples. Do you have a preference for where you'd like to go to provide a urine sample?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. Oh, um… the restroom, I suppose? Is there a specific one I should use? I just… I prefer privacy, if that’s possible. It's a little embarrassing, you see. I apologize for being so… delicate.
DOCTOR: Of course, Keoni. Absolutely. The restroom right down the hall is private. I’ll give you a cup and instructions, and I’ll be right here when you're finished. Take your time. And don’t hesitate to let me know if you need anything at all. Here you go. Just follow these instructions, and I’ll be waiting outside.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… be right back.
