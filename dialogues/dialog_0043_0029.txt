DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… eating thing. I just don’t seem to get hungry anymore, or… I get full awful fast. It's been going on for a few months now, and it's a bit worrying, to be honest. I used to love a good meal, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Obarr. That certainly sounds concerning, and it’s good you’re addressing it. A change in appetite like that, especially over a few months, is worth investigating. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… hard to explain exactly. Like, I can start eating, and everything tastes fine, you know? But after just a few bites – not even a full plateful – I feel… stuffed. Like I ate a huge dinner, even if it’s just breakfast. And it’s not a sick feeling, not exactly. Just… full. It happens with most things, I guess. Not always, but mostly. My wife makes a lovely salmon chowder, and I used to be able to eat a big bowl… now I can manage just a few spoonfuls. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s not nausea or discomfort during eating, but rather a feeling of fullness that comes on quickly and with relatively little food. And it’s been impacting your enjoyment of foods you previously liked, like your wife's salmon chowder. That’s very helpful to know. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Well, let's see… Usually, I wake up and have a bit of toast with some tea. Maybe an egg if my wife’s feeling generous. But like I said, I don't eat much of it anymore. Just a bite or two. Then, lunch is usually a sandwich, something simple. Again, not much. I try to eat something, you know? Don’t want to just waste away. And supper… well, that's the worst. My wife makes good meals, but I just can’t get through them like I used to. A few bites of whatever it is, and I'm done. I usually drink a lot of tea throughout the day, though. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Obarr. It sounds like you are consciously trying to eat, which is good, but the volume you’re able to consume is quite limited. And you've mentioned drinking a lot of tea – thank you for sharing that detail. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My wife keeps saying I'm looking a bit thinner, but I haven't been weighing myself. I suppose I have lost a bit around the middle, but I figured that was just getting old, you know? I haven’t been trying to lose weight, that’s for sure. I wouldn’t say it’s a drastic amount, but… yeah, I think she's right. A few pounds, maybe. It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information, Mr. Obarr. Even a small amount of unintentional weight loss, coupled with the decreased appetite, is something we need to investigate. Now, thinking about other symptoms, have you experienced any difficulty swallowing, heartburn, or any abdominal pain alongside this change in appetite?
PATIENT: No, not really. Swallowing is fine. No trouble there. Sometimes a bit of heartburn, but I get that now and then anyway, always have. Nothing worse than usual. And no pain, no. Just… full. It's the full feeling that's the bother. It’s not a bad feeling, just… inconvenient. And worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Obarr. It's good to hear that you haven’t experienced any difficulty swallowing or abdominal pain. The occasional heartburn is also reassuring. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure years ago, but it's been under control for a long time now, with some pills the doctor gave me. Other than that… not much, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. I’ve never been a sickly man, if that makes sense. My wife always said I was built like a Haida war canoe – strong and sturdy. Though maybe the canoe is starting to leak a bit these days.
DOCTOR: That's a wonderful image, Mr. Obarr. And it's good to know you’ve generally been a healthy man. So, you've been treated for high blood pressure in the past, and it's currently well-controlled with medication. Could you tell me the name of that medication, if you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife handles all the pills, mostly. I just take them when she tells me to. I think it’s… Lisinopril? Is that right? It’s a little white pill, that's all I really know. I’m not good with names, never have been. She keeps a list, though, if you need to know for sure. She’s very organized, my wife.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Obarr. Lisinopril is a common medication for high blood pressure, and that's very helpful to know. We can verify that with your wife’s list later. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, not any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. Broke my arm once when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but they just put it in a cast. Nothing fancy. I've always been lucky, I guess. Never been one for hospitals, if I could help it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Obarr. No surgeries in your history. Now, thinking about your family, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or digestive problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother lived to be a good age, but I don’t really remember her having any serious illnesses. My father… he had some trouble with his heart, I think. But that was a long time ago. And my sister… she had some stomach problems, but I don’t know what kind. We weren’t very close, my sister and I. It’s hard to say, really. Not much history of anything serious, as far as I know. We didn’t talk about those things much, back in my day.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Obarr. It’s common for family medical histories not to be well-documented. Knowing about your father’s heart trouble is helpful, though. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I'm retired now, used to work in communications, mostly radio stuff. I don’t do much these days, mostly just sit around and read. I like to walk a bit, when the weather’s nice. Used to do a lot of fishing, but it's hard to get out there on my own these days. I don’t smoke, never have. Drink a bit of tea, as I said. Not much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with supper now and then. I try to eat healthy, but… well, you know. It’s hard when you don’t have much appetite.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mr. Obarr. So, you're retired, enjoy reading and walking when you can, and maintain a generally healthy lifestyle despite the decreased appetite. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with allergies. My wife always checks when she gives me pills, though. She’s very careful. I've eaten just about everything over the years, and never had a reaction.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Obarr. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk about any medications you’re currently taking. You mentioned Lisinopril for blood pressure. Are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just the Lisinopril, Doctor. That’s it. And sometimes, when my joints are acting up, my wife gives me some Tylenol, but that's just now and then. Nothing regular, just the blood pressure pills. I keep things simple, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Obarr. So, just Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional Tylenol for joint pain. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. It's probably just old age catching up with me, but it's good to check things out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. If you could just take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Your heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly are appreciated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Everything appears within normal limits on initial examination, Mr. Obarr. However, given your decreased appetite, unintentional weight loss, and the feeling of fullness after only a small amount of food, I would like to order some blood work and a stool test. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing these symptoms. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that's what you think is best, then go ahead. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what's going on, and get back to enjoying my wife’s cooking, if I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Obarr. I will order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a fecal occult blood test . The FOBT checks for any hidden blood in your stool, which can be a sign of gastrointestinal issues. The lab results should be available in a few days. I will have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or significant weight loss, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. Just… thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure out what might be going on. I’ll wait for the results and get in touch with your nurse to schedule that follow-up.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help. It’s important to address these concerns, and we’ll work together to find the cause and get you feeling better. My nurse, Sarah, is excellent and will be in touch soon to schedule that follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, Mr. Obarr, and please give my best to your wife.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I’m sure she’d appreciate that. You have a good day too.
