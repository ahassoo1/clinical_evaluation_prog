DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor... Duplichan, yes? Hmm. Well, it’s… a check-up, I think. New to the area, you see. Medicare said I needed to find a doctor. Something about… social healthcare? Honestly, I don't really follow all this paperwork. It's all very confusing. I just want to make sure everything is… working. You know. Old man problems, probably.
DOCTOR: Right. A general check-up. Perfectly understandable. Medicare does have a lot of… procedures. I see you’re new to the area, arrived just last month. And you're 58 years old. Let's just go through a bit of a history, just to get a baseline. “Old man problems” is a bit vague, of course. Can you be a little more specific about what you're experiencing, or what concerns you have?
PATIENT: Concerns? Oh… well, my back, sometimes. A little stiff. But I've always had a bad back, from all the… bending over. I do makeup, you see. For the theatre. Lots of bending. And maybe… forgetting things? Small things, mostly. Like where I put my glasses. Which is… ironic, isn't it?
DOCTOR: So, back stiffness related to your profession – makeup artistry for the theatre, involving a lot of bending – and some difficulty with recall. "Small things," you said. Could you give me an example of what you mean by 'small things'?
PATIENT: Hmm… like yesterday, I went to the shop for… what was it now? Oh, bread! Yes, bread. And I came back with… potatoes. Not bread. Potatoes! My neighbor, Mrs. Petrova, she laughed. She said I was losing my mind. Probably right, she’s a sensible woman. It happens more often now, little things like that. Not… important things, mind you. Just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Right. Misremembering items when shopping. And this is a relatively new development?
PATIENT: New? Hmm... it's hard to say. It feels like... a while now. Maybe six months? A year? Time goes so quickly, you know. It wasn't always like this. I used to remember everything, for the actors. Lines, colours… everything! Now… now I have to write things down. It’s a bother, really. Makes me feel… old.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, memory lapses developing over the past six to twelve months. Primarily affecting recall of recent events, like grocery items. No difficulty recalling information related to your profession, specifically lines or colors?
PATIENT: No, no! The work, that's fine. I still know my reds from my blues, my shadows from my highlights. The actors would never forgive me if I messed that up! It’s just… everyday things. What I had for breakfast, if I locked the door… things like that. Important things, really, if you think about it. But not… professional things.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it seems to be primarily affecting your everyday memory, not your procedural memory – the skills related to your profession. Now, let's move on to some other areas. Do you have any history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Medical problems… Oh, let me think. I had my appendix out, many years ago. When I was a young man. And my blood pressure, the doctor always says it’s a little high. But nothing serious. Just… old man things, again. No, nothing serious. I’ve always been strong. Worked hard, you see. Never sat still.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hypertension. Are you currently taking any medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medication…? Yes, I think so. Little white pills. I take them every morning. Or… most mornings. Sometimes I forget, if I’m busy. My daughter, Svetlana, she reminds me. She worries too much, that girl. But a good girl, a very good girl. She keeps track of everything for me, the pills and… things.
DOCTOR: So, you take medication for hypertension, but sometimes miss doses. Do you know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Name…? No. No, I don't. Something long, I think. Svetlana orders it for me, you see. She has a pharmacy she trusts. I just take the pills. They’re little and white. And… they sometimes make me feel a bit… dizzy, if I stand up too fast.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will need to get a list of your current medications. We can request a record from your pharmacy, with your consent of course. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. No, not that I know of. I had a rash once, when I was a boy, but I don't remember what caused it. Probably just a bug bite, or something. No, no allergies. I’ve always been quite healthy, despite the bending and the forgetting.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Filthy habit. My wife… she used to smoke, before she left. Nasty smell. Drink… I like a little vodka, sometimes. With my dinner. Nothing excessive, you understand. Just… to relax. And drugs? Absolutely not! I am a respectable man! A makeup artist!
DOCTOR: Right. Occasional vodka consumption. And your wife… she passed away?
PATIENT: Passed away? Yes. A long time ago. Ten years, maybe more. Left me for a… a younger man. A dancer, can you believe it? But… she passed away a few years later. Sad, really. But… we didn't speak after she left.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you currently live alone?
PATIENT: Yes. Alone. In that little apartment by the park. It's quiet, mostly. Svetlana visits sometimes, with the grandchildren. But mostly… it’s just me. And the memories, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Szmyd. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. It will include checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Neurological…? Hmm. Sounds… complicated. But… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have to… prepare for the actors, you see. They’re very demanding. But yes, go ahead. Check what you need to check.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit here, we'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 85. Not drastically high, but something we need to monitor. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply for me. Your heart rate is regular, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I can see it. It’s… a little blurry, sometimes. Especially when I stand up quickly. Like I said, Svetlana says I get dizzy. Old man things, you know? Everything feels… a little wobbly. But I’m following it. Yes, yes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you please stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Whoa… there we go. Steady… steady. Yes. A little dizzy, a bit. See? Svetlana was right. Everything’s a bit… swimmy. Old age, I tell you. It’s a terrible thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Please sit down. That's enough for now. Based on what you've told me and my brief examination, it appears we need to investigate your memory lapses and dizziness further. Your blood pressure is also something we should manage. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I also want to schedule an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems.
PATIENT: MRI…? Now wait a minute. An MRI… isn't that… one of those machines? The loud one? I don't like loud noises, Doctor. It makes me anxious. And blood work… so many needles. I don’t do well with needles. Are you sure all this is necessary? Perhaps it’s just… old age, like I said.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. The MRI is a valuable tool for identifying potential causes of your memory lapses and dizziness. It’s a non-invasive procedure, although I acknowledge the machine can be loud. We can provide earplugs and even a mild sedative if you’re particularly anxious. The blood work is also necessary to rule out other potential causes. It’s a simple procedure, and we take every precaution to minimize discomfort. While it could be attributed to age, it's important to rule out any treatable medical conditions first. Ignoring these symptoms could lead to a more serious outcome. It's my responsibility to ensure you receive the best possible care. Would you like me to explain the procedures in more detail?
PATIENT: Explain… yes, alright. Explain it. But… no sedatives. I don’t like the idea of… being out of it. And… my Svetlana, she wouldn't approve. She always says I need to be… alert. She worries. But explain it. What will happen? How long will it take? And… will it hurt? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The MRI scan itself takes about 30-45 minutes. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, tube-shaped machine. It's important to remain completely still during the scan to ensure clear images. The machine makes a loud knocking and buzzing noise, but it doesn’t touch you. We’ll give you earplugs or headphones to minimize the noise. As for the blood work, it involves taking a small sample of blood from your arm. It will be a quick pinch, and usually doesn’t cause significant discomfort. We’ll use a small needle, and the process takes only a few minutes. We'll get the results in a few days, and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in brain and nervous system disorders. They can provide a more thorough evaluation and help determine the best course of treatment. Would you like me to explain the referral process?
PATIENT: A neurologist…? More doctors. This is… a lot. I just wanted a check-up, you see. Just to make sure everything was… working. Is this… is this because you think something is… seriously wrong? Don’t tell me if it’s something awful, Doctor. Just… tell me if I need to call Svetlana.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I understand your anxiety. It’s not necessarily because I suspect something awful is wrong, but your symptoms – the memory lapses and dizziness – warrant further investigation. The neurologist is simply an expert who can provide a more specialized evaluation. It's a precautionary measure, to rule out any potential underlying causes and ensure you receive the best possible care. The blood work and MRI will provide us with more information. Until we have those results, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing your symptoms. However, based on what you've told me, it's unlikely to be anything acutely life-threatening. Yes, I do think it would be a good idea to have Svetlana aware of the upcoming tests and referral. It's always helpful to have a support system during medical evaluations. But I don't want her to worry unnecessarily. We'll proceed step-by-step, and I'll explain everything to you along the way. Would you like me to call her now to schedule the tests, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Svetlana… yes, she should know. She'll want to… organize everything. She's good at that. Please, Doctor, you call her. I… I'm too tired to explain it again. Just… tell her everything. And tell her… not to worry too much. Just… tell her I'm seeing doctors. That's all. And… can I have a glass of water, please? My throat is dry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I'll call Svetlana right away and explain everything. I'll also request a nurse bring you a glass of water. It sounds like this is a lot to process, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. "Good morning, Svetlana?
