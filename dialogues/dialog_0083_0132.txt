DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Coby's the name. Heat's been gettin' to me, that's what. Never bothered me before, but this summer... it's somethin' else. Makes a man feel… weak, you know? Not myself at all.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It has been a particularly warm summer. Feeling weak is certainly concerning. Could you tell me more about this weakness, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Weakness… well, it’s not like I can’t do things, exactly. I still go to work, paintin' and fixin' things. But I get tired faster. And I feel… flushed. Like my face is on fire, even when it's not that hot out. It's just… not right. I used to be able to work all day in the sun, no problem. Now, I need a break every hour, and even then... it doesn't always help. My head gets a bit swimmy too, if I'm out for too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So, increased fatigue with activity, flushing, and some dizziness, particularly with heat exposure. Have you noticed this dizziness at any other times, or is it specifically when you're overheated?
PATIENT: Specifically with the heat, Doctor. Never had this happen before. I mean, I get a little winded sometimes, like anyone does, but this is different. It’s… a proper dizzy spell. Like the room’s spinning for a second. And it always happens when I've been in the sun for a bit. I haven’t been drinkin’ any less water than usual, if that matters. Always keep a bottle with me, been doin’ that for years. A sensible man does.
DOCTOR: That's good you're staying hydrated, Mr. Coby. It’s important. And it is good to know it’s specifically heat-related. Have you had a fever or chills at all with this, or any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Nothin’ like that. And my stomach’s been fine, thankfully. I can’t afford to be sick, got work to do. No chills either. Just… tired, flushed, and dizzy when it’s hot. It's just… frustrating, you know? I'm a practical man, always been able to handle myself. This feels… strange. Like somethin's wrong with me. A bit unnervin', to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and concern, Mr. Coby. It’s good you’re describing things so clearly. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. A bit of high blood pressure a few years back, the doctor put me on a little pill for it. I took it for a while, but he said it was under control so I stopped. And my knees, they ache sometimes, just old age, I reckon. Nothing serious. I've always been a healthy man, mind you. Eat alright, don’t smoke, don’t drink much. This heat thing is comin' outta nowhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of managed hypertension and some knee pain. Do you remember the name of the medication you were on for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... the little white pill... I think it started with an 'A'. Am-lod-i-pine, maybe? Something like that. It was a while ago, and honestly, I wasn’t paying much attention to the name. The doctor just told me to take it, and I did. It wasn't botherin' me, but he said my numbers were good, so I figured I didn't need it anymore. Sensible, right? No point takin' pills if you don’t need ‘em.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Mr. Coby. Amlodipine, yes. And you've been off of it for how long now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, it must be… three, maybe four years now? It was before the pandemic, I reckon. Time flies, doesn’t it? I haven't had any trouble with my blood pressure since I stopped takin’ it. Checked it at the pharmacy a couple of times, and it was always normal. I’m a pretty regular guy, Doctor. I don't like makin' a fuss. This heat thing is the first proper thing that's bothered me in years.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. Never been in a hospital, thankfully. A few broken bones as a kid, climbin' trees and such, but nothin’ serious. Just patched me up at the doctor's office, good as new. I pride myself on bein' a sturdy man. This… this is different. It feels like somethin' internal, you know? Not like a broken bone or a sprain. It’s… weakenin’. And I don’t like that one bit.
DOCTOR: Okay. And regarding family history - are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father… he had a bit of trouble with his heart when he got older. Had to slow down, couldn’t do much work in his garden anymore. And my mother, she had… well, she just got weak as she got older, faded away, really. Not much energy, always tired. That’s all I can really recall, honestly. We weren’t much for talkin’ about health, back then. Just toughened up and got on with it. Sensible folk, my family. Didn't want to bother anyone with complainin’. And I reckon I got that trait from ‘em. But this… this feels different than just gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little multivitamin now and then, Doctor. Keepin' myself topped up, you know? But I'm not religious about it. Sometimes I forget to take it for a week or two, no bother. Nothing else, though. I don’t hold with all those fancy pills and potions. A sensible diet and a bit of hard work, that's what keeps a man healthy. This heat thing is somethin' else, though. And it's gettin' worse, I reckon. Started off just a little flushed, now I feel proper weak after a couple of hours in the sun. It's… worryin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And one final question before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been allergic to nothin’ in my life. Lucky, I reckon. Can eat anything, take anything. A sensible man doesn’t let allergies bother him. This heat thing is the first proper trouble I've had in years, Doctor. And I’m not one for complainin’, you know? But it's gettin' to me. Makes a man feel useless, not bein' able to work. And I got bills to pay. So, if you can figure out what's goin' on… well, I'd be much obliged. Sensible, right? Figure it out and get me back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby, thank you for that thorough history. It sounds like you've been very healthy most of your life, and this is a new and concerning development for you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sensible. Do what you gotta do, Doctor. Get to the bottom of it. I've got work waitin', but I reckon figure out what's wrong is more important. Just don't poke and prod too much, alright? A sensible man doesn't like bein' fussed over.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Coby. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat, and feel your abdomen. Finally, I’ll check your extremities. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm… Your blood pressure is 160 over 90. That’s a bit elevated. Your pulse is 88 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s not particularly loud, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear… No wheezing or crackles. Ears and nose look normal. Throat is clear as well. Your abdomen is soft, and there’s no tenderness. Your extremities have good pulses, and there’s no swelling. Alright, Mr. Coby. Everything seems generally alright, but your blood pressure is elevated, and I detected a murmur. I’d like to order some blood work and an electrocardiogram, or EKG, just to get a more detailed picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work and an EKG... Sounds sensible. If you gotta poke and prod, might as well do it proper. I'd rather know what's goin' on than wander around feelin' useless. Will it take long? I got a roof to fix tomorrow, if the weather holds. And I need to get back to work, you know? Bills don't pay themselves. A sensible man gets things done.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Coby. The blood work will just involve a quick draw, and the EKG is a painless test where we attach some stickers to your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. Both tests should only take about 30-45 minutes total. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood and set you up for the EKG. While we’re waiting for the results, let’s discuss some things we can do to manage your symptoms. It’s important to avoid strenuous activity in the heat, stay well-hydrated, and wear loose-fitting clothing. Based on your history and the physical exam, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. Your elevated blood pressure and murmur could be related to a heart condition, or they could be a result of the heat stress. The blood work and EKG will help us determine the cause. In the meantime, I also want to rule out heat exhaustion or heatstroke. Are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or confusion?
PATIENT: Nausea? No. Vomiting? Definitely not. Confusion… well, sometimes I forget where I put my tools, but that's just gettin' old, isn't it? Not proper confusion. Just… a bit absentminded. And the dizziness comes on when I've been in the sun too long, like I told you. Sensible enough. Not like I'm ramblin' or not knowin' my own name. I still know a good roof from a bad one. And I still know how to get things done. But this heat... it's makin' things harder. I just want to get back to work, Doctor. A sensible man needs to earn a livin'. Don't want to be a burden on anyone.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Coby. The fact that you’re not experiencing nausea, vomiting, or confusion is reassuring. And it sounds like your symptoms are improving when you get out of the heat, which supports the possibility of heat-related illness. However, given your elevated blood pressure and the murmur I detected, I think it’s important to be cautious. We need to rule out any underlying heart condition. So, we’ll proceed with the blood work and EKG, and we’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. The nurse should be in shortly to draw your blood. She'll explain the process. In the meantime, please rest comfortably and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Questions... Hmm. Will this put me out of work for long, Doctor? That's my biggest concern. A sensible man needs to keep earnin' a livin', you know? I got bills to pay and a roof to fix. And I don't want to be a burden on anyone. If it's just heat exhaustion, I can handle that. But if it's somethin' serious… well, that's a different story. Just tell me straight, Doctor. Is it somethin' I gotta worry about, or can I just keep workin'? Sensible answer, that's all I ask.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Mr. Coby, and I understand your concern. It’s difficult to say definitively right now whether this will keep you out of work, or for how long. The blood work and EKG will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. I don't want to alarm you, but the murmur I detected does warrant further investigation. It’s possible it’s nothing serious, but it’s also important to rule out any underlying heart condition. If it is a heart condition, we’ll need to discuss treatment options and potential limitations on your activity. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll get the results of the tests as quickly as possible, and then we’ll discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity in the heat. Until we have more information, it’s best to err on the side of caution. I will call you as soon as the results are available, and we can discuss them in detail. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Sensible. Caution is always wise. Err on the side of caution, you say? Alright. I can do that. No point pushin' myself if somethin's wrong. But call me as soon as you can, Doctor. I need to know what's goin' on. Bills don't pay themselves, you know? And a roof needs fixin'. A sensible man can't afford to wait around. So, get those tests done and call me. That's all I ask. Sensible and quick, that’s what I need.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Coby. I completely understand. I’ll make sure the lab prioritizes your tests, and I’ll call you as soon as the results are available – I promise. The nurse should be in any moment now. Please relax and let her know if you have any questions. We'll get to the bottom of this. And we’ll figure out the best way to get you back to work as quickly and safely as possible. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Coby. We’ll be in touch very soon.
PATIENT: .
