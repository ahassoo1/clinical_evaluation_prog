DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's...well, it's kinda embarrassing, yeah? Something’s been…leaking. Down there. It's not right, you know? Never happened before. I don't even know why I have to talk about this.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Genard. These things happen, and you've come to the right place. There’s absolutely no need to feel embarrassed. We discuss these types of concerns frequently. Could you tell me a little more about the leaking?
PATIENT: Well… it's just… wet. Sometimes. Not all the time, thankfully. And it doesn't hurt hurt, but it feels… icky. Like somethin' ain't clean. I been tryin' to keep things… tidy, you know? But it keeps happenin'. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A little while ago, I guess. Maybe a week? Two? Time gets away from me.
DOCTOR: Okay, “wetness” for approximately one to two weeks, and it doesn’t cause pain, but a general feeling of uncleanliness. I understand. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe when this happens?
PATIENT: When? Oh, goodness. That's… hard. It doesn't seem to be after… you know… with a man. Not that there is a man. It just… happens. Sometimes when I'm just sittin' here. Or after I… use the bathroom. Maybe? I really don’t keep track of these things. It’s just… annoying. And worryin’. I don't want nothin' bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn't seem to be directly related to sexual activity. It occurs sometimes when you're sitting, and possibly after using the bathroom. That’s helpful to know. Has this been happening with both urination and bowel movements, or do you notice it more with one than the other?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're askin' things I really don't pay attention to! Let me think… probably after pee-pee. Yeah. Definitely more after I pee. I don’t… notice it after the other thing, not really. I try not to think about that part too much. Is somethin’ really wrong? You make it sound so serious.
DOCTOR: I'm simply gathering information, Ms. Genard. It’s important to understand all the details. It doesn't necessarily mean something serious is wrong. It could be a number of things, and we'll figure it out together. Now, aside from the leaking, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kinda changes? My bones ache sometimes, but that's just gettin' old, I figure. And my hair's fallin' out, but everybody says that happens. Oh! And I been feelin' kinda tired. More tired than usual, anyway. But I always been a little tired. This is hard, Doctor. You want me to remember everything?
DOCTOR: You’re right, that is a lot to remember, and it's perfectly alright if it's difficult. I'm not looking for a perfect recall, just a general sense of anything new or different. The aching bones and fatigue are good to know – those could be related, or they could be separate issues. Let's focus on the leaking for now. Have you noticed any odor associated with it?
PATIENT: Odor? Oh… well, now that you mention it… yeah. A little bit. Not a bad smell, exactly, but… different. Kind of… fishy. Not strong, though. I been usin’ more soap, tryin’ to get rid of it. But it keeps comin’ back. Ugh. This is awful. I'm too old for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slightly fishy odor. That is a helpful piece of information. Now, are you experiencing any burning or discomfort when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burnin’? No, not really. It just… feels normal when I go. Maybe a little bit of a tingle, sometimes. But not burnin’ like fire, or anythin’. Just… aware of it, you know? Like somethin's there. Is this gonna be expensive, Doctor? I don’t have a lot of money. And I ain’t insured.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Ms. Genard. We'll discuss that with you after we've had a chance to evaluate things. We'll work with you to find affordable options. For now, let’s focus on getting to the bottom of what’s going on. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve a gentle external examination, and I may also need to collect a urine sample. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh… goodness. I don't like doctors touchin' me. Never have. But… I guess I have to, if you're gonna figure out what’s wrong. A pee sample, yeah, I can do that. But… be gentle, okay? I bruise easy. And don't… don’t look at me too much. It's embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. I completely understand your discomfort, and I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. We’ll take things at your pace. I will explain everything as I go and stop immediately if you feel uncomfortable. First, let's collect that urine sample. I'll give you a cup and some instructions. There’s a restroom just down the hall. Please try to collect a midstream sample - that means you start urinating and then collect a small amount in the cup once you’ve been going for a few seconds. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Midstream… okay. That sounds… complicated. So I just… start, and then catch some in the cup? Like, not the first part? I guess I can try. This is all so much. I wish my daughter was here. She always knew what to do with doctors. Alright, alright. I'll go try. Where's the restroom again?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Start urinating, and then catch a small amount in the cup midway through. It's alright if it's not perfect, just do your best. The restroom is right down that hallway on your left. I’ll be right here when you get back. Take your time, and please let me know if you have any trouble. I can explain it again if you need me to.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’m goin’ now. Don’t go anywhere.
DOCTOR:
