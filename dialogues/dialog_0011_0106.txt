DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, really. A nasty one, and it just won't heal. I’ve had…well, let’s just say I’ve had a lot of experience with things not healing properly, if you catch my meaning. And don't tell me to take better care of myself, young man. I know my own body.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington. A persistent sore on your foot. And you've experienced some difficulties with healing in the past. I certainly won’t lecture you on self-care; your experience is valuable. Could you tell me a bit more about this sore?
PATIENT: It’s on the bottom of my left foot, right near my heel. It started…oh, goodness, must be a month or so ago, maybe longer. It was just a little red spot at first, barely noticeable. Now? Now it’s…well, it’s quite deep. And it aches. Especially when I try to walk. I used to be very active, you know. Walked everywhere. Not so much anymore. It’s…unacceptable.
DOCTOR: A month or longer, on the bottom of your left foot near the heel. Started as a small red spot and has progressed to a deeper sore with associated pain, particularly with walking. You mentioned being quite active previously. When you say “deep,” can you describe that a little more for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just…surface level, if you understand. It’s…a hole, practically. Not a huge one, mind you, but deep enough that you can see…well, you can see more than just skin. It’s…unpleasant. And it’s always a little bit damp. Always. No matter how much I dry it, it feels…moist. It’s rather disgusting, really. I’ve tried all sorts of creams, you know. Things the ladies at church recommended. Nothing works.
DOCTOR: I understand. A deeper sore, not just surface level, with a moist appearance despite drying. You’ve also tried various creams without success. To help me get a better understanding, have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Hmm. Let me think. Yes, actually. A little bit. It’s…not a lot, mind you. But there's…a clear fluid sometimes. And occasionally…a little bit of…well, it looks yellowish. Not pus, exactly. More like…thick water. It stains my socks, you know. Which is terribly embarrassing. Honestly, at my age, one shouldn't have to worry about staining one's socks.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Ms. Cannington. Clear and yellowish drainage, staining your socks. That’s helpful. Now, regarding your past medical history – do you have any conditions such as diabetes or problems with circulation in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, that. Yes, well, the doctor told me years ago I had…the sugar sickness. Diabetes, he called it. I don't pay much attention to those things, honestly. I try to eat right, mostly. And I’ve always been a bit…thin. It’s never been too bad, or so they say. As for circulation…my feet get cold sometimes. Very cold. But everyone gets cold feet, don’t they? I haven't had any trouble with…you know, legs swelling or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. A history of diabetes, and occasional cold feet. It's good you're mindful of your diet. Now, have you ever had any surgery or had any serious injuries to your feet or legs?
PATIENT: Surgery? Oh, goodness, let me think. Not on my feet, no. I had my gallbladder out, decades ago. And a hysterectomy, naturally. But nothing on my feet. As for injuries…I tripped over a root in the garden a few years back, twisted my ankle a bit. Nothing serious, though. I wrapped it, rested it for a while, and it healed just fine. Nothing like this…this awful sore. It’s just…stubborn.
DOCTOR: Thank you. No surgeries or significant injuries to her feet or legs aside from a minor ankle sprain years ago. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a little something for my blood pressure, a tiny pill. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take one of those…Melatonin, I think it's called. Just a little one. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were low. That’s about it, really. I don't believe in taking a lot of pills. They just make you feel worse, in my experience.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I used to get a little itchy when I ate strawberries as a girl, but I haven't had strawberries in…oh, goodness, decades. Nothing serious, mind you. I've never had a bad reaction to any medicine, as far as I know. I’m a pretty sturdy woman, really. It takes a lot to knock me down.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. Now, I'd like to take a look at the sore on your foot. Would you mind if I examined it?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, go ahead. But be gentle, young man. It’s quite tender. And don't poke and prod too much. I have a very high pain tolerance, but even I have my limits.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. I’m just going to take a look. I’m noting a sore on the bottom of your left heel, roughly one and a half centimeters in diameter. It appears to be quite deep, and there's some redness around the edges. The pulses in your foot feel strong, which is good. There is mild tenderness to the touch, but no other immediate concerns. I do notice some moisture within the wound. Based on my initial assessment, this appears to be an ulceration, and given your history of diabetes, it's important we address it carefully to prevent any complications. Do you have any sensation in your foot, like if I lightly touched it with this?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, of course I have sensation. I’m not completely numb, you know. Yes, I feel that. It tingles a bit. It’s not a pleasant sensation, mind you. More like…pins and needles. But I feel it. "Pins and needles" isn't a good sign, is it? I knew it. It's always something with this sugar sickness.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. The sensation of “pins and needles” is something we’ll need to keep in mind. Given your history of diabetes, the description of the sore, and the pins and needles sensation, I'm concerned about the possibility of a diabetic foot ulcer. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a blood sugar test to see what your current levels are. And then, a wound culture to check for any infection. We may also want to consider a vascular study to assess the blood flow in your legs and feet, just to be sure. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests. Honestly. Always something. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just don’t keep me waiting all day. And don’t tell me to change my diet. I eat perfectly fine, thank you very much. And no lectures about wearing shoes all the time either. It's my foot. I’ll do what I want. Just get it over with. I have a church social to get to this afternoon, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington. I assure you, I won't lecture you about your diet or footwear. My goal is simply to get a clearer understanding of what’s going on so we can get you feeling better. We’ll start with the blood sugar test and wound culture. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood now, and then she’ll gently clean the wound and take a swab for the culture. It shouldn’t take long. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend offloading pressure from the sore as much as possible. Try to avoid putting a lot of weight on your left foot. Would you be willing to try using crutches or a walker temporarily?
PATIENT: Crutches? A walker? Absolutely not. I’m not an invalid, young man. I can manage just fine. I'll just…be careful. And maybe stay off it a bit. But no crutches. Honestly, the thought of it. Just get those tests done, and tell me what you find. And quickly. The social is very important, you know. Mrs. Abernathy is bringing her famous pineapple upside-down cake. I wouldn’t miss it for the world.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. I respect your decision. We’ll proceed with the blood sugar test and wound culture. The nurse will be in shortly to take care of those. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please monitor the sore for any signs of worsening – increased pain, redness, swelling, or drainage. If you notice any of those, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Just…hurry up. And don’t keep me waiting. The cake won't stay fresh forever, you know. And Mrs. Abernathy doesn't take kindly to being upstaged.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. I'll let the nurse know to come in as quickly as possible. Thank you for your patience.
