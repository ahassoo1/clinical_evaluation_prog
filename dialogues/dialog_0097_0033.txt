DOCTOR: Hi Burdette, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather obvious, isn’t it? I’ve lost my vision…and my hearing. Suddenly. It’s…inconvenient, to say the least, for someone in my profession. I haven’t much time to waste on this.
DOCTOR: I understand, and I apologize for any inconvenience this is causing you. Sudden vision and hearing loss is concerning, and we'll definitely get to the bottom of it. When did you first notice these changes?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t recall precisely. A few days ago, perhaps? It all feels rather…blurry, if you’ll pardon the pun. I was…busy. Very busy with a complicated case. It’s difficult to pinpoint a specific time, Doctor. Must we dwell on the specifics?
DOCTOR: It’s okay if you can’t recall the exact time, Burdette. Any detail you can remember is helpful. Was it gradual, or did it happen all at once?
PATIENT: All at once, naturally. One moment I was seeing perfectly well, the next…not so much. And the hearing…simply gone. It wasn’t a slow fade, if that’s what you’re implying, Doctor. I have important things to attend to.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying. “All at once” is very important information. I’d like to do a quick exam of your ears and eyes, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I do have patients waiting. But…very well. Get it over with quickly, please. I trust you know what you’re doing. I haven’t time for protracted examinations.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as efficient as possible. Okay, looking in your ears… the ear canals are clear, and the tympanic membranes themselves appear intact, no signs of infection or fluid. Now, looking in your eyes… pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. The retinas appear…pale. And I’m seeing some narrowing of the retinal arteries. Alright, Burdette. Everything appears normal on basic examination, which is…concerning given your symptoms. The pale retinas and narrowed arteries are a bit unusual. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No, not particularly. Just the…inability to see or hear. I haven't been feeling unwell, if that’s what you mean. A bit of a headache, perhaps, but that’s hardly noteworthy. I lead a stressful life, Doctor. It comes with the territory. I haven't noticed anything…different, beyond the obvious. And frankly, I don’t have time to catalogue every minor ache and pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms. And you said a mild headache?
PATIENT: “Mild” is generous. A slight pressure, more like it. It comes and goes. Truly, Doctor, I suspect it’s just fatigue. I work very long hours. It’s…the nature of the profession. Are we getting anywhere with this? I have a surgery scheduled for this afternoon. A very important one.
DOCTOR: Burdette, given the sudden onset of both vision and hearing loss, and the findings on the exam – specifically the pale retinas – I’m concerned about a possible neurological event. While it could be many things, we need to rule out something serious, like a stroke or transient ischemic attack. The headache, even if mild, adds to that concern. I understand you have a surgery scheduled, but it would be incredibly risky to proceed without further investigation. I recommend we get a stat CT scan of your head and possibly an MRI. Would you be willing to go to the hospital immediately?
PATIENT: A stroke? Are you serious, Doctor? I am a surgeon! I perform surgeries, I don’t have them. This is…preposterous. And a hospital? Absolutely not. I have a schedule to keep, patients relying on me. This is a complete waste of my time. I suspect you’re a young doctor, still learning. Perhaps you should consult with someone more experienced before making such…dramatic pronouncements. I’m perfectly fine. This will likely resolve on its own. I refuse to be subjected to unnecessary tests. I'm leaving. .
DOCTOR: Burdette, I understand your frustration, but I am genuinely concerned for your well-being. Dismissing these symptoms could have very serious consequences. I am obligated to recommend the most appropriate care, and in this case, that means ruling out a potentially life-threatening condition. I respect your decision, but I must strongly advise against leaving without further evaluation. I’m happy to discuss this with another physician here at the clinic, or I can provide you with the contact information for the nearest hospital emergency room. However, I cannot in good conscience allow you to proceed with surgery without knowing what is causing this sudden loss of vision and hearing. .
