DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Vankampen, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Albino Vankampen. But please, call me Al. Everyone does. It's a long story why my parents named me that, ha! I’m here ‘cause my back… well, it’s been botherin’ me somethin’ awful lately.
DOCTOR: "Bothering" is… vague, Al. How long has it been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? It was just a little ache then, you know? I thought I just slept wrong. But it’s gotten worse and worse. Now it’s… well, it hurts to bend over, to stand for too long, even to sit sometimes. Especially in the mornin'.
DOCTOR: Six months. And you haven’t done anything about it?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ really. I tried some of those creams… the kind you rub on? Didn't do a thing. And my daughter, bless her heart, she told me to take some pills, but I don’t like takin’ pills if I can help it. I thought it would just go away, you know? Old age, maybe. But it’s not gettin’ better. It's just...there.
DOCTOR: Right. Any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingle. Not at all. Just… pain. A deep ache, mostly in my lower back. Sometimes it shoots down my… well, my backside a little. But no numb feelin’ or anything like that. It's just… a constant reminder that I’m gettin’ old, ha!
DOCTOR: And what about your bowel and bladder function?
PATIENT: Oh! Well... that's a personal question, isn't it? Everything's... regular. I mean, I go to the bathroom like normal. No trouble there. No changes or nothin'. Just askin’ why you wanna know about that?
DOCTOR: Just routine, Al. We need to rule things out. Alright. Have you had any recent injuries?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Not recent, anyway. I tripped over the rug maybe a year ago, but didn't break anything. Just bruised my pride, ha! This pain… it just started out of nowhere, really. Not like somethin' I did. That's what's worryin’ me. And my daughter, she’s been sayin’ somethin’ about my bones… I don’t really understand it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said six months… have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. Bendin’ over, like I said. And standin’ for a long time… that’s awful. But… liftin’ things is the worst. Even somethin’ light, sometimes. And… sittin’ for too long, too. I like watchin’ the news, you know? But after a while, I gotta get up. It’s uncomfortable. It feels like somethin’s gonna snap. Not a sharp snap, but… you know. Weak. That’s the best way to describe it. Weak and achy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look. If you don't mind. Just gonna feel around a bit. Lie down on the examination table, if you would.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Sure. Examination table, right. I haven’t been on one of these in… well, a long time. Just tell me if you need me to move a certain way. My back is a little… tender, you know. And I might groan a little. Sorry about that.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness over L4-L5. Some muscle spasm. Straight leg raise… any pain radiating down your leg with this?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That one… that one hurts a little. Not a sharp pain, but… a sort of achin’ feelin’. Down my… right leg, I think. Not all the way to my foot, but… yeah. Down the back of my leg. Is that bad? It’s just a little ache, but… you said that hurts, right?
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes… patellar and Achilles… two plus bilaterally. Strength… dorsiflexion, plantarflexion… five out of five. Seems like you've got some nerve irritation, likely impinging on the L5 nerve root. It's not a complete blockage, which is good. We'll need to get some X-rays to confirm. Probably a bit of degeneration, maybe some arthritis. It's common at your age.
PATIENT: X-rays, huh? Is it… serious? Arthritis? I’ve heard that’s… not good. Degeneration… that sounds bad too. My daughter, she keeps talkin’ about my bones bein’ weak, like somethin's missin'. Is that what this is? What does all this mean, Doc? Will I be able to… keep watchin' the news? Will I need a wheelchair?
DOCTOR: Look, Al, try not to panic. It's not an emergency. Degeneration and arthritis are common with age. It just means the cartilage in your spine is wearing down. We need to see what’s going on with the X-rays before we jump to any conclusions. And honestly, you’re probably fine. We’ll rule out anything serious. I doubt you’ll need a wheelchair. But you do need to be more careful with lifting and bending. I’ll order the X-rays now, and the receptionist will schedule you. I'm also going to prescribe you a mild anti-inflammatory to help with the pain. Come back once you’ve had the X-rays, and we’ll discuss the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Anti-inflammatory… that’s… pills, right? I don’t like takin’ pills, but… if it helps. And X-rays… right. I’ll ask the receptionist. So… not a wheelchair? That's good. My daughter would never let me hear the end of it. She worries too much. Just… tell me, Doc… is it gonna be painful? Getting the X-rays, I mean? And… is there anything I can do now? Before the pills and the X-rays? Just… anything?
DOCTOR: The X-rays are painless, Al. You just lie still. As for now… try heat. A warm compress on your lower back. And avoid lifting anything heavy. Honestly, that’s about it. Don't try to self-diagnose with Dr. Google. Let's get the X-rays first. The receptionist will schedule you. Next! .
PATIENT: .
