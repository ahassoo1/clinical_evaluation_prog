DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, Kile. Just Kile is fine. New here, you know? Just… seeing if things are okay. Old age, I guess. Medicare sent me. Not sure why, really. Everything feels… normal. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kile, that’s perfectly alright. Medicare sometimes sends out preventative care notices. No need to apologize for not knowing exactly why you're here. “Mostly normal” is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about what feels not normal?
PATIENT: Not normal… hmm. It’s… hard to say. Things just… fade. Faces, names… things I should remember. I used to do makeup, you know? For the theater. Very good work. But now… It’s… gone a little. Not all of it, but… enough to be annoying. And my knees ache when it rains. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That definitely counts, Kile. Both the memory concerns and the knee pain are important. So, it sounds like the memory issues are relatively new, and you’re noticing difficulty recalling faces and names, specifically. Has this been interfering with your daily life – things like appointments, medications, or recognizing people you know?
PATIENT: Appointments… yes. I forget sometimes. My ex-wife… she calls. I… I have to ask who she is. Very embarrassing. Medications? I take… a little blue pill. Every day, I think. Maybe. It’s for… something. Blood? Pressure, maybe? I don’t really pay attention. My daughter handles most of that now. She's good girl. Very organized. Unlike me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kile, that’s very helpful. It sounds like the memory issues are impacting your recognition of people and remembering appointments, and you’re not entirely sure about your medications. You mentioned a “little blue pill” for blood pressure, possibly?
PATIENT: Yes, blue. Small. And… round. I think. It’s not a big one. She, my daughter, brings it. Every month. I don't ask too many questions. Always busy, you know? Used to be so many people, so many faces to make up. Now… mostly just quiet. It's not so bad, really. Just old.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you have your daughter helping you with your medications, Kile. It’s not a sign of weakness to need assistance, especially as we get older. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high cholesterol, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… hmm. I had a bad knee when I was young. Football. Stupid game. Fixed it, mostly. And… something with my stomach, a long time ago. Ulcers, maybe? The doctor gave me pills. Pink ones. I don’t remember much else. Nothing serious, I don’t think. I always felt okay. Busy, always busy. The theater, you know? No time for being sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past knee injury and a possible history of ulcers. That's helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… The knee, yes. A long time ago. Very painful. And… maybe my appendix? When I was a boy, I think. I was very sick. Everything is blurry, you know? So many years. Not important, really. Just… old things. I remember the theater more clearly. The lights, the costumes… better memories.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a little more to work with. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she was always sick. Something with her heart, I think. Very weak. Always tired. And my father… he drank. A lot. Not good for the… the mind, you know? I don’t think he remembered much at the end. Not a happy family, really. Mostly quiet sadness. No one talked much about… anything. Except maybe the weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems and possible cognitive decline with your father. That's important information. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Bad for the voice, you know? Important for the theater. Drink… sometimes. A little vodka. For the throat. A small glass, maybe once a week. And… when I was younger, sometimes more. But now… just a little. And drugs? No. Never. A respectable man, you know? Always. Mostly. A little vodka now and then. Nothing bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, besides the little blue pill?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. My daughter brings me something for my...arthritis, I think? In my hands. Small white pills. And...sometimes, when I can't sleep, she gives me something too. A yellow one. But I don't really pay attention. She knows what I need. She's very good. I don’t ask too many questions. It makes my head hurt, you know? All these pills. Just… a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kile, thank you for sharing all of this with me. It sounds like you're taking a few different medications, and it’s understandable that it’s confusing to keep track of everything. Before we proceed, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just a quick check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a neurological assessment to get a better understanding of your memory and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Fine. Whatever. Do what you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle. Old bones, you know? And… don't take too long. I have… things to think about. Mostly the theater. It's better than remembering everything else. Just hurry. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Kile. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? Hmm… August… something. I always forget. Is it the 2nd? Maybe the 3rd? My daughter tells me. I… I don't remember. It's hot, though. Very hot. That much I remember. August. Somewhere around the 2nd, I think. Stop asking me so many questions. It makes my head hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s alright, Kile. No need to worry. It’s okay if you don’t remember. Now, can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: President? Oh… that man… the one on the television… It starts with a… a B? Or is it a… T? No… it's… I can see his face, but I can't remember the name! Important, is it? I used to know these things. Used to be very smart. Now… nothing. It's all gone. Don't ask me anymore. Please. It's useless.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kile. That’s enough for now. I understand this is frustrating. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, you’re experiencing some memory loss, difficulty with recall, and some confusion regarding dates and current events. This could be due to a number of factors, including normal age-related changes, stress, medication side effects, or potentially something more serious. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but I think it’s important to investigate this further. I would like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a brain scan – either an MRI or a CT scan – to get a better look at your brain structure and rule out any physical abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Blood work? A scan? Oh… More tests… more questions… It never ends. Fine. Whatever you think is best. But I don’t want to be poked and prodded too much. Old bones, you know? And… will it cost a lot of money? My daughter handles all that, but… she gets upset when things are expensive. Just… do what you need to do. And hurry. Please. I have… things to remember. Or try to, anyway. Just… don't tell me too much. It makes my head hurt.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Kile. We’ll keep everything as comfortable as possible. The blood work is a standard procedure, and we’ll take all necessary precautions to minimize discomfort. The scan is non-invasive, and the technicians are very experienced. I’ll order the tests now and schedule them for you as soon as possible. I’ll also have my nurse discuss the costs with your daughter. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a medication called donepezil. It's a mild cholinesterase inhibitor that can sometimes help improve memory and cognitive function in people with mild to moderate memory loss. It's not a cure, but it might help stabilize your condition. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in brain disorders – for a more thorough evaluation. Would you like me to arrange an appointment for you, or would you prefer to schedule it yourself?
PATIENT: A pill? Another pill? Oh, for goodness sake... My daughter is going to kill me. She says I take too many already. What is this one for, again? And a… a neuro… what did you call it? A brain doctor? Sounds… serious. Just… give me the pill. And schedule the appointment for the… the brain doctor. Whatever. Just get it over with. I don’t want to deal with it. My daughter can handle all the details. She’s good at that. Just… don't expect me to remember any of it. This is… too much. Just too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Kile. I'll print out these documents for you and for your daughter. We’ll also send the referral to the neurologist’s office, and they’ll contact her to schedule an appointment. We've covered a lot today. To summarize, we're going to monitor your vitamin levels with blood work, get a clearer picture of your brain structure with a scan, and explore the possibility of donepezil to help manage your symptoms. And you'll be seeing a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. I understand this is a lot to take in. Please remember that we’re here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call my office. My nurse will be reaching out to your daughter shortly to discuss the details of the tests and appointments. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Kile?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s enough. Too much already. Just… thank you. I guess. But I don’t remember much of anything anyway. Just… let me go home. Let me try to remember the theater. It's better than all this. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Kile. You take care now. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. My nurse will be in touch shortly. .
