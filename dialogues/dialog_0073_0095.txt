DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s rather inconvenient having to be here. But alright. I woke up yesterday and… well, I couldn't hear out of my left ear. And my face… it feels droopy on that side. It’s quite alarming, really. I don’t usually bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes, well, health issues rarely adhere to convenient schedules. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping... that is concerning. How quickly did the hearing loss come on?
PATIENT: Immediately. I mean, I went to bed perfectly fine. Woke up, and poof. Nothing. It wasn't gradual, it wasn't a slow fading. One minute I could hear, the next… silence. And then I looked in the mirror to brush my teeth, and that’s when I noticed my face wasn't quite… symmetrical. It’s rather obvious, isn’t it? I’m not imagining things.
DOCTOR: “Sudden onset… no prior symptoms…” Right. And you haven't experienced any dizziness, headache, or trouble with your vision?
PATIENT: No dizziness. No headache, thankfully. My vision is perfectly fine. I do wear glasses, as you can see, but that’s just… aging. Not related to this… problem. Honestly, I suspect it’s just a pinched nerve or something. I've always been rather… robust. Though, I suppose that doesn’t explain the hearing. It’s just… frustrating. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Robust is good, yes. Still, sudden unilateral hearing loss with facial drooping is… unusual for a simple pinched nerve. We need to rule out more serious possibilities. I'm going to perform a brief neurological exam, if you don't mind. It will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation. Then I'll need to take a look in your ear, of course. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Look in my ear? Fine. Though I assure you, it's perfectly clean. I take excellent care of myself. A neurological exam… is that going to take long? I have a luncheon scheduled. And frankly, I find poking and prodding rather… undignified. But if it gets me out of here faster, I suppose. Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't take long, Ms. Nissenbaum. Just a few standard tests. I assure you, it's a necessary part of assessing the situation. First, let's look in your ear. Please sit forward slightly… and try to relax. Now, can you tell me if you’ve noticed any ringing in your ears, or any pain associated with this hearing loss?
PATIENT: Ringing? No. Absolutely no ringing. And pain? Definitely not. It’s just… silence. A rather unsettling silence, I might add. And looking in my ear isn't going to cause any pain, is it? Because I won't tolerate that. I have a very low tolerance for discomfort. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. This is all very… inefficient.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t cause any pain. The ear canal appears clear, no visible obstructions or signs of infection. Now, could you please smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? I do hope this isn’t going to involve a lengthy series of… contortions. I have important things to attend to, you know. Luncheons, charitable events… it’s a busy life. Just tell me what’s wrong and how quickly I can fix it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s sufficient. I also want you to try and raise your eyebrows, and close your eyes tightly. It appears you have some weakness on the left side of your face, and the left side of your mouth doesn’t move as strongly as the right when you smile. Given the sudden hearing loss and facial weakness, I’m concerned about a possible Bell’s palsy, but we need to rule out other causes. We’ll need some blood work, and I’d like to order an MRI of your brain just to be certain.
PATIENT: An MRI? Blood work? Honestly, this is becoming ridiculous! Bell’s… what was it? Palsy? Is that serious? I have no time for serious! I simply cannot be having a… a palsy! I'm a perfectly healthy woman, aside from the… temporary inconvenience, of course. This is all very… stressful. And expensive, I presume? I don’t even have insurance, you know. A waste of my time, and now, apparently, a waste of my money.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your frustration. Bell's palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the facial muscles. It’s not life-threatening in most cases, but it does need to be investigated to rule out other, more serious possibilities, such as a stroke. The MRI and blood work are to ensure an accurate diagnosis. As for the cost, I can connect you with our financial counseling department to discuss options. Delaying diagnosis could potentially worsen the outcome, even with Bell’s Palsy. Now, regarding the MRI, are you currently taking any medications or do you have any metal implants, such as a pacemaker or artificial joints?
PATIENT: Pacemaker? Good heavens, no! I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, but that’s all. A tiny pill. A very small pill. I haven't had any… surgeries or implants. I assure you, I’ve always been remarkably… intact. So, no metal. No pacemakers. Now, can we please expedite this process? I have a reputation to maintain, you know. This luncheon… it's quite important. And I absolutely refuse to be late. This whole ordeal is utterly inconvenient. Is the MRI going to require me to lie in a… a tube? I’m rather claustrophobic.
DOCTOR: Okay, no metal implants, blood pressure medication noted. Yes, the MRI does involve lying in a tube, but it's a relatively open machine. And you'll be given headphones so you can listen to music. We can also provide a mild sedative if you're particularly anxious. It’s important to get this done quickly to determine the best course of action. I'll write you a referral order for the MRI, and I’ll have my nurse draw some blood for the labs. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a short course of oral steroids, which can sometimes help with Bell's palsy. They won't necessarily cure it, but they can reduce inflammation and potentially speed up recovery. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely no allergies. I've always been rather… robust, as I mentioned before. Steroids, you say? Well, I suppose that's better than nothing. Though, I do hope they don't cause me to… gain weight. I have a very important gala next month, and I'm rather particular about my appearance. Just… make sure they’re the kind that don't puff you up. And tell me, honestly, how long is this going to take? I need to know. I have a schedule, you know. This is all very disruptive. And I still haven't heard how much this is going to cost! Honestly, this whole experience is quite appalling.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your concerns. I’m prescribing a low dose of prednisone, which has a lower risk of weight gain than some other steroids. But it's important to follow the instructions carefully, and we’ll monitor you closely. As for the cost, I’ll have the billing department contact you directly with an estimate. The labs and MRI will be separate charges. This will require a consultation with a neurologist after the MRI is completed. They will interpret the results and provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide you with the referral order for the MRI. Do you have any questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: Neurologist? Another doctor? This is becoming a parade of specialists! Honestly, it's ridiculous. Fine. No, I don't have any further questions. Just… please tell your nurse to be quick. I have a luncheon to attend, you know. And I expect a detailed itemized bill. Very detailed. I don’t appreciate surprises. And if this neurologist is going to suggest some lengthy, invasive treatment… I will likely seek a second opinion. This is all rather… distressing. Just… get it over with. .
