DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Good morning to you too. Quicksey, you say? Well, I just… moved here. New place, you know? Figured I should see a doctor. Medicare says I have to, I think. Something about… social healthcare. It’s all a bit of a mess, honestly. Not like back home.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. It can be a bit confusing navigating a new system. Establishing care with a primary care physician is a great first step, and Medicare does have some initial preventative requirements. We'll get everything sorted out. So, aside from establishing care, are you experiencing any specific health concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Concerns? Not really. I mean… I'm old. Things ache. Always have. It's the job, you know? All that bending, the bright lights… Makeup is hard work. But nothing wrong, wrong. Just… old. Is that a concern?
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you're generally feeling alright. And it's very common for things to ache as we get older, especially with physically demanding professions. We definitely want to address those aches and pains to maintain your quality of life. Just to get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about what you do for work?
PATIENT: Work? I am a makeup artist. Theatrical. Performance. Very important work! I make the stars look beautiful. Or scary. Or… whatever they need. I used to do big shows. Real shows. Not like… what they have now. Lots of bending over people, holding my arms up… heavy things. The lights, always the lights. Very bright. Now… it's smaller jobs. Parties. Sometimes. It’s… less.
DOCTOR: That sounds fascinating, Mr. Szmyd! And yes, I can see how that would be physically demanding, even with smaller jobs now. Holding those positions and working under bright lights could certainly contribute to some discomfort. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe the aches and pains you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Achy. Everywhere. Mostly my back, I think. Lower back. And my shoulders. They are always tight. Like… knots. And my hands, sometimes. They… they hurt when I squeeze things. Not all the time. But when I’m working. And… Oh! My feet! They swell up. Especially after I’m on them all day. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, all of that is important, Mr. Szmyd. Lower back pain, shoulder tightness, hand discomfort with squeezing, and foot swelling – those all give me a better understanding of what's going on. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. When? A long time ago, I think. The back… always a little ache. But it got worse… hmm. When I stopped doing the big shows, maybe? Ten years ago? Fifteen? It’s all a blur. The hands… more recently. A few years. And the feet… when it gets hot, you know? Summer. They swell up then. It's… hard to say exactly. It just… happened. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like this has been a gradual process over the past ten to fifteen years, with the hand discomfort being more recent. And the foot swelling seems to be related to the heat. To get a better idea of what might be going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Nothing like that. Back home… the doctors, they just gave me pills. For the pain. I took them. They helped. Then I ran out. This doctor… They told me to stop taking them. Something about… my stomach. I don't remember. No, no diagnoses. Just… pills. And pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no formal diagnoses, and you were previously prescribed pain medication that you’ve since discontinued. That's helpful to know. Do you currently take any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones like ibuprofen or acetaminophen?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes. For the headache. You know? When the lights are too bright. Acetami… whatever you said. The white pills. And… sometimes, if I’m really hurting, I take something for the stomach. Something pink. But not often. I try not to. They don’t really help much anyway. Everything hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you occasionally take acetaminophen for headaches and something pink for stomach discomfort. We'll make a note of that. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh… I don't think so. Nothing serious. Once, I touched a flower… a very pretty flower… and my hand got a little itchy. But that was a long time ago. And I don't remember what kind of flower it was. No, no allergies. I eat everything. I like food. Especially the sweet things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have suffered from any significant health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family? Oh, dear. It’s been a long time. They… they all lived far away. Back home. My mother… she died. Old age, I think. My father… I don’t remember. I was very young. And… I had a sister, maybe? I think so. But I haven’t seen her in… many years. No, I don't know about health problems. We didn’t talk about such things. It was a long time ago. A different life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited information about family medical history. That’s alright. We can still proceed. Finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. Bad for the makeup, you know? Dries out the skin. Makes the stars look old. No, I do not smoke. And I drink… sometimes. A little vodka. With friends. Not much. It helps with the… aches. But not every day. Mostly on holidays.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, and occasional vodka consumption. That's good to know. Now, Mr. Szmyd, I think I have a good starting point. It sounds like you've been dealing with a gradual onset of aches and pains, primarily in your back, shoulders, and hands, with some foot swelling related to the heat. You've previously taken pain medication but discontinued it due to stomach issues. Would you be comfortable if I conducted a brief physical exam to assess your range of motion, check for any tenderness, and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Well… I don’t like being poked and prodded. But… if you must. I suppose it’s necessary. Just… be gentle. I am a delicate artist, you know? And… don’t take too long. I have things to do. But alright. Go ahead. But gentle, please. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your back. Could you please stand up and bend forward slowly, and then bend backward, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is not going to be good. Ugh. It creaks. Like an old door. Oh! That’s worse! Everything hurts. Stop! Stop, please! I think that’s enough. No more bending. It’s bad for the… artist. Very bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll stop there. I can see that bending is causing you significant discomfort. I observed some limited range of motion and you expressed pain with both forward and backward bending. Now, let's check your shoulders. Can you please raise both of your arms above your head, and then rotate them inward and outward?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s tight. Very tight. Ugh. It feels like something is stuck. Like… knots. That’s worse! Everything is stuck. No, no. I can’t. It hurts too much. This is… not good. Can we stop now? Please?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Szmyd. We’ll stop right there. I observed limited range of motion and you reported significant tightness and discomfort with both inward and outward rotation. Now, let’s just briefly check your hands. Can you please squeeze my hand firmly?
PATIENT: Oh… it hurts a little. When I squeeze. Not strong. Not like before. The makeup… it’s hard on the hands, you know? Lots of squeezing. Is something wrong? Are my hands broken?
DOCTOR: I don’t believe your hands are broken, Mr. Szmyd. There is some tenderness on palpation of the joints, and you reported discomfort with squeezing. I also noted some decreased grip strength. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in through your mouth?
PATIENT: Oh… it feels tight. My chest. Like… something is pressing. Is something wrong with my lungs? Do I have… the sickness? Everyone is talking about the sickness.
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds a bit labored, Mr. Szmyd, and I do hear some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of your lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but slightly rapid. I don't believe this is "the sickness" based on what I'm hearing, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Based on your history and the physical exam, it appears you are experiencing musculoskeletal pain in your back and shoulders, likely related to your profession, along with some decreased grip strength in your hands and some mild breathing difficulties. I also noted swelling in your feet during our conversation. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I recommend a few tests. I would like to order a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs, some blood work to check for inflammation and other potential underlying conditions, and possibly some imaging of your hands and lower back to rule out any underlying arthritis or other structural issues. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, dear. More poking and prodding? Blood work? I don’t like needles. And… imaging? What does that even mean? Will it hurt? Will it take long? I have things to do, you know. Is it… serious? Are you saying I am very sick? I just want to feel better. Is there a pill for that?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. The chest X-ray is a quick and painless procedure – you’ll simply stand in front of a machine while a picture is taken of your lungs. The blood work involves a small sample of blood being drawn from your arm – it’s a quick pinch, and then it’s over. And the imaging, like an X-ray, is non-invasive. I'm not saying you are very sick, Mr. Szmyd. These tests are simply to help me understand what's causing your symptoms and determine the best course of treatment. It's important to rule out any serious underlying conditions, but right now, it's most likely related to the physical demands of your profession and possibly some mild arthritis. There isn't one single "pill" for feeling better, unfortunately. But once we have the results of these tests, we can develop a comprehensive plan to manage your pain, improve your breathing, and help you get back to feeling your best. This may involve medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Would you like me to go ahead and order these tests for you?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you must. But please, be quick. And gentle. I don't want to spend all day in the doctor's office. And… make sure they don’t poke too hard. When will I get the results? And… can I still work? I need to make a living, you know. Just… please, help me. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. We'll get everything done as quickly and gently as possible. I’m ordering the chest X-ray and blood work right now. The lab and radiology departments will contact you to schedule appointments. They should be able to accommodate you relatively quickly. The results typically take a few days to come back – usually around three to five business days. Once I have them, I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. As for work, I don't see any reason why you can't continue to work, but I would advise you to take it easy and avoid any strenuous activities until we have a better understanding of what’s going on. Listen to your body, and don’t push yourself too hard. We may need to discuss some modifications to your work routine to help prevent further discomfort. Here’s a requisition form for the lab and radiology. Please take this to the front desk and they will help you schedule your appointments. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Requisition… it sounds complicated. Oh… alright. I’ll take it to the front desk. Thank you. I think. I hope you are right. I just want to feel better. Alright. I’ll go now. Stop poking, you said? Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. And yes, no more poking, I promise. Just take it easy, listen to your body, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
