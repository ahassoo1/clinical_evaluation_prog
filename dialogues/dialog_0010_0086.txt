DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning. Just here for the results, like we talked about. I really don’t have time to go over everything again, if that’s alright. Just… what do they say?
DOCTOR: Understandable. I do want to be thorough, even if it's a quick review, to ensure we cover everything, Ms. Kovtun. But we can focus on the results. Okay, so the lab work came back and shows… everything is within normal limits. Your complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid function all look good. Do you have any specific concerns you were hoping the results would address?
PATIENT: Normal limits? Okay. That's… good, I guess? I honestly don’t know what any of that means, to be perfectly frank. I just needed to know if there was something seriously wrong, since I was feeling a bit tired lately. Is “normal” like, really normal? Or just… normal for most people?
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Ms. Kovtun. “Normal” is based on a range established from testing a large population. It doesn’t necessarily mean everyone should be within that range, but it's what we consider healthy in most cases. Your results fall well within those established parameters. The tiredness you’ve been experiencing, though… since the labs are normal, we need to explore other potential causes. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. Well, no, not really. Just… tired. And maybe a little more forgetful than usual, but honestly, I’ve always been a bit spacey. It’s nothing new. It’s just… frustrating. I have a lot to manage at work, you know? Logistics isn't exactly a relaxing job. Is there anything else it could be? Like… stress, or something? I really don't have time for a long investigation, if you get my drift.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Ms. Kovtun. Stress is definitely a possibility, and it can absolutely cause fatigue and even affect cognitive function. However, "forgetful" is something we should explore a little further, just to rule out anything else. Could you describe what you mean by “forgetful”?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. It's just… little things. Like, I'll walk into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I'll be talking to someone and completely blank on what I was saying mid-sentence. Nothing major, like losing days or anything! More like… momentary lapses. It’s been happening a bit more lately, but it's hard to say if it's the stress or… something else. Honestly, I'm pretty sure it's just stress.
DOCTOR: Those sound like fairly typical symptoms of stress and being overwhelmed, Ms. Kovtun. However, since you've noticed a recent increase, and to be thorough, I’d like to do a quick cognitive assessment. It’s just a brief series of questions to assess your memory and attention. It won’t take long, maybe five to ten minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Five to ten minutes, maximum? Okay, fine. But if it starts taking longer, I’m going to have to cut it short. I have shipments to track, you know? Just… let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Kovtun. Five to ten minutes, I promise. Let’s start with a simple one. Can you please tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: August 2nd, 2025. Is that what you needed? Can we just hurry this up a bit? I feel like I’m wasting my whole morning here.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. Thank you. And now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Shoot. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: The words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Done. Can we move on? Seriously, I’m starting to get anxious about missing deadlines.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you to do a simple calculation. Can you subtract seven from one hundred?
PATIENT: Ninety-three. Look, are we almost done? I’m really not good at these kinds of things. It’s not like I’m a mathematician or anything. I manage things, not numbers.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Two thousand and twenty-five. Are we finally done? This is ridiculous. I have actual work to do. What did this even prove?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kovtun. That was helpful. Based on the quick assessment, your cognitive function appears to be within normal limits for someone your age. However, your recall was slightly delayed, and you seemed frustrated during the assessment. Given your level of stress, and the recent increase in these “lapses” as you described, I would recommend a few things. Firstly, stress management techniques. Have you considered mindfulness, meditation, or talking to a therapist?
PATIENT: Therapist? Seriously? No, absolutely not. I don't have time for that. Look, I manage a lot. It's a stressful job, okay? That's just part of it. And I am not paying someone to listen to me complain. Maybe just… a stronger coffee? Or a long vacation, if that was an option. Are there any medications to help with tiredness? Something quick and easy?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about therapy, Ms. Kovtun. There are options for managing tiredness. We can discuss some over-the-counter options like Melatonin or Vitamin B12. However, those aren’t always effective, and I would recommend having a full blood panel to rule out any deficiencies or underlying medical causes before starting anything. I also want to emphasize the importance of prioritizing sleep and maintaining a healthy diet. I can provide resources for stress management techniques you can try on your own. And if the fatigue or memory lapses worsen, please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that's everything. Just… give me something for the tiredness. And a list of those stress things, I guess. But honestly, I doubt they'll work. I really need to get back to work now. Can I just get a copy of these results and go?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kovtun. I'm printing a summary of your results now, along with a list of resources for stress management. I'll also include some information about over-the-counter options for fatigue. It is my professional opinion that a full blood panel may be helpful in identifying underlying causes of your tiredness and memory lapses, but I will respect your decision if you choose not to pursue that option at this time. Here you are. Please be sure to read through this information carefully. If you experience any worsening symptoms, don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up. Thank you for your time. .
