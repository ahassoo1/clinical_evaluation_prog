DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Sink, if you must know, it’s about this…procedure. My daughter insisted I get checked out first. Says I'm too old to be going under the knife without a proper look-see. Honestly, I think she worries too much. But here I am. Let’s get it over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: A procedure, you say. And your daughter…encouraged this visit. Right. Well, we always prefer to be thorough. Can you tell me what procedure you are scheduled for?
PATIENT: It's…a face lift. Don't look at me like that. A mini face lift. Just a little tightening, you understand. The skin's starting to…droop. Not that I notice it much. But apparently, others do. My daughter showed me some pictures… quite dreadful, really. It's not like I'm vain, I just want to look…presentable. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: A facelift. Yes. Well, presentable is a reasonable goal. And it's good your daughter is involved. Before we proceed, let's get some background. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Medical problems? Goodness. Where do I begin? I’ve lived 81 years, Doctor. A few aches and pains, of course. Arthritis in the hands, mostly. Keeps me from doing the really fine work with the terrazzo anymore, sadly. Had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered just fine. Nothing…serious. And I don't want to bore you with every little sniffle I’ve had since I was a boy. Is this necessary, really?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Orwin. It's important to know what we're dealing with. The arthritis…is it in both hands?
PATIENT: Both hands, yes. Mostly the knuckles. Makes it difficult to grip things tightly. Though, I manage. I've always been a stubborn Norwegian, you see. Doesn't slow me down too much. Really, Doctor, I’m a very healthy man for my age. I still walk a mile every morning, weather permitting. And I eat my fish. Plenty of fish. Is there a form I can fill out instead of all this questioning? This is taking a great deal of time.
DOCTOR: Walking a mile is good. Fish is good. Still, we need to cover the basics. Have you had any surgeries at all?
PATIENT: Surgeries…let me think. Oh, yes. Appendicitis when I was a young man. Back in Norway, of course. And I had a cataract removed from my left eye about fifteen years ago. That went well enough. Apart from that…no. Nothing major. And certainly nothing cosmetic. This face lift will be my first foray into that world, you see. My daughter picked the doctor, so I trust she knows what she’s doing. Now, are we getting closer to being finished here?
DOCTOR: Right. Appendectomy, cataract removal. And no other surgeries. Family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… honestly, Doctor, that’s a bit of a mess. My father lived to be 92, but he was a…difficult man. Didn't talk about much of anything. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. But it was a long time ago, and nobody really explained it properly. Lots of folks lived long lives, but they were all very… stoic. Didn't bother with doctors much. So, no, I couldn't tell you about any significant conditions. Really, it’s not something we talked about. Can we move on now? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Very well. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I eat everything. Fish, meat, vegetables… I’m Norwegian, you know. We're a hardy people. No allergies. Absolutely none. Though, I do find certain cheeses a bit…strong. But that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like I’m being interrogated. Is this really necessary for a mini face lift?
DOCTOR: It's necessary to assess your overall health, Mr. Orwin. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, yes. Just a small pill for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. Something with a “-pril” in the name, I think. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I believe. Over-the-counter stuff. Nothing fancy. Though, I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. They never agree with me. Now, please, are we almost finished? I’m a busy man.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed. One last thing. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father was very strict about that. And frankly, the idea of willingly inhaling smoke seems… foolish. No, I’ve never smoked. And my daughter would have my hide if I even thought about it. Now, can we finally be done? I really must be going. This has taken far too long. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a quick physical exam. Just a few things to check. Please lie down on the examination table.
