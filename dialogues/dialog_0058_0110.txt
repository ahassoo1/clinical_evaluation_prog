DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Please, call me Nicoletta. Well, I suppose I’m feeling a bit…stuck. Like an old engine that needs a little turning over, you know? I’m 87 years young, and while I don’t feel 87, I certainly don’t feel as spry as I used to. I’m hoping you can help me get a bit of a “jumpstart,” as my daughter puts it.
DOCTOR: “Jumpstart,” alright. And what specifically feels…off?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s not one thing, really. Just…everything feels a little slower. I used to walk every morning, down to the beach, but now…it takes me a bit to get going, and I don’t go as far. And I used to bake for all the neighbors, but I find myself…forgetting ingredients, or just not having the energy for it. It’s silly things, mostly. But my daughter, bless her heart, thinks I should get checked out. She worries so.
DOCTOR: Slower… fatigue… forgetfulness. Okay. And how long have you been noticing these changes, Nicoletta?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… It’s been creeping up on me, really. But I’d say, maybe the last six months or so, it’s become more noticeable. Before that, it was just the occasional “senior moment,” you know? Now…it’s more frequent. I used to be so sharp with my students, always remembering their names and little quirks. Now…well, sometimes it takes a moment. It's a little embarrassing, truth be told.
DOCTOR: Well, memory does naturally decline with age, Nicoletta. It's to be expected. But we'll certainly document it. Now, besides the walking and baking, are you experiencing any other difficulties?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand, dear. I’m not expecting miracles! It’s just…it feels like more than just “age,” if that makes sense? And yes, actually. My appetite isn’t what it used to be. I used to love a good meal, but now…I just don’t feel as hungry. And I’ve been sleeping…well, not badly, but not as soundly. I wake up a lot during the night. Though, I suppose that comes with getting older too.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite and disrupted sleep… Right. Any changes in your vision, hearing, or balance?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. My vision isn’t as good as it used to be, of course. I need reading glasses now, which I’ve had for a few years. But no sudden changes, no blurry spots or anything like that. And my hearing…well, I ask people to repeat themselves sometimes, but that’s been happening for a while. I think I just don't always pay attention! As for balance, I haven’t fallen or anything, but I do feel a little…wobbly sometimes, especially when I stand up quickly. Nothing major, mind you. I just need to take my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Nicoletta?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I have a list here somewhere… Ah, here we are. I take a small dose of Lisinopril for my blood pressure – my doctor prescribed it years ago. And I take a Vitamin D supplement, my daughter insisted on that. She said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. And…that’s it, I think. Just those two things. Though, I do take a little bit of ibuprofen sometimes for my arthritis, but not regularly. It's only when it really flares up.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril, Vitamin D, occasional ibuprofen. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, dear, I don't have any allergies that I know of. Never have. I used to be quite the adventurous eater when I was younger, tried all sorts of things! No reactions or anything like that. Just a strong stomach, I suppose. Although, I don't really eat much shellfish anymore. It just doesn't sit well with me, but I don't think it's an allergy, just a preference.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Nothing extensive, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, dear. There we go. A little creaky, but still going! Do you need me to do anything special?
DOCTOR: Just stand still, please. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, but there's some mild diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, dear, no chest pain or shortness of breath. Sometimes I feel a little winded after walking uphill, but that's to be expected, I think. I'm not as young as I used to be, after all! I haven’t had any trouble breathing while resting or anything like that. Just a little tired after exertion. It's nothing that worries me, really.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s common at your age. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Overall, it doesn’t seem like anything drastically concerning, but given your reported fatigue, forgetfulness and decreased appetite, I think we should run some basic blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying deficiencies or other issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that sounds perfectly sensible. If it will help figure things out, I'm happy to have some blood work done. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? A little “jumpstart” is all I’m asking for.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a Vitamin D level, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We’ll also check your B12 levels. The lab is just down the hall. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. It’s a standard procedure, should only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very thorough, dear. Thank you. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, Vitamin D, and B12… I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and run these tests. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to get back on my feet. And yes, a follow-up appointment would be wonderful. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better already, just knowing we’re getting things checked out.
DOCTOR: Good. The nurse will be with you shortly. In the meantime, if anything changes or you develop any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to call the office. We’ll get you scheduled for a follow-up once the results are back. Have a good day, Ms. McNabb. .
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Thank you so much for your time. I will certainly let you know if anything changes. And I look forward to hearing from you. You have a good day as well, Doctor. .
