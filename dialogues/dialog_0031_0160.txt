DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about this… tiredness. It’s just getting worse, and it’s ridiculous. And… well, I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to be embarrassing, and I don’t understand why I’m doing it. It's not like I haven’t had a good life, you know? It's just...happening.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Hardenburgh. It takes courage to discuss something like that. Let's try to understand what’s going on. You mentioned tiredness that’s worsening, and also… a craving to eat dirt. To clarify, when you say “dirt,” can you describe what kind?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t patronize me. It's dirt. From the garden, mostly. Red clay, sometimes. I don’t go digging up fancy stuff, it’s just… regular dirt. And it’s not like I’m making a meal of it, alright? A little bit here and there. It's not a hobby. Honestly, the tiredness is the bigger problem. I used to be able to do anything, and now… I just want to sit.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my previous question came across as insensitive, Ms. Hardenburgh. It wasn’t my intention. I simply wanted to get a more precise understanding. It’s important to gather as much information as possible. You're right to focus on the tiredness as the primary concern. When did you first start noticing this increasing fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s fine. Doctors always ask silly questions. It started… hmm. Probably about six months ago, I’d say. Gradual, at first. Just feeling a bit more tired at the end of the day. Then it started happening during the day. Now, I can barely get through an afternoon without needing a nap. And that’s… not normal for me. I've always been… active. Still am, when I have the energy. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's concerning when a change in energy level impacts your daily life, especially when you've been consistently active. Six months is a significant period of time. Besides the tiredness and the… dirt-eating, have you noticed any other changes in your body or how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, my stomach hasn’t been the greatest. A bit… unsettled, you know? Not sick, exactly. Just… not right. And I’ve been colder than usual. Even in the summer. My neighbor, Bessie, keeps telling me I look pale. Old women always notice those things, though. They think they know everything. Honestly, it’s probably just getting old. But this tiredness is… different.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing those details, Ms. Hardenburgh. The unsettled stomach and feeling colder, along with the paleness, are important pieces of information. It is good you’re noticing these changes. It’s not necessarily "just getting old," and we need to investigate further. Do you have any history of medical problems, such as anemia, thyroid issues, or anything else significant?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had a hysterectomy… a long time ago. Probably forty years. And I broke my wrist once, falling in the garden. And… that’s about it. I’ve always been lucky, really. Never been one for doctors, to be honest. I take a multi-vitamin sometimes, if I remember. But nothing serious. My mother had high blood pressure, but she ate too much salt. I avoid salt. I don't need all that extra water weight.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hardenburgh. That’s helpful. A history of a hysterectomy is important to note. And knowing you've generally been healthy and avoid excessive salt is good information as well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements, besides the multi-vitamin?
PATIENT: Just the multi-vitamin, like I said. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. The regular kind. Nothing fancy. I try to avoid it if I can, though. It doesn't do much good, honestly. I just… put up with the pain. I've always been good at putting up with things. Now, are you finished asking questions? This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Ms. Hardenburgh. I appreciate your patience. Just a few more questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family had problems with anemia – low blood count – or any other unusual or prolonged illnesses?
PATIENT: Anemia… hmm. My grandmother, on my father's side, she was always tired. Very tired. Bessie says it might have been anemia, but we didn't have doctors back then like we do now. They just said she was "delicate." And my uncle… he had some kind of stomach problem when he was young. Kept complaining about being weak. Not sure what it was, exactly. They lived in Ethiopia, so it was different back then. Now, can we get on with this? I have gardening to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hardenburgh. That’s very helpful. A family history of fatigue and stomach issues is relevant. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if you’re agreeable. I’d like to check your heart rate, blood pressure, listen to your lungs, and do a brief abdominal exam. I also want to look at your nails and the inside of your eyelids. It's a quick process, and will give me a better overall picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don’t poke too much. I bruise easily. And I don't like having cold hands. I told you I was cold. Hurry up, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hardenburgh. I will be as gentle as possible. Your heart rate is 72, which is normal. Blood pressure is 118 over 78, also within the normal range. Lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness in the upper left quadrant. Nothing alarming, but we’ll keep that in mind. Your nails are a bit pale, which is consistent with what you mentioned. And the inside of your eyelids appears slightly paler than usual as well. This could indicate a possible iron deficiency. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of iron deficiency anemia, and also want to investigate the cause of your dirt-eating, which is a condition called pica. It’s often associated with nutritional deficiencies. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. This will include a complete blood count to check your iron levels, and some other basic tests to rule out other potential causes of fatigue. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests. Of course. More waiting. Fine. Do what you have to do. But I don’t want a lot of poking and prodding. And if it’s just low iron, I’m not taking any of those awful iron pills. They make me terribly constipated. Can't they just give me a shot or something? Now, how long is this going to take? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hardenburgh. We can certainly discuss alternatives to iron pills if the blood tests confirm a deficiency. Iron injections are an option, but they do come with their own set of potential side effects. We can also explore dietary changes to increase your iron intake. The blood tests will take about 15-20 minutes to draw, and the results usually come back within 2-3 business days. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once we have the results, so we can discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding eating dirt. While the exact cause of pica isn’t always clear, it’s best to address the underlying nutritional deficiency if that’s what it turns out to be. Would you like me to provide you with a list of iron-rich foods while we await the results?
PATIENT: Iron-rich foods? Honestly. I eat perfectly well. I don't need a list. And I've already told you, I'm not eating a lot of dirt. It’s not like I’m making a habit of it. Just get the tests over with, and let me know the results. I haven’t got all day to spend in a doctor's office. And make sure they don’t poke me too much! Now, where do I go?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’ll make a note to ensure the phlebotomist is gentle during the blood draw. My nurse, Sarah, will escort you to the lab just down the hall. She’ll explain the procedure and answer any questions you may have. Once you're finished, she’ll let me know, and you’re free to go. Here is a lab requisition form, and Sarah will take care of the rest. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just get it over with. I’m tired of talking about it. And I really need to get back to my garden. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. I understand. Sarah will be right with you. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I hope you can get back to your gardening soon.
