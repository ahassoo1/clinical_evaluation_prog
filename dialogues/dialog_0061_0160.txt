DOCTOR: Talofa Candis, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day, so let’s just get on with it. It’s this tiredness, this…weakness. And it’s gotten worse. And…well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been…eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to know it’s not right. Clay, mostly. From the garden. Don't look at me like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. No judgment here, we just need to figure out what's going on. It's good you're telling me everything. You mentioned tiredness and weakness – can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to tell? I’m tired. All the time. Even after a full night’s sleep, which, mind you, isn’t easy these days with the neighbors and their…activities. And I just don't have the energy to do things. Even walking to the mailbox feels like climbing a mountain. It’s been going on for…oh, I don’t know, a couple of months now, maybe longer. I just figured it was old age creeping up on me, but then this dirt-eating started, and…well, it’s unsettling. I used to be strong. I could lift anything. Now…now I struggle with grocery bags.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months of increasing tiredness and weakness, and it’s affecting your daily activities like walking and lifting. And you've noticed this unusual craving for dirt, specifically clay, recently. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s…accurate. Though "craving" makes it sound like I’m enjoying it. I'm not! It just…happens. I'll be in the garden, and suddenly…I need to taste it. It’s a strange feeling. And it doesn't help with the tiredness, if that wasn't obvious. Honestly, I haven't told anyone else. They'd think I’ve lost my mind. What could be causing this? Is it something I'm eating? I eat pretty healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re sharing this with me, and you’re right to want to figure out what’s going on. The dirt-eating, which we call geophagia, can sometimes be a sign of a nutritional deficiency. It's also important to rule out other causes. Let’s go through some questions to get a better picture. First, can you tell me a little bit about what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Ugh, now we're getting into my business. Fine. Breakfast is usually oatmeal, sometimes with fruit if I have any. Lunch is a sandwich, maybe a salad. Nothing fancy. Dinner…depends. Sometimes I cook, sometimes I just have something simple. Soup, leftovers…I try to have a vegetable with most meals, but it's not always possible. I drink a lot of water, and I have a cup of tea in the afternoon. I don't really eat a lot of…processed foods, or sweets. I don't drink alcohol, never have. Does that help? I’m a simple woman with simple tastes.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Candis. It sounds like you have a fairly healthy diet overall. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I’ve been a bit more…forgetful lately, I suppose. Not major things, just…misplacing things, forgetting names. It's probably just age, though. And my skin…it feels dry, even after I moisturize. And sometimes I feel…a bit cold, even when it's warm. Oh, and my nails…they’ve been brittle, breaking easily. Is this getting somewhere, or are we just cataloging the woes of an old woman? I really haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: We're definitely getting somewhere, Candis. These symptoms – the forgetfulness, dry skin, feeling cold, and brittle nails – are all important pieces of the puzzle. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about that? Really? Fine. It’s…irregular. Sometimes constipated, sometimes…not. It’s never been consistent, honestly. And lately, it’s been…worse. I've been trying to drink more water, but it doesn’t always help. It’s embarrassing to talk about, but I’m trying to be…cooperative. Are you going to ask me about anything else unpleasant? Because I’m starting to lose my patience.
DOCTOR: I apologize for asking about personal matters, Candis, but it's important to get a complete picture. No more unpleasant questions for now, I promise. Now, thinking about your past health, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing serious. I had a hysterectomy when I was 40, that’s about it. And my iron was a little low once, a long time ago. They gave me some pills, and it went away. I've never been a sickly person, really. I've always been strong, independent. I used to hike for miles. Until recently, of course. Is this helping? Are we getting closer to figuring out what’s wrong with me? I'd like to get this sorted out quickly, if possible. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a hysterectomy at 40 and a history of low iron that was treated with pills. And otherwise, generally good health. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had…arthritis, I think. Badly. She was in a wheelchair for the last few years of her life. And my father…he had high blood pressure, I believe. He died young, of a heart attack. My sister is still alive, she's a bit frail, but generally healthy. We weren’t a particularly close family, so I don’t know a lot about their medical histories. Does any of that matter? I'm not sure why you need to know about my relatives. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m at a family reunion, not a doctor’s appointment.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Candis, as family history can sometimes point to potential risks. Okay, and finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I'm a pretty…straightforward person. No allergies, no medications, just this tiredness and this… embarrassing habit. Are we done yet? I really need to get going. I have a garden to tend to, even if I don’t have the energy for it. And I'd like to get this figured out before I start… craving more dirt. It’s a bit humiliating to admit, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis, thank you for sharing all of that with me. It’s been very helpful. Based on what you've told me – the tiredness, weakness, geophagia, dry skin, brittle nails, irregular bowel habits, and family history – I'm concerned about the possibility of an iron deficiency anemia, and potentially other nutritional deficiencies as well. The geophagia, craving dirt, can be a sign of that. Now, to confirm this, I’d like to do a physical exam and order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Of course. Just get it over with. The sooner we know what’s wrong, the better. But please, be quick about it. I haven't got all day, you know. And…try not to poke me too much. I don't like needles. And for goodness sake, don't ask me about my bowel movements again. It's been enough.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Candis. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And no more questions about bowel movements, I promise. First, let’s just listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take your blood pressure. Then, I’ll take a look at your skin and nails. After that, we'll get the blood work ordered. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Fine. deep breath. Honestly, I've had better days. Is this going to take long? I have roses that need pruning. And the weeds are taking over. A person can’t just ignore a garden, you know. It's a matter of principle. another deep breath I just don’t understand what’s happening to me. I used to be so strong. So capable. Now…now I'm just tired and craving dirt. It’s humiliating.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, which can sometimes be seen with iron deficiency. Your skin is quite dry, and your nails are definitely brittle. Okay, Candis, that confirms some of my suspicions. Now, for the blood work. We’ll need to check your iron levels, complete blood count, vitamin D, B12, and thyroid function. I'll also order a stool test just to rule out any other possibilities. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back, which usually takes a couple of days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A couple of days? That's… acceptable, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take longer. I need to get this sorted out. I have a life to live, you know. A garden to tend to. And frankly, I'd like to stop feeling like a weakling. So yes, a couple of days sounds alright. Just…please, make sure they’re gentle with the needle. And don't poke me too much. Is that all? Can I go now? I really need to get back to my roses. They won't prune themselves. And I'm starting to feel… anxious. This whole thing is rather unsettling. shifts in chair, looking impatient.
DOCTOR: Yes, Candis, that's all for now. The nurse will be in shortly. I've made a note of your concerns about the needle, and I’ll make sure to let her know. In the meantime, try to get some rest and drink plenty of water. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, get you feeling like yourself again soon. Thank you for coming in today. We’ll be in touch as soon as your results are available.
PATIENT: .
