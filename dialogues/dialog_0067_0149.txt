DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. My name is Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you. Pfennig, you say? Hmm. Well, honestly, it's all a bit of a fuss. My niece, bless her heart, she insisted. Said I had to get this checked out. I don't see what the problem is, but here I am. It’s my feet, of course. What else would a foot doctor be for? But truthfully, I’m not one for all this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Alright, your feet it is. And it's perfectly alright to feel a little hesitant about exams – many people do. We'll go at your pace. So, tell me, what’s been going on with your feet?
PATIENT: Going on? Oh, goodness. It’s just…old age, I suppose. They ache, mostly. A bit stiff when I first get up. Nothing a good rub doesn’t fix, usually. I used to dance, you know. Really dance. Before… well, before things changed. But that was a lifetime ago. This isn't a new thing, Doctor. I've lived with it for years. Why all the concern now?
DOCTOR: It's good to know you've been managing this for a while. Even if it's something you've lived with for years, it's helpful to get it checked out, just to make sure everything is okay and to explore ways to make you more comfortable. Your niece sounds like a caring person to be looking out for you. Could you tell me a little more about the aching?
PATIENT: Caring, yes, she is. A bit too caring sometimes, if you ask me. Always fussing. As for the aching… it’s mostly in the arches, I think. And the heels. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a…a dull throb. Worse in the mornings, like I said, or if I’ve been standing a long time. I don’t do much standing these days, thankfully. Mostly just puttering around the house. Really, I don’t understand why I’m even here. It feels like a waste of everyone’s time.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound like a waste of time at all, Wynell. Even dull aches can be caused by a number of things, and we want to make sure we rule everything out and get you feeling your best. And it’s good to get a baseline, even if things haven't changed dramatically. You mentioned it's worse in the mornings. Does anything relieve the pain, besides rubbing them?
PATIENT: Relieve it? Well, sitting helps. And warm water. I soak my feet sometimes, in Epsom salts. My mother always said that was good for everything. But it doesn't last long, the relief. And honestly, I just try to ignore it. I have things to do, you know? Can’t be fussing with aching feet all day. Though, now that I think of it… it has been a little worse lately. A little more constant, perhaps. But maybe that's just the weather. It’s been so humid.
DOCTOR: That’s good information. Warm water and Epsom salts are a good start. The fact that it’s been a little worse lately is something we should definitely investigate. And you're right to mention the weather – humidity can definitely play a role. Now, besides the aching, have you noticed any other changes in your feet?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… Well, they're not as…flexible as they used to be, I suppose. I can't bend my toes over like I once could. And my toenails… they're always so thick, it's hard to cut them myself. I have to ask my niece, and she complains about it something fierce. Says I should come to a professional. Honestly, it's just old age. Everything starts to go when you get to be my age. Do you have to poke at them now? I really don't like being touched.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and we’ll definitely take things slowly. We don’t have to do anything you’re not comfortable with. The thick toenails and decreased flexibility are important things to note. It sounds like there could be a few things going on, and a quick examination will help me get a better idea of what’s happening. It’s not necessarily something serious, but it’s best to rule things out. Would you mind if I just take a look at your feet?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I really don’t see the point. But if you must, I suppose. Just… be gentle. And don’t take too long. I have a casserole in the oven, you know. And my niece will be here any minute to check on me. She’ll fuss if dinner’s not on time. Do I have to take my shoes off now? I have on my good support stockings. They're terribly expensive, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, we’ll go as slowly as you like. And yes, we’ll need to take your shoes and stockings off so I can get a good look. We’ll take our time getting them off and be very careful. Don't worry, we'll be quick, and I'll be mindful of your casserole and your niece. Would you like a hand taking them off?
PATIENT: Well, alright. A hand would be nice, actually. My back isn’t what it used to be. Careful with the stockings, now. They snag easily. And don't stare, Doctor. It's just feet. Everyone has them. Though, mine have seen better days, I'll admit.
DOCTOR: There’s no need to feel self-conscious, Wynell. I see feet all day, and we're simply looking to see what's going on. Alright, let's take a look. I'm noticing some mild swelling in both ankles, and your arches seem a bit flattened. Your toenails are quite thick, as you mentioned, and I see some slight redness around a few of them. Are those areas tender to the touch?
PATIENT: Tender? Hmm. Not particularly. A little uncomfortable, maybe, when I press right there. But I've lived with it for so long, I barely notice it anymore. My niece says I need to see about getting them… trimmed, I think she called it. Something about ingrown toenails. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to what she says. She worries too much. Is there something wrong, Doctor? You’re frowning.
DOCTOR: I'm not frowning at you, Wynell, just concentrating. You are right, the nail on your left big toe is a little thickened, and there's some mild inflammation around the edge. It does look like it could be the beginning of an ingrown toenail. It's not severe yet, but it could become more painful and infected if left untreated. Your niece is right to be concerned. Your pulses are good, and I don’t see any other major concerns right now. However, I also notice some dryness and cracking on your heels. Do you have any diabetes or problems with circulation?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Goodness, no. My mother lived to be ninety-seven, and she didn't have diabetes. I eat a sensible diet, mostly. Though, I do have a weakness for sweets. As for circulation… I get cold feet sometimes, but that's just from getting old. And the dryness? Well, I live in Florida. It's always humid here. Though, it gets terribly dry in the winter, when the snowbirds come down. Honestly, Doctor, I think all this poking and prodding is unnecessary. Are you sure there's something wrong? I feel perfectly fine, all things considered.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Wynell. And you're right, you're doing remarkably well for your age. However, even without diabetes, dry skin and ingrown toenails are common concerns, especially as we get older, and they can lead to discomfort or even infection if left unaddressed. We're not necessarily looking for something dramatically wrong, but rather trying to prevent potential problems and keep you as comfortable and mobile as possible. Based on what I’ve seen, I recommend a few things. First, we could trim your toenails properly to avoid further ingrown nail development. Second, I recommend a good foot cream to address the dryness and cracking. And third, given the mild swelling, I’d like to rule out any underlying circulation issues. To do that, I’d like to order a simple blood test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A blood test? Oh, goodness. I hate needles. Absolutely hate them. Is it absolutely necessary? I haven't had a blood test in… well, I can't even remember. Probably decades. And all this for a little dryness and a slightly ingrown nail? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to think your niece sent me here just to bother me. Can’t we just trim the nail and be done with it? I really don’t want to spend the whole afternoon in a doctor’s office. I have a casserole to finish.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Wynell, and we certainly don’t want to do anything you’re not comfortable with. And you're right, it's not always necessary. However, the blood test would give us a clearer picture of your overall health and rule out any potential circulation issues that could be contributing to the swelling. It's a simple test, and we can make it as quick and comfortable as possible. If you’re truly uncomfortable with a blood test right now, we can skip it. However, I would still strongly recommend the toenail trimming and a good foot cream. We can monitor the swelling, and if it gets worse, we can revisit the blood test later. Would that be a compromise you’d be comfortable with?
PATIENT: Hmmm. Just the trimming and the cream, then. No blood tests. I’m not getting any younger, you know. And frankly, I don’t want to spend my remaining years poking around in doctor’s offices. As long as you promise to be gentle with the trimming. And don’t make me come back for another visit unless absolutely necessary. I really do have a casserole to finish. It's my niece's favorite. She'd be terribly upset if it's not perfect.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. Just the trimming and the cream it is. And I promise to be as gentle as possible with the trimming. We'll do everything we can to make it as comfortable for you as possible. And I absolutely understand about the casserole – we want to keep your niece happy! Now, let’s get started with the trimming. I’ll explain each step as I go, and please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. We'll take our time. First, I’m going to soak your feet in some warm water…
