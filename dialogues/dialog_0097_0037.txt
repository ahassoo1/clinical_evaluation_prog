DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… I have been… having trouble with my breathing. Like a whistling sound, when I breathe. It is… worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, a whistling sound when you breathe. That is something we should definitely look into. Can you tell me a bit more about that whistling?
PATIENT: Yes. It happens mostly when I… when I try to do things. Like, walking. Or even just… standing up from a chair. Not always, but… often. It feels… tight in my chest, then the whistling sound comes. It’s been going on for… maybe a week? I not sure exactly. Time… it goes quickly.
DOCTOR: A week, okay. And it's linked to activity, so walking or standing up. And you feel tightness in your chest before the whistling starts?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Tightness… then the whistling. It is not a bad pain, not sharp. More like… a squeeze. And it does not happen when I am… resting. When I sit very still, I am okay. But then… I want to do things! You understand? It makes me not want to move.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Margret. It's frustrating when your body limits what you want to do. So, it sounds like the whistling and tightness are triggered by exertion. Have you noticed anything else that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The cold air… makes it worse. If I go outside when it is chilly, it starts up quicker. And… sometimes, if I drink something warm, like tea, it feels a little bit better for a little while. Not much, but… a little. I also… I used to walk every morning. Very fast. But I stopped when this started. I thought maybe… rest would help.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold air makes it worse, warm drinks offer some temporary relief, and you've been resting, understandably. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, just to get a fuller picture. Have you had any cough along with this whistling sound?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No cough. Just the whistling. And the… squeeze in my chest. My throat feels… normal. It is only when I breathe. I am… a little worried it is my heart. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all to be worried about your heart, Margret. It's good you're thinking about these things. We'll definitely explore that possibility, as we should with any chest symptoms. Now, have you had any other symptoms – things like swelling in your ankles or feet, dizziness, or feeling unusually tired?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My feet are… normal. I walk a lot, so they sometimes ache, but no swelling. And… I feel tired sometimes, but I am 76 years old! I think that is normal, yes? I do not… I do not get dizzy. No, nothing like that. I am… usually quite strong, for my age. I used to help my son with gardening. Lots of bending and lifting.
DOCTOR: You're very active for your age, that's wonderful! Okay, no swelling, no dizziness, and feeling generally okay energy-wise besides the limitations this breathing issue is causing. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had… a problem with my blood pressure, many years ago. The doctor gave me pills, and it was fine. I stopped taking the pills… maybe ten years ago? He said it was okay then. And… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. But other than that… nothing much. I try to eat healthy, and I walk a lot. I did, until recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, managed with medication and then discontinued, and gallbladder removal. Good to know. And no other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. I do not think so. I see my son sometimes, and he helps me remember things. He is a very good son. He would tell you if there was something I forgot. He is very… organized. But… no, I do not think I have any other health problems.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pills. I take a vitamin every day, but that is all. A small one. For my bones. My son… he said I should. He worries about me. But no other medicine. Not for blood pressure, not for pain, nothing. Just the vitamin.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a daily vitamin. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like foods, pollen, or animals?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I eat everything. Sometimes my nose gets a little itchy in the spring, with the flowers. But that is normal, yes? It is not… a bad allergy. Just a little tickle. But no bad allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. My son always asks me, but no, nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. That's good. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and oxygen level, and just have a general look around. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need. I trust you. My son says… you are a very good doctor. He read… something about you on the computer. So, please, do whatever you need to help me. I want to go back to my walking.
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you and your son. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but not critically high. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, especially when you take a deep breath. It's subtle, but it explains the whistling sound you described. I'm also going to listen to your back. Everything sounds clear there. And your oxygen level is good, thankfully. One more thing, I'm going to have you take a few deep breaths while I listen again. The wheezing does get a bit more noticeable with exertion. Now, based on what you've told me and what I'm hearing, it's likely this is some form of airway narrowing. It could be asthma, even if it develops later in life, or another lung condition. To be sure, I’d like to order a chest x-ray and a simple breathing test – a spirometry – to see how well your lungs are functioning. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. An x-ray and a… a breathing test. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what is wrong. And I want to be able to walk again. I trust you. Will the test… be painful?
DOCTOR: No, the tests won't be painful at all, Margret. The chest x-ray is just a quick picture – you'll stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. And the breathing test involves you taking deep breaths into a mouthpiece. It’s a little effort, but completely painless. We’ll get the results back quickly, and then we can discuss the best treatment options to get you back to your walking. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler. It will help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It’s safe to use and many people find it helpful. Would you like me to explain how to use the inhaler now?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Explain the inhaler. I… I am not very good with those things. My son… he usually helps me. But I want to learn. I want to be able to do it myself. I just… I worry I will do it wrong.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no problem at all. It's very common to be a little unsure at first. This is a rescue inhaler, meaning you only use it when you're having trouble breathing or before activity. First, you shake the inhaler well. Then, you take a deep breath and exhale completely. Next, you put the inhaler in your mouth, forming a tight seal with your lips around the mouthpiece. As you start to inhale slowly and deeply, press down on the canister to release the medication. Continue inhaling deeply for about 10 seconds, and then hold your breath for a few seconds. Finally, exhale slowly. It's important to rinse your mouth with water after each use to prevent any thrush – a mild yeast infection in the mouth. Do you want to try it?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I will try. Oh dear. I think… I did it wrong. It feels strange. And I think… I did not breathe in deep enough. I am so sorry. My hands are… a little shaky. This is harder than it looks. Perhaps… my son should be here. He is very good at these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Margret. It is a little tricky at first, and your hands being shaky is completely understandable. It’s not something to feel bad about at all. We’ll practice a few more times. Let's take it slow. The most important thing is to exhale fully before inhaling. Let’s try that together. Take a deep breath in… and now exhale slowly and completely. Good. Now, we’ll focus on forming a tight seal with your lips around the mouthpiece. Imagine you’re sipping through a straw. Okay, now take a deep breath, exhale, form a tight seal, and as you inhale slowly, press down on the canister. Better! A little more practice and you’ll get it down perfectly. Do you feel comfortable trying a couple more times on your own, and I’ll watch and offer guidance?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will try. I think… I did it a little better that time. But I still… worry I am not getting enough of the medicine. And I am afraid… I will forget how to do it when I am at home. My memory… it is not what it used to be. Perhaps… a picture would help? A picture of how to hold it? And how to breathe? My son always says… pictures are good.
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent idea, Margret! A picture is absolutely helpful, and I’m happy to print one out for you with clear instructions. I can even write down a simple reminder checklist for you to keep with the inhaler. And don't worry about forgetting – it's completely normal to need reminders, especially with something new. We can also have the pharmacist go over it with you again when you pick up the prescription, and they can answer any questions you might have. Let’s make sure I have your address correct so I can send you the information later today. Okay, and just to recap: you'll use this inhaler if you feel your breathing getting tight, or 15 minutes before any activity you plan to do. If your symptoms don’t improve after using the inhaler, or if they get worse, please don’t hesitate to call my office. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. You have been very kind. And very patient. I am grateful. You have made me feel… much better, just talking to you. Now… I hope I can walk again soon. That is all I want. Perhaps… a little slower than before. But to walk… in the fresh air. That would be wonderful. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: It was lovely meeting you too, Margret. And I understand completely – getting back to your walking is a very achievable goal, and we'll do everything we can to help you get there. I’ll get the nurse to schedule the chest x-ray and spirometry for you, and we’ll send those results to you as soon as they’re available. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns or questions at all. And remember, take it slow, and listen to your body. Have a wonderful day, Margret! And I hope to see you again soon.
