DOCTOR: Hi Dorman, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. My… weakness, it keeps getting worse. It’s in my legs mostly, but sometimes my arms feel it too. It’s… hard to explain. It just feels like they don’t want to go. You know? Like they’re too heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds frustrating when your body isn’t cooperating the way it should. “Too heavy,” that’s a good way to describe it. When did you first start noticing this weakness, Dorman?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It was… a while ago now. Maybe… six months? No, longer. A year, maybe a year and a half? It started small. Just a little bit harder to get up from a chair. I thought it was just getting old, to be honest. But it’s… not stopping. It’s getting more each month. It’s worrying my wife, Leilani.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over the past year or so. And it has been progressively worsening, not staying the same. That’s important information. Is it worse at certain times of the day, or after doing specific activities?
PATIENT: Not really… not that I’ve noticed. It’s… just there. Some days are better than others, I suppose. But it’s not like it gets much worse after walking, or anything. It just… is. It’s mostly in the mornings, I think, that it feels the worst. Hard to get moving, you know? But even in the afternoon, after resting, it’s still… there. It's a constant thing, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, a constant weakness, more noticeable in the mornings. And it affects both legs, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, both legs. And sometimes my arms, like I said, but mostly my legs. It’s… hard to walk long distances now. I used to love to walk down to the beach with Leilani, but now… I have to stop and rest a lot. It makes me sad. I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand that’s frustrating, Dorman, and it’s completely reasonable to feel sad about that. It’s good you’re sharing this with me. Let’s talk a bit more about the rest of your body. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My vision… sometimes it gets blurry. Not all the time, but… yes, blurry. And my hands… they get numb sometimes. Like when I’m holding something. Not always, but it happens. And… I get tired easily. Very easily. Even just… talking sometimes makes me tired. It's strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision, numbness in your hands, and fatigue. Those are all important things to note. Do you recall if the blurry vision happens at specific times, or is it random?
PATIENT: It's… random, I think. It comes and goes. It doesn’t happen every day. But when it does, it’s like… looking through a fog. Not a strong fog, but… enough to make things hard to see. It usually goes away after a few minutes, or if I blink a lot. It doesn't bother me too much, but it worries Leilani. She says I shouldn’t be driving when my vision is blurry.
DOCTOR: That's good that it's temporary, but Leilani is right to be concerned about the driving. We’ll definitely need to address that. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on medicine and it’s been good since then. And… oh, I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But that’s healed now. Nothing else, really. I’ve been mostly healthy, all my life. That’s why this… weakness is so strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous broken wrist that has healed. And you said the high blood pressure is currently well-controlled?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Very well controlled. I take my medicine every day, just like the doctor told me. No problems with that. Leilani makes sure of it! She’s very good at keeping me on track.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, and it’s wonderful to have that support. What about any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. Never had any problems with that. I can eat anything, take any medicine… as long as it doesn’t make me sick! But really, no allergies at all. My wife always asks when I go to the doctor, and I always tell her the same thing. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And what medications are you currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the one, Doctor. For my blood pressure. It’s… a small white pill. I think it’s called… amlodipine? Yes, amlodipine. Five milligrams. One every morning. That’s it. Nothing else. I don’t like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine 5mg daily for blood pressure. Good. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. My mother... she had arthritis when she got older. Very bad arthritis in her hands and knees. And my father... he had heart problems. He passed away when he was in his seventies. That’s about all I can think of. Nothing else major that I know of. My family… we didn’t talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of arthritis in your mother and heart problems in your father. And finally, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink alcohol. Not anymore. I used to, a little bit, when I was younger. But I stopped many years ago. And… no, no drugs. Never had any interest in that. I like to eat healthy, mostly. Leilani cooks very good food.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, no drugs. Healthy diet. That's all very helpful information, Dorman. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your strength and reflexes. Will that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. But I'll try my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated today, but not drastically. I'm hearing a murmur, which we'll want to keep an eye on. Your lungs sound good. Now, I'm going to check your strength in your arms and legs. Please push against my hand when I ask you to. Alright. Your arms feel pretty strong, but your legs are a bit weaker than they should be. And your reflexes are a little sluggish in your legs. I also want to check your gait - would you mind walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can walk. Here. Like this. It’s… not as easy as it used to be, you know. I have to… think about each step.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Dorman. That was helpful. You’re right, it does look like you're having some difficulty with your walking. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam findings—the weakness in your legs, the decreased reflexes, and the gait abnormalities—it sounds like you may be experiencing some neuropathy, potentially combined with some vascular issues contributing to the weakness. It’s a bit too early to say definitively without further testing, but these findings warrant further investigation. I’d like to order a blood test to check your vitamin levels, kidney function, and thyroid function. I also want to order an MRI of your lower back to rule out any compression of the nerves in your spine. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. If that’s what you think is best, then yes. Whatever tests you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? This weakness… it’s scary. An MRI… is that… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Dorman, and you’re right to want answers. The MRI will give us a much clearer picture of what’s happening in your spine. As for whether it’s uncomfortable, it’s not painful, but it does require you to lie very still in a narrow tube for about 30-40 minutes. Some people feel a little claustrophobic, but we can give you some medication to help with that if you’re concerned. We’ll have a technician monitoring you the whole time, and you’ll be able to communicate with them if you need anything. I'll also write you a prescription for some Vitamin D supplements to start with, as low levels can contribute to weakness. While we're waiting for the test results, I would recommend you avoid any strenuous activity and continue to take your blood pressure medication as prescribed. Also, I'll put in a referral to a neurologist. They're the specialists in nerve disorders, and they'll be able to provide further evaluation and treatment options. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. A neurologist… that’s… reassuring. And the medication… okay. I’ll take the medication. And I’ll try to rest. I’m a little worried about the MRI… but I trust you. And if I get too scared… they can give me something? That’s good to know. Thank you, Doctor Rosanova. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dorman. It's my job, and I'm glad I could help. And yes, absolutely, if you feel at all anxious during the MRI, they can give you some medication to help you relax. Don’t hesitate to tell the technician if you're feeling uncomfortable. I’m going to write up the orders for the blood tests and the MRI now, and give you a referral to a neurologist. You can schedule those appointments at the front desk on your way out. Also, I'll give you some written instructions about preparing for the MRI. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as numbness or tingling in your arms or legs, or difficulty with your balance, please call the office immediately. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment with me in about two weeks to discuss the test results and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfect. Two weeks… okay. I'll remember that. And I’ll call if anything changes. Thank you again, Doctor Rosanova. You’ve put my mind at ease, a little bit. I really appreciate your kindness. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go schedule those appointments. This has been a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dorman. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And take care of yourself. I'll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: .
