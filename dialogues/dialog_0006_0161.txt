DOCTOR: Alright, Helaina. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor Gorga. Honestly? A friend of mine… she suggested I come talk to you about something. It’s about… staying safe, you know? She mentioned a pill you could prescribe. Something to… prevent things. I don’t really understand all the details, but she said it was a good idea.
DOCTOR: Right… staying safe. A preventative pill, you said. Hmm. Okay. To be sure I understand, are you talking about something to prevent… infections?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it! Infections. She said… well, she's been with a lot of people, and she wanted me to be careful, too. I haven't… I haven't been very careful, to be honest, and I'm getting older, and she said it's a good idea to have something just in case. I don’t want to end up sick, you know? It’s… it’s a little embarrassing to talk about.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to be embarrassed, it’s good you’re thinking about this. So, we’re talking about preventing sexually transmitted infections… or STIs. And your friend recommended something preventative. Before we go any further, let's just get a little more information. Have you ever been tested for STIs before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A long time ago. When I was… younger. Probably in my twenties. I think it was just a basic panel, you know? Blood test, maybe? I don’t really remember the specifics. It came back negative then, but that was… decades ago. And things change, don't they? I haven’t been with anyone new since then, not really, but… well, it's better to be safe, like my friend said. She keeps up with everything.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay, a test decades ago. Things do change, you’re right. And it’s good to be cautious. Now, just to get a clearer picture... are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes. Not… regularly. It's… complicated. A friend, occasionally. It's not a committed relationship, if that makes sense. More… companionship. We don’t always… use protection, and honestly, I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately. That’s why I’m here. I'm starting to worry, you know? I don't want to put either of us at risk.
DOCTOR: Okay. Companionship, occasional… and not always protected. I understand your concerns. Alright. Let's talk about PrEP – Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. That's likely what your friend was referring to. It’s a medication you take to prevent HIV infection. It's very effective, but it's not a shield against all STIs. We'd need to do some blood work to make sure you're a good candidate. It also requires regular check-ups. Does that sound like something you’d be interested in?
PATIENT: HIV… yes, she mentioned that. Preventing that, specifically. Regular check-ups and blood work… that sounds okay. A little inconvenient, maybe, but if it keeps me safe… yes, I think so. I just… I don't know much about it. What does it involve, exactly? Are there side effects? I get nervous about taking pills, you know? My stomach isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. We can definitely discuss it. So, PrEP is a daily pill – there’s also an injectable option now, but the pill is more common. It works by preventing HIV from establishing an infection if you're exposed. It doesn't protect against other STIs, so we'd still need to talk about safe sex practices. As for side effects… most people don't have any, but some can experience nausea, headaches, or fatigue. Rarely, there can be kidney issues, which is why we'd need regular blood tests. We'll monitor your kidney function closely. Now, before we move on… do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have high blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication. And I had a knee replacement about five years ago. Other than that… not really. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age! Oh, and I'm allergic to penicillin. That’s important, right? A bad reaction when I was a kid. Rashes, swelling… a whole thing. And… I think that's it. Mostly just getting old, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, controlled. Knee replacement five years ago. Penicillin allergy – that’s very important, thank you for telling me. And yes, getting older does come with a few things! Alright, one more thing before we talk about potential testing. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, for the blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. 20 milligrams, once a day. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knee, when it acts up. Just over-the-counter, though. Nothing fancy. That’s it, I promise! I’m usually pretty good about remembering my pills, but sometimes… well, sometimes I forget. Don't judge me!
DOCTOR: No judgment here, Helaina. Lisinopril 20mg daily, and ibuprofen as needed. Okay, that’s good to know. Alright, so we’ve covered a lot. Before we decide about PrEP, I want to do a full STI screening, just to get a baseline. We'll also need some blood work to check your kidney function and make sure you're a good candidate for the medication. And given your penicillin allergy, we'll avoid any antibiotics in the penicillin family, of course. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A baseline, blood work… all of it. I want to be thorough. And avoiding penicillin, definitely. I trust you. When do we do it? I need to get this over with, honestly. I’ve been worrying about this for weeks. Is it… painful? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. I understand your anxiety. The STI screening involves a blood draw and a urine sample. We might also need to do a swab for some tests. The blood draw… well, it’s a little pinch, but it's usually over quickly. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood, she’s very good. The urine sample is just… well, you know. As for the swab, it depends on which tests we're doing, but it’s generally not very uncomfortable. We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. Let me get the nurse in here, and we can get started. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… as good as it can be. A pinch… okay. And a nurse… that’s good. They’re usually nicer than doctors. Let's get it over with, then. The sooner I know, the sooner I can stop worrying. Thank you, Doctor Gorga. I appreciate you explaining everything.
