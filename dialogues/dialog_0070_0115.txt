DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Oh, dear. What does bring me in… It’s my… a friend of mine, actually. She’s been feeling quite unwell. A sort of… yellowing. Yes, a yellowing of the skin, and the whites of her eyes. She has… trouble with her liver, I believe. Something about hepatitis. It's all rather confusing. I hope you can help. I’d like to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Durig. It sounds concerning, and it’s good you’re bringing her in. Yellowing of the skin and eyes – what we call jaundice – can certainly indicate a liver issue. Hepatitis is one possibility, yes, but there are other causes as well. To help me understand what’s going on with your friend, could you tell me a little more about her symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Symptoms… Well, she’s very tired. More tired than usual, and she’s always been… a bit of a napper, you see. And she’s lost her appetite. Doesn’t seem to want much food. She also complains of… a dull ache, somewhere around her abdomen. It’s hard to pinpoint, she says. And… she's been rather… forgetful lately, which isn’t like her at all. Though, at my age, one forgets things… I don't recall much else, truly. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Durig, that’s very helpful indeed. Fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort, and increased forgetfulness – those are all important pieces of the puzzle. When did these symptoms begin?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Dates… That’s always the trouble. Let me think… It began… sometime this spring, I believe. Perhaps… March? Or April? It was after the… the bad rain we had. No, wait. It was before the rain. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn't what it used to be. It all feels rather… blurred. Perhaps a few months ago, at least? It’s hard to say precisely. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Durig. It’s perfectly normal to have difficulty recalling exact dates. “A few months ago” is a good starting point. Has she experienced any other symptoms during this time?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. She mentioned feeling… nauseous sometimes. Not vomiting, just… unwell to her stomach. And her urine… yes, her urine has been rather dark. A sort of… tea color. She pointed it out to me one day. And… oh! She’s been very itchy. All over, she says. But I suppose those could just be… summer bugs. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Durig, those are all important things to know. Nausea, dark urine, and itching… These symptoms, along with the others you’ve described, are certainly raising some concerns. Now, could you tell me a bit about her medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, dear. She’s… not one for doctors, my friend. Never has been. She’s always been… remarkably healthy, actually. Until recently, of course. She did have… a bout of something when she was younger. A fever, I think. And a rash. But I don’t recall the details. It was a long time ago. She’s never been hospitalized, if that’s what you’re asking. And she doesn't take any… regular medications. Just the occasional pain reliever for her arthritis. Honestly, Doctor, I'm afraid I'm not much help. She keeps most of that information to herself.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Durig. You’re doing everything you can. It’s understandable that she may not have a detailed medical history readily available. Do you know if she has any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t believe so. She’s never mentioned any. She likes… shellfish, and she eats peanuts. She’s always been fine with those. And… she uses a scented lotion. A rose scent, I think. No reactions to that, either. Honestly, Doctor, she’s quite… robust. Usually. This is… very worrying. I really wish I could be more helpful. Perhaps she has something written down somewhere, but I doubt it.
DOCTOR: You've been very helpful, Ms. Durig. It’s good to know she doesn’t have any known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to perform a physical examination, if that's alright with you. This will involve listening to her heart and lungs, checking her abdomen, and looking for any signs of jaundice or other abnormalities. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical examination… Well… I suppose so. But… is it absolutely necessary? She’s… rather private, you see. And she doesn’t like being fussed over. But… if you think it’s important… yes. I suppose so. Just… please be gentle? And explain everything you’re doing. She gets… anxious, easily. Perhaps you could tell me what you’re looking for, as well?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Durig. I understand her concerns, and I’ll be as gentle and thorough as possible. I’ll explain everything I’m doing before I do it. I’ll start by listening to her heart and lungs with a stethoscope to check for any unusual sounds. Then, I’ll gently examine her abdomen to see if there’s any tenderness or enlargement, particularly in the area of the liver and spleen. I’ll also look for signs of jaundice – yellowing of the skin and eyes – and check for any swelling in her legs or feet. I’ll also check her vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. I’m primarily looking for signs that might indicate a liver problem, such as tenderness, enlargement, or jaundice. The vital signs can also give us clues about her overall health. Would you like me to proceed?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. But… slowly. And explain everything as you go. And… if she becomes upset, please just… stop. She’s not a young woman anymore, you see. Let’s… let’s just get this over with. I do hope you find something out. This uncertainty is… quite dreadful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. We’ll take things slowly and at her pace. I’ll explain everything as I go, and we’ll stop immediately if she becomes uncomfortable. First, I’m going to listen to her heart and lungs. I’m listening for any unusual sounds – murmurs, crackles, or wheezes. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles auscultated. Now, I’m going to gently feel her abdomen. I’m looking for any tenderness, enlargement, or masses. Is there any pain here?
PATIENT: She… she flinches a bit. There. On the… upper right side. Yes, that’s where she feels the discomfort. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. She doesn't usually complain, you see. And… yes, it feels… slightly swollen. But perhaps that’s just… gas? I don't know. She’s never been one for complaining about gas, either. Honestly, Doctor, I'm afraid I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: I see. It does seem tender to the touch on the upper right side, and there is some mild fullness. It could be a number of things, Ms. Durig, and it's too early to say definitively. Fullness can be caused by gas, but the tenderness is more concerning. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look at the whites of her eyes – the sclera – to see if there’s any yellowing. Yes, there is some definite jaundice present. The sclera are noticeably yellowed. Finally, I'm just going to check for any swelling in her ankles. There's a bit of swelling here. Alright, Ms. Durig, that completes the physical exam. Based on what I've observed – the tenderness in her abdomen, the jaundice, and the swelling in her ankles – I'm concerned about a possible liver issue. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Oh dear. More tests. Very well. If you think it's necessary. But… what kind of tests? And will they be… painful? She doesn't like needles. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel quite overwhelmed. But… yes. If it will help her, then… yes, do the tests. But please, be as gentle as possible. And… explain everything before you do it, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. I understand your concerns, and I’ll explain everything before I do it. The blood tests aren’t usually painful, just a quick pinch. I’d like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, which will give us information about her liver function, kidney function, and electrolyte levels. I’ll also order a complete blood count to check her red and white blood cells. And finally, I’ll order a bilirubin test to confirm the jaundice and see how elevated her bilirubin levels are. We will also order a Hepatitis panel to see if there’s an acute or chronic infection. A phlebotomist will draw a small amount of blood from her arm. It will take just a few minutes. The results will be available in a couple of days, and we’ll discuss them in detail at that time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A couple of days… Yes. A couple of days. That… that sounds alright. As long as it doesn’t take too much longer. And… will she need to fast before the tests? She gets… quite irritable when she’s hungry. And… will you be the one to explain the results? I… I’d prefer it if it was you. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather frightening. I just want to get her well.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Durig, I understand. It's natural to be frightened. I’ll be the one to explain the results to you, and I'll do my best to answer all of your questions. Yes, she will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood tests. No food or drinks except for water. But we can schedule the appointment for a time that’s convenient for her, and we can make sure she’s comfortable. And don't worry, we will get through this. We'll take it one step at a time. I'm going to write the lab orders now. And then we can schedule the appointment for the blood tests. Does tomorrow morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… Yes. Tomorrow morning would be… alright. As long as it’s not too early. She doesn’t get up before eight o’clock, usually. And… will the results be sent directly to you? Or will I need to come back to pick them up? Honestly, Doctor, I'm afraid I'm not very good with these things. My memory isn’t what it used to be. And… is there anything she should do to prepare for the tests, other than fasting? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Durig, that’s perfectly alright. We can schedule the appointment for 9:00 am tomorrow morning. That should give her plenty of time. The results will be sent directly to my office. I will contact you as soon as they are available. And I will make sure to explain everything to you in a clear and easy-to-understand way. Other than fasting, there isn’t much she needs to do to prepare for the tests. She can continue taking any of her usual medications, except for any blood thinners, if she is on any. But I believe she mentioned not taking any, so that shouldn't be an issue. It is also important that she stays well-hydrated before the tests. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. Thank you for being so patient with me. And… for explaining everything so clearly. I just… I worry about her. She’s always been so strong. And now… now she’s not herself. I suppose we’ll just have to wait for the tests. And hope for the best.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Durig. It’s my pleasure. I understand your worry, and I’ll do everything I can to help her. We will take things one step at a time, and we'll work through this together. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. I will see you tomorrow morning at 9:00 am. Have a good rest of your day, Ms. Durig.
