DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're a new patient with Medicare, and that you’re 52 years of age. Welcome to the practice. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don't really… remember exactly when it started, honestly. It’s been a while, though. A long while. It's just… draining, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. "Tiredness," or fatigue, is quite common. It’s helpful to try and pinpoint when it began, but I appreciate it can be difficult to recall. A “long while” could mean weeks, months, even years. Can you describe the tiredness?
PATIENT: Years, I think. Definitely years. It's not like… I pulled a muscle or something, you know? It’s just… everything feels heavy. Like I'm pushing through mud all the time. Even after a full night’s sleep, I wake up… still tired. And it doesn’t really get better throughout the day, just… stays that way. Is that… helpful? I don't know what doctors need to know these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Licano. “Heavy” and “pushing through mud” – I’m making notes. Constant fatigue, even after adequate sleep, is significant. To clarify, when you say "adequate sleep," approximately how many hours are you sleeping each night?
PATIENT: Oh, um… seven, maybe eight? Sometimes more if I can. I used to be a very good sleeper, but… not anymore. I wake up a lot, you know? Not every hour, but… enough to feel it in the morning. It's not like I’m tossing and turning, just… aware I’m awake. My husband… well, he used to say I snored, but that doesn’t matter now, does it?
DOCTOR: Seven to eight hours can be adequate, yes, but disrupted sleep certainly complicates things. And your husband’s observation does matter, Ms. Licano. Snoring can be indicative of sleep apnea, which can contribute to daytime fatigue. Let’s move on. Beyond the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Sleep… apnea? I don't think so. He just said I woke people up, that's all. Oh… symptoms? Let me think. I get… aches. Little ones, all over. And I’m a bit forgetful. Not like… losing things every five minutes, but… names, sometimes. Dates. Little things. It's embarrassing, really. My memory was always good.
DOCTOR: Aches and increasing forgetfulness. Alright. We’ll certainly address those. Are these aches constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go. Mostly when it's… damp. You know? Like before a rainstorm. Or when it’s really cold. They’re not…sharp. Just dull. And they move around. My knees one day, my back the next. It's not like a proper injury, you understand? More like… old age creeping in.
DOCTOR: I see. Fluctuating aches, worsened by weather changes. Ms. Licano, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Oh… weight. I haven't really been keeping track, to be honest. I think… maybe I've lost a little? My clothes feel a bit looser, but…I wouldn’t know exactly. I haven’t stepped on a scale in ages. It used to upset my husband, if I worried about my weight.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will get a current weight during the examination. Now, regarding your medical history, have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My husband… he had high blood pressure, near the end. But I never did. I went to the doctor regularly, when he was sick. To take care of him, mostly. I think… the doctor said my cholesterol was a little high once, but they didn’t give me anything for it. Just told me to eat better. That was… years ago.
DOCTOR: No prior chronic conditions, borderline high cholesterol noted some time ago. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I always tried to avoid them, if I could. Seemed… risky. A friend of mine, she had a hip replacement… it didn’t end well. No, I’ve never had surgery. Just… the usual bumps and bruises, you know?
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother… she lived to be old, very old. But she had… dementia, near the end. My father… he died young, a heart attack, I think. And my sister… she had cancer. Lung cancer. But that was… a long time ago. They’re both gone now.
DOCTOR: History of dementia in mother, early death due to heart attack in father, lung cancer in sister. And finally, regarding your lifestyle - do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit when my sister got sick. He didn't want to… encourage her. I always hated the smell. I do… enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: One glass of wine with dinner – noted. Now, regarding allergies, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean… I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… a sensitive nose, maybe. No, no serious allergies. I can take most medications, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Licano, thank you for that comprehensive history. Now, I’d like to proceed with a brief physical examination. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Just get it over with, please. It's just… tiring, talking about all this. I have… things to do, you know? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Listens carefully. Your heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Checks reflexes Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Takes blood pressure Your blood pressure is 138/86. A bit elevated, but not alarming. Palpates abdomen gently Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Looks at patient over glasses Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright. It doesn’t hurt. Just… feeling a bit lightheaded now. Maybe it's all this… poking and prodding. I feel rather foolish being examined like this.
DOCTOR: You’re not being foolish, Ms. Licano. A physical examination is a necessary part of assessing your condition. Lightheadedness is noted. Given your fatigue, elevated blood pressure, and family history, I think it's prudent to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, and a Vitamin D level. We also need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues, so an EKG is also warranted. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Honestly, I just want to know what’s wrong with me. If anything is wrong. But… fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, I suppose. Just… please be quick about it?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will get the orders placed for the blood work and EKG immediately. The laboratory is located just down the hall; they will take care of you there. I will also have the nursing staff schedule a follow-up appointment for you to review the results in approximately one week. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to monitor your fatigue levels and… try to get a bit more rest, if possible. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… get it over with, please. I have other things to do. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nursing staff will escort you to the lab. Have a good day, Ms. Licano.
PATIENT: .
