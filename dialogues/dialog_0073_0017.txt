DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… about a team. A baseball team. I’m trying out. They need a… a check-up, I think? Before I can play. Something like that. It's been a while, you see. A long while. I don’t really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: A team… Right. And you need a check-up to ensure you're fit to play. I understand it's been some time since your last medical evaluation. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit about what kind of activities this team involves?
PATIENT: Activities? Well… baseball. You know. Throwing the ball, hitting the ball. Running… sometimes. It’s… a sport. I used to do it a lot. A lot. Back then. Now… well, I’m trying to get back into it. It's not as easy, naturally. It’s a… a men’s team. Older fellas, mostly. Not… professionals. Just for fun, you see. Mostly.
DOCTOR: "Fun" is good. Though even "fun" requires a certain level of physical capability. Alright. And when you say “used to,” how long ago was that, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A long time. A very long time. Before… before my wife. Before the divorce, that was. Maybe… fifteen years? Twenty? Something like that. Time… it gets away from you, you see. It really does. I haven’t been… active… much since then. Just… little things. Around the house. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Fifteen to twenty years. That’s… significant. And since then, just light activity around the house. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness with these activities, even the light ones?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, not really. Maybe a little… tightness sometimes. But that’s just… getting old, I suppose. Shortness of breath… a little. When I climb the stairs, maybe. But nothing… alarming. Dizziness… no, I don't think so. Not that I recall, anyway. I get a little… tired, that’s all. More tired than I used to be. Is that… bad? I just figured it was… the age.
DOCTOR: Tightness, some shortness of breath with exertion, and fatigue. Those things can be related to age, Mr. Bartok, but it's important to rule out anything more serious, especially given the time since your last evaluation. Before we go any further, do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me see. I don’t think so. Nothing… major. I had a rash once… from some cream my wife bought. But that was… a long time ago. I don’t remember what it was for. Penicillin? No, I don’t think I’m allergic to penicillin. I took it… once, maybe? A long time ago. I really don't keep track of those things, you see. It all blurs together. Does that… help?
DOCTOR: Not entirely, Mr. Bartok, but it’s a start. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. No, not really. Nothing… regularly. I take a little… something for my knee, sometimes. When it acts up. But it’s just… an ointment. Rub it on. I don’t even know what’s in it. My neighbor gave it to me. Said it helped his arthritis. And… that’s it, I think. Maybe vitamins, sometimes. But not… every day. Does that… matter? It's all just little things.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know. Alright, Mr. Bartok. Now, I’d like to get a bit of your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions – things you've been diagnosed with or treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Past conditions… hmm. That’s a tough one. I had… something with my back once. Years ago. A slipped disc, maybe? I don’t remember exactly. Went to a chiropractor. Helped a little. And… my blood pressure was high, once. The doctor put me on pills. I don't take them anymore. I stopped a long time ago. Everything felt fine. I didn't see the point, you see. I'm sure it wasn't that serious. Is that… enough? It's hard to recall everything, you know.
DOCTOR: Back pain, treated with chiropractic care. And a history of elevated blood pressure, previously managed with medication, now discontinued. We'll need to check that today. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Uh… yes. I had my appendix out. When I was young. A long, long time ago. And… I think I had something on my knee. A little… cleaning out, maybe? When I hurt it playing… baseball. Years ago. That’s all I can recall. It was… a while ago. Everything’s blurry, you see? I don’t remember the details. It didn't seem like much at the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Hmm… no. My mother passed away… a long time ago. My father… he passed away before my mother. I think. It was… a while ago. I don’t remember exactly. We weren’t… close, you see. I didn’t… keep track of those things. Did they have… problems? I don’t really know. My mother had… something with her heart, maybe? But I don’t really recall the details. It was a long time ago. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s difficult when memories are hazy. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. My wife… she smoked. But I always told her not to. Bad for you, you see? I always tried to be… sensible. I never understood why people did it. It's just… foolish. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I was always… careful.
DOCTOR: That's good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, a little. I have a beer… sometimes. With dinner. Or when I watch the baseball game. Nothing… excessive. Just one or two. Maybe three, if it’s a good game. I don't get… drunk, you see. I’m always… sensible. It helps me… relax. Nothing more than that. It’s not… a problem. I don’t drink every day. Just… occasionally.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, I’d like to clarify one thing. You mentioned feeling “tired” and some “tightness” in your chest. Can you describe these symptoms in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, the tiredness… it’s just… a general feeling. Like I don’t have… much energy. I get winded… easily. Walking up the stairs, doing little things around the house. It wasn't like that before, you see. And the tightness… it’s just… a squeezing sensation. In my chest. Not… painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. It comes and goes. When I exert myself, maybe. Or when I’m… stressed. It's not bad, you see. Just… noticeable. It doesn't keep me up at night. Just... there. It's hard to describe. A little… pressure. That's all.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s good you’re describing these sensations to me, Mr. Bartok. It’s important to rule out anything serious. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your general physical condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your… expertise. I just want to make sure I’m… fit enough to play. I don’t want to… embarrass myself. Or… get hurt. Do whatever you need to do. I’m ready, I suppose. It’s been a while, you see. But… I’m willing. Just… be gentle, if you would. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bartok. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, if you could please sit back and relax on the examination table. First, I’ll take your blood pressure. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright… breathing… yes. Normal. . It's been a while since I’ve been… examined like this. A long while. Everything feels… a little strange. Is this going to… hurt? Just… tell me if it does, Doctor. I'm not… a young man anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 148/92. Not critically high, but something we'll need to monitor. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe deeply in and out for me, please. I’m listening for any unusual sounds. I hear a slight murmur... It’s faint, but present. I’ll note that on your chart. Do you experience palpitations or fluttering in your chest?
PATIENT: Palpitations… fluttering…? . No, not that I recall. Maybe… a little sometimes? But I just figured it was… anxiety. Or… getting older. I don’t… worry much about those things, you see. It's just… a feeling. A little… jumpiness, maybe? But nothing… serious. It doesn’t… bother me. Not really. Is that… bad? Is the murmur… bad? It sounds like a lot of… technical terms. I'm not a doctor, you see. I just want to play baseball.
DOCTOR: The murmur warrants further investigation, Mr. Bartok, but it's not necessarily cause for immediate alarm. It simply means there’s some turbulence in the blood flow, which can have various causes. We’ll need to order an EKG and possibly an echocardiogram to get a clearer picture. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain.
PATIENT: Ooh… a little tender… here. . Not… painful, exactly. Just… sensitive. It's been… bothering me on and off for a while. I just figured it was… gas. Or… indigestion. I eat a lot of… beans, you see. Maybe that’s it. It comes and goes. Sometimes it's… fine. Sometimes it’s… a little uncomfortable. Nothing… serious, I hope. Is that… bad? . It's probably just the beans, right?
DOCTOR: The tenderness in your lower right abdomen could indicate a number of things, Mr. Bartok. It’s possible it is related to dietary factors, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel, in addition to the EKG and echocardiogram. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes… okay. Never had those tested before. Are those… important? Oh! That’s… a little strange. Everything feels… a little strange today, you see. It’s been a long time since I’ve been examined like this. Is everything… alright? I just want to play baseball, Doctor. I’m not… a complicated man. Just… an old man who wants to play baseball. Are my reflexes… okay? Are they… bad?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age, Mr. Bartok. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. Overall, I’m concerned about the elevated blood pressure, the murmur, the tenderness in your abdomen, and the diminished reflexes. It’s important to get a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on before you start any strenuous activity like baseball. I recommend that you do not participate in baseball tryouts until we have the results of these tests and I’ve had a chance to review them with you. Is that understandable?
PATIENT: No… baseball… . No baseball… I understand, Doctor. You think it’s… too risky? . I just… I wanted to get back into it. It’s… good exercise. It makes me feel… alive. But… if you think it’s too dangerous… . No baseball. I understand. What do I… do now? Just… wait for the tests? It’s going to be… a long wait, isn’t it? Will I… ever get to play again?
DOCTOR: I understand your disappointment, Mr. Bartok. It’s frustrating to have your plans put on hold. We’re not saying you’ll never play again, but we need to rule out any potential underlying issues first. The tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health, and then we can discuss your options. The EKG and echocardiogram will assess your heart function, the blood count and metabolic panel will check for any abnormalities, and then, depending on those results, we might need to do further investigation for your abdominal tenderness. I’ll order these tests right away, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. They should have the results back within a week or so. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity. I’ll also give you a referral to a cardiologist for a second opinion. It's always good to get multiple perspectives, especially when it comes to your heart. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… yes. A second opinion… that sounds… sensible. What if… what if they find something… bad? . Will I… need surgery? Or… medicine? It’s just… a lot to take in. But… I appreciate you… looking into it. I appreciate you… trying to help me. So… no baseball. Just… wait for the tests. And see a cardiologist. I understand. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. Is there… anything else I need to do? Or… know? Right now?
DOCTOR: It’s natural to feel worried, Mr. Bartok, but try not to jump to conclusions. We don’t know anything for certain yet. Let’s focus on getting the tests done and then we’ll discuss the results together. For now, no strenuous activity, and please try to maintain a healthy diet and get plenty of rest. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here are the test orders and the referral to the cardiologist. The lab should contact you within 24-48 hours to schedule an appointment. I’ll also have my nurse call you in a few days to check in and see how you’re doing. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Questions…? Uh… I don’t… I don’t think so. You’ve… explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I’m just… a little overwhelmed, I suppose. It’s been… a long time since I’ve had to… worry about these things. But… thank you again. For everything. I appreciate your… patience. And your… kindness. I’ll… wait for the lab to call. And see the cardiologist. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bartok. Remember, we're here to help you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
