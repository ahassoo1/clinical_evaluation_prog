DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m Dr. Sham. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s…Brodie Pavlovic, actually. And it’s this cough. Been…a while now. Dry as a bone, it is. Just won't go away. Seems worse when I…well, I can't rightly remember when it’s worse. Just…always there, mostly.
DOCTOR: Right, a cough…for some time now. And you said it's dry?
PATIENT: Yes, dry. Not much…anything coming up. Just a tickle, then a…hack. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just…tires me out, I suppose. I used to work on cars, you know. Body work. Lots of dust, back then. Could it be…from that? I don’t…I forget things so easily these days.
DOCTOR: Body work…dust exposure. That’s…possible, certainly. And you've had this cough for…how long would you estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. Years, I think. Maybe…five? Ten? It comes and goes, you see. Worse in the winter, usually. But it never really goes away. My wife…she used to bring me tea with honey. Helped a little. But…she’s gone now. So…I just…deal with it. It's hard to keep track of time, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s difficult to pinpoint when things started with a chronic issue like this. And I’m very sorry for your loss. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. Aside from the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think. I get…short of breath sometimes. Not all the time, just when I…walk up the steps, or something. And…I feel tired, like I said. Just…old tired, I guess. Maybe a little wheezy sometimes, but that could just be my age. I don’t know. I haven’t been to a doctor in…a long, long time. Everything feels a little fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Short of breath with exertion…and fatigue. Okay. Have you had a fever at any point with this cough, or noticed any chest pain?
PATIENT: Fever…not that I recall. I don’t think so. And no, no chest pain. It’s just…this constant tickle and…emptiness in my chest. It feels like my lungs are…old. Does that make sense? And I don’t sleep as well as I used to. Cough keeps me up sometimes. It’s just…a bother, mostly. Nothing too serious, I figured. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't…something awful.
DOCTOR: Right. No fever, no chest pain. Just a chronic cough, shortness of breath on exertion, and fatigue. Let me ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or emphysema?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a lot of big words. Asthma…no, I don't think so. The doctor never said anything like that. Bronchitis…maybe once, a long time ago? A bad cold, I think. Em…emphysema…no, I don’t believe so. I worked with cars, like I said. Lots of dust and fumes. But they didn't say anything about that either. Back then, things were different. You just…kept working. I forget a lot of the details now, to be honest. My memory…it’s not what it used to be. Is it alright if I just tell you what I feel, instead of what I remember being told? It might be easier.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Pavlovic, that’s perfectly alright. Tell me what you feel. We'll work with that. Have you ever smoked, or been around a lot of secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Not a bit of it. My wife, she tried it once, a long time ago, but didn't like it. As for secondhand smoke…not much, really. Maybe at the county fair, sometimes. But not regularly. I mostly worked in the garage, you see. Lots of fumes, but not smoke. Just…the smell of metal and oil and…things. Is that important? I worry I’m not being very helpful. Everything feels so…distant.
DOCTOR: No smoking, minimal secondhand smoke exposure… Okay. And what about any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I think I used to sneeze a lot in the spring. Flowers, maybe? But nothing too bad. Nothing I took medicine for, or anything. Just a little sniffle. My wife always said I was sensitive. But I can't remember anything specific. It's hard to keep track of these things when you get…old. Does it matter much? It’s just a cough, after all. I’m probably just being a bother.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t matter if you’re being a bother, Mr. Pavlovic. We’re trying to get a full picture. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Then we can decide if any further testing is needed. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s…fine. Listen to my lungs, you said? Alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just…want to breathe easier, you see. It’s getting harder and harder these days. And…thank you for being patient with me. I’m not the easiest patient, I imagine. Just…old and forgetful. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could just sit up here for me. I’m going to listen to your chest with the stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Okay…I’m hearing some wheezing in both lungs, and some diminished breath sounds, particularly in the bases. It's not…critical, but it's definitely something we need to investigate further. Your oxygen saturation is…92%. That's a little low. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Heart rate is 78. I think we should get a chest X-ray, and possibly some blood work to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work… Hmm. That sounds…serious. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then alright. Whatever you think is best. I just…don’t want to be a trouble. Is it going to cost a lot of money? I don’t have much insurance, you see. My wife…she took care of all that. Now…well, I’m just on my own. But if it will help me breathe, then alright. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just…tell me if it’s something awful. I’d rather know.
DOCTOR: We'll do our best to keep the costs as low as possible, Mr. Pavlovic. I understand your concerns. And we'll discuss all the options thoroughly before proceeding. The X-ray will help us see what's going on in your lungs, and the blood work will rule out any infection or other underlying conditions. It’s possible this is just chronic bronchitis, or something similar. But we need to get a clearer picture. I will get the order for the X-ray and blood work, and the nurse will come in and draw the blood shortly. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No…not really. Just…will it hurt? The blood draw, I mean. I’m not good with needles. And…how long will it take to get the results? I have…nowhere to be, really. Just…sitting at home. Waiting. But it’s nice to know what’s going on, I suppose. Even if it’s…bad. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Just…do what you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: The blood draw shouldn’t hurt much, Mr. Pavlovic. Just a quick pinch. And the lab usually gets the results back within a few days. We'll call you as soon as we have them, and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. The nurse will be in shortly to take care of the blood work. I'll let her know you're a little nervous about needles. In the meantime, please try to rest, and drink plenty of fluids. And if you experience any worsening symptoms – fever, severe shortness of breath, chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. .
