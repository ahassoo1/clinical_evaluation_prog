DOCTOR: Hi Thyra, welcome to the clinic. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, good to meet you too, Dr. Georgiou. Well, I don’t really need anything, not exactly. It’s just… paperwork, I think? I got a notice about needing to fill some things out, and I figured it was easier to do it with someone here to answer questions if I get stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright! Lots of things come up with insurance and new patient forms, it’s good you came in. We can definitely get those sorted out together. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Thank you. They look a little… detailed, but I'm sure we can manage.
DOCTOR: They can be, yes! We want to make sure we have a complete picture of everything. Let’s start with this first one, the medical history form. It asks about any past illnesses, surgeries, or hospital stays you’ve had. Don’t worry if you can’t remember everything exactly – just do your best. We can always look things up later if needed. Do you want to start with that, or would you prefer I ask you some questions directly while you write?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe you asking questions would be easier, actually. My memory isn't bad, but sometimes writing it all down makes it harder to think straight. If that's okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that’s perfectly fine! We do this all the time. It’s much easier for some people to talk it through. Okay, let’s start with past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing – but nothing major. My grandma, on my mom’s side, had some trouble with her joints when she got older, but that was about it in the family, as far as I know. Does that help? I’m trying to think if the school nurse ever said anything…
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and yes, that’s helpful! Knowing what doesn't apply is just as important as knowing what does. And you said your grandmother had joint trouble?
PATIENT: Yeah, she did. Mostly in her knees and hands, I think. It got really bad when she was in her eighties. She ended up needing a cane to get around. I don't think she ever went to a doctor about it, though. She was pretty old-fashioned and didn't really trust doctors much. We mostly just helped her out around the house and made sure she was comfortable. I don’t remember the exact name of what she had, if it even had a name.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information to have. It sounds like it might have been osteoarthritis, which is common as people get older. We'll keep that in mind. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I broke my arm once when I was little – fell out of a tree trying to rescue a kitten – but it wasn’t bad enough to need surgery. Just a cast for a few weeks. Otherwise, I’ve managed to stay out of the hospital, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! Staying healthy is the best thing. Alright, moving on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’m aware of. I eat pretty much everything. No bee stings or anything like that have ever bothered me. I think I remember being a little itchy after eating strawberries once when I was a kid, but my mom said it was probably just a rash, not an allergy. So, no real allergies, I guess. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Right now? Nothing regular. I don’t take anything daily. Sometimes, if I get a bad headache, I’ll take ibuprofen, but that’s about it. Oh, and I use an inhaler occasionally during wildfire season, if the smoke gets really bad. It’s just an over-the-counter one, though, nothing prescribed. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that counts. It's important to know everything you're using, even over-the-counter medications. Okay, good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. Never smoked a day in my life. I don't really care for the taste of alcohol, so I rarely drink. And I definitely don’t do any drugs. I grew up on the reservation, and we were taught to take care of our bodies and minds. That means staying away from things that could harm us.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. That’s very good to hear. And how about work or school?
PATIENT: I work as a control and valve installer and repairer. It’s a pretty physical job, mostly outdoors. I’ve been doing it for about ten years now, and I like it. It keeps me busy. I didn’t go to college after high school, I just started an apprenticeship right away.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It sounds like a demanding job, physically. One last question for this part: Are there any significant stressors in your life right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Things are pretty good, all things considered. My work is steady, my marriage is good, and my family’s healthy. It's wildfire season, so that's always in the back of my mind, but we're prepared as we can be. Living on the reservation, we're pretty used to dealing with things. I guess… just the usual everyday worries, if that makes sense? Nothing major causing a lot of stress.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Thyra. It sounds like you have a good support system and a healthy outlook. Okay, now let’s move on to the physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I haven’t had a full check-up in… a long time, honestly. I usually only go to the doctor if something’s actually wrong.</stage>
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, many people feel that way. It’s good to get things checked out even when you’re feeling well. Let’s start with your height and weight. Okay, you're 171 centimeters tall and weigh 70 kilograms. Now, let’s check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 122/78, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. All looking good so far. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezes or crackles.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That's… reassuring. Is everything alright? I always worry when people listen to my chest, just in case they find something wrong. It's probably silly.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, it's perfectly normal to feel that way. Everything sounds good so far, honestly. Those are normal findings. I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat now. Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Nose is clear as well. Throat looks healthy, no redness or swelling. Now, I'm going to feel your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are normal, not enlarged. Now, let’s take a look at your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses. Do you have any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. It feels… weird, I guess. But not painful. I haven’t really had anyone poke around my stomach before.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. It's not something people do every day, and it can feel strange. Alright, everything feels normal so far. Now, just a quick neurological exam. I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can do that. Like this? Is that okay? I just want to make sure I’m doing it right. I'm not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect! You’re doing great. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like that? Is that too much, or not enough? I don’t want to break your hand or anything.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfect! Good strength. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems normal so far, Thyra. I’m going to take a look at your EHR to see if there's anything else I should be aware of, and then we can discuss next steps.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That's… a relief to hear. I don’t really have a lot on my record, honestly. Just the usual childhood vaccinations and a few doctor’s visits for colds and flu. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see that you had your childhood vaccinations, and a few visits for common illnesses, just as you said. It looks like your last general check-up was about ten years ago. Given that everything looks normal today, and you’re feeling well, I’d recommend a few routine screenings based on your age and gender. We should check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and do a basic metabolic panel. And, I’d also like to discuss breast cancer screening options. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. Cholesterol, blood sugar, that makes sense. And… yeah, okay, I guess we should talk about the other thing too. I haven’t really thought about it before, to be honest. I just… haven’t had a lot of regular check-ups. What does that involve? Just… tell me everything. I want to know what I’m getting into.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a very good question, and it’s important to be fully informed. For breast cancer screening, the standard recommendation for someone your age is to start annual mammograms. A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast. It can detect small changes in the breast tissue before they can be felt during a physical exam. It’s a relatively quick procedure, usually takes about 10-15 minutes. We would position your breast on a special plate and compress it gently for a few seconds to get a clear image. Some women experience mild discomfort, but it’s usually bearable. We also recommend a clinical breast exam as part of your regular check-up, which is what I did today, feeling for any lumps or changes. And, it's important to be aware of your breasts and report any changes to me right away. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… sounds a little scary, honestly. But I understand why it’s important. Compression… that doesn’t sound fun. Is it really necessary every year? I mean, is there a lot of radiation involved? And… what if they find something? What happens then? I know I'm asking a lot of questions, but… I’m just worried.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Thyra. It’s completely normal to be worried, and it’s important to address all your concerns. Let's talk about the radiation first. The amount of radiation from a mammogram is very low, about the same as the natural background radiation you’re exposed to over several days. It's considered very safe, and the benefits of early detection far outweigh the risks. As for the frequency, annual screening is recommended because breast cancer can develop quickly, and early detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment. Now, what if we find something?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… good to know about the radiation. What if you find something? Like… what does that even mean? Do I need surgery right away? Will I lose my breast? I have a friend whose mother had breast cancer, and… it was really scary. I just… I don’t want to go through that.
DOCTOR: Thyra, it’s completely understandable that you’re worried, especially knowing someone who has been through this. It’s good you’re asking these questions. Finding something doesn’t automatically mean you need surgery, or that you’ll lose your breast. If we find something, the first step is usually further imaging, like an ultrasound, to get a clearer picture of what it is. It could be a benign cyst, which is very common and doesn’t require treatment. If it looks concerning, we would do a biopsy, which is a small sample of tissue that’s sent to a lab for analysis. Even if it is cancer, there are many different treatment options available, and the best approach depends on the type and stage of cancer. Surgery is often part of the treatment plan, but it’s not always necessary, and there are different types of surgery available, including lumpectomy, which preserves most of the breast. We would discuss all your options with you in detail, and you would have a say in the decision-making process. I would also refer you to an oncologist, a cancer specialist, who would work with you to develop a personalized treatment plan. It’s important to remember that early detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment, and many people who are diagnosed with breast cancer go on to live long and healthy lives. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah… that makes more sense. It’s just… a lot to take in. Knowing what could happen, even if it’s not likely, is… scary. But it’s better than just being in the dark, I guess. Okay. Let’s… let’s just do the bloodwork for now. And maybe… maybe we can talk about the other thing at my next appointment. I need to… process everything. Thank you, Dr. Georgiou. For… for everything. You’ve been really patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Thyra. That’s perfectly alright. It’s okay to take things one step at a time. We can definitely postpone the discussion about the mammogram until your next appointment. And you're right, it's better to process everything first. Okay, let’s get the bloodwork ordered. I’ll write you a requisition for a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a cholesterol check. You can go to the lab right here in the clinic, and they’ll take care of everything. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. I’ll let the lab know you’re coming, and the results should be back in a few days. Then, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And remember, we’re here to support you. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. Georgiou. I think I'll just… go get the bloodwork done.
DOCTOR: Alright, you have a good day, Thyra. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. .
