DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, it's about this…procedure. My daughter booked it, honestly. She worries too much. Says I should “freshen up” before the family reunion. Honestly. I just want to get this over with, if you don't mind. What do you need to know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. No problem at all. It sounds like your daughter scheduled an appointment for you. Just to be clear, is this regarding a colonoscopy, as I see here in the system?
PATIENT: A…colonoscopy? Goodness, no. I'm having my eyelids done. Droopy, you see? Makes me look tired. My daughter…she must have mixed something up. Honestly, the things she does. Waste of time, really. Is this going to take long? I have a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Eyelid surgery, then. My apologies for the confusion, Mr. Orwin. It seems there was a mix-up with the appointment details. Yes, we're scheduled for a blepharoplasty today. To get started, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed your eyelids becoming droopy?
PATIENT: Honestly, when didn't they start to droop? It's been years. Gradual, you see? Not like one day I woke up and suddenly looked ancient. It's just…age. Though I keep up with things, you know. I still do a bit of terrazzo work when I can. Keeps me sharp. Are we getting anywhere with this? I’d really like to be done soon.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like this has been a gradual process. And it's good to hear you're still active with your terrazzo work – that's wonderful. Okay. Besides the cosmetic concern, are you experiencing any difficulties with your vision, or any discomfort, dryness, or heaviness in your eyelids?
PATIENT: Vision's fine. Always been good as a hawk, until recently. Though I do squint a bit more now. And…well, they feel heavy, I suppose. Especially at the end of the day. Like I’m carrying little weights on my face. But it’s nothing dramatic. Honestly, I’m a bit sensitive about this whole thing. My wife…she always said I had handsome eyes. I don’t want to mess things up.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Orwin. It's completely natural to be a little anxious about something like this, especially when it involves your appearance and memories. It's good you brought this up. Squinting a bit more and feeling heaviness…okay. Have you noticed any changes in your tearing – more or less than usual?
PATIENT: Tearing? Hmm. I don't think so. Everything seems…normal. Honestly, I don't spend a lot of time analyzing my eyes. I have work to do, you know? Terrazzo doesn’t lay itself. Is this going to involve a lot of poking and prodding? I really don’t like poking. And prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like you're a man who prefers to get things done. I assure you, we’ll keep the poking and prodding to a minimum. It's just a standard examination to assess your eyelids and make sure you're a good candidate for the procedure. Just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any eye problems or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. Eyes have always been good. Like I said, hawk eyes. Though I did get a bit of dust in them now and then, working with the terrazzo. But nothing a good rinse couldn't fix. Honestly, I think this is all a bit much. Is there anything you need to know, besides what I don't want to talk about? Because I'd rather just get this over with.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Orwin. And I understand you'd like to keep things concise. Alright. Just to confirm, you're not currently taking any medications, and you have no allergies to any medications, correct?
PATIENT: No medications. Never needed them. And allergies…hmm. I get a bit sniffly in the spring, but that’s just pollen. Nothing serious. Honestly, I’m a pretty healthy man for my age. Don't go looking for problems where there aren't any. Can we please get to the part where I know how long this is going to take?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I'll do a quick exam of your eyelids and surrounding areas, just to get a better look. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Okay. I'm seeing some mild ptosis in both eyelids, more pronounced on the right. Your skin has some elasticity, but there’s a bit of looseness. Your lacrimal glands feel normal. I don't see any signs of infection or inflammation. It appears you're a good candidate for a blepharoplasty, but it’s important to understand the procedure and potential risks. I want to ensure you have realistic expectations. Would you mind if I explain the process?
PATIENT: Explain it quickly, please. Honestly, I don’t want a lot of detail. Just tell me what you're going to do, and how long it'll keep me from my work. And if it’s going to be terribly painful. Because I have a very low tolerance for…fuss.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. We’ll make small incisions along the natural creases of your eyelids to remove excess skin and, if needed, reposition some of the muscle and fat. The procedure is usually done under local anesthesia, so you’ll be awake, but we'll ensure you’re comfortable. As for pain, you might feel some mild discomfort during the procedure, like a slight pressure or pinching sensation. We’ll use numbing medication to minimize this. Afterward, you can expect some swelling, bruising, and soreness for about a week to ten days. We’ll provide you with pain medication and detailed post-operative instructions. As for your work, you’ll need to avoid strenuous activity for at least a week, and it’s best to take it easy for a few weeks while you heal. It’s difficult to give an exact timeframe, as healing varies, but we’ll be able to discuss this further after the procedure. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Sounds…acceptable. As long as I'm not bedridden for a month. Honestly, I have deadlines. What about…complications? You have to tell me if there’s a chance of something going wrong. I don't want surprises. And can I still see afterward? I need to be able to see to work! .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. It's important to be aware of potential risks. While complications are rare, they can include temporary dry eyes, difficulty closing your eyes completely, infection, bleeding, or asymmetry in the eyelids. We take every precaution to minimize these risks. I’ll thoroughly discuss these with you before the procedure, and we'll provide you with detailed post-operative instructions to help prevent them. And yes, absolutely. You will still be able to see afterward. The procedure is designed to improve your vision by lifting the eyelids, and it shouldn’t affect your ability to see. There might be some temporary blurred vision due to swelling or bruising, but this should resolve within a few days to weeks. Before we proceed, I need to get your consent and review your medical history one more time to ensure this is the right course of action. Are you ready to proceed with that?
