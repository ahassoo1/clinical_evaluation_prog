DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Humph. Morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day. I come 'bout… well, lookin' in the mirror these days. Things ain't holdin' up so good, you understand? Everything droopin' and saggin'. I want somethin' done 'bout it. Quick like.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you're concerned about some changes you've noticed in your appearance. We certainly can discuss options. To help me understand what you're experiencing, could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What kinda specific? I just told you! Everything is fallin' apart! My neck... look at it, all wrinkly. And my… well, the skin under my chin ain't what it used to be. It’s a mess, a proper mess. I don’t need a lecture 'bout growin' old, I just want it fixed. You understand? Straight to the point, Doctor. No time for fancy talk.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I understand you’d like to get straight to the point, and I respect that. It sounds like you’re concerned about skin laxity in your neck and under your chin. To determine the best course of action, I’d like to ask a few questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed this change gradually over time, or has it been more sudden?
PATIENT: Gradually. Like rust, you know? Slow, but steady. Been gettin' worse for... oh, maybe five, six years now. I didn't bother with it at first, thought it was just age. But it's gettin' embarrassing. I used to have a proper jawline, you know? Now... well, now it looks like I swallowed a melon. And I don’t like it. Not one bit. You got somethin' that can help or what? I ain't got time for maybes.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like this has been a gradual process causing you increasing concern. We certainly have options to explore. Before we discuss those, I'd like to get a more complete picture of your overall health. May I ask about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Humph. What for? You think my droopin' neck has somethin' to do with a cold I had in '78? I ain't been sickly. Worked on piles my whole life, strong as an ox. Never been one for doctors, to be honest. But if you must know… had my appendix out when I was a boy. And broke my arm fallin' outta a mango tree. That's it. No fancy diseases or nothin'. Now can we talk 'bout fixin' this?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I simply ask to ensure there aren't any underlying conditions that could affect treatment options. Knowing you've only had your appendix removed and a broken arm is helpful. Now, to address your concerns about the skin laxity in your neck and under your chin, there are several possibilities we could consider. These include non-surgical options like radiofrequency treatments or injectables, as well as surgical options like a neck lift. However, before we delve into those, I'd like to perform a quick physical examination to assess the degree of laxity and rule out any other contributing factors. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Lookin' at me neck ain't gonna change nothin'. But alright, fine. Get it over with. Just don't be pokin' and proddin' too much. I ain't a side of beef, you know. And explain what you're lookin' at, simple like. I don't want no fancy medical words. Just tell me if it can be fixed. That’s all I care about. Quick now, I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Trendler. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. I simply want to get a clear understanding of the skin and underlying tissues. I’ll explain everything as we go, using plain language. Okay, so I’m just feeling for the elasticity of the skin here… as you can see, there is some loss of firmness. And I’m also checking the muscle tone… there's some mild weakening. It does appear to be primarily skin laxity, with some contribution from muscle tone. Do you feel any tenderness in any particular area when I press here?
PATIENT: Pressin'… yeah, a little bit there, on the left side. Not painful, just… feels a bit funny. Like a dull ache. Haven't noticed it much before, though. Mostly just bothers me when I look in the mirror, seein' all the sag. Is that… bad? Is that gonna make it harder to fix? Just tell me straight, Doctor. No beatin' around the bush. I can handle the truth. I've handled worse on a pile driver, believe me.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know about the tenderness. It's good that you brought that to my attention. Mild tenderness isn’t necessarily a cause for major concern, but it’s something we’ll keep in mind. It could be a sign of minor inflammation or muscle strain, and we’ll want to rule out anything more significant. To do that, I think it would be prudent to order a quick ultrasound of your neck. This will allow us to visualize the underlying structures and ensure there are no unusual masses or abnormalities contributing to the tenderness. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Now you want to scan me neck? What for? I told you, I just want it fixed! You makin' this more complicated than it needs to be. I ain't got nothin' growin' in me neck, I'm a simple man! Look, if you can't fix it without scanin' and pokin' and proddin', then just say so. I'll find another doctor. I ain't afraid to shop around. Now, are you gonna help me or what? This whole thing is takin' too long. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the delay. I assure you, I am trying to help you. The ultrasound isn't about suspecting something serious, it’s simply a precautionary measure to ensure we have a complete picture before recommending any treatment. It will allow me to visualize the deeper tissues and rule out any factors that could affect the outcome of a procedure. Think of it like this: before building a house, you need to check the foundation, right?
PATIENT: A house? What's a house got to do with me neck? You always comin' up with these… these analogies! Look, I ain't no builder, I'm a pile driver operator! And I ain't got time for buildin' houses or checkin' foundations! I just want the sag gone! If you can't do it without all this fuss, then fine. Just tell me straight. I'll go somewhere else. I’m wastin’ me time here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, please, sit down. I understand your impatience, and I respect your decision to seek another opinion if you wish. However, I genuinely believe I can help you, but I want to do so safely and effectively. The tenderness you mentioned is a small detail, but one I’m obligated to investigate before proceeding. A quick ultrasound will take only a few minutes and provide valuable information. It’s a standard precaution, and I wouldn’t recommend any treatment without it. If the ultrasound is clear, we can discuss the best options for addressing the skin laxity, and I’m confident we can achieve a result you’ll be happy with. But I won't proceed without that first step. Would you be willing to consider the ultrasound, just for peace of mind?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Fine, alright. But make it quick. And no fancy gel or nothin'. Just get it over with. And tell me everything you see, simple like. No medical jargon. I ain't a doctor, remember? I just want the sag gone. And I'm warnin' you, if this takes all day, I'm leavin'. And I’m not payin' for nothin'.
DOCTOR: Excellent, thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Trendler. I assure you, it will be quick and as comfortable as possible. We’ll use minimal gel, and I’ll explain everything I see in plain language, as I promised. Let’s get started then. I just need to apply a small amount of gel to your neck, and then I'll move the probe around to get some images. It doesn’t hurt at all. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Nah. Just get it over with. And don't poke too hard. My neck ain't made of steel, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I’m just gliding the probe across your neck now. You may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Okay… I’m seeing the skin layers, the underlying muscle, and the thyroid gland… everything appears to be in its normal position. The muscle tone is slightly reduced, as we discussed, but there are no signs of any masses or abnormalities. And on the left side… there’s a very small area of mild inflammation, but nothing significant. It could be due to a minor strain or irritation. It doesn’t appear to be anything concerning. Alright, that’s all done. It only took a few minutes. The ultrasound results are reassuring. Everything appears to be normal, and there’s no reason to delay discussing treatment options.
PATIENT: Reassurin', huh? Alright. So, what now? Can you fix it or can’t ya? And what’s it gonna cost me? I ain’t wastin’ me money on somethin’ that ain’t gonna work. Straight answers, Doctor. No beatin’ around the bush. I got things to do, ya know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I can help you improve the appearance of your neck. Based on the ultrasound results and our examination, we have several options. The most effective option, given the degree of skin laxity and mild muscle tone reduction, would be a neck lift, also known as a platysmaplasty. A neck lift involves removing excess skin, tightening the underlying muscles, and reshaping the jawline. It’s a surgical procedure, but it provides the most dramatic and long-lasting results. We also have non-surgical options, like radiofrequency treatments or injectable fillers, but they provide more subtle results and require more frequent maintenance. The cost of a neck lift typically ranges from $8,000 to $12,000, depending on the complexity of the procedure and the surgeon’s fees. This includes the surgeon’s fee, anesthesia fees, and facility fees. We can discuss financing options if needed. With a neck lift, you can expect to see a noticeable improvement in skin laxity, a more defined jawline, and a smoother, more youthful appearance. The recovery time is typically 2-3 weeks, and there may be some bruising and swelling. Do you have any questions about the procedure, the cost, or the recovery time?
PATIENT: $8,000 to $12,000?! You’re pullin’ me leg! That’s a whole lotta money! I could buy a brand new pile driver for that! Humph. And 2-3 weeks recovery? I can’t be lyin’ around for weeks! I got work to do! What about these other things… the radio… the whatchamacallit… the fillers? What do those cost? And what kinda results can I expect? I ain't lookin’ for a miracle, just somethin’ to take the sag outta me neck. Simple like. No fancy surgery if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Trendler. It is a significant investment, and I appreciate you weighing your options carefully. Radiofrequency treatments, also known as Thermage, can help tighten the skin by stimulating collagen production. They’re non-surgical, require minimal downtime, and typically cost between $1,500 and $3,000 per session. You would likely need 3-4 sessions to see optimal results. The results are more subtle than with a neck lift, and they won’t address significant skin laxity. Think of it as a gentle lift, rather than a dramatic transformation. Injectable fillers, such as Radiesse or Sculptra, can add volume to the skin and improve the appearance of wrinkles. They typically cost between $800 and $1,500 per syringe. You would likely need multiple syringes to achieve the desired results. The results are temporary, lasting about 6-12 months, and require periodic maintenance. They're better for addressing lines and wrinkles than significant skin laxity. To put it simply, a neck lift provides the most dramatic and long-lasting results, but it requires surgery and a longer recovery time. Radiofrequency treatments and injectable fillers are less invasive, require minimal downtime, but provide more subtle and temporary results. Which option sounds more appealing to you based on your concerns and preferences?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Temporary ain't what I'm lookin' for. Don't wanna be payin' for this every six months. So, this radio... this Thermage... it won't last long, but it's less invasive? What kinda results can I realistically expect? And will it hurt? I ain't got a high pain tolerance, ya know. I've been workin' with steel my whole life, not needles and heat.
DOCTOR: With Thermage, you can realistically expect a moderate improvement in skin tightness and a slight reduction in wrinkles. It’s not a dramatic transformation, but it can help take years off your appearance. It’s best suited for people with mild to moderate skin laxity. As for pain, most people describe the sensation as a warm, tingling feeling. We can also apply a topical anesthetic cream to minimize any discomfort. The treatment itself takes about 60-90 minutes, and there’s typically no downtime afterward. You may experience some mild redness or swelling for a few hours, but it usually resolves on its own. To be clear, Thermage won’t give you the same results as a neck lift. But it’s a safe and effective option for people who want to improve the appearance of their neck without surgery. Would you like to see some before-and-after photos of patients who have undergone Thermage treatment?
PATIENT: Before and after photos… alright. Let me see 'em. But don't show me nothin' too fancy. I want to see real people, not models. And no touchin' up! I want to see the real results, good or bad.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. Here are a few examples. As you can see, these are real patients with a variety of skin types and concerns. The results are subtle, but noticeable. You can see a slight improvement in skin tightness, a reduction in wrinkles, and a more defined jawline. These photos are unretouched, so you’re seeing the true results. This patient had similar skin laxity to yours. After three treatments, you can see a noticeable improvement in skin tightness and a more defined jawline. Do these results seem realistic to you?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Not bad. Not a miracle, but… not bad. It takes the sag outta it a bit, I reckon. And it don't look like they been pulled too tight, which is good. I ain't lookin' to look like a wax figure. Three treatments, you said? And how far apart do I gotta space 'em? And will it interfere with me work? I can't be takin' time off every few weeks. I got piles to drive!
DOCTOR: Yes, the goal is always to achieve a natural-looking result, Mr. Trendler. We want to improve your appearance without making you look overdone. We typically space the treatments about four to six weeks apart. Each treatment takes about 60-90 minutes, and there's usually no downtime afterward. You may experience some mild redness or swelling for a few hours, but you should be able to return to your normal activities immediately. You should be able to continue working as usual between treatments. There's no need to take time off. The procedure is non-invasive, and there's no recovery period. So, to recap, Thermage is a safe and effective way to improve the appearance of your neck without surgery. It's non-invasive, requires no downtime, and can provide a noticeable improvement in skin tightness and jawline definition. It requires three treatments spaced four to six weeks apart. Would you like to schedule a consultation to discuss the treatment plan in more detail?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… acceptable. Better than lyin' around for weeks after some surgery. Schedule a consultation. But I want it quick. And I want a firm price, no hidden fees. I ain't gettin' ripped off. And I want it done before the weather turns too cold. I don't fancy bein' poked and prodded in the winter. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Trendler. I understand your concerns, and I assure you there will be no hidden fees. The cost of three Thermage treatments is $4,500, and that includes everything – the consultation, the treatments themselves, and any necessary follow-up care. Let me see… We have an opening next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at ten… alright. That'll do. Get it in the calendar. And make sure you tell whoever does it to be gentle. I ain’t a young man anymore, ya know.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. It’s scheduled for Tuesday at 10:00 AM. And I will personally ensure that the technician is aware of your concerns and treats you with the utmost care. Here is your appointment card with all the details. Please arrive 15 minutes early to complete some paperwork. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Nope. That's it. Just get it done. And don't poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We look forward to seeing you on Tuesday. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good day, Mr. Trendler.
PATIENT: You too.
