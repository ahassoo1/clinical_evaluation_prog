DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I must confess, getting here was a bit of a blur. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I believe… yes, I believe it has to do with… going to the bathroom. Quite a lot, actually. More than usual, you see. It’s been… persistent. I’m not entirely sure when it started, to be honest. A few weeks, perhaps? It’s rather bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Increased frequency of urination can definitely be bothersome. It's good you came in to get it checked out. You mentioned it's been a few weeks, and you're having some difficulty pinpointing exactly when it started – that's alright, we can work with that. To help me understand a bit better, could you describe what it's like when you need to go?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… it comes on rather suddenly, you see. Not a gradual urge, more like… a pressing need. And it’s not just… frequently, but… a good amount each time. I find myself going to bed several times during the night, which is… disruptive, naturally. I don't experience any pain, thankfully. Just… the volume and the frequency. I also… I don't recall if I'm thirstier than usual, perhaps a little. It’s all rather… vague, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sudden onset, large volumes, frequent trips – especially at night – and no pain. You also mentioned possibly being a little thirstier than usual. That's helpful. Now, just to rule some things out, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… urine itself? Let me see… That’s a good question. I suppose… no, not that I’ve consciously observed. It looks normal, as far as I can tell. The colour seems… usual. No blood, no… foam, nothing of that nature. I don’t typically… scrutinize it, if you understand. Just… a normal colour, I believe. Perhaps a bit lighter than I remember, but that could easily be my imagination.
DOCTOR: Alright, no noticeable changes in color, no blood or foam. That's good. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health history. Do you have any medical conditions that you're currently being treated for, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my… medical history. That’s… a rather long story, I'm afraid. Let me think… I had my prostate checked a few years back, but nothing came of it, thankfully. And… I believe I had some issues with my blood pressure at one point, but that was managed with… medication, I think. I’m currently not taking any regular medications, though. As for conditions… I suppose I’m generally quite healthy, all things considered. My doctor always said my heart was strong, but I… honestly, I can't recall all the specifics. It was some time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a prostate check in the past that was normal, and some blood pressure issues previously managed with medication, but nothing currently. That's helpful. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… Yes, actually. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, a rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… I believe I had a minor procedure on my knee a few years back, something to do with… cartilage, perhaps? It wasn't a major surgery, just a small… repair. And… that’s all I can think of at the moment. My memory is… so fragmented, you see. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Verbos. It's perfectly understandable. Knowing about the appendix removal and the knee procedure is good. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… yes. My mother… she had some issues with her kidneys, I believe. A rather serious condition, it was. And my father… he had heart problems, I recall. A weak heart, the doctor said. And… my sister had… diabetes, I think. Yes, diabetes. She had to be quite careful with her diet. As for other conditions… honestly, I'm not entirely sure. It was some time ago, and I wasn't always… privy to all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of kidney problems in your mother, heart problems in your father, and diabetes in your sister. That’s important information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no, I’ve never been a smoker. Never had the inclination. Always considered it rather… unhealthy. My wife… she smoked, unfortunately, but I always discouraged it. She… passed away some time ago. I find it a rather… unpleasant habit, to be honest. No, I’ve never smoked, and I rarely drink alcohol, either. Just a glass of wine with dinner occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, very limited alcohol consumption. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. Hmm. I don't believe I have any significant allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medications, as far as I can recall. And… no food allergies, either. I eat a fairly… varied diet, though I try to avoid anything too… processed. I had a bit of a rash once, after using a certain type of soap, but that was… years ago, and I can't even remember the brand. No, I don't think I have any allergies to speak of.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for that information, Mr. Verbos. Okay, well, based on what you've told me, it sounds like we need to investigate the cause of your increased urinary frequency and volume. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, starting with checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. I'd also like to do a gentle abdominal exam and, if you're comfortable, a quick neurological exam to assess your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, of course. I suppose a thorough examination is necessary. Checking my blood pressure and pulse is fine, and listening to my heart and lungs is… understandable. A gentle abdominal exam is acceptable, and… a neurological exam, if you believe it’s necessary. Yes, go ahead. I'll cooperate fully. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. My bladder… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, we'll try to be as efficient as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your pulse is normal. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, your lungs sound clear and your heart rhythm is regular. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. This won't be uncomfortable, just let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Okay, your abdomen feels normal. Your bladder is palpable and feels moderately full, which is consistent with your symptoms. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the edge of the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. Sitting on the edge… here we are. I confess, I’m not entirely comfortable with this… reflex examination. I’ve never been very good with… these sorts of things. But if you deem it necessary… proceed. Just… be gentle, if you would. And please, don’t be alarmed if I… flinch. My nerves aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verbos. I’ll be as gentle as possible. It’s just a quick assessment, and it's alright if you flinch. I just need to check a few reflexes in your legs. Okay, your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which isn’t necessarily concerning, especially given your age. Alright, thank you for your cooperation. That completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found, your symptoms and exam suggest several possibilities. The frequent urination, especially at night, could be related to a number of things, including an overactive bladder, a urinary tract infection – although you don't have pain, it’s still possible – or even diabetes, given your family history. The slightly diminished reflexes could also be related to diabetes, or simply be a normal finding with age. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… prudent. Tests are… understandable. I’d much prefer to have a definitive answer, rather than… speculation. What sort of tests are you thinking of? And… will they be… unpleasant? I must confess, I’m not fond of… medical procedures, if you understand. But if they are necessary… I’ll cooperate, naturally. Just… please explain them to me beforehand. And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand your concerns. I'll explain everything thoroughly. First, I'd like to order a urinalysis and urine culture to check for a urinary tract infection. The urinalysis is a simple test where we collect a urine sample and examine it under a microscope. The urine culture will help identify any bacteria present. That's relatively painless – you just need to provide a sample. Second, I’d like to order a blood test to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and prostate-specific antigen levels. This will help rule out diabetes and assess your prostate health. The blood draw will cause a brief pinch, but it's usually quick and relatively painless. Finally, I'd like to order a post-void residual measurement. This involves using a handheld device to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder after you urinate. It's a non-invasive test and doesn't cause any discomfort. The results should be available in about 3-5 business days. Once we have them, we can discuss them and develop a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… manageable. A urine sample, a blood draw, and this… post-void residual measurement. All relatively painless, you say? That’s… reassuring. Three to five business days… I can certainly wait that long. And then we’ll discuss the results… and develop a plan. Yes, that sounds… sensible. Very well. Let’s proceed with these tests, then. When and where should I provide the urine sample? And… is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood draw? I usually… get quite anxious around needles, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad you're comfortable with that. You can provide the urine sample first thing in the morning, before you have anything to eat or drink. There’s a collection cup in the restroom down the hall. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – meaning, start urinating, then collect a portion in the cup, and finish urinating afterwards. As for the blood draw, you don't need to do much to prepare. Just try to drink plenty of water in the days leading up to the test. As for your anxiety around needles, that's perfectly understandable. We can take things slowly and I can let the phlebotomist know you're a bit anxious, so they can be extra gentle and patient. They are very experienced in dealing with anxious patients. Would you like me to write you a referral to the lab and a note explaining your anxiety?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be… most appreciated. A referral to the lab, and a note explaining my… apprehension. That would certainly put my mind at ease. And… thank you for being so… understanding. It’s not every doctor who takes the time to… accommodate a patient’s anxieties. So, first thing in the morning, a urine sample. Then, I’ll schedule an appointment at the lab. And… once the results are in, we’ll discuss them. Yes. That sounds… a perfectly sensible plan. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any… dietary restrictions or lifestyle changes I should implement before the results are available? Or… should I simply maintain my current routine?
DOCTOR: Here you are. This referral includes a note explaining your anxiety. As for now, there's no need to change your current routine. Continue to drink your usual amount of fluids and eat a balanced diet. Avoid excessive caffeine or alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder, but otherwise, just try to relax and don't worry too much. We'll have a better understanding of what's going on once we have the results. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, flank pain, or blood in your urine, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You've been… most thorough, and I appreciate your patience with my… vagueness. I confess, my memory isn’t what it used to be, but you’ve managed to… piece together a coherent picture, despite my shortcomings. Thank you for your time, and your… understanding. I’ll schedule the tests as soon as possible, and I’ll contact you if any of those… concerning symptoms arise. Yes. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbos. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again once the results are in. Have a good day.
