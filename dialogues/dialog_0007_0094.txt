DOCTOR: Hi Airam, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um… hello. I think… my husband said I should come. Something about… learning? I don’t really remember. He worries too much. It’s just… work is work, you know? Metal is heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your husband is concerned about something related to your job. “Metal is heavy” – are you involved in any kind of manufacturing or construction work?
PATIENT: Construction… maybe? I cut the metal. Big sheets. And… put them together. With… things. Screws, I think? It’s loud. Very loud. I wear… ear things. But still loud. My hands… they hurt sometimes. A lot sometimes. But I just… work. You need money, right?
DOCTOR: Right, you do need money. And it sounds like a physically demanding job. So, the hand pain – when did that start?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time ago, I think. Not suddenly. Slowly. First just tired. Then… ache-y. Now… sometimes I drop things. It’s embarrassing. My boss… he doesn’t like that. He says I need to be careful. Like it’s my fault the metal is heavy! It’s not like I can… make it lighter, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s not helpful when people don’t understand the nature of the work. And dropping things when your hands are hurting is definitely concerning. So, to clarify, the pain is in both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: Both. But… the left one is worse. It… feels funny sometimes. Like… pins and needles. And… cold. Even when it’s hot. It wakes me up at night sometimes. I try to ignore it. My husband… he rubs it. But it doesn’t really help. He means well. He just… doesn’t understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so both hands are affected, but the left hand is worse with numbness, tingling – what you’re describing sounds like pins and needles – and coldness, even when you're warm. And it's waking you up at night. That’s important information. Do you notice anything else?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes… my fingers feel clumsy. Like I can’t… hold things right. I dropped a screw the other day and… it almost hit my foot. My husband was very worried. He keeps saying I should see a doctor. That’s why I’m here, I guess. But I don't like doctors. They always ask too many questions. And poke you.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and I'll try to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. It's good you're here, though – we want to make sure this doesn't get worse. Okay, so clumsy fingers, dropping things, pain, numbness, tingling… Let's talk about your work a little more specifically. What kind of metal are you cutting and assembling?
PATIENT: Steel, I think. Big sheets of it. And… aluminum sometimes? The shiny stuff. It doesn’t really matter, it’s all hard. We use… machines. Big noisy machines. And… hand tools. Lots of hand tools. I don't know the names of them. My husband says I should pay attention, but… it’s just metal. You cut it, you bend it, you put it together. What difference does it make how you do it?
DOCTOR: Okay, steel and aluminum. And lots of repetitive motions with both machines and hand tools. That gives me a better picture. Now, besides your hands, are you experiencing any pain in your wrists, elbows, or shoulders?
PATIENT: Hmm… my shoulder. Sometimes. The left one. It aches. Like… after a long day. I thought it was just from… sleeping wrong. I sleep on my side. But… maybe it’s the metal? It’s hard to say. Everything hurts after work. It’s just… work, you know? I take some pills. For the pain. My husband gives them to me. I don’t know what they are.
DOCTOR: Okay, shoulder pain on the left side as well, and you're taking pain pills your husband provides. I'm going to need to ask some more questions about those pills – do you know the dosage, or what they look like?
PATIENT: No. He just… gives them to me. Little white pills. Two at a time. When it hurts really bad. I don't ask. He knows best. He’s always telling me what to do. He worries too much. They make me… sleepy. And… fuzzy. I don't really like them, but… the pain is worse. I think. It’s hard to remember sometimes. Everything feels… slow.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s important we identify what you’re taking, so let’s put that on the list. Before we move on, have you noticed any weakness in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Weakness… sometimes. When I’m… lifting the metal. Big sheets. I have to ask my co-worker to help. He makes fun of me. Says I’m getting old. I’m not that old. Thirty-three! But… it is getting harder. To hold things steady. To… screw things in. It’s… frustrating. I used to be able to do it all myself. Now… I need help. A lot. It makes me feel… bad. Like I’m not useful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so weakness with lifting, needing assistance at work, and feeling like you're not as strong as you used to be. I'm noting all of this. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis, diabetes, or nerve problems?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I haven’t really… been to the doctor much. Just for check-ups. And… when I broke my arm when I was a little girl. But that was a long time ago. My husband… he says I should be more careful. He worries about everything. He says I need to take better care of myself. But… I’m fine. Mostly. It’s just… work. I don’t know what you want me to tell you. Everything hurts, but I still go to work. Isn't that enough?
DOCTOR: It is enough that you continue to work despite the pain, and I appreciate your resilience. We just want to get to the bottom of what’s causing the pain so we can help you feel better. Okay, no major medical history. Let's talk about your family. Do any of your family members have arthritis, nerve problems, or similar conditions?
PATIENT: Um… my grandma. She had… bad hands. Very swollen. She couldn’t… knit anymore. It made her sad. And… my uncle. He had… tingling. In his feet. He had to… take pills. A lot of pills. My husband says it’s probably… genetics. He knows a lot about… things. I don’t really pay attention. He says I inherited it from them. Is that what you mean? I just… want the pain to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, so family history of arthritis in your grandmother and tingling in your uncle. That’s helpful. Now, just to finish up the history part, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I can eat anything. My husband… he says I should be careful. He always says that. He worries about everything. He says I’m too reckless. But I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Never. I just… want to go home. This is taking a long time. And… it makes my head hurt. All the questions. Can we… stop now?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed and want to go home, and I’ll try to be as quick as possible. One last thing, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me about your typical day at work?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay. I wake up early. Very early. My husband makes me breakfast. Then I go to the factory. It's loud. Very loud. I cut the metal. Big sheets. Then I bend it. And screw it together. Lots of screwing. All day. My hands get tired. My shoulder gets sore. I eat lunch with my co-workers. Then more cutting. More bending. More screwing. It's boring. And tiring. Then I come home. I eat dinner. Then I watch TV. Then I go to bed. And… it hurts. All over. It’s just… work. It’s always the same. Every single day. Is that what you want to know? Because I’m really tired now.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that detailed description. That gives me a very clear picture of what you do. Now, I am going to need to do a quick physical exam of your hands, arms, and shoulders. It will involve me checking your range of motion, strength, and reflexes. It shouldn’t be painful, but please let me know if anything does hurt. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But… be gentle. And… don’t take too long. My hands are already hurting just thinking about it. And… I don’t like being touched. It makes me… uncomfortable. But… I guess I have to. My husband would be mad if I didn’t. So… just… hurry. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as gentle and quick as possible. I understand this is uncomfortable, and I'll explain everything as I go. First, let's start with your left hand. Can you open and close your hand for me?
PATIENT: It… hurts. When I close it. Like… something is stuck. And… it’s hard. To bend my fingers all the way. They… feel stiff. Like they haven’t moved in a long time. See? It’s not very smooth. And… it’s getting more painful. Every time I do it. Please… just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It does look a bit stiff, and I notice some slight swelling around your knuckles. Now, I'm going to gently bend each of your fingers. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. How about this finger?
PATIENT: Ow! Yes! That one hurts! A lot. Like… a sharp pain. Right here. And… it cracks. I don’t like that. It feels… wrong. Stop! Please stop! It’s really hurting. I told you it would hurt. This is… awful. Just leave it alone!
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. I'm stopping immediately. I apologize for causing you pain. It seems there is definite tenderness and limited range of motion in your left index finger. Now, let’s move to your right hand. Can you open and close that one for me?
PATIENT: It’s… not as bad. But… it still hurts. A little. Mostly… in my wrist. When I bend it. Like… a dull ache. And… it feels weak. Like I can’t… grip things very tightly. It’s… frustrating. I used to be able to do anything. Now… I can barely hold a cup of coffee. It's just… getting worse. All the time. Please… be careful. I don’t want it to hurt anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. Now, I'm going to gently check the strength of your grip. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Ow! It hurts! My hand… it’s so weak. I can’t… squeeze very hard. See? It’s… barely anything. I used to be able to… crush things. Okay, not crush, but… you know. Strong. Now… it feels like… a wet noodle. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to… be difficult. It just… hurts too much. Please… just… stop. I've shown you. It's weak. I don't need you to… poke me anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely understand. I’m stopping the exam now. It’s clear that your grip strength is diminished, and you’re experiencing pain with even minimal exertion. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome and/or tendinitis, possibly aggravated by repetitive stress at work. It is also possible you have early signs of arthritis. To confirm this, I would recommend an X-ray to rule out any bone damage, and nerve conduction studies to assess the function of the nerves in your wrist and hand. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Ugh. X-rays? Nerve… studies? What does that even mean? It sounds… scary. And… expensive. My husband… he doesn’t like spending money. He says I’m overreacting. He says it’s just… work. He says I need to… toughen up. I don’t know. I don’t want to… go through all that. Can’t you just… give me something for the pain? Pills? Rubbing something? Anything? I just want it to stop hurting. I don’t want to… deal with all that… testing. Is there anything else I can do? Without… all that? Please?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and I respect your concerns about cost and further testing. It’s valid to want a quick solution, and I want to explore all options. While pain medication can provide temporary relief, it doesn’t address the underlying cause of the problem, and long-term use can have side effects. Rubbing something can also help with pain, but it’s unlikely to be a lasting solution. Given your concerns, we could start with a wrist brace to provide support and reduce inflammation, and I can recommend some exercises to strengthen your hands and wrists. However, if your symptoms don't improve or worsen, the X-ray and nerve conduction studies will be crucial to rule out more serious conditions and determine the best course of treatment. Would you be willing to try the wrist brace and exercises first, and then reassess in a few weeks?
PATIENT: Ugh. A brace? Like… a cast? I can’t… work with a cast! My boss would… fire me. And… exercises? I’m already tired. I don’t want to… do more work. But… I guess it’s better than… all that testing. And… I don’t want to upset my husband. He gets… angry when I don’t listen to him. Okay. Fine. A brace. And… exercises. But… can you… write down the exercises? I don’t want to… forget. And… how long do I have to wear the brace? And… what if it doesn’t help? Can I… just come back and see you? Please? I just want this to be over.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. I’ll write down the exercises for you now. They are gentle stretches and strengthening movements, and you should aim to do them several times a day. As for the brace, you should wear it during work hours and any other activities that aggravate your symptoms. You can take it off at night while you sleep. We'll start with this for four weeks. And yes, you can definitely come back and see me if it doesn’t help, or if your symptoms worsen. We can then discuss the possibility of further testing and treatment options. I also recommend avoiding activities that aggravate your symptoms as much as possible. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Ugh. Avoiding activities? How can I avoid activities? I have to… work! My boss would… fire me! This is… so complicated. Um… what if… the brace hurts? What if it makes it… worse? And… what if I can’t… afford the brace? It’s probably… expensive. My husband… he’ll be mad. He says I waste money. And… what if it’s… arthritis? Is that… serious? Will I… have to stop working? I think… that’s all. For now. This is… too much. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, those are all very valid concerns. Let's address them one by one. If the brace causes any pain or discomfort, stop wearing it immediately and come back and see me. We can adjust the fit or try a different type of brace. As for the cost, I can provide you with information on local resources that may offer financial assistance with medical equipment. We can also explore less expensive brace options. Arthritis is a chronic condition, but there are many different types and levels of severity. Some types can be managed effectively with medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. It's unlikely you'd have to stop working completely, but you may need to make some adjustments to your activities. It's important to remember that we're taking things one step at a time. Let's start with the brace and exercises, and see how you respond. Here’s a referral to a physical therapist in the area, just in case you want to start that sooner. Do you feel comfortable with this plan?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay. Fine. A brace. Exercises. Physical… something. But… I don’t like it. It’s… too much work. And… I’m still worried about the money. My husband… he’ll be mad. But… I guess I have to try. I don’t want to… lose my job. And… I don’t want to… be in pain anymore. Okay. Yes. I… feel comfortable. Sort of. But… if it gets worse… I’m coming back. And… I’m blaming you. Just… so you know. Can I… go home now? I’m tired. Very tired. This has… been a long day.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. You can go home now. And you are absolutely right to come back if things get worse - that's what I'm here for. I understand this has been a long and tiring day, and I appreciate you coming in and being so open with me. Here’s a summary of our plan, along with the exercises and the referral slip. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we'll take things one step at a time. Get some rest, and I hope to see you feeling better soon. It was nice meeting you, Airam. .
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Bye. I hope you’re right. .
