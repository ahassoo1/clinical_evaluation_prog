DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Marquie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Yeah, nice to meet you too. It's…well, I've been getting really short of breath lately. It’s kinda scary, to be honest. I don't really…remember exactly when it started, just that it's been happening more and more. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath… that is concerning, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. It's alright if it's hard to explain, we'll figure it out together. You said it's been happening more and more. Can you tell me a little bit more about when you notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm…when? That's the tricky part. I think…walking up the stairs definitely gets me winded. And…I do a lot of work, you know, with the water plant…lifting things, being outside…it happens then too, I guess. But sometimes it just…happens. Even when I'm sitting. It's all kinda blurry, honestly. My wife keeps telling me I need to come see someone, she worries.
DOCTOR: It sounds like it’s impacting your daily life, which is good you're addressing it now. And it's wise of your wife to encourage you to come in. “Happening even when you're sitting” is something we need to explore. When it happens while sitting, is there anything that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger it…? Not that I can think of, no. It just…starts. Sometimes it’s a little wheezing, sometimes just feels like I can’t get enough air. It doesn’t last long, usually. A few minutes, maybe. I try not to think about it too much. I…I don't know if this is important, but I haven’t really seen a doctor in ages. I just…avoid it, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it comes on spontaneously, sometimes with wheezing, and usually resolves within a few minutes. And you haven't been to a doctor in a while… that’s alright, we’ll take things at your pace. To help me understand what’s going on, let’s do a quick review of your health history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Lung problems… hmm. No, not that I remember. I mean, I get the occasional cold, like everyone else. But nothing…serious. My mom had…something with her heart, I think. But I don’t think it was lungs. I’m really bad with remembering stuff like that, sorry. I never paid much attention to medical things.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Marquie. It's perfectly alright. We'll piece things together. Your mom having heart issues is good to know, we can ask more about that later. Okay, and have you ever had any major illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, a long time ago. That’s about it, I think. And…I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, measles, chickenpox… but nothing major. I’ve been pretty healthy, honestly. Just…this breathing thing is worrying me. It feels…different.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child and the usual childhood illnesses. That's helpful to know. And I understand your concern about this breathing issue feeling different. Let’s talk about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements. And do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Medications… nope. I don’t take anything regularly. Maybe some ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s it. And allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, that I know of. I try to stay away from stuff with a lot of chemicals, if I can. Honestly, my wife handles most of the medicine stuff in the house. I just…don't pay attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed, no known allergies. That's good. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I hate smoking. My grandfather smoked, and it…it wasn't pretty. My wife hates it too. Never touched a cigarette in my life.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s very good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, a little. A beer sometimes with dinner, or a glass of wine on the weekend. Nothing crazy. I don't really drink a lot. My wife might have a glass with me sometimes too.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate alcohol use. And finally, do you work with any chemicals or dust at the water plant?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, all the time. Chlorine, you know, for cleaning the water. And sometimes dust, when we're working on the pipes. I wear a mask most of the time, but… it's not always perfect. It gets hot and stuffy, you know? I try to be careful, but… it’s part of the job.
DOCTOR: Okay, exposure to chlorine and dust at work, despite wearing a mask. That's important information. Alright, Marquie, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your lungs and check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds…good. Just get it over with, I guess. I have a lot to do today.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won't take long. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in and out when I ask. Okay, breathe in… and out… again… Okay. And one more time. I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, Marquie. It's not severe, but it’s definitely present. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from the shortness of breath itself. I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. Your oxygen saturation is 93%, which is a little low. Normal is above 95%. I want to get a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and I'll also want to do a blood test to rule out any infection and check your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood tests…? Ugh. Look, Doctor, I really don't like hospitals or tests. Is it…is it something serious? I just thought it was stress, maybe. I've been working a lot lately.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Marquie. I wouldn’t suggest these tests if I didn’t think they were important to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It's possible it’s stress, but the wheezing and low oxygen saturation warrant further investigation. We need to rule out anything serious, like pneumonia or asthma. The X-ray is quick and painless, and the blood test is just a few vials of blood. It’s better to be safe and know what we’re dealing with, wouldn’t you agree?
PATIENT: I… I guess so. My wife would kill me if I didn’t get it checked out properly. Okay, fine. Do the tests. But can we hurry? I really need to get back to work. There’s a problem with the filtration system, and I'm the only one who knows how to fix it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marquie. We’ll get things moving as quickly as possible. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and then we'll get you over to radiology for the X-ray. I’ll order the tests now. Nurse, could you please come in and draw some blood for Marquie Chayer?
PATIENT: Just…let me know when it’s over. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marquie. The nurse is very skilled and will make it as comfortable as possible. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. And after the blood test, we’ll head over to radiology. It won’t be long, I promise. I’ll explain everything again as we go, and we’ll get you back to work as soon as we have some answers. Just take deep breaths. We're doing this to get you feeling better.
PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marquie. We’ll take good care of you.
