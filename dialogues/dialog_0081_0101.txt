DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Aldine Popova is the name. Well, it’s this headache, see? Right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not constant, but when it comes on… ooh, it’s a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: A nuisance, you say. And how long precisely is “a little while,” Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think now. I’d say… about three weeks, maybe a little more. Started off just now and then, easy enough to ignore. But the last few days… it's been comin’ on more often, and stayin’ longer each time. I used to just brush it off, but it’s startin’ to worry me a bit. I don’t like feelin’ pain, you know? Never have.
DOCTOR: Pain is… inevitable, Mr. Popova. It’s a signal. Now, can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't no throbbing, if that's what you're askin’. It’s more… a heavy ache, right at the base of my skull. Feels like somethin’s tightenin’ up, squeezin’. And sometimes, it kinda radiates, spreads a little bit up the back of my neck. Not all the way to my head, just the neck. It’s a dull ache, mostly, but it can get sharper if I move my head too fast, or if I’m tryin’ to focus real hard on somethin’. Like readin’ a small print.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed anything that specifically brings on these headaches, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me see… I don’t think so, not really. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anythin’ particular. I do a lot of work with my hands, you know, bein’ a manicurist and pedicurist. Maybe that’s somethin’? But I’ve been doin’ that for years, and it never bothered me before. Sometimes it comes on after a long day, when I’m tired, but other times… it just comes on for no reason at all. Honestly, it’s a bit unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with these headaches, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. No dizziness, no blurry vision, no nausea or anything like that. I haven’t noticed any weakness in my arms or legs. My appetite's been normal, sleepin’ alright… though I do wake up a few times in the night, but that’s just old age, I reckon. No, I can’t say I’ve been feelin’ anythin’ else particularly strange. Just the headache. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you had any previous medical issues, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Well, I've had the usual things, you know? Old age comes with a few aches and pains. High blood pressure, they told me years ago, but it's been under control with diet and exercise, mostly. I'm a pretty active man, still. I haven't been to the doctor much over the years, to be honest. I believe in keepin' myself movin'. Had a touch of arthritis in my hands a few times, but nothin' serious. No surgeries, no major illnesses… nothin' like that. Oh, and I broke my wrist when I was a boy, fallin’ out of a mango tree, but that healed up fine. A long, long time ago now.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Just a little something for the blood pressure, Doctor. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. A small dose, every morning. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take a bit of ibuprofen, over-the-counter, you know? But not regularly, just when I need it. That’s it. I try to avoid takin’ pills whenever I can. Don't like the way they make me feel.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you allergic to any medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anythin’ they’ve given me at the doctor's office, or any food for that matter. I do get a bit of a rash sometimes when I’m bitten by mosquitoes, but that's just a normal reaction, you know? Nothing serious. Nope, can't say I have any allergies to speak of. I'm a pretty tough old bird.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. It will just be a quick neurological assessment and a check of your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Go ahead, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I'm ready when you are. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated. Now, I'm going to check your pulse. Regular pulse. Now, I’m going to assess your cranial nerves. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m followin’ it. Keep it steady now, my eyes ain't what they used to be. Is that alright? Am I doin’ it right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. Good control. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There you go, Doctor. As you can see, still got a bit of a grin left in me. Sometimes I use it to charm the ladies. Does that do?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you furrow your brow and squeeze your eyes shut tightly?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that good enough? It feels a bit strange, tighten’ all the muscles like that.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to check your strength in your arms and legs. Please resist as you normally would if I try to move your limbs.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, do your best. I’ll push back as hard as I can. Just let me know if I need to push harder or softer. Don’t worry, I’m a pretty strong old man, still got some muscle left.
DOCTOR: Good strength in your arms and legs. Finally, I will check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, go ahead. I don’t mind a little tappin’. Just let me know if it stings or anything. I haven’t had a good thumpin’ in a while, so this is a bit of a novelty.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. Everything appears neurologically intact. Your strength and reflexes are normal. The slight elevation in your blood pressure is something we should monitor, but it’s not an immediate cause for alarm. Based on your symptoms and this examination, it’s likely you’re experiencing a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by stress or muscle strain. However, given your age and the recent onset of these headaches, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgement. A bit of blood never hurt anyone. It’s good to be thorough, especially at my age. I’ll take anythin’ to put my mind at ease. So, what do I need to do now? Do I need to come back for another appointment, or will you let me know the results?
DOCTOR: Alright. I will write you a lab order now. You can get these tests done at the clinic’s lab tomorrow morning, first thing. They usually have quick turnaround times. I’ll want to see you back here next week to discuss the results, regardless of what they show. Let’s schedule that for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at ten sounds perfect, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to look at me, and explainin’ everything so clearly. It’s good to know I'm in capable hands. Will I need to fast before the blood tests? And is there anythin’ else I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests – no food or drinks, except for water. And please bring a list of all your medications with you when you come back next Tuesday, just to be certain we haven’t missed anything. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything. Fasting, medication list… got it. You've been very helpful. I feel much better already, just knowin’ we're gettin’ to the bottom of this. Thank you again for your time and attention. I'll see you next Tuesday, then. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Popova. You take care now, and I’ll see you next Tuesday. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if anything changes before then. Have a good day.
