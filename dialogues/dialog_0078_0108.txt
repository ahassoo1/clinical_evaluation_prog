DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. My name is Dr. Solero. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, I ain’t got a whole lot of time for chit-chat. Been… well, bleeding. Down there. It’s been going on a few days now and it’s… unpleasant. Not something a man wants to talk about, frankly. Just want it stopped.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. It’s perfectly alright if you’re not comfortable with the details right away. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and I assure you, these things are more common than people think. It’s good you came in to get it checked. Just to clarify, when you say “down there”, are you referring to bleeding from your rectum?
PATIENT: Rectum? Is that what you call it? Yeah, that’s the one. Look, I ain’t no doctor. It’s coming out of my… backside. Is that clear enough? And yeah, it’s… blood. Not just a little, either. Enough to worry me, which says somethin’ considering what I do for a livin’. You see a lot worse, right? But this… this is me. Different story.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gentz, that's perfectly clear. And you’re right, as a physician, I’ve seen a variety of medical issues. It's understandable that experiencing this yourself is concerning, even with your profession. Okay. And how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Started, I’d say… Tuesday, maybe? So, about… three days now. It wasn’t much at first, just a spot on the paper. Thought maybe I ate somethin’ bad. But yesterday… yesterday was a different story. Had to change my… underthings… twice. And it ain’t gettin’ better, that’s for sure. I tried some of those over-the-counter stomach things, but they did nothin’. Absolutely nothin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days, starting Tuesday. And it’s definitely been increasing, particularly yesterday. And you've tried some over-the-counter remedies without any improvement. Now, can you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want, a poetry recital? It’s… red. Look, Doc, it’s blood. What’s there to describe? It ain't blue, okay? It’s… mostly just red. Sometimes it’s brighter, sometimes it’s darker. There was… I don't know… some clumps in it yesterday. Like little pieces. And it smelled… well, like blood, naturally. Is this really necessary? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Gentz. My apologies. It's important to try and understand the nature of the bleeding, and I understand your frustration. The differences in color and the presence of clumps are helpful information. Okay, so brighter red and darker red, with some clumps yesterday. Has anything specific happened that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Well, straining, for one. You know... when you gotta go. Pushing... makes it a lot worse. And… look, this is embarrassing, but… when I pass gas, sometimes it comes with it. A little… spray. Not a lot, but enough to… be unpleasant. Honestly, it’s just been a bad week all around. I had to deal with a… difficult family yesterday at work, too. Everything just feels… off. Though, I doubt that has anything to do with my backside bleedin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, so straining definitely makes it worse, and you've noticed some bleeding associated with passing gas as well. And you've had some stress with a difficult situation at work. While stress might not be the direct cause, it can certainly contribute to overall health and digestive issues. Now, have you experienced any pain or discomfort along with the bleeding?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really… sharp pain. More like… a pressure. Like somethin’s… swollen. And a little crampin’ sometimes, especially after… you know. Like a dull ache, really. Not somethin’ I’d call debilitating, but definitely noticeable. And… this is gonna sound strange, I know, but sometimes I feel like I haven’t… emptied everything out. Like somethin’s still there. But there ain’t nothin’ there when I look. Does that make any sense? I don’t usually talk about this stuff, Doc. This is… awful.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Gentz, and thank you for sharing all of this with me, even though it’s uncomfortable. It’s important information, and you're doing the right thing by coming in to get it checked. Okay, so pressure, some cramping, and a feeling of incomplete bowel emptying. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. I stay pretty healthy, all things considered. I mean, I eat right, I try to get some exercise when I can, and… well, my job keeps me on my feet. Widowed five years ago, lost my wife to… never mind. That’s a whole other story. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, no nothin’. Just… this. And honestly, Doc, I’m starting to get worried. I’ve seen what this can be, workin’ where I do… and it ain’t pretty. Are you thinkin’ it’s somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gentz, and I assure you, we’re going to do everything we can to figure out what’s going on. And I appreciate you sharing that information with me. It’s good that you don’t have any known medical conditions. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Nope. Never had anything major. Broke my arm when I was a kid, got a cast, that was about it. No hospitalizations, except when my wife… well, you don’t need to know about that. Nothing else. I’m a pretty simple man, Doc. I just wanna get back to work and… and leave this whole mess behind me. I’m missin’ a shift tomorrow if this doesn’t clear up soon. And I don’t get paid if I don’t show. It's just… bad timing, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations except for the broken arm as a child. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I can take most things, really. I take ibuprofen sometimes for aches and pains, and that’s about it. No reactions, no rashes, nothin’. My wife used to say I could eat anything, which… well, that was before… Never mind. I ain’t got no allergies, Doc. Just… this bleedin’. It’s wearin’ me down. Is this gonna require… tests? I really don't like tests. Especially the ones where they… never mind. Just tell me what you're thinkin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you’re right to ask about tests, Mr. Gentz. Given your symptoms - the rectal bleeding, the changes in color, the presence of clumps, the cramping, and the feeling of incomplete evacuation - it’s important we investigate this further. I’m concerned about potential causes such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or potentially something more serious like inflammation or a growth. To get a clearer picture, I would like to perform a physical exam, including a rectal exam. This will allow me to visually assess the area and check for any abnormalities. It will also help rule out other possible causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? You want to… look there? Look, Doc, I appreciate you tryin’ to help, but… that sounds awful. Really awful. I mean, I understand it’s your job, but… Is there any other way? Can’t you just give me somethin’ to stop the bleedin’? A pill, maybe? I really don’t want anyone… pokin’ around down there. It’s just… humiliating. And frankly, a little scary. I’ve seen what happens in that line of work… I don’t need that.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation and discomfort, Mr. Gentz. It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about a rectal exam, and I would never push you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. However, given your symptoms, a physical exam is the most effective way to get a proper diagnosis and rule out any serious underlying causes. It allows me to visualize the area directly and assess the source of the bleeding. I want to assure you that I will be as gentle and respectful as possible throughout the exam. I will explain each step beforehand and stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. I’ll also ensure your privacy is maintained at all times. If we skip the exam, we risk missing something important and delaying appropriate treatment. Before we proceed, I can explain the exam in more detail, and we can discuss any concerns you may have. We can also talk about alternatives, but they may not provide the same level of accuracy. Ultimately, the decision is yours, Mr. Gentz. But I strongly recommend allowing me to perform a physical exam to ensure we get to the bottom of this and provide you with the best possible care. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Look, Doc… you’re right. I know you’re right. Delayin’ things ain’t gonna help. And… and I don’t wanna end up like some of the folks I… deal with at work. Just… just get it over with, okay? But… be gentle. And… and quick. And please, don't tell me everything you're seein’. I don't need a play-by-play. Just tell me what it is when you're done. And… and I really need to get back to work. This is losin' me money. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I completely understand. I will be as gentle and quick as possible, and I will only share the necessary information with you. I will explain everything beforehand, and I will stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. Okay, so what I’m going to do is have you lie on your side, and I’ll gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to check for any abnormalities. It may feel some pressure or slight discomfort, but it shouldn’t be painful. I will be looking for things like hemorrhoids, fissures, or any masses. I will also be checking for any blood or inflammation. Please let me know immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort at any point. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. And try not to poke around too much, okay? I don’t like this. Not one bit. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, just relaxing. Deep breaths. I'm just gently inserting my finger now. Let me know if you feel any discomfort. Okay, all done. Okay, so what I found was some tenderness and mild swelling internally. There are also some external hemorrhoids present, which appear to be the primary source of the bleeding. They are not large, but they are inflamed and likely causing the discomfort and bleeding you’ve been experiencing. I didn't feel any masses or anything concerning. The stool guaiac test was positive for blood, which we already suspected. Overall, it appears to be a case of symptomatic hemorrhoids. However, given your history and the positive guaiac test, I want to be thorough and rule out any other potential causes. I would recommend a colonoscopy to get a clearer picture and ensure there are no underlying issues. We can also discuss some treatment options to help manage your symptoms and prevent future bleeding. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hemorrhoids? That’s… it? All this fuss… for hemorrhoids? I’ve seen folks with worse, honestly. But… a colonoscopy? You want to stick a camera up there? That sounds… awful. Worse than the other thing, even. Is it really necessary? Can’t you just… give me somethin’ for the pain? Some cream, maybe? I really don’t want to go through another procedure. I got a job to do, Doc. I can't be layin' around gettin' cameras stuck in me. Is there any other way? Honestly, I'm startin' to feel a little faint. This is a bad day. A really bad day.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Gentz, and I apologize for the discomfort you're feeling. It’s good news that it appears to be hemorrhoids, but it’s important to remember that bleeding from the rectum should always be investigated. A colonoscopy would allow us to rule out any other potential causes, such as inflammation, polyps, or, rarely, something more serious. It’s a preventative measure to ensure we’re not missing anything. However, I understand your concerns, and we can certainly discuss alternatives. We can start with conservative treatment for the hemorrhoids, such as dietary changes, stool softeners, topical creams, and sitz baths. We can also schedule a fecal occult blood test to monitor for any further bleeding. If your symptoms don’t improve with conservative treatment, or if they worsen, we can revisit the option of a colonoscopy. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Okay… conservative treatment. That sounds… better. Less invasive, anyway. Dietary changes, creams, sitz baths… I can handle that. No cameras. For now. And… monitor for bleeding. I can do that. I don't wanna go under the knife, Doc. I just want this to stop. So, what kind of dietary changes are we talkin’ about? And what kind of cream? Does it smell bad? I really don't want somethin' that smells awful. And how often do I gotta take these baths? Honestly, I'm exhausted. This has been a really long morning. Can we just get a list of instructions? I’ll try my best, okay? But no promises. Just… get me out of here. I need to go home and… and lie down.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I completely understand. We can definitely start with conservative treatment and see how you respond. Okay, here's a list of instructions: Dietary Changes: Increase your fiber intake by eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid processed foods and limit red meat. Hydration: Drink at least 8 glasses of water per day to keep your stools soft. Stool Softeners: I’m going to prescribe you a mild stool softener to help ease your bowel movements. Follow the dosage instructions on the label. Topical Cream: I’m also prescribing a topical cream with hydrocortisone and a local anesthetic to help relieve pain and inflammation. Apply it to the affected area twice daily after each bowel movement. It has a mild scent, but it shouldn’t be unpleasant. Sitz Baths: Take sitz baths for 10-15 minutes twice daily after each bowel movement. This will help soothe the area and reduce inflammation. Fecal Occult Blood Test: I want you to perform a fecal occult blood test in one week to monitor for any further bleeding. The instructions are included in this packet. If your symptoms don’t improve within two weeks, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can revisit the option of a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: No, I think I got it. Fiber, water, cream, baths… I can manage. Just… no more poking and prodding, okay? I really appreciate you not makin' me get a camera stuck up there. I mean that. And… thanks for listenin'. It wasn't easy talkin' about all this. Honestly, it feels like a weight lifted, even if I still feel kinda sore. I guess I’ll go home and start the treatment. And… and I’ll call if somethin’ goes wrong. Thanks again, Doc. You’ve been… helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Gentz. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I'm here if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if needed.
