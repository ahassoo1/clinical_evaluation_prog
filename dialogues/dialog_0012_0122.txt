DOCTOR: Hi Venus, welcome. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Yoshino. It is… a pleasure. I am here because… well, my memory. It is becoming… troublesome. I do not like it. It is new, this difficulty.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Troubles with memory can be really concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. “New” is a key piece of information – that helps us figure things out. To start, can you tell me a little more about what you mean by “troublesome”?
PATIENT: It is… small things. I forget where I put my keys, though I always put them in the same place. I repeat questions. I… I will be speaking with a neighbor about the garden, and then I cannot recall what we discussed five minutes later. It is not… large events. Just… details. Important details for daily life, you understand. It is frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, I absolutely understand. Those little things can be really disruptive, and it is frustrating. It sounds like it’s impacting your daily routine, which is definitely worth looking into. To get a better picture, about how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… Perhaps… three months? Maybe four? It began slowly. I thought it was simply… being busy. But it has worsened. My blood pressure… it has been high for some time now, the doctor told me. Perhaps it is connected? I do not know.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months. That gives us a timeframe. And you're right to wonder if your blood pressure could be connected – high blood pressure can definitely affect memory and cognitive function. Let's talk a bit more about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure, Doctor. I had a small… surgery, many years ago, on my knee. But it healed well. Nothing else. I take a pill for the blood pressure, every day. A small, white pill. I… I believe it is called… amlodipine? Yes, amlodipine. And I had the flu, once, last winter, but everyone gets the flu, no? Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so amlodipine for your blood pressure, and a history of knee surgery and the flu. Good to know. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I have taken many medications in my life, for small things, and never a reaction. I am… a very healthy woman, usually. This memory… it is simply unsettling. I am not used to forgetting.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about the allergies. And I understand why it's unsettling, especially if you're usually so sharp. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family. Is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – who has experienced memory problems or conditions like dementia or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: My… my mother, yes. She… she became confused, towards the end. The doctor said… something about her mind. She would forget where she was, who I was, sometimes. It was… very sad. My father, he was always very clear, very strong. No problems with his memory. My brother… he is healthy, as far as I know. We do not speak often. It was many years ago, when my mother… began to forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information, thank you. A family history of memory problems does increase the risk. Now, just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My… lifestyle? What do you mean, Doctor? I live alone. I manage the properties in the neighborhood – the gardens, the repairs, the meetings. I… I walk every day. I read. I try to eat healthy foods. I do not drink alcohol, and I do not smoke. It is a quiet life. A simple life. Is that what you wish to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. That's very helpful. It sounds like you're quite active and take good care of yourself, which is wonderful. Do you feel stressed or anxious often?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Managing the properties… people can be… difficult. There are always complaints, disagreements. And… since my husband passed away… it has been lonely. I do not show my stress, but… yes. Sometimes I feel… overwhelmed. I try to be strong. I must be strong for everyone. But… it is not always easy.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, especially after a loss and with the responsibilities you carry. It takes a lot of strength to manage everything, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. Okay, Venus, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your overall health and rule out any other potential causes for your memory concerns. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you think is best. I wish to understand what is happening. I want to be… clear-headed again. Please. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Those are normal. Finally, I’m going to do a brief cognitive assessment. This just involves a few simple questions and tasks to get a better sense of your memory and thinking skills. It won't be a formal diagnosis, but it will give us a good starting point. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. I will answer truthfully. I want to be… accurate. Let us begin. I am ready. Though… I am a little nervous, now. It is strange, to be tested on my memory.
DOCTOR: I understand it can feel a little unsettling, but you’re doing great. We’ll take it slowly. Okay, first question. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today is… August second. August second, 2025. Yes. I am certain of that. I checked the calendar this morning. Before I came here.
DOCTOR: Good. Very good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. I… I know I live in a large city. A very large city. Is it… Los Angeles? No… San Francisco? I… I am usually very good with geography. This is… troubling. I should know.
DOCTOR: Okay, it's alright. Take your time. We're in Seattle. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. I’ll say them, and then I’ll ask you to remember them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. I have them. Apple, table, penny. I will remember. I am sure of it. This is… odd. I feel as if I am trying very hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions about your recent past. Do you recall what you had for breakfast this morning?
PATIENT: Hmm… Breakfast… I believe I had… toast. Yes, toast with… jam. Strawberry jam, I think. And… coffee. Yes, coffee. A small cup of coffee. But… it is all a little… hazy. I usually remember these things. It is as if… the memory is fading. It frightens me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, one last question before we move on. Can you spell the word “world” backwards for me?
PATIENT: …D-l-r-o-w… No. That is… incorrect. I know how to spell “world”, but backwards… It is… difficult. I am usually very good with spelling. This is… very upsetting. I apologize. I am making mistakes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus, thank you. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief assessment, you’re experiencing some difficulties with short-term memory and recall, and some trouble with certain cognitive tasks. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but these symptoms could be due to a number of things, including high blood pressure, stress, anxiety, or possibly early signs of cognitive decline. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d also recommend a brain scan – an MRI or CT scan – to look for any structural abnormalities. And I’d like you to see a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests… a scan… a neurologist… If that is what is necessary, then… yes. I want to understand what is happening. I want to be… clear-headed again. Please. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. But… this is frightening. Very frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is frightening, and it’s okay to feel that way. We’ll take this one step at a time. I’m going to write you a referral to a neurologist I trust – Dr. Chen. I’ll also have the lab draw the blood tests today. The results will take a few days. In the meantime, it’s important to manage your stress. Are there any coping mechanisms you use, or activities you enjoy that help you relax?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I… I keep busy. That is what I do. I manage the properties, I read… I try to focus on practical things. I do not allow myself to… dwell. But… it is not always effective. The loneliness… it is difficult. And now… this. I do not know what to do. Perhaps… gardening. I enjoy gardening. It is… peaceful. But it is not enough, I think. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like gardening is a good start, but you might benefit from exploring other stress-reduction techniques. Things like mindfulness, meditation, or even joining a support group could be helpful. I can give you some resources for those if you’d like. Now, is there anyone who can help support you during this process?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. My husband… he passed away two years ago. We had no children. I have a brother, but… we are not close. We do not speak often. I manage everything myself. I always have. I am… accustomed to being alone. But… this is different. This is frightening, and I… I do not know who to turn to.
DOCTOR: I understand. That can be very isolating. It’s important to have support, and it’s okay to ask for help. Even though you’re accustomed to managing things on your own, you don’t have to go through this alone. I have a list of support groups in the area for people experiencing memory concerns and for those who are grieving. Would you like me to give you that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. That would be… very kind. I… I may not use them. But it is comforting to know they are there. Thank you. You have been… very understanding. And patient. I appreciate it. This is… a lot to process.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venus. It is a lot, and it's okay to take your time. I’m glad I could help, even just a little. Here’s the information. And remember, I’m here for you too. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call. For now, I'll get the lab order for the blood tests and the referral to Dr. Chen. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Thank you again. I… I feel a little less frightened, now. Knowing that there are options. And that I am not alone… completely alone. I appreciate your kindness. And your patience. I will call if I have any questions. And I will schedule the follow-up appointment. Thank you. Perhaps… perhaps I will go gardening, this afternoon. It may help. .
DOCTOR: That sounds like a wonderful idea. Gardening is a great way to relax and de-stress. Take care of yourself, Venus. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. It was nice meeting you.
