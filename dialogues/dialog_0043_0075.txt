DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. Even though I’m using the machine they gave me for the sleep apnea… it just doesn't seem to be doing the trick, you know? I still feel tired all day. It’s a bit frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. That is frustrating. It’s good you’re already using a CPAP machine for the sleep apnea – that’s an important first step. So, you're still experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness despite using the machine consistently?
PATIENT: Yes, consistently. I try not to miss a night. My ex-wife… well, she was very good at making sure I used it, and the habit stuck, thankfully. But even with it on, I find myself dozing off in the afternoons, you know? Not falling asleep asleep, but… drifting off. It makes reading difficult, and I enjoy my books. And sometimes my grandkids will be talking to me and I’ll just… lose track. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Paske, and it’s good that you've been so diligent with the CPAP. Losing track during conversations is certainly concerning, and we want to get to the bottom of this. To help me understand things better, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I wake up around 7, usually. I have a small breakfast – toast and coffee, mostly. I used to teach history at the community college, but I retired a few years back. Now, I volunteer at the local library a couple of times a week, helping people with research. I read a lot, as I mentioned. I try to take a walk in the afternoons, when it’s not too hot. I usually have dinner around 6, and then I’ll watch some television or read before bed. And, of course, the CPAP every night. It's a fairly quiet life, all things considered. I do try to keep busy, you know? But I'm just…tired a lot of the time, even with all that.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very full and admirable routine, Mr. Paske. It's good you remain active. Now, let’s delve a little deeper into this tiredness. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being wide awake and 10 being completely exhausted, what number would you typically rate your energy level throughout the day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It fluctuates, of course. First thing in the morning, maybe a 6, after the coffee. But by mid-afternoon, it dips down to a 3 or 4, easily. Even with the CPAP. So, I'd say… on average, probably a 5 throughout the day. It’s rarely higher than a 7, and often dips lower. It makes focusing difficult, you know? I find myself rereading paragraphs several times.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed answer, Mr. Paske. That’s very helpful. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this daytime sleepiness and fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, my wife used to complain I snored, even with the machine, though it’s much better now. I do wake up with a dry mouth sometimes, and a bit of a headache. Not terrible, but noticeable. Oh, and I’ve noticed I need to use the restroom more often at night. That’s new, I think. And… sometimes, I just feel a little… foggy, you know? Like my thinking isn't as sharp as it used to be. It's frustrating, honestly. I used to be able to recall dates and details so easily.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of that with me, Mr. Paske. The dry mouth, headaches, increased nighttime urination, and the feeling of fogginess are all important details. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let’s see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years. I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. And… oh, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about ten years ago, but I manage it with diet and exercise, and medication when needed. Other than that… nothing major, I don’t think. I see my primary care physician regularly, of course, for checkups. She’s the one who referred me to you about the sleepiness.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That’s good to know. And what medications are you currently taking, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Not at all. Let me see if I can remember everything… I take lisinopril for the blood pressure, 20 milligrams a day. And metformin for the diabetes, 500 milligrams twice a day. Sometimes, if my blood sugar is a little high, I’ll take an extra metformin. Oh, and occasionally, I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not very often. And… that’s it, I believe. I keep a list in my wallet, actually, if you’d like to double-check.
DOCTOR: That's very thoughtful of you, Mr. Paske. No need to dig it out right now, but it’s good you're so organized. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything, as far as I know. My wife always teased me about being able to eat anything without a problem. I suppose I've been lucky in that regard. It makes life a little easier, certainly.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Paske. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or sleep disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My father had heart disease, unfortunately. He passed away when he was in his seventies. My mother had diabetes, like me, but she managed it pretty well for a long time. And… my brother, he’s always been a bit of a restless sleeper, always tossing and turning. I don’t know if he’s ever been diagnosed with a sleep disorder, but he’s always complained about not getting a good night’s sleep. Other than that… not that I’m aware of. My family wasn’t really one for talking about medical issues, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for families not to discuss these things openly. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she tried to get me to quit her smoking, ironically. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And absolutely no recreational drugs, never have. I always preferred a good book to anything else. A quiet life, you see. That’s always been my preference.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know, Mr. Paske. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, I’d like to briefly review your current sleep apnea treatment. How often do you clean your CPAP machine, and have you had your mask fitted recently?
PATIENT: Good question. I try to clean it every other day, with soap and water, like the technician told me. It’s a bit of a hassle, but I know it’s important. And… let me see… the last time I had the mask fitted was… about a year ago, I think. It still seems to fit okay, but I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to have it checked again. It's a little uncomfortable sometimes, around my nose, but I just figured it was something I had to get used to. Perhaps it is too tight?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That’s helpful information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your throat and nose. This will help me assess your overall health and look for any potential causes of your ongoing sleepiness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear, Mr. Paske. Blood pressure is a little high, but not alarming. Your throat looks fine, and your nasal passages are a bit dry. I'm going to check your oxygen saturation now with a pulse oximeter. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is good. I’m also going to quickly palpate your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels normal in size and consistency. Now, let’s take a look at your CPAP mask. Perhaps it is a bit too tight, or could use a better fit.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good. I appreciate you taking a look at the mask. It has been leaving a mark on my nose lately, and it’s a little uncomfortable, as I mentioned. I’m hoping it’s just a simple adjustment, but honestly, I’m open to anything that might help. This tiredness is really starting to wear me down. I just want to be able to enjoy my books and spend time with my grandkids without feeling so exhausted all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Paske. It’s frustrating when something that’s supposed to help is causing discomfort. I’m going to recommend a repeat sleep study, specifically to assess the effectiveness of your current CPAP settings and to rule out any changes in your sleep architecture. We'll also have the technician re-fit your mask and ensure it's providing an optimal seal. In the meantime, to address the possibility of mild dehydration contributing to your dry mouth and fatigue, I’d like you to increase your fluid intake to at least eight glasses of water per day. I'm also going to order some basic bloodwork – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level – to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very agreeable, Doctor. A repeat sleep study and a better mask fit sound like excellent ideas. And I can definitely drink more water. I tend to get lost in my books and forget, I suppose. And the bloodwork sounds sensible. Just want to make sure everything is okay, you know? Thank you for taking the time to listen and running these tests. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance and a plan of action. The lab order and referral for the repeat sleep study will be sent electronically to your primary care physician and the sleep center. They will contact you directly to schedule the appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or significant changes in your level of alertness – please contact your primary care physician immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. I really appreciate your patience and kindness. It's a relief to finally have a plan to address this tiredness. Thank you again for everything. I suppose I’ll just wait to hear from the sleep center and try to drink more water.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Mr. Paske. It was my pleasure to meet you and help in any way I could. Remember, we are a team in this, and I'm here to support you throughout the process. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the future. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: .
