DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Louine. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about time someone finally got around to seeing me. This foot of mine is a mess, and it’s been getting worse for weeks. Honestly, I expected better care, but I suppose I shouldn't be surprised living out here.
DOCTOR: I apologize you’ve had to wait, and I’m sorry to hear about your foot. We’ll get this sorted out. “Weeks,” you said?
PATIENT: Oh, weeks is an understatement. It started small, just a little sore spot. But my grandson, he kept saying, "Grandma, you need to go to the doctor!" Like he knows anything. Now look at it. It’s red, it hurts, and frankly, it’s embarrassing. I haven't been able to wear my good sandals.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore spot that’s been getting redder and more painful…and it’s affecting your ability to wear your sandals. That’s important. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t remember the exact date. I’m 89 years old, you know. I remember when things were good around here, before everything changed. But it was probably… sometime after my grandson's birthday. He turned 25, lovely boy, but always fussing over me. It was a little ache after I went to that church picnic. They had those awful plastic chairs, you know, the kind that dig into your skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, so after the church picnic, a little ache that’s progressed over the weeks. And it seems like those plastic chairs might have been a factor. Besides the pain, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I’m old. Everything changes when you get old! But… let me think. Oh! It’s been a bit… smelly, I suppose. And sometimes, when I walk, I feel a little… tired in my legs. Not terribly, but noticeable. And my skin around it feels… funny. Not smooth like it used to be. Everything is just downhill now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some smell, increased fatigue in your legs when walking, and a change in the skin around your foot. That gives me a little more to work with. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or swelling in your foot or leg?
PATIENT: Fever? Goodness, no. I don’t get fevers. Chills… maybe a little cold sometimes, but that’s just because this place isn’t heated properly. Swelling… hmm. I haven’t really looked at my foot, you know? I just try not to think about it. It’s unpleasant. My grandson keeps telling me to look at it, but I tell him I’ve got better things to do. Honestly, young people think they know everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills that you’re aware of. We’ll take a look at the foot together then. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. But don’t expect me to enjoy it. And be gentle! My skin is very sensitive, you know. And don’t make a mess. I just had these pants cleaned. Honestly, the things I have to put up with…
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very gentle. I'll need you to lie back on the examination table, if you’re comfortable. I’ll do my best to be quick and minimize any discomfort. Let me grab some gloves first.
PATIENT: Honestly, these things are so uncomfortable. And cold! And you young doctors always have such cold hands. It's a wonder anything ever heals properly. Hurry up, please. I haven’t got all day. My grandson is taking me for ice cream later, you know. And I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Alright. It does look a bit red and warm to the touch. And I can feel some tenderness here… Can you tell me if this is particularly painful?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that spot! It feels…hot. And throbbing. It’s been like that for days, but I didn’t want to bother anyone. Honestly, I’ve had worse aches and pains in my life. But this… this is just annoying. And the smell! It’s quite embarrassing, you know. I had to put extra lotion on before I came here. Don't look at me like that! It's just an old lady's foot!
DOCTOR: I understand it’s frustrating, Louine. It sounds like this has been bothering you for a while. I do notice some redness and warmth, and there’s a little bit of discharge here. Do you have any cuts or blisters that you can recall?
PATIENT: Discharge? What do you mean, discharge? Oh… that little bit? I thought it was just lotion. I put lotion on everything! Cuts or blisters… hmm. Not that I remember. I wear socks, you know. Sensible socks. But maybe… maybe I scraped it a little bit on the coral when I was swimming last month. But it was just a little scrape! Nothing serious. Honestly, you young doctors always make a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible scrape from the coral. And we’ve noted the redness, warmth, and discharge. It's good you mentioned the lotion, that can sometimes mask things. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it could be an infection, possibly related to the scrape. To be sure, I'd like to order a quick lab test to check for bacteria. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A lab test? Honestly, must we? It sounds… unpleasant. And expensive! I’m on a fixed income, you know. Is it really necessary? I mean, it's just a little sore spot. I’ve had worse. But… I suppose if you think it's important… Fine. But hurry up, please. And don't give me a long list of things to do. I can barely remember where I put my glasses, let alone follow complicated instructions. And no needles! I hate needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine. It's a simple swab test, very quick and not painful at all, no needles involved. It will just tell us what kind of bacteria, if any, are causing the problem. Knowing that will help us choose the right treatment. We’ll get the results back quickly, usually within a day or two. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend keeping it clean and dry, and wearing loose socks and shoes. We can discuss antibiotics if the lab confirms an infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Clean and dry… loose socks… I can manage that. And no needles, you promised. But if it doesn't get better, I'm blaming you. Honestly, doctors these days… always making a fuss over nothing. But a quick swab… I suppose it's better than nothing. Now, can I get off this dreadful table? My legs are aching. And please, don't give me any of those paper gowns. They're terribly drafty.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Louine. Let me help you sit up. And no paper gowns, I promise! I'll have the nurse bring in a form for the lab test, and we’ll get that sorted out quickly. The nurse will also give you instructions on keeping the area clean and dry. Thank you for coming in today. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
