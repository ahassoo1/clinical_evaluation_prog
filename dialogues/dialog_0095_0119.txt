DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But it’s a problem, a delicate problem. And frankly, I don’t know who else to turn to. It’s… concerning.
DOCTOR: I understand. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things. Don't worry, Ms. Wartick, everything you tell me is confidential. Take your time, and just explain what’s been going on. We’ll figure it out. Perhaps you could start by telling me when this first started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… It’s been… a few weeks, I suppose. Not terribly long, but long enough to be… unsettling. It's not something a woman expects to be dealing with, you understand. It’s… his. It's coming from him. Honestly, it's quite dreadful.
DOCTOR: “Him?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, him. My… companion. It’s a discharge, you see? An unpleasant one. And it’s… well, it’s coming from down there. On him. Really, the whole situation is… most irregular. I’ve never encountered anything like it. And I certainly didn't expect to be discussing such things with a doctor. It's terribly awkward, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, just to be certain I understand correctly… are you saying you are experiencing a discharge from your… partner?
PATIENT: Well, yes! Isn’t that what I’ve been trying to tell you? Honestly, Doctor, are you even listening? It’s quite obvious, isn’t it? A discharge! From him! It’s… it’s frankly unhygienic, and I’m rather worried it might be… contagious. I keep telling him to be more careful, but men, you know how they are. Completely oblivious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wartick. Thank you for clarifying. So, to be clear, you're concerned about a discharge you've observed on your male partner. Is this a new issue, or has this happened before?
PATIENT: Of course it's new! If it had happened before, do you think I'd be wasting my time here? Honestly, Doctor, sometimes I wonder… It started a few weeks ago, like I said, and it's… rather persistent. It's not a large amount, thankfully, but it's certainly… noticeable. And it smells… unpleasant. He doesn’t seem to think it’s a problem, but I do. A woman has standards, you know.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Ms. Wartick, and it's good you're bringing this to my attention. It's important to investigate these things. To get a better understanding, could you describe the discharge a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s… yellowish, I think. And a bit… thick. Not like water, certainly. More like… cream, but not a pleasant cream. And as I said, it smells… not fresh. A bit… sour, perhaps? Honestly, I try not to look at it too closely. It's quite distressing, you understand. And he insists on wearing such dark trousers, it’s hard to get a good look, even if I wanted to. Really, the whole situation is rather… unfortunate.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish, thick, with a sour smell. Thank you for that description. Has your partner experienced any other symptoms along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. He hasn’t said anything… He’s not one for complaining, you see. But now that you mention it… he has been rather… quiet lately. More than usual, that is. And he seems a bit… tired. But he always claims to be tired! Honestly, men are so oblivious to their own health. He hasn’t mentioned any pain, though. And his… appetite seems normal. Really, I'm not sure. It's hard to tell what's going on with him. He just sits and watches television, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. No pain, normal appetite, just increased quietness and tiredness. Has there been any change in his bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits?! Really, Doctor! Are you suggesting…? That’s… quite personal, isn't it? I hardly think that’s relevant! I came here about a discharge, not… that! Honestly, I’m starting to think you’re not taking this seriously. A woman comes to you with a delicate problem, and you ask about her companion’s… evacuations! It’s simply appalling. I think I'd like a second opinion.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Wartick. I assure you, I am taking this seriously. I was simply trying to gather as much information as possible to understand the potential cause of the discharge. Sometimes, changes in bowel habits can be related to underlying infections or other conditions. However, I understand your discomfort, and we can certainly focus on the discharge itself. To proceed, and with your permission, I’d like to ask a few questions about your companion’s medical history, if you know it. Do you know if he has any pre-existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… he’s a bit of a… recluse, you see. Doesn’t bother with doctors. Claims he’s “perfectly healthy.” But… he did have a rather nasty bout of something years ago. Pneumonia, I think it was. Kept him in bed for weeks. And… he used to be quite the… ladies’ man, shall we say. Before me, of course. So, one can only imagine… I really don’t know much about his history, to be honest. He doesn’t like to talk about it. Frankly, I’m not sure I want to know! It’s probably best not to dwell on the past, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Pneumonia in the past, and a… more active social life previously. Ms. Wartick, given the description of the discharge, and your partner’s previous history, it’s important to rule out a possible sexually transmitted infection, or another cause of urethritis. The best course of action would be to have him examined by a doctor and tested. I can provide you with a referral to a urologist. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A… a what?! Are you suggesting…? He… he has a disease?! Honestly, Doctor, that’s… that’s outrageous! I will not subject him to such… indignity! He’s a respectable man! And I certainly won’t be responsible for dragging him to some… specialist! This is simply appalling! I think I’ve heard enough. I’m leaving. I expected a more… delicate approach, Doctor. You’ve only made matters worse. Disgraceful… absolutely disgraceful…
