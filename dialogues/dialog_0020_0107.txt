DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my heart, it feels funny sometimes. Like, it beats too fast, but not all the time. It's... hard to explain. It just flutters. That's why I make appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A fluttering sensation in your chest… that’s good you came in to get it checked out. It is good you came in. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me more about when this happens?
PATIENT: When it happen? Hmm... not when I do something hard, like work. It just... happen. Maybe when I relax? Or when I watching TV? I not really sure. It's not every day, you know? Sometimes a week, sometimes not for a month. It’s hard to say. I’m sorry. I try to remember, but… it just happens. It no follow any time.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it is tricky when it's not consistent. It sounds like it doesn’t seem to be related to physical activity, which is good to know. And you’re right, it’s hard to pinpoint sometimes. Do you notice anything else happening when this fluttering starts?
PATIENT: Anything else...? Let me think. Sometimes I feel a little… dizzy. Not fall down dizzy, just... light head. And maybe a little bit short of breath? Not bad, just… like I need to take a bigger breath. And... I think my chest feel tight sometimes, but maybe that just from the fast beat? I not sure about that one. It hard to tell what feel what. I no good with explaining how body feel.
DOCTOR: Okay, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and sometimes a tight feeling in your chest… those are all things we want to explore. It is okay if it’s hard to explain; we’ll work through it together. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, never. I always healthy, mostly. I work with chemicals, so I go for check-ups at work, but they say I'm fine. Never have any problem with heart before this. My father… he had some pressure, I think, but not heart. Just… pressure. I no remember exactly what kind. Sorry. Old man problems. He passed away long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior medical diagnoses for you, and your father had some blood pressure issues, but not heart problems specifically. That’s helpful information. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I no take nothing. Never been a big medicine man. I eat good, mostly. My wife, she always tell me to take vitamin, but I forget. I drink tea, sometimes. Yemeni tea, it good. But not medicine. Just tea. And I no drink much alcohol, maybe once a month when I go with friends.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No medications or regular supplements. Just tea and occasional alcohol. Alright, Mr. Puder. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that good. Listen to heart, check blood… okay. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what make heart flutter. It scare my wife. She worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart rate is a little elevated right now, but that could be from being in the office. I hear no unusual murmurs or sounds. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is slightly on the higher side, 138/85. And your pulse is regular, but a bit fast. Given your symptoms and these findings, I’d like to order a few tests to rule out anything serious. We'll do an EKG – that's a simple test that records your heart's electrical activity. And I’d like to get some blood work done to check your thyroid levels, electrolytes, and complete blood count. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: EKG...? Blood work...? Yes, okay. Whatever you say. If it help find out what wrong, I do it. I no understand what EKG do, but if you say it good, I trust you. When can we do it? I have work tomorrow. I can come after work, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. An EKG is a quick, painless test where we put some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart's rhythm. And the blood work is just a standard sample, nothing to worry about. We can absolutely schedule those tests for after work tomorrow. Let me see… there’s an opening at 6 PM at the lab down the street. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: 6 PM, yes, that good. After work is fine. I finish work at 5, so 6 PM give me time to get there. Down the street you say? Easy. My wife can drive me. She worry too much, she want to be with me. Thank you, Doctor. That make me feel better already. Just knowing we do something.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. 6 PM tomorrow it is. And it’s good your wife will be there with you for support. Here is the requisition form for the lab. Just take this with you tomorrow, and they will get you all set up. We’ll get the results back in a few days. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Chest pain... okay, I remember. Emergency room. Thank you, Doctor Beinborn. You very kind. And you listen to me, even when I no explain good. That mean a lot. My wife will be happy to hear we do tests. Thank you again. I go now. Have good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up. You have a good day as well, and please give your wife my best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will.
