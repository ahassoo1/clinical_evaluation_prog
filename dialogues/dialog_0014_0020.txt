DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is… a check-up, mostly. My regular doctor, he… passed away last year. I need to find someone new, and this is… recommended. I have Medicare, if that is okay?
DOCTOR: Medicare is perfectly fine. Though, frankly, a "check-up" at your age… is rarely just a simple thing. It's been a while since anyone's really looked at you, hasn't it?
PATIENT: Yes. A long while. He… he was a good doctor. Very thorough. I feel… a little tired lately, but I work hard. I fix cars, you know? It is… physical work. Sometimes my back aches, but that is… normal, yes?
DOCTOR: Fixing cars…yes. That is physical. "Tired lately"… that could be anything. And back aches are…common. But common doesn’t mean we ignore them. Tell me, is this tiredness new, or has it been building up?
PATIENT: It is… newer. Maybe six months, I think? Before that, I was… always busy. Not much time to feel tired. But now… after work, I just want to sit. And sometimes, even in the mornings, I don’t feel… strong. Like I need many coffees to start. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: "Need many coffees…" Right. Well, relying on caffeine isn't exactly a solution. Six months… that's enough time to warrant a look. Are you sleeping okay?
PATIENT: I sleep… mostly okay. Sometimes I wake up in the night, but I go back to sleep. My house is… quiet now. It is different than when my husband was alive. He… he snored, a lot. So I am used to quiet. But I do not sleep as well as before, no.
DOCTOR: Right. "Different than before." Of course. Look, Ms. Benites, I'm not going to pretend I know your entire history. But a change in sleep and fatigue… that's a starting point. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just routine stuff, to get a baseline. Blood pressure, heart, lungs, the usual. Can you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. The scale… is over there? I hope it is accurate. I… I have lost a little weight, I think. Everything tastes… different since he passed. Not as good.
DOCTOR: It should be accurate. We calibrate it regularly. Weight loss… and altered taste… alright. Let's just get your vitals first. Then we'll talk more about this. Don't worry, we'll figure things out. Step on when you're ready.
PATIENT: One hundred and seventy-two. Is that… bad? I used to be heavier. But I was… bigger then. It feels… strange to be losing weight without trying.
DOCTOR: One seventy-two. That's… a bit lower than your recorded weight, yes. Though, as you said, things change. Alright, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please, sit back and take some deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breaths… I used to get very nervous at the dentist. He made loud noises. This is… quieter. Is everything okay so far?
DOCTOR: Everything seems okay so far. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Heart sounds are…regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, but your breathing is a bit shallow. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength. Just follow my instructions. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that… good? I used to be very strong. Working on cars, you need strong hands. Not as strong now, maybe. It is… harder to lift the heavy parts.
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is…adequate. Not as strong as it once was, as you said. Alright. Now, can you lift your arms?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… a little stiff. My shoulders. They ache sometimes. Especially after… after working under the cars. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a relative term, Ms. Benites. A little stiffness after physical labor isn't uncommon. But the degree of discomfort… and the fact that it's affecting your overall strength… That's worth investigating. Now, let’s talk a bit more about this weight loss. Has your appetite changed at all?
PATIENT: Yes. It has. Everything… tastes like nothing, almost. I still eat, because I know I need to. But I do not… enjoy it. My husband, he was a wonderful cook. Everything tasted so good when he made it. Now, it is just… food. It fills the stomach, but it does not… satisfy. And I do not feel hungry as much as before.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite…altered taste…weight loss…fatigue…It's a lot, Ms. Benites. It could be many things. Let's run some blood work, just to get a baseline. We’ll check your thyroid, your vitamin levels, and rule out anything obvious. And honestly, given your fatigue and weight loss, I'm going to order a chest X-ray, just to be safe. It's routine. Don't worry. But we need to rule things out. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… Is something… wrong? I do not smoke, if that is what you are thinking. My husband, he tried it once, long ago, and he did not like it. He said it smelled… bad. Is it… serious? I do not want to cause trouble. I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t mean something is wrong, Ms. Benites. It’s simply a precaution. Fatigue and unexplained weight loss require investigation. We need to see what’s going on, and an X-ray is a good place to start. It’s a routine imaging test. It doesn't mean I suspect anything serious, but we can't ignore these symptoms. I assure you, you’re not causing any trouble. We are simply being thorough. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw some blood. Then, the radiology department is on the third floor. Do you think you can manage that on your own, or would you like me to have a nurse escort you?
PATIENT: I think… I can manage. I used to walk a lot with my husband. He liked to go to the park. I remember the way. I do not want to bother anyone. But… thank you for offering. I think I can find the lab. And the third floor. Is there… anything I need to do before the blood work? Should I eat something? Or… not eat? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. No, you don’t need to eat anything special. Just… try to relax. And drink some water before you go. It makes the blood draw easier. The lab technician will give you instructions. It’s a simple procedure. Once you've had the blood work and the X-ray, make an appointment with the receptionist on your way out to follow up with me in a week. They’ll find you a slot. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not… dismissing me. It is… nice to be taken seriously. A week… I will remember. I think. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright… let's get these results back and hopefully it's nothing. .
