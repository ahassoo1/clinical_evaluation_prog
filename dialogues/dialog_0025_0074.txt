DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Ms. Steines. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… the pressure. Been feelin’ kinda shaky lately, and my daughter, bless her heart, she said I oughta get it checked. She worries somethin’ awful.
DOCTOR: Pressure, alright. And shaky… can you be a little more specific about that?
PATIENT: Well, not like… tremblin’ all over, ya know? More like… a heaviness, in my head sometimes. And my arms feel… weak. Not all the time, just… comes and goes. It's hard to explain. I get tired easy too. Real easy.
DOCTOR: Heaviness…weakness…tired easily. Alright. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Steines?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… a while. Maybe… three, four months now? It started slow, I didn't pay it much mind at first. Just thought I was gettin' old, ya know? But it ain't goin' away. My husband, he used to say… well, never mind what he used to say. It's been gettin' worse lately, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Three or four months… and worsening. Okay. Any other symptoms along with the heaviness, weakness, and fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my vision gets… blurry. Just for a bit, then it's okay. And… oh, I get headaches. Dull ones, mostly. Not the real bad poundin’ kind. And I been thirsty a lot. Real thirsty. That’s about it, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, headaches, increased thirst… alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your… bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Bathroom habits? Oh, goodness. Well… I go to the bathroom more often than I used to, I suppose. Especially at night. Wakes me up sometimes. Is that what you mean? It’s just… gettin’ old, right? Everything kinda goes with gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Ms. Steines. We’ll need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. Let’s start with a blood pressure check, and then we’ll do some blood work. I'll also want to listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds alright, Doctor. Just… try not to take too long, alright? I got a pie crust needin' rollin' this afternoon. Blueberry, my grandbabies are comin' over. They love my blueberry pie.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Steines. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please sit back and relax. 140 over 90. Hmm. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning at your age. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I always hated doctors. Not that you're doin' anything wrong, mind you. It’s just… reminds me of when my mama was sick. Go on now, get it over with. The sooner I get back to my pie, the better.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are…regular, though a bit faint. Lungs are clear, but there’s some mild wheezing. Nothing alarming, likely just age-related. Now, I’m going to need to draw some blood. It’ll just be a few vials, standard tests. We'll check your blood sugar, kidney function, electrolytes…the usual. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood sugar? Electrolytes? Sounds… complicated. But alright, if you need it, you need it. Just… be quick, please. I got a feelin' in my bones this pie crust ain’t gonna roll itself. And my daughter would have my hide if I didn't get it done. She's a good girl, that one. Always lookin' out for me. Go ahead then. The sooner this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. Just relax your arm. This will sting for a moment… There we go. All done. Just need to apply a little pressure here for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. While that's stopping, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ouch. That did sting. Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. Never had much trouble with medicine. Took some penicillin as a girl, I reckon. And… somethin' for a cough once. But nothin' serious. My husband, he was the one with the allergies. Poor man, couldn't eat a peach without breakin' out in hives. Go ahead and write down “none” then. That's the safest bet.
DOCTOR: Alright, “no known allergies.” Any medications you’re currently taking, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my arthritis. These old knuckles ain’t what they used to be. It’s… Ibuprofen, I think. The regular kind, ya know? Over-the-counter. Just when they get real bad. And… sometimes a little Benadryl if I can’t sleep. But that's it. Nothin' fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen as needed, Benadryl occasionally. And you said your husband had allergies?
PATIENT: He did. Real bad ones. Pollen, dust, cats… you name it. He always carried an EpiPen, just in case. He’s gone now, though. Been five years. Good man, he was. Always made me laugh. But… that ain’t got nothin’ to do with my pressure, has it? Are we almost done here, Doctor? My pie…
DOCTOR: No, your husband's allergies aren’t directly relevant, Ms. Steines. But it's good to have a complete picture. Alright, we’ll send these blood samples to the lab. It should take a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’m going to order a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. And just to be on the safe side, I'm going to recommend an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A metabolic… whatchamacallit? And a… ECG? Goodness gracious. Sounds like a whole heap of tests. I… I reckon so. If you think it’s necessary. But I still got that pie crust, Doctor. And my grandbabies are expectin’ blueberry. Will these tests take long? I just don’t want to be keepin’ them waitin’ too long.
DOCTOR: The EKG will only take a few minutes, Ms. Steines. We can do that right now. The blood tests will take a couple of days, as I said. We’ll call you with the results. In the meantime, I recommend you limit your salt intake and drink plenty of water. And… try to get some rest. If you'll just lie down on the table here… we’ll get this over with quickly.
PATIENT: Salt and water… that’s what my mama always said too. Hurry up now, Doctor. This table is cold. And my pie… Don’t forget my pie. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. Just relax. Try not to move. Okay, all done. Let’s take a look at this… Hmm. Some minor irregularities, but nothing overly concerning for your age. We'll need to review the blood work to get a clearer picture. Alright, Ms. Steines. We’ll call you with the results in a couple of days. Remember, limit your salt intake, drink plenty of water, and try to get some rest. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No, I reckon not. Just… hurry up and call me, alright? My grandbabies are countin' on that pie. And I got a feelin' in my bones it’s gonna be a good one. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Next patient…
