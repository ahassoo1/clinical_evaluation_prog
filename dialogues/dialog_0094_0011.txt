DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. Look, I ain't got all day. I need a… a permission slip. For somethin’ the… the fella down the street offered. Said I needed a doctor to say it’s okay. Somethin’ about my… face. Honestly, I don't recall much detail. Just want it done quick, if you please.
DOCTOR: I understand. A note for a procedure offered by someone else, concerning your face. Of course. To make sure I can provide an accurate note, could you tell me a little more about what this "fella down the street" offered?
PATIENT: Look, it was… somethin’ about makin’ it… smoother. Wrinkles, I think. He had a… machine. All shiny. Don't ask me specifics, lady. I'm not a… a technician. Just want to know if I can do it without… problems. Is that too much to ask? Honestly, all these questions... I told you, I don’t remember details. I just want the okay.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not too much to ask at all, Mr. Honcoop. It's important for me to gather enough information to ensure your safety. So, let’s try this: do you recall where on your face this procedure was offered?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Somewhere… around here, I suppose. Near the barber shop. He parks his van there sometimes. It's...the whole face. He said it would fix everything. Look, I'm a simple man. I don’t need a map and a history lesson. Just tell me if I can go ahead, or not! I ain’t got time for this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I’m hesitant to provide a note for a procedure offered in these circumstances. A procedure affecting the “whole face” performed by someone parked in a van near a barber shop… that raises several concerns. I need to understand more to protect your health. Could you tell me when this offer was made?
PATIENT: Look, lady, are you accusin’ somethin’? I ain’t doin’ nothin’ illegal. He's a businessman. Offers services. I asked about gettin’ somethin’ fixed, he offered. It was… last week, maybe? Tuesday, Wednesday… I don’t keep a calendar for everythin’. All I know is, it seemed reasonable. And I’d like to know if you think it’s alright, instead of grillin’ me like a… a criminal. Honestly, it’s just a little touch-up. You makin’ a big deal outta nothin’. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I am not accusing you of anything illegal. My concern is entirely for your safety. Procedures like these, when performed outside of a regulated medical setting, carry significant risks of infection, scarring, and other complications. Before I can even consider providing a note, I need to perform a basic skin exam to assess your current condition. Would you be willing to allow me to do that?
