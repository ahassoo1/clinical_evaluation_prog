DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguioto. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's Paguioto, actually – P-A-G-U-I-O. I'm here for a vaccination, I think? Medicare sent me a notice saying it was time for one, and I wanted to get it sorted. I don’t quite remember which one it was for, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Paguioto, yes. Right. Medicare does send out a lot of those notices… It’s difficult to keep track, isn’t it?
PATIENT: It really is! I try to keep everything filed neatly, but things slip my mind sometimes. Do you have a record of what I need, Doctor? Maybe a list? I wouldn’t want to take up too much of your time guessing.
DOCTOR: Let's see… Medicare record indicates you are due for a pneumococcal vaccine and a tetanus booster. Are you up-to-date on your flu vaccine as well?
PATIENT: Pneumococcal… and tetanus? Okay. I think I had a tetanus shot a few years back, but I couldn’t say for sure when. And the flu vaccine… I usually get that in the fall, but it hasn’t happened yet this year. It’s still August, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is still August. We can certainly get you updated on both the pneumococcal and tetanus vaccines today. As for the flu vaccine, we typically administer those starting in September, but it's not a strict rule. Do you have any allergies that I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. So, pneumococcal and tetanus today, then? Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Or… will it be a bit of a wait? I have a little bit of time, but not a whole afternoon, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: No preparation is necessary. It will be a quick process. We'll administer both vaccines in your other arm. There may be some mild soreness at the injection sites afterward, but nothing serious. It’s quite standard. Let’s get started, shall we?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Soreness is fine. Better than getting sick! Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do on my end. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just relax your arm. You may feel a brief pinch. There. All done. Now, I’ll need you to stay here for fifteen minutes just to monitor for any immediate reaction. Though, I highly doubt anything will occur.
PATIENT: Okay, fifteen minutes. No problem. A little pinch, you said? That was… a bit more than a pinch, but I suppose it’s worth it. I'll just sit quietly over there then, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: It’s a necessary discomfort. We need to ensure adequate protection. Just let me know if you experience any unusual symptoms – dizziness, difficulty breathing, rash… though those are exceedingly rare. I’ll be right over in a moment to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, I will. No dizziness or anything right now, just a bit of… well, a bit of feeling in my arm. I appreciate you checking up on me, Doctor. It's good to know someone is paying attention. I sometimes worry I forget to mention things. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily a matter of age, Mr. Paguioto. Everyone experiences occasional lapses in memory. Now, your blood pressure is 138 over 82 – perfectly acceptable. I'll document that. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in six months, just to ensure everything is as it should be. Do you have any other concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: Six months sounds good. No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Just the vaccines and a check-up. Thank you for your time and patience. I sometimes feel like a bother asking so many questions, but I'd rather be safe than sorry, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s my job to address your concerns, Mr. Paguioto. Though, I do have several other patients waiting. Here’s a printed summary of today’s visit and your vaccination record. And a card for your next appointment. Do try to remember the date. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I'll do my best to remember. Yes, I've got it. Thank you again. Have a good day to you too, Doctor.
