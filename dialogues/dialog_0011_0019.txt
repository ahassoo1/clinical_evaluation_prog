DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… what brings me? My wife, she say… we want… maybe have baby? But we old now. We want to make sure… okay? I make little things, you know? Metal, plastic… not babies!
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. You and your wife are considering starting a family, and you’d like to discuss whether it’s safe and appropriate given your age. That is perfectly reasonable, and we can certainly explore that together. To help me understand your situation better, perhaps we could start with a few questions. First, are you currently experiencing any health issues?
PATIENT: Health issues? Hmm… not really. I feel… okay. A little tired sometimes, maybe? Old man tired, you know? Nothing… serious. My wife worry more than me. She always ask if I feel cold, or if my back hurts. She good wife. But… I take some pills. For… the water. My water.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Carlotta. It’s good to know you generally feel okay, despite some fatigue. And you mentioned taking medication for “the water” – do you mean for your prostate?
PATIENT: Prostate? Is that… the water place? Yes, maybe. The doctor… he say something about it getting big. So I take the little white pills. Every morning. They help me… sleep better, I think. And… go to the bathroom easier. But I forget the name of the pills! Old man problems, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. Medication names can be difficult to remember. We can certainly look that up in your records. Do you recall the name of the physician who prescribed them?
PATIENT: Doctor… hmm… Patel? Maybe? He had a nice office. Lots of plants. Near the… the big shop? The one with the shiny cars. I see him… a long time ago. Before… the water trouble got bad. It was… a few years. I don’t remember exactly. My brain… slow sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me just check our system for Dr. Patel and any medications prescribed to you. Okay, I see a Dr. Sanjay Patel in our records. And it appears he prescribed you Tamsulosin 0.4mg daily, starting about three years ago, for benign prostatic hyperplasia – an enlarged prostate. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Tamsulosin… that sound right. Yes, yes! That the little white pills! Benign… what? Big prostate. That right. He say it make it hard to… go. So I take the pills. They help. But… do they make… baby trouble? That what we worry about.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Carlotta. Tamsulosin can, in some cases, affect fertility, although the effect is usually reversible when the medication is stopped. It works by relaxing the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, which can sometimes lead to retrograde ejaculation – where semen goes into the bladder instead of out of the penis. This doesn't necessarily prevent conception, but it could reduce the chances. Before we discuss further, could you tell me a little more about your wife’s health?
PATIENT: Retrograde… hmm. So… it still come out? Just… different way? Okay. That… good to know. My wife… she good health. Always walk, always eat good food. Not smoke, not drink. She little tired sometimes, from work, but… strong woman. She have… children already. From first husband. But she want… one more. With me. She no longer young, you know?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear that your wife is generally healthy. And it’s good that she has had children previously. That’s a positive sign. Could you tell me her age, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… she… sixty-two. Yes, sixty-two. Almost. She not tell me exact age, you know? Women… secrets. But she sixty-two. Maybe sixty-three. Close enough.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. That’s helpful information. Given both your ages, and your wife’s history of previous pregnancies, achieving a pregnancy naturally may be challenging. However, it is not impossible. Before we discuss potential options, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, and order some routine blood work to assess your overall health and hormone levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical… okay. I not mind. But… the blood work… lots of poke? I no like poke. But… if it help… if it help baby… then okay. Do what you need. Just… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Carlotta. We'll do our best to make it as comfortable as possible. It will be a standard blood draw, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. We'll just need a few vials for a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and some hormone levels. Let’s start with the physical exam. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Okay… here I go. Old man bones… creaky. Is… is that enough? Do I need to… stand on one leg?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. That’s sufficient. Your weight is 96 kilograms, and your height is recorded as 164 centimeters. That gives you a BMI of 35.7, which is classified as obesity. This can impact fertility in both men and women, so it’s something we should be aware of. Now, if you would please follow me over to the examination table, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. We'll also check your prostate size. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… heart, lungs… that okay. But… the prostate… is that… uncomfortable? My wife say it get big. So… what you do? You poke it? I no like poke.
DOCTOR: We'll start by listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. This is a non-invasive procedure. Then, to check your prostate size, it involves a brief digital rectal exam. I understand your apprehension, Mr. Carlotta, and I will explain everything as I go. It's not usually painful, but it can be a bit uncomfortable. It allows me to assess the size and consistency of your prostate. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. We can stop at any time if you are uncomfortable. Before we begin, would you like your wife to remain in the room?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes. Please. Let my wife stay. She… she good with poke. And she help me… be brave. Yes. Let her stay.
DOCTOR: Of course. Mrs. Carlotta, thank you for staying with your husband. Alright, Mr. Carlotta, if you could lie back on the examination table, and drape yourself with the gown. I’ll begin by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I will gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. Your abdomen is soft, with no tenderness to palpation. Now, I will proceed with the digital rectal exam to assess your prostate size. I will use lubricant to minimize discomfort. Please take a deep breath and relax.
PATIENT: Okay… okay… do it quickly, please. And… remember, I no like poke.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. That is complete. Your prostate is enlarged, but not significantly firm. There are no palpable nodules. It feels approximately 40 grams in size, which is consistent with moderate enlargement. Based on this examination, and your medical history, we can discuss further investigations and potential options to help you and your wife achieve your goal of starting a family. Would you like to discuss blood work now, or do you need a moment to collect your thoughts?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. 40 grams… is that bad? Blood work… yes. Let's do the blood work. If it help baby, then okay. What you need to know? What it tell you? Is it expensive?
DOCTOR: 40 grams is considered moderate enlargement, Mr. Carlotta. It's not necessarily "bad", but it can contribute to urinary symptoms and potentially affect fertility. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, hormone levels, and rule out any other underlying conditions that might be affecting your ability to conceive. We'll be checking your complete blood count to look for any signs of infection or anemia, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, testosterone levels, and prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which can help us monitor your prostate health. Medicare typically covers these blood tests with a reasonable copay, which I believe is around $30 to $40, depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can provide you with a more accurate estimate. We’ll draw the blood right here in the clinic. It will only take a few minutes, and the results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, do you have any questions about the blood work, or would you like me to explain the next steps in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… $40… that okay. Better than no baby. Testosterone… is that… man stuff? I feel like man. Old man, but man. So… after the blood work… what then? You give me pills? Or… something else? Do you… help make baby?
DOCTOR: Yes, testosterone is indeed a “man stuff” hormone, Mr. Carlotta. It plays a crucial role in reproductive health and overall well-being. Checking your levels can help us identify any potential imbalances that might be affecting your fertility. Once we have the blood work results, we can develop a tailored plan for you and your wife. Depending on the findings, potential options might include lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss and exercise, medication to improve your hormone levels or urinary symptoms, or a referral to a reproductive specialist. As for directly helping to "make a baby," I primarily focus on assessing and managing your overall health and fertility. However, if necessary, I can certainly refer you to a reproductive specialist who can provide more advanced treatments, such as intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization. For now, let’s focus on getting the blood work done and reviewing the results. Then we can discuss all of your options in more detail and make a plan that’s right for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sound good. Lifestyle… I can walk more. I like walk. And… maybe eat less cake. My wife say I eat too much cake. So… blood work first. Then… cake control. And… maybe baby. That sound good plan, Doctor. Thank you. Let's do it.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Carlotta. That’s a very positive attitude. We’ll get the blood work ordered right away. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples. Nurse Davies, could you please assist Mr. and Mrs. Carlotta with the blood work?
