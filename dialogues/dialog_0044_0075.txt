DOCTOR: Good morning, Moshe. Welcome to the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. Now, to get started, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this tiredness, really. Daytime sleepiness, even though I’m using the machine they gave me for the sleep apnea. It just…doesn't feel like it's doing enough, you know? I’m still dragging myself through the day. It's been going on for a little while now, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Moshe. Daytime sleepiness despite using a CPAP machine is definitely something we need to look into. It's good you're bringing this up. “A little while now” – can you give me a sense of how long we’re talking?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I started using the machine…oh, it must be close to six months now, maybe seven. And the tiredness…it was better at first, for sure. But it’s been creeping back, I’d say for the last two, maybe three months. It’s not awful, but it’s enough to notice. Enough to make things…difficult, you know? Especially if I’m trying to stay focused. I used to be able to read all day, but now…it’s a struggle.
DOCTOR: I see. So, initial improvement with the CPAP, then a gradual return of symptoms over the past two to three months. That's helpful to know. And you've noticed it's affecting your ability to concentrate and enjoy reading, which you used to do easily. Before we go further, can you tell me a little more about the sleepiness itself?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s…it’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up or anything. It's more of a…heavy feeling, a lack of energy. And a real difficulty staying awake. I find myself dozing off in the afternoon, usually after lunch. Even just sitting and watching television. I used to be able to power through, but now…I'm fighting it. It's frustrating, honestly. I feel like I'm living in slow motion sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not overwhelming sleepiness, but more of a struggle to stay awake, especially in the afternoons, accompanied by a general lack of energy. That helps paint a clearer picture. Now, let's talk about the CPAP machine itself. Are you using it every night?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. Every single night. I don’t like it, mind you. It’s a bit…claustrophobic, and the mask leaks a little, even after I adjusted it. But I know I have to use it. My ex-wife – she was very insistent on that. And the doctor who prescribed it made it very clear too. So, I do. Every night. I try to put it on as soon as my head hits the pillow. Maybe six, seven hours a night, usually. It’s not always a solid six or seven, sometimes I wake up and have to readjust it.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent use, despite some discomfort and minor leaks. That’s good, and it’s important you’re sticking with it. The leaks are something we can definitely address. Now, regarding your sleep before you started the machine...can you describe what your sleep was like?
PATIENT: Oh, it was…terrible. Absolutely terrible. My wife – bless her heart, even though we’re divorced now – she used to tell me I snored like a freight train. And I’d wake up feeling…groggy, never rested. I’d wake up several times a night, gasping for air, you know? It wasn't a peaceful sleep, not at all. I was constantly tired, irritable…it affected everything. That’s why the doctor suggested the sleep study in the first place. And that’s when they told me about the apnea.
DOCTOR: Right, so significant snoring, frequent awakenings, and feeling unrefreshed despite what you thought was a full night's sleep – all pointing towards the sleep apnea diagnosis. Now, let's talk a little bit about other things that might be impacting your energy levels. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…not really, no. My appetite is pretty much the same. I enjoy my food, you know? Spanish cooking…it's hard to resist. And my weight…well, I’ve always been a bit on the heavier side. I’ve lost a pound or two here and there, but nothing significant. I try to walk a bit when I can, but with the tiredness…it’s harder to get motivated. I probably don’t eat as healthily as I should, honestly. Lots of rice and beans, you know? And paella on the weekends!
DOCTOR: Okay, stable appetite and weight, with a generally consistent diet. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, let’s go through a quick review of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that have been diagnosed, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think…the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but it’s been under control with medication for a while now. Just a small dose, nothing major. Other than that…no, not really. I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I suppose. And my vision isn’t what it used to be, but I wear glasses. Nothing else comes to mind, honestly. I’m pretty lucky, I think, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension and some arthritis in the knees, but otherwise generally healthy. That’s good to know. Do you take any medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the one for the blood pressure, Doctor. A small, white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes I take a little something for the arthritis, just when my knees are really bothering me. Over-the-counter stuff, you know? Ibuprofen, something like that. Nothing regularly, just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication daily and occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I’ve never had any bad reactions to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. My ex-wife used to joke that I had a cast-iron stomach. And I've never had a problem with any medications, as far as I can remember. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My father…he had heart problems later in life. He had a stroke, I believe. And my mother…she had diabetes, but it was manageable with medication. My brother…he’s got high blood pressure, just like me. Other than that…not really. No history of cancer that I know of. My family…they weren’t big on talking about their health, if I’m honest. It was a bit of a taboo subject.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. That's good to know. Finally, let's talk briefly about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of the above. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother was very strict about that. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a retired teacher, you know? I’ve seen enough of that in my lifetime!
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. That’s all very helpful information, Moshe. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Go ahead. I understand you need to check things. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular, though the first sound is a bit stronger than typical. Blood pressure is 142/88 – a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi. Ears appear normal. No signs of infection or excessive wax buildup. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Lymph nodes are normal in size and consistency. Okay, Moshe, everything seems generally normal so far. However, your blood pressure is a little higher than we’d like. And the accentuated heart sound is something to keep an eye on. Given your continued fatigue despite CPAP use, and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to order a few blood tests. We’ll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any underlying causes for your tiredness. We should also do an EKG, just to be safe, to look at your heart rhythm more closely. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds…sensible, Doctor. Yes, I agree. If something’s not right, it’s best to find out, isn't it? Blood tests and the EKG…fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? I miss reading. And having the energy to go for a walk without feeling completely exhausted.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Moshe. And we will work towards that. The blood tests and EKG will give us a better understanding of what's going on, and help us create a plan to get you feeling better. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood samples now, and we can schedule the EKG for later this week. In the meantime, it's important to continue using your CPAP machine as prescribed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’m just glad I came in. I was starting to think I was just…getting old, you know? But it’s good to know there are things we can check. Thank you. And thank you for listening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Moshe. It's my job to listen, and to help you feel your best. And it's important to remember that fatigue can have many causes, and it's definitely worth investigating. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please don't hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and your help. I appreciate it very much. I’ll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Moshe. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
