DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Doc, right? Look, I ain’t got all day. It’s… the breathin’. Been gettin’ harder. And my mouth feels like the desert, you know? Everything’s just… dry. Can't even enjoy a good cigar no more. It’s a mess, a real mess.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. It sounds quite bothersome. Difficulty breathing and dryness are definitely things we want to address. When did you first notice the breathing getting harder?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? Boy, that’s a tough one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe… last few months? Everything’s kinda blurry these days. I just remember it gettin’ worse, slow-like. Used to be able to walk to the store, no problem. Now? Forget about it. And the dryness… always thirsty. Always.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of gradually worsening shortness of breath and persistent dryness. And it’s affecting your ability to walk, I see. Has this shortness of breath been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, yeah. Mostly when I try to do somethin’. Sittin’ around doin’ nothin’? Not so bad. But walkin’? Climbin’ stairs? Forget it. It feels like… like someone’s squeezin’ my chest. And then the mouth gets real bad. Like cotton. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Guilds, I understand. A squeezing sensation in your chest with exertion and increasing dryness—that gives me some initial ideas of what might be going on. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me see… … Not that I noticed. I got these old boots on most of the time, hard to tell. Maybe a little? I don't pay much attention to that kinda thing. Always been a pretty skinny fella, even for my age. Ain’t got the build for swellin’ or nothin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. And have you had a cough at all, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: A cough? Sometimes. Mostly at night. A little tickle, really. Ain’t no big cough, not like when I was a kid. Just… a little bother. I usually just ignore it. Old man stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild cough that’s worse at night. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Huh. Let me think... Doc, I been to a lot of doctors over the years. And they all tell me somethin' different. I think… somethin' about the pressure? High blood pressure, maybe? And the old man down the street, he said I had a touch of somethin' with my lungs when I was younger, but that was ages ago. Honestly, it all runs together after a while. Medicare pays for a lot of tests, you know. They poked and prodded, but I don’t remember what they found.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. It can be difficult to keep track of everything. High blood pressure is definitely something we’ll want to consider. And a history of some lung issue is also important. Do you know what, if anything, was diagnosed with your lungs?
PATIENT: Ugh… no, can’t rightly say. It was… back in the army, maybe? Lots of dust, lots of… stuff. They gave me some pills, told me to stay away from smoke. And I mostly did. Used to enjoy a good cigar, but… not so much anymore. The breathin' just ain't what it used to be, even with the cigar. Just a cough, mostly. A little tickle.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a possible history of a lung issue from your time in the army, and a current cough with a history of high blood pressure. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries... hmm... Let me see. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell outta a tree chasin' a cat. They fixed it up, good as new. And… I think I had somethin' taken out, appendix maybe? A long time ago. Hospitalized? A few times, for this and that. Old age, you know? Gets you into trouble. Nothing serious, mostly just overnight stays.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, possible appendectomy, and a few overnight hospital stays for unspecified reasons. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or have you stopped taking any recently?
PATIENT: Let me see… Here. This one. Water pill, the doc gave me for… somethin'. Blood pressure, maybe? And… I think I used to take somethin' for my stomach, but I stopped. Didn’t seem to be doin' much good, so I just quit. Don't bother much with pills these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a water pill—furosemide—for blood pressure, and you previously took something for your stomach but stopped. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a problem with pollen or nothin'. Used to work outside all the time, never bothered me none. I’m a tough old Cuban, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. No known allergies. Now, Mr. Guilds, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history... Ugh, that's a long story. Lots of folks, lots of… problems. My father, he had… somethin' with his heart, I think. Died young. And my mother… she lived a long time, but she was always sick. Lots of coughin' and wheezin'. And my brother, he had… well, I don't remember exactly, somethin' with his breathin' too. It runs in the family, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. A family history of heart problems and breathing issues. Finally, could you tell me about your smoking or alcohol history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Now there’s a question. Smokin’? Used to. A lot. When I was younger, with the boys. Cigars, mostly. Good Cuban cigars, you know? Best in the world. Quit a long time ago, though. Doc told me to. And alcohol? A little now and then. A beer with dinner, maybe. Don’t go overboard, you know? Old age, don’t need the trouble.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Guilds. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine, fine. Get it over with. Just don’t poke too much, alright? And hurry up, I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 160 over 92. A little elevated. Heart sounds… slightly irregular rhythm, and I can hear a murmur. Lung sounds are diminished, with some wheezing on both sides, especially at the bases. Mild pitting edema in both ankles, just a small amount. Okay, Mr. Guilds. I’ve listened to your heart and lungs, and checked your ankles. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found on the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms related to heart failure, possibly exacerbated by some underlying lung disease. The shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling in your ankles, and irregular heartbeat all point in that direction. However, we need some further testing to confirm this. I’d like to order a chest X-ray, an EKG, and some blood work—including a BNP to check your heart function. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Ugh… heart failure? What’s that mean? Sounds… serious. And all them tests? Takes time, you know. I ain’t got all day. What will them tests show? And if it is heart failure, can you fix it? I just want to be able to breathe again, Doc. And enjoy a good cigar once in a while. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Guilds. Heart failure doesn’t necessarily mean your heart is about to stop. It means your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should be, which can cause fluid to build up in your lungs and other parts of your body. That's why you're feeling short of breath and having swelling in your ankles. The tests will help us understand the cause of the heart failure, if that’s what’s going on, and how severe it is. The chest X-ray will show us if there’s fluid in your lungs. The EKG will check the electrical activity of your heart. And the blood work will give us more information about your heart function and overall health. As for fixing it, there are many things we can do to manage heart failure and improve your symptoms. Medications can help strengthen your heart, reduce fluid buildup, and control your blood pressure. Lifestyle changes—like reducing salt intake and exercising regularly—can also make a big difference. We may also need to consider a referral to a cardiologist—a heart specialist—for further evaluation and treatment. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Ugh... a heart specialist? More doctors? Seems like everyone wants to poke and prod me these days. Okay, okay. Tests... fine. But can I still have a little cigar while I'm waitin' for the results? Just a small one? For medicinal purposes, you understand. It calms my nerves. And what about the medication? Will it make me sleepy? I gotta be able to… well, I gotta be able to think, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Guilds. It sounds frustrating to have so many appointments and tests. I'll write a referral to a cardiologist for you, but we don't need to rush into anything. We'll get the test results first and then discuss the best course of action. Regarding the cigar… while I can’t specifically recommend smoking, especially with your heart condition, I understand it brings you comfort. We can discuss this further once we have the test results. The goal is to manage your health and improve your quality of life, and that includes considering what’s important to you. As for the medication, it depends on what we find in the tests. Some heart medications can cause drowsiness, but there are also many that don't. We’ll start with the lowest possible dose and monitor your symptoms closely. If you do experience any side effects, we can adjust the medication or try a different one. Okay, I’ve ordered the chest X-ray, EKG, and blood work. The lab should be able to schedule you for an appointment within the next few days. Once the results are back, we'll review them together and discuss a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Ugh... emergency room. Sounds… unpleasant. Okay, okay. Chest X-ray, blood work. I guess I gotta do it. Can I at least get a note so I don’t have to explain all this to the nurses again? They always look at me like I'm makin’ it up. And… tell me honestly, Doc. Do you think… do you think I’ll be able to breathe normally again? That’s all I really want. Just to be able to breathe.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Guilds. I completely understand. I’ll write a note for you to give to the nurses explaining your symptoms and the tests I’ve ordered. It should help streamline the process. As for your question… it’s hard to say definitively without the test results. However, many people with heart failure are able to significantly improve their symptoms with treatment. We have many options available, and we’ll work together to find a plan that’s right for you. The goal is to get you breathing comfortably again, and to improve your quality of life. I'm optimistic that we can make a positive difference. I want you to feel comfortable and confident in our plan. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or how to prepare for them?
PATIENT: Ugh... prepare? What kinda preparation? Do I gotta fast? I hate fasting. And... will the X-ray hurt? I got old bones, you know. Things creak and groan these days. And what about the blood work? I always get dizzy when they take blood. It's a mess, a real mess. Just tell me what I gotta do, Doc. Simple. No fancy talk.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds, no fancy talk, I promise. For the chest X-ray, no special preparation is needed. You don’t need to fast, and it shouldn't hurt at all. It’s just a quick picture of your lungs. You’ll stand or sit in front of the machine, and the technician will take a few images. It’s completely painless. For the blood work, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before your appointment. That means no food or sugary drinks. You can drink water, but that’s it. As for the dizziness, let the phlebotomist—the person taking your blood—know that you’re prone to it. They can take precautions to make you more comfortable, like having you lie down during the procedure. They can also give you a cold compress to apply to your forehead. Here's a summary of the instructions. You’ll need to fast for 8 hours before the blood work, and let the phlebotomist know about your dizziness. I'll also make a note in your chart about this. And remember, if you experience any sudden or severe symptoms—like chest pain, difficulty breathing, or fainting—please call 911 immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Ugh… 911. Sounds… scary. Okay, okay. Fast for 8 hours. Tell the blood taker I get dizzy. I think that’s everything. Well, Doc, I guess I’ll be seein’ you. Hopefully, them tests don't take too long. And… thanks. For explainin' it all. Even if it's a mess, a real mess.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guilds. I understand it's a lot to take in, and I'm glad I could help. I'll see you back here once the test results are available. We'll go over them together and discuss the best plan of action. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. And please, try not to worry too much. We'll take things one step at a time. Have a good day, Mr. Guilds. And try to get some rest. .
