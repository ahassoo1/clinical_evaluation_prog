DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno, good to see you… I guess. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Just… a cough. Been coughin' a bit. And… somethin' in the stuff I cough up. Red. Like… blood. Not a lot, but it’s there. I smoke, you know. Always have. Is that what it is? Just the smokin'? I gotta get this sorted, got work.
DOCTOR: Right. A cough with…hemoptysis. Lovely. And you say you’ve always smoked?
PATIENT: Hemop… what now? Always. Since I was… young. Don’t remember exactly when, but a long time. Pack a day, mostly. Sometimes more when things are… stressful. Does it matter when? Just wanna know if it’s serious. I distribute power, people need that.
DOCTOR: It matters for how long you've been exposing your lungs to carcinogens, Mr. Reyno. It's...relevant. Alright, let's not dwell. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Car… what now? Look, I ain’t a doctor. Just tell me if it's bad. Other… hmm. Sometimes feel tired. More tired than usual, I mean. And a little… short of breath. But I work hard, ya know? Been doin' that job a long time. It’s probably just that.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and shortness of breath… and a chronic cough with hemoptysis in a long-term smoker. Wonderful. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever… Not that I know of. Haven't taken my temperature. I don’t get sick much. Just this cough. It… comes and goes. Mostly when I’m… stressed. Is this somethin' I need to worry about? Really?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, let's be frank. You smoke, you’re coughing up blood, and you're experiencing shortness of breath. Yes, you need to be evaluated. I'm going to need to listen to your lungs, check your oxygen saturation, and we'll get a chest X-ray, just to be thorough. I'm not saying it's cancer – although that is a possibility – but we need to rule things out. Can you step back so I can listen to your chest?
PATIENT: X-ray? Look, is that… expensive? I got Medicare, but… Still. And… rule things out? What things? I just wanna get back to work. This power grid ain’t gonna fix itself, ya know? It’s hot out there. People need their AC.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover it. And yes, the grid is important, Mr. Reyno, I understand. But we’re talking about your lungs. Pneumonia, bronchitis… even something more serious. It’s standard procedure. Now, please, take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… hurry, okay? I got dispatches to run. It feels… tight, in here. Like somethin's blockin' it.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm hearing some wheezing, and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes, bilaterally. Not ideal. Oxygen saturation is… 92%. Borderline. I’m going to order a chest X-ray, and a sputum sample for culture. We need to see what's going on in those lungs. Nurse will be in to get that set up. Don’t push yourself too hard, Mr. Reyno.
PATIENT: Sputum… What does that even mean? And 92? Is that bad? Look, doc, can I at least get a call if somethin's really wrong? I can’t just be sittin’ around waitin’ for bad news. Gotta keep the lights on. My foreman, he's gonna be real unhappy if I’m out for long.
DOCTOR: Sputum means we need a sample of what you’re coughing up, Mr. Reyno. Yes, 92 is a little low, but it’s not an emergency… yet. And I assure you, if anything is seriously wrong, you’ll get a call. But we need those tests to know for sure. The nurse will explain the procedure for the sputum sample. She’ll give you instructions. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. Just… tell her to hurry, okay? I gotta get back to work. Thanks, I guess. .
