DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. Been happening for a while now, I guess. Hard to say how long, exactly. Time… it slips away, you know? I just figured I should get it looked at. Don't want it getting worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. “A shaking,” okay. And you said it’s mostly in your hands?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Though sometimes… sometimes it feels like it’s… everywhere, a little. Not all the time, mind you. Just… when I’m trying to do things. Like holding a cup, or… well, anything that needs a steady hand, really. It’s frustrating, more than anything. I used to be so good with my hands, fixing things around the plant… Now? Not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more noticeable when you’re using your hands, trying to do something precise. And you’ve noticed it’s been gradually getting worse. About how long would you say you've been noticing this shaking, even if it was very mild at first?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. Years, I suppose. Maybe… five years? Six? It started so slow, I didn’t really pay attention to it. Just thought I was getting older, you know? A little unsteady. But it's definitely… more now. It's hard to say for sure. Everything feels like a blur these days. I really don't keep track of time very well.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be hard to pinpoint. Five or six years… okay. Has anything specifically made it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm… Not that I’ve noticed, really. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything in particular. Stress maybe? Working at the plant was stressful, all those systems… But I retired a few years back, and it’s still happening. Coffee doesn’t seem to make it worse, and I drink a good bit of coffee. Honestly, I haven't a clue. It just is. That’s the frustrating part.
DOCTOR: Alright. No obvious triggers, even with retirement and continued coffee consumption. Let's talk about other things going on with your health. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Well, my balance isn’t what it used to be, that’s for sure. I stumble a bit more than I used to. And… sometimes, I feel a little… stiff. Mostly in my arms and legs. But I just figured that was old age creeping up on me. You know, the usual. I haven't really told anyone about it, though. It's just… small things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some balance issues and stiffness in your arms and legs. And you feel those things are related to getting older, but you haven’t specifically discussed them with a doctor before, is that right?
PATIENT: That’s right. Never really bothered a doctor with “old age.” Figured they'd just tell me to slow down. Which I’ve been trying to do, but… well, a man’s gotta stay busy, you know? It's just… this shaking is getting harder to ignore. And now the stumbling… I don't want to fall and break something.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. It’s good you’re addressing it now. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh, goodness. I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. That was… must have been thirty years ago. And I had high blood pressure for a while, but they got it under control with pills. I stopped taking those pills a long time ago, though. The doctor said it was fine. Beyond that… I can’t really recall anything serious. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. Or maybe just stubborn.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal many years ago and a history of high blood pressure that was managed with medication, but you're currently off those medications. And you haven't been diagnosed with anything else, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: That’s right, pretty much. No, nothing else comes to mind. I had a bad flu a couple of years back, but everyone gets the flu, right? Nothing that required a hospital stay or anything like that. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at remembering these things. It feels like a lifetime ago. I just want to get my hands working again.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright if you don’t remember everything perfectly. We'll take our time. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not really. I take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's about it. No regular pills, no vitamins, nothing like that. I never really believed in all that stuff. Just aspirin when I need it. And… occasionally, I’ll have a little bit of whiskey at night to help me sleep, but that’s not a medicine, is it?
DOCTOR: No, whiskey wouldn't be considered a medication, Mr. Jezik. Okay, so just occasional aspirin and a bit of whiskey at night. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat just about anything. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes if I eat something spicy, but that’s it. No rashes, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that department, too. I'm starting to feel a little foolish remembering all this. It's just… I don't have a good memory anymore, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're not foolish at all, Mr. Jezik. It’s perfectly normal to have trouble remembering things, and you're doing great. Okay, no known allergies. Let's move on to family history. Do you know if anyone in your family—parents, siblings, or other close relatives—has had similar symptoms like shaking or problems with balance?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, dear. That’s a tough one. My parents are both gone now. My mother… she had arthritis, I think. Badly in her hands. But that wasn’t shaking, it was… swelling and pain. My father… he was a strong man, never really sick. I had a sister, but we haven’t spoken in years. I don't know anything about her health. Honestly, Doctor, my family wasn’t very forthcoming about these things. It was a different time, you know? Not much talking about aches and pains. I wish I knew more, but… I just don't. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had arthritis, but no one else with similar symptoms that you are aware of. That's helpful. Now, before we do a physical exam, let's talk about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I live alone. My wife… she passed away a long time ago. A good many years. Divorced before that, a long time ago as well. No children, so… just me. Quiet life, mostly. I keep busy with a few projects around the house, try to stay active. But it gets lonely sometimes, I won't lie. It's just… easier this way, I think. Less trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright to feel lonely sometimes. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Oh, I used to smoke, years ago. Quit a long time ago, thankfully. Good for my health, you know? As for drinking… I have a little bit of whiskey most nights, just to help me sleep. Not a lot, mind you. Just enough to take the edge off. No other substances, no. Never really had much interest in those things. Always preferred a quiet night at home. It’s a habit, more than anything. A small one, I hope.
DOCTOR: Alright. You used to smoke but quit, and you have a small amount of whiskey to help you sleep. Okay, last question before we move on to a physical exam. Are you having any trouble with your memory, besides what you’ve already mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. More than I let on, I think. It's not just forgetting names or dates. Sometimes… sometimes I have trouble finding the right words. Or I'll start a thought and… it just disappears. It's frustrating. My doctor… the old one… said it was probably just old age. But it's getting worse. I worry about it, you know? More than I let on. It's just… scary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. It's good you're telling me about this. We'll definitely look into this further. Okay, with your permission, I'd like to do a physical exam now. We'll check your reflexes, balance, coordination, and look for any tremors. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try not to take too long, if you don’t mind. I have… things to do. Not important things, mind you. Just… things. Let’s get it over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll start with your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, we'll do some neurological tests to assess your reflexes, coordination, and balance. I'll also check for any visible tremors while you're resting and moving. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable or painful during the exam. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. We'll keep an eye on that. Your pulse is good, and your temperature is normal. Your heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. It’s probably benign, but we’ll note it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It’s… a little blurry sometimes. But I can see it. I used to have very good eyesight. Everything feels a little… off these days. Not just my eyes. Everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. You're able to follow my finger. Now, can you touch your nose with your index finger when I point to it?
PATIENT: Yes. I… I got it. It’s a little shaky, though. My hands aren’t what they used to be, you know? It’s frustrating. I used to be able to do this perfectly.
DOCTOR: I see a slight tremor in your hands, Mr. Jezik. It's more noticeable when you're trying to do something precise. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and extend both arms out in front of you, palms up. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m doing it. It’s… hard to hold them still. They just want to… fall. It's getting worse. You can see it, can’t you?
DOCTOR: I see a tremor in both arms, Mr. Jezik, and they are drifting slightly downwards. Now, I'd like you to walk a straight line, heel to toe, for about ten steps. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes… I’m trying. It’s… hard. I’m losing my balance.
DOCTOR: I see some difficulty with your balance and coordination, Mr. Jezik. You’re drifting slightly to the side and you’re walking slower than usual. Now, I'd like you to sit back down. Okay. That’s enough for the physical exam for now. We have a good amount of information. I've documented the tremor in your hands and arms, difficulty with balance and coordination, and a slight murmur in your heart. Given your symptoms and the findings of the physical exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of Parkinson’s disease. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes, such as essential tremor or medication side effects. To help us determine the best course of action, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function and vitamin levels. I also want to order a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s… Is that… bad? I’ve heard things. Shaking… getting worse… losing control… What does that mean? What will happen? And an MRI? Is that… painful? What kind of tests? I don't like tests. It all sounds… complicated. And what about my memory? Will this help with that? I just want to get my hands working again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. It’s natural to feel worried when you hear a diagnosis like Parkinson's disease. Let me assure you, we're not making a definitive diagnosis yet. We need to do further testing to confirm or rule it out. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. The symptoms can vary from person to person, but they often include tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement, and balance problems. However, there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. The blood tests will help us rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. And the brain MRI is a non-invasive imaging scan that will help us look for any structural abnormalities in your brain. It’s painless – you’ll simply lie inside a scanner while it takes pictures. It can be a little noisy, but it doesn't hurt. Regarding your memory, we can also discuss a cognitive evaluation to assess your memory and thinking skills. It's possible that your memory problems are related to the same underlying cause as your movement problems, but it's also possible that they are due to something else entirely. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I’ll write you a referral for the blood tests and the brain MRI. The MRI center will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: So… tests first. No definite diagnosis yet. That’s… good. A little, anyway. And the MRI isn't painful. That’s a relief. What kind of doctor… do I see for this? If it is Parkinson's… who do I see? And what about the memory… will this evaluation… will it help? I just want to know what’s happening… and what I can do about it. It’s just… scary not knowing. And I really don't want to fall. I’ve been lucky so far. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. It's perfectly natural to feel scared and uncertain when you're facing a health challenge. If it turns out to be Parkinson’s disease, you’ll need to see a neurologist – a doctor who specializes in disorders of the nervous system. I’ll write you a referral to a highly-rated neurologist in the area. They'll be able to provide expert care and develop a personalized treatment plan for you. The cognitive evaluation will help us assess your memory and thinking skills in detail. It will involve a series of questions and tasks that will help us identify any areas of concern. This will give us a better understanding of your cognitive function and guide us in determining the best course of action. In the meantime, to help prevent falls, I recommend that you avoid slippery surfaces, use assistive devices like a cane or walker if needed, and maintain a regular exercise routine to improve your balance and coordination. I'll also provide you with some resources about Parkinson's disease and cognitive impairment, so you can learn more about these conditions and connect with support groups in the area. Here are the referrals and the resources I mentioned. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. I want you to know that you're not alone in this, Mr. Jezik. We'll work together to figure out what's going on and develop a plan to help you stay healthy and active.
