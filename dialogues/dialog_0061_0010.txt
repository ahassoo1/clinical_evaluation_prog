DOCTOR: "Bula and welcome, Jahaad. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, hello Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… swelling, you said? Yes. It’s… well, it’s a bit hard to explain precisely. It’s mostly in my… I think it’s my face, but maybe my neck too? It came on rather suddenly, actually. I don’t recall doing anything to cause it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “It does make sense, Jahaad. Sudden onset is good information to have. Okay, so swelling in your face and neck… and you haven’t noticed any injury or anything that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: No, nothing I can recall. I really don’t remember… anything specific happening. It just… appeared. Perhaps a day or two ago? It’s difficult to be certain. I apologize for being so vague; my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: “No need to apologize at all, Jahaad. We'll figure it out together. A day or two ago… okay. And has the swelling been getting worse, staying the same, or perhaps even going down a little since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe it's been… gradually getting a bit worse, yes. Not drastically, but noticeable, I think. It feels… tighter, if that makes sense? And maybe a little… warm to the touch? Though, I could be imagining that last part. It’s hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: “Okay, gradually worsening swelling, feeling tighter… and you suspect some warmth. That’s helpful. Do you have any pain associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not any pain. It's more… uncomfortable. A sort of… pressure, I suppose. It doesn’t hurt to touch, or anything like that. It just feels… full. And a little strange. I find myself constantly touching it, which I’m sure isn’t helping, but… it’s just there, you know?
DOCTOR: “I understand completely, Jahaad. It's good to know there's no pain, that rules some things out. Let's do a quick exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: “Thank you, Jahaad. I appreciate your trust. I'm going to gently palpate your face and neck, and then I’ll listen to your neck as well, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Okay… I’m noticing some definite swelling on both sides of your face, particularly around your cheeks and jawline. The swelling extends into your neck as well, and it feels… a bit firm to the touch. No obvious redness or warmth externally. Listening to your neck, I don’t hear any unusual sounds, which is good. Do you notice any difficulty breathing or swallowing?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. Breathing is… normal, as far as I can tell. And swallowing hasn’t been difficult either. I haven’t had to… force anything down, if that makes sense. It’s just… a little awkward, perhaps? A slight feeling of fullness, but nothing alarming. I'm glad to hear there are no unusual sounds, though. That is… reassuring.
DOCTOR: “Good. That’s very good to know, Jahaad. Okay, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Um… allergies. Let me think. I… believe I have a slight sensitivity to certain pollen, but nothing severe. Just a bit of sneezing in the spring. And… I think I had a reaction to a penicillin antibiotic when I was a child, but it was a long time ago. Nothing major, just a rash. Other than that… no, I don’t recall any significant allergies. I apologize if that’s a vague answer; my memory… isn’t always reliable.
DOCTOR: “No apology necessary, Jahaad. That's very helpful to know. Pollen sensitivity and a rash with penicillin… we'll make a note of that. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I generally try to avoid taking anything if I can. I prefer… natural remedies, if possible. I occasionally take vitamin D during the winter months, as I don’t get much sunlight, but that’s it. Nothing regularly, or at a high dosage. I don't believe I've taken anything in the last few days, either.
DOCTOR: “Okay, no medications currently. That simplifies things. Have you had any previous medical conditions or surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils removed when I was quite young, I believe. And… I had a minor injury to my wrist a few years ago, but it healed without any complications. Other than that… no, I haven't had any serious illnesses or surgeries. I've generally been quite healthy, thankfully. Although… I do sometimes feel… fatigued, but I always assumed it was just stress. I sincerely apologize if I’m being unhelpful; I wish my memory was better. It’s quite frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: “You're not being unhelpful at all, Jahaad, and I understand your frustration. Tonsillectomy and a minor wrist injury… noted. And the occasional fatigue... we can explore that further if needed. Now, a little about your family. Is there any history of allergies, autoimmune diseases, or swelling conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had quite severe hay fever, I recall. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, I believe. As for swelling conditions… I don’t recall anything specific. My family isn’t particularly forthcoming with medical history, if I’m honest. They tend to… avoid discussing such matters. I apologize for the lack of information. It's not that they're being secretive, necessarily, just… private, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “That’s perfectly understandable, Jahaad. Hay fever in your mother and rheumatoid arthritis in your grandmother… that’s helpful to know. Finally, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don’t smoke, and I very rarely drink alcohol—perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I lead a relatively… quiet life, to be honest. I spend most of my time working, or relaxing at home. I prioritize my health, and I try to maintain a balanced lifestyle.
DOCTOR: “That’s excellent, Jahaad. Thank you for being so open and honest. Okay, based on what you’ve told me, and the examination, I’m thinking this could be a few things. Given the sudden onset and the lack of pain, a viral infection is possible, although the firmness of the swelling is a little unusual for that. Another possibility is an allergic reaction, even without a known allergen, but the absence of itching makes that less likely. Less commonly, it could be a salivary gland issue, or even something a bit more unusual. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a blood test. It will help us rule out infection, and assess your general inflammatory markers. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A blood test. Yes, I agree. It’s best to rule things out, as you say. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I do hope it’s nothing too serious. I have a meeting next week, and I wouldn’t want this to interfere.
DOCTOR: “I understand your concern, Jahaad, and we'll work quickly to get you answers. I’ll write the order for the blood test now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be able to take care of you. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you notice any difficulty breathing, swallowing, or if the swelling worsens significantly, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Difficulty breathing or swallowing… I will certainly remember that. Thank you for your time and your attention. I appreciate your thoroughness. I suppose I’ll go to the lab now?
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Jahaad. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. Yes, please head to the lab. They’ll take good care of you. I’ll have the results sent to me, and I’ll be in touch as soon as I have them. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.”
