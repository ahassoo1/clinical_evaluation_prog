DOCTOR: Well, hello there, Maribeth. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s this breathing. It gets…difficult when I try to lie down flat. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I believe. Not every night, but often enough to bother me. I’d like to get it sorted, if you please.
DOCTOR: Hmm, breathing difficulty…specifically when lying flat. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Perhaps…six or seven? It’s hard to say exactly, you understand. I don’t keep a calendar for such things. It wakes me up sometimes. I have to sit up to get my breath. It’s…uncomfortable. And a bit frightening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Wakes you up, makes you sit up. Okay. And is this…shortness of breath, or does it feel more like you’re…struggling to get a full breath?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. It’s not exactly short of breath, Doctor. More like…a tightness. A pressure, really, in my chest. It feels as though something is…holding me back from taking a proper, full breath. It’s not painful, but…restrictive, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Restrictive, tightness…okay. And does anything seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Well, lying flat, certainly. I’ve noticed…eating a large meal before bed doesn't help. It seems to…exacerbate it, if that’s the correct word. I try to eat earlier in the evening now, but it doesn’t always prevent it. Being upset…that can make it worse, too. Although, at my age, something always upsets me.
DOCTOR: Eating a large meal, lying flat, and…stress. Right. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, have you had any coughing?
PATIENT: Coughing? Not really. A little bit of a tickle in my throat sometimes, especially in the mornings. But no proper coughing. No…wheezing, either. It’s mostly just this…tightness in my chest. And the difficulty breathing when I lie down. It isn't a cold, Doctor. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Right, no cough, no wheeze. Good. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, not that I’ve noticed. I wear slippers mostly, so I wouldn't necessarily see it, I suppose. But no, I haven't had any discomfort or noticed my shoes being tighter. My feet are…well, they’re old feet, but not swollen. I check them for corns, if that’s any consolation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Any history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Heart problems… Hmm. My father, he had high blood pressure, I believe. And my Aunt Millie… she had something with her heart, but it was a long time ago. I don't recall the specifics, unfortunately. It wasn't a sudden thing, if that helps. He lived to be eighty-two, so it didn’t bother him too much, I suppose. We didn’t talk about such things much in those days.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in your father, something with your aunt… Okay. And have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had a bout of pneumonia when I was quite young. And arthritis, of course. Old age, you know. But nothing major. No heart conditions, no diabetes, no…anything serious, as far as I'm aware. The doctor checks my blood pressure every year, and it’s always…adequate, he says. I do take a little something for my blood pressure, now that I think of it. A small pill.
DOCTOR: A pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, a small white pill. I take it every morning. Doctor Ramirez prescribed it, perhaps… five years ago? It helps, I believe. Though, as I said, it doesn’t seem to be preventing this trouble breathing when I lie down. It’s a very small dose, I assure you. I try to be a good patient, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what other medications are you taking?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… just the pill for my blood pressure. And I take a multivitamin every day. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take something for that. Ibuprofen, I believe it's called. A small dose, only when I need it. I'm not one for taking a lot of pills, Doctor. I prefer to…get on with things, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen to your lungs and heart, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I always try to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me... and again... Okay. Your lungs sound…relatively clear. A few scattered wheezes, but nothing significant. Your heart… a slightly irregular rhythm, but it’s not alarming. I'm going to check your ankles for swelling now. No significant edema. Now, I’m going to have you sit up a bit more and I'll listen to your back again.
PATIENT: Alright. I'm sitting up now. I do feel a bit… exposed, you understand. It’s just… I don’t like feeling poked and prodded, even if it’s for my own good. Are you finding anything concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, nothing concerning. It sounds like… mild asthma. Possibly exacerbated by your age, and the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure. It could also be heart-related, but it doesn't sound like heart failure. I’m going to order a chest X-ray, just to be sure. And a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any infection. And I want you to follow up with a cardiologist. They can do an echocardiogram and see how your heart is functioning.
PATIENT: An X-ray and blood tests? And a… cardiologist? That sounds…rather serious, Doctor. Is it something to be worried about? I’m not a fan of hospitals, you understand. And I certainly don't want to be taking a lot of new medications. I just wanted to get to the bottom of this breathing, not… embark on a whole series of tests.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Maribeth. We need to rule things out. It's likely just a mild exacerbation of asthma, as I said. But at your age, we have to be thorough. The X-ray is quick, and the blood test is minimal. The cardiologist… they'll just do a scan of your heart. It's better to be safe than sorry. I’ll write you a prescription for an inhaler to help with your breathing in the meantime. Use it as needed. And I want to see you back here in a week to discuss the results. Don't worry too much. It's probably nothing serious. But we need to be certain.
PATIENT: An inhaler… and all those tests. Very well, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose I don’t have much choice. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… make the arrangements. I do hope it isn’t too disruptive. I believe that’s all, then. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. You'll get a call from the radiology department to schedule the X-ray, and I'll have my nurse send over the cardiologist referral. Don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms. .
