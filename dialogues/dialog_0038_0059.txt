DOCTOR: Alright, good morning, Adyn. I'm Dr. Auelua. Glad to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it's… difficult to explain precisely. It’s about my speech, you see. It hasn't been quite right lately. A bit… slurred, I suppose. It's been happening for a little while now, but I thought it would just… pass.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A little slurred speech that's been going on for a while. That's good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, that’s… a bit tricky. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It feels like… several weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month or so? It wasn't sudden, more of a gradual thing. I don’t really recall exactly when it started, though. It's frustrating, I know. My husband usually notices these things before I do.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, it’s perfectly alright. Memory can be tricky. Several weeks, gradual onset… that’s helpful. And it’s good you have your husband to help keep track of things. Has it been constant since you noticed it, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… varies, I think. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and others… well, others it’s much more pronounced. Like this morning, for instance. It feels… worse when I’m tired, perhaps? Or stressed. But even when I'm feeling alright, it seems to pop up sometimes. It’s not predictable, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's variable, worse with fatigue or stress, but not consistently linked to either. That gives us a bit to work with. And when you say “slurred,” can you describe what that feels like to you?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It doesn't feel like I'm struggling to find the words, it’s more… the way they come out. Like my tongue feels a bit heavy, perhaps? Or slow. It's as if I’m not quite coordinating everything properly. It doesn’t hurt, and I don’t stumble over words necessarily, just… the sound isn’t as clear as it used to be, I suppose. It’s embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, and it's perfectly alright to feel embarrassed. It takes courage to come in and talk about things like this. “Heavy tongue,” trouble coordinating… that's very helpful. Has anyone else noticed this speech change, besides your husband?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I work on construction sites, mostly managing things, not a lot of close conversation. People shout instructions, you know? So, I don't think so. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. My husband definitely has, and he's the one who encouraged me to come see you. I mostly see family on weekends and we usually don't talk long enough for it to be noticed, I think. It’s difficult to say for certain, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily noticed by your husband. And you mentioned working on construction sites. Has there been any recent head trauma, even a minor bump or knock?
PATIENT: A bump… hmm. Well, construction sites aren't exactly known for being gentle, you see. There’s been the odd knock here and there, a toolbox falling, things like that. Nothing major, I don’t think. I mean, I haven’t been knocked unconscious or anything. Just… the usual bumps and scrapes. It’s hard to say if any of them are related. They happen so frequently, you know? It’s easy to dismiss them.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Frequent minor bumps… we’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No weakness at all. Everything feels… normal in that regard. My arms and legs are fine, and I haven't noticed any trouble with my face or anything like that. I can walk and move everything as usual. I was a bit worried about that, to be honest, but thankfully, that doesn't seem to be an issue.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, like double vision or blurry vision?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… perhaps a little bit of blurriness, on and off? But I wear glasses, you see. I just assumed it was my prescription needing adjustment. It’s nothing drastic, and I haven’t thought much of it. I’m overdue for an eye exam, actually. So, I couldn't really say if it's new or just my regular blurry vision.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possible blurry vision that you attribute to needing a new glasses prescription. We can note that. Now, have you experienced any difficulty swallowing, or a change in your taste?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing… no, not really. Everything goes down as usual. Taste, either. I haven't noticed any changes there. I still enjoy my food, thankfully. My husband makes a lovely jerk chicken, and I wouldn't want to lose my appreciation for that!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the jerk chicken! Alright, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, I have Medicare, so I must have something… but I don't have anything formally diagnosed, to my knowledge. The doctor who signed me up for Medicare said my blood pressure was a little high once, but he didn't say it was anything serious. I haven't been to a doctor regularly since then, to be honest. Mostly, I just try to stay active and eat well. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possible slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, but no formal diagnosis. And you haven't been regularly following up with a doctor. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No, not that I recall. I haven't had any major illnesses or anything requiring surgery. A few stitches here and there from construction site mishaps, but nothing serious. Mostly just bumps and bruises, as I said. I try to be careful, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit tricky. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I didn't really talk to her about medical things. She died suddenly, a heart attack, I think. My father… he’s still alive, but we aren’t very close. I don’t know much about his medical history, to be honest. He always kept things to himself. I don’t think there was much in the way of serious illness on either side, but I couldn't say for certain. It’s not something we ever discussed.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother passed away from a heart attack, limited knowledge of father’s medical history. And finally, what about any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat whatever I want, thankfully! And I haven’t had to take any medications regularly, so I haven’t had any issues there either. I’m a pretty straightforward case, I think. Mostly just healthy living and a bit of forgetfulness, as we've established!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Okay, Adyn, thank you for providing all of that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to check your cranial nerves. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Okay, good. Now, I’m going to ask you to smile and frown for me. And can you stick your tongue out?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? Is that alright? It feels a bit silly, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Everything looks good so far. Now, I'm going to check your strength and reflexes. Please place your arms out in front of you, palms up. And I'm going to tap your reflexes with this little hammer. This might feel a little strange. Your strength is good, and your reflexes are normal. Finally, I'll briefly assess your coordination. Could you touch your nose with your finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It feels a bit… awkward, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Your coordination seems good as well. Alright, Adyn. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on the physical exam, everything appears normal. However, the slurred speech is concerning, and we need to investigate further. It could be a number of things, ranging from something relatively minor to something more serious. Given your history of possible minor head trauma and the variable nature of the symptoms, I’d like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… That sounds… rather serious, doesn’t it? Is it painful? And is it very expensive? I mean, I have Medicare, but I’m always a bit worried about costs. What exactly are we looking for, Doctor? And what if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Adyn. An MRI is a very detailed imaging scan, and it’s non-invasive, meaning it doesn’t involve any cutting or injections. It’s also painless. You’ll lie inside a large machine, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create pictures of your brain. You might feel a little warm, and it can be a bit noisy, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Regarding costs, Medicare should cover a significant portion of the expense. There may be a co-pay or deductible, but our billing department can help you understand those details and explore any financial assistance options if needed. As for what we’re looking for, we want to rule out things like a small stroke, a tumor, or any other structural abnormalities that could be affecting your speech. It's important to remember that these are just possibilities, and it's more likely to be something less serious. However, it's always best to be thorough, especially with neurological symptoms. If something is wrong, we will discuss all of your options and create a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. You won’t be alone in this, and we will support you every step of the way. Would you like me to go over the process in more detail?
PATIENT: That… that does sound a little less frightening when you explain it that way, Doctor. The noise and magnets don’t bother me too much, I suppose. And knowing that Medicare will cover most of it is a relief. Yes, please, could you go over the process in more detail? What will I need to do to prepare? And how long does it usually take? I'm a bit claustrophobic, I must admit. Is the machine very enclosed?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about an MRI, especially if you're claustrophobic. Let’s address that first. The MRI machine is a long, narrow tube, but it’s not completely enclosed. There’s a wide opening at both ends, and you’ll be able to see out. We can also offer you headphones to listen to music, and we can even provide a mild sedative if needed to help you relax. Before the MRI, you’ll need to remove any metal objects, like jewelry, watches, and piercings. We’ll also ask you some questions about your medical history to make sure it’s safe for you to undergo the scan. The scan itself usually takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on what areas of your brain we’re imaging. During the scan, you’ll need to lie very still, and it’s important to let the technician know if you’re feeling uncomfortable at any point. I will write a referral for you to get the MRI at [Name of local imaging center]. They are very experienced and have a good reputation for making patients feel comfortable. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are in, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that does sound alright, Doctor. Knowing about the music and the sedative is helpful. And it’s good to know the machine isn’t completely enclosed. I think I can manage it, as long as I can listen to some music. [Name of local imaging center], you said? I'll need to write down that name. And will you have the results sent directly to you? Or will I need to bring them myself? I worry about misplacing things, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, [Name of local imaging center]. I'll write the referral with all their contact information, so you don’t have to worry about misplacing the name. And don't worry about the results at all. They will send the images and report directly to my office electronically. I'll have them available when we meet for your follow-up appointment. You don't need to do anything with them yourself. To summarize, I'm writing a referral for an MRI at [Name of local imaging center]. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. The scan should take about 30-60 minutes, and you can listen to music during the scan. The results will be sent directly to my office, and we'll review them together at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Adyn?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough and patient with all my questions, and I appreciate that. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for ordering the MRI. Hopefully, it's nothing serious, but it's good to get it checked out, regardless. I suppose I'll just wait for the imaging center to contact me then. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with you once I know when the scan is scheduled. Thank you again, Doctor Auelua.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We're here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
