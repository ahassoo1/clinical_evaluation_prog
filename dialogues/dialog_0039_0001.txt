DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Knoch. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Kamahele. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it plainly, I’ve been smoking for… a very long time. And I think it’s finally time I tried to do something about it. It’s not been easy, you understand. Sixty years is a long habit to break.
DOCTOR: Sixty years... that is a long time. It takes a lot of courage to even consider making a change after that long, so you've already taken a big first step. It’s absolutely understandable that it hasn’t been easy. We can definitely work on this together. To start, can you tell me a little more about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Where shall I begin? I started when I was fourteen, back in Lithuania, actually. It was… common, you see. Everyone smoked. Mostly unfiltered cigarettes, those days. Gauloises, if I recall correctly. I continued when I came to this country, naturally. Through thick and thin. Perhaps a pack a day, on average, for most of those years. Lately, it’s been… less. Maybe fifteen a day, but I find myself craving them more frequently. I’ve tried to cut back a few times, on my own, but… well, it’s difficult. I have tried patches, I believe they were. Years ago. They did not work for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting at fourteen, Gauloises primarily, roughly a pack a day for many years, now down to about fifteen a day with increased cravings… and you’ve tried nicotine patches in the past without success. That’s very helpful to know. Do you still smoke Gauloises, or have you switched brands over the years?
PATIENT: Ah, good question, Doctor. No, I do not smoke Gauloises anymore. They became… difficult to find, you see. After a time, I switched to Marlboro. Then, when those became too expensive, I’ve been smoking… what are they called… American Spirits. They are… brown. And a bit more… flavorful, perhaps. Though I suspect that’s just the nicotine talking. It’s a rather unrefined habit, when I think about it.
DOCTOR: No shame in it at all, Mr. Knoch. It sounds like you’ve adapted over time as things changed. American Spirits now... okay. And you said the cravings have been increasing recently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, they have. It’s… unsettling, to be frank. I find myself thinking about them constantly, even when I’m busy. It’s especially bad in the evenings, after dinner. Or when I’m… bored, perhaps. I used to enjoy a cigarette with my coffee, you see. A small pleasure. But now, it feels less like a pleasure and more like… a need. It’s… bothersome. I worry about my health, naturally, although I am… seventy-four years old. Perhaps it is too late for much good to come of it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the habit has become very ingrained, and those evening cravings are particularly strong. It’s very common for cravings to intensify when you try to cut back, and it’s completely normal to feel like it’s a need rather than a pleasure at this point. And you are absolutely right to be thinking about your health, even at seventy-four. It’s never too late to improve it. It's admirable that you're taking this step now. Just to get a fuller picture, have you had any other health problems recently?
PATIENT: That is… reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. As for health problems… well, I have some arthritis in my knees, which makes walking difficult. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, naturally. I also had a touch of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up. Nothing… serious, you understand. I’ve never been a man to trouble the doctors much, if I can avoid it. I also have some… shortness of breath sometimes. Not all the time, but… when I exert myself. Perhaps that’s just the age, as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your knees, some vision changes, bronchitis last winter, and some shortness of breath with exertion. That’s helpful. The shortness of breath is something we should definitely look into a bit more, given your smoking history. It could be related to age, but we need to rule out anything else. Before we talk about options for quitting, I'd like to ask a few more questions and do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Specifically, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your heart rate and blood pressure. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need for a proper examination. Please, proceed. I have no objections at all. I suppose it is best to know exactly what one is dealing with, even if the news is not… pleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch. I’m going to listen to your lungs, both front and back. It will involve me pressing the stethoscope against your skin, so please let me know if it feels uncomfortable at any point. Then I'll check your pulse and blood pressure. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… I'm hearing some mild wheezing, particularly on the left side. It's not alarming, but it does suggest some narrowing of the airways. Your heart rate is a bit elevated at 88, but that could be due to anxiety or simply from talking. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a bit high. Okay, that gives us a little bit more information. The wheezing and slightly elevated blood pressure are things we need to keep an eye on. Given your smoking history, I'd like to order a chest X-ray just to get a better look at your lungs and rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. An X-ray seems… prudent. I have no objections at all. I would prefer to know exactly what is going on, as you say. I trust your judgment. So, what are my options for quitting, then? Patches clearly did not work. Are there other… medications? Or perhaps some sort of therapy? I am willing to try, you understand. I just… I am rather wary of strong medication, if I can avoid it. I have always been a… simple man.
DOCTOR: Alright, we will get that X-ray scheduled right away. And I understand your hesitation about medication, Mr. Knoch. We definitely don’t have to jump straight to that. There are several options we can explore. Since patches didn’t work, we can look at other forms of nicotine replacement therapy, like gum or lozenges. Those can sometimes be more effective for people who find patches don't suit them. There are also non-nicotine medications, like bupropion and varenicline, that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. However, as you mentioned, those do come with potential side effects, so we would discuss those thoroughly before considering them. Another very effective approach is behavioral therapy or counseling. A therapist can help you develop coping mechanisms and strategies to manage cravings and address the psychological aspects of addiction. We have a smoking cessation program here at the clinic, and I can provide you with more information about that. Finally, there are support groups where you can connect with other people who are going through the same thing. What sounds most appealing to you at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm. The medication… I think I would prefer to avoid that, if possible. The side effects worry me. Support groups… perhaps. I am not one for… sharing personal matters with strangers, if you understand. Behavioral therapy, though… that sounds… promising. A therapist, you say? Someone who can offer guidance and… strategies? That does appeal to me. Perhaps we should start with that. If it does not work, we can consider other options, yes?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable approach, Mr. Knoch. Behavioral therapy is a great first step, and it’s something we can definitely try. We have a very good therapist here at the clinic, Ms. Evans, who specializes in addiction. I can schedule an appointment for you with her next week, if you’d like. She'll work with you to develop a personalized plan, identify your triggers, and teach you coping skills. While we are waiting for that appointment, I will give you some information on local resources, including a helpline you can call if you experience strong cravings. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… excellent. Ms. Evans, you say? Very good. An appointment next week would be… most welcome. And the information on local resources is appreciated. It is… reassuring to know there is support available. Thank you, Doctor Kamahele. I believe we have made a good start, yes? Perhaps… perhaps this time, I can finally manage it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knoch. And yes, I absolutely agree – we have made a very good start. It takes courage to even consider making this change, and you've already taken the hardest step. I’m confident that with Ms. Evans’ help, and your commitment, you can achieve your goal. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that appointment for you now, and also provide you with those resources. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been most helpful. And… surprisingly reassuring. Thank you again. I shall see you again, then, after my appointment with Ms. Evans. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Mr. Knoch. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up before your appointment. I look forward to hearing how it goes. Have a good day, and please, take care. .
