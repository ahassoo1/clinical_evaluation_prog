DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. Well, to be honest, a friend suggested I come talk about… something to help prevent things, you know? With… with HIV. She called it PrEP, I think. I just want to learn about it, see if it's right for me. I'm a bit older, so… I wasn’t sure if it was even something for someone my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, Helaina, that’s a very good question, and a responsible one to ask. PrEP – Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis – is definitely something we can discuss for people of all ages, it’s not just for younger individuals. It's great you're thinking proactively about your health. To get a better understanding of whether PrEP would be appropriate for you, I’m going to ask a few questions, if that’s alright. First, can you tell me a little bit about your sexual history?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, good. That's reassuring. Yes, please, ask away. Um… well, I’ve been single for… a long time now, honestly. But I do have… occasional partners. Not regular, you understand. And I’m careful, always have been. But… you know, things change. I suppose I haven’t been as careful lately as I used to be. And a friend… she just mentioned this PrEP thing, and it got me thinking. I don't want to take chances.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. When you say "occasional partners," roughly how many partners have you had in the past six months?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Six months… It’s not a huge number, maybe… three? Four, at most? It really varies. It’s not like a regular thing, honestly. And I always use… protection, usually. Though, I did have one instance a few months back where things happened a little quickly and… well, we didn’t. That’s what really got me thinking about this, to be honest. I just… don’t want to worry about it, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being so open, Helaina. That’s very important. So, just to clarify, you’ve had three or four partners in the last six months, with one instance of unprotected sex. Have you experienced any symptoms that might suggest a sexually transmitted infection – anything like sores, unusual discharge, or fever?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms at all. Not a thing. I always feel fine afterward, to be honest. That’s why I wasn't too worried, but my friend, she was very insistent. She said it's better to be safe than sorry, and, well… she's a nurse. I tend to listen to her! So, what does this all mean? Is this PrEP thing something I should even be thinking about?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear you haven’t experienced any symptoms. Based on what you’ve told me – occasional partners and a recent instance of unprotected sex – PrEP is certainly something we should consider for you. To be absolutely sure it’s safe and appropriate, I’d like to run a few standard tests. We’ll need to check your kidney function, liver function, and screen for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. It’s a routine process. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I mean, if it's going to make sure everything is okay, then absolutely. I just want to be on the safe side. What does that involve, exactly? Bloodwork, I suppose? And how long does it take to get the results? I have a little bit of a schedule, so… I'd like to know what I'm getting into.
DOCTOR: Yes, it will involve a blood draw. It’s a standard panel, so not too much. We’ll also need a urine sample. The lab usually takes about a week to get the results back, sometimes a little longer. We can schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are in to discuss them and, if everything looks good, talk about starting PrEP if you’re comfortable with that. While we wait for the results, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Not to any medications, anyway. Just dust, a little. Oh, and cats. But that’s not really relevant, is it? No, no medication allergies at all. This all sounds very… organized. I appreciate that. It makes me feel better, honestly. Is there anything I need to do before the bloodwork? Fasting? Anything like that?
DOCTOR: No, no fasting is required for these tests. Just drink plenty of water beforehand. Now, I'd like to briefly ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, all my life. A little arthritis in my hands, but that's about it. My doctor always says I have a strong heart. You know, it's funny. I've always taken good care of myself, but this… this feels different. Like I need to be extra careful now. Things change as you get older, I guess.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, things do change, and being proactive about your health is the smartest thing you can do. And it's great you've been generally healthy. One final thing before we proceed: are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis, if it’s acting up. That’s it. Honestly, I try to avoid medication as much as possible. I prefer a cup of tea and a good rest if I can manage it. I'm not one for taking pills unless I absolutely have to. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: No, that won't be a problem at all. Multivitamins and occasional ibuprofen are unlikely to interfere with PrEP. Okay, Helaina, that’s everything I need for now. I’m going to have my nurse come in and draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide if PrEP is right for you. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect. I’m ready when she is. I just want to get this done and know one way or another. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with all my questions. I appreciate that. It’s… reassuring to talk to someone who doesn't make me feel silly for asking them. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. It’s my job, and I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Please don’t hesitate to ask if anything else comes to mind. I'll let the nurse know you're ready. .
