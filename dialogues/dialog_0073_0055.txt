DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s been reading about it, and she thinks it might help with… well, the aches. I’m not one for all these newfangled things, but she’s quite insistent. I suppose I’m here to see if I can get a certificate, if it’s even proper for someone my age.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana, yes. It’s… becoming more common. And your daughter is encouraging this, you say?
PATIENT: Encouraging is putting it mildly, Doctor. She practically dragged me here. She says it’s a natural remedy, better than all those pills the other doctors keep prescribing. Honestly, I've tried a few, and they mostly just make me feel… foggy. But I do get these pains, particularly in my joints. It's just… I'm not sure I understand how this marijuana is supposed to help. Is it like… the stuff people used to smoke? Because I assure you, Doctor, I have never partaken in such things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it is derived from the same plant, but the method of delivery and the compounds are quite different. It's not quite the same as… recreational use. We're talking about specific formulations, often with very low THC levels—that's the psychoactive component—and higher CBD, which is thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. But let's back up. You mentioned joint pain. Where exactly are you experiencing this pain, and how long has it been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s mostly in my knees, Doctor. And my lower back. Been going on… oh, years now. I suppose it started gradually, just a little stiffness after gardening. But lately, it’s been… sharper. Especially in the mornings. Getting up is a chore, let me tell you. And it doesn’t really go away, it just… lessens. I try to keep busy, you know? I don't like sitting around. But even a short walk can leave me aching. I've tried those over-the-counter creams, but they barely make a dent. I really don’t want to end up needing one of those… replacements. My sister had one, and it looked so… artificial.
DOCTOR: So, chronic joint pain, primarily in the knees and lower back, worsening with activity. And you've tried over-the-counter creams with limited relief. You mentioned gardening – how often do you garden, and how strenuous would you describe it?
PATIENT: Well, I try to get out there most days, Doctor. It's a small garden, mostly herbs and tomatoes. But bending and kneeling… that's the hard part. It's not heavy lifting, mind you. Just a lot of… getting up and down, weeding, pruning. It's a good, honest hobby, but it’s definitely aggravating my joints. I used to be able to do it for hours, but now… a half-hour is about my limit. And then I pay for it the rest of the day. I really hate slowing down, though. It feels like… losing a part of myself, you know? It's silly, I suppose. But it's important to me.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all. Maintaining your independence and hobbies is important. Now, have you seen any other doctors for this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Dr. Abernathy, he’s retired now. He gave me some pills – ibuprofen, naproxen, things like that. They helped for a while, but they upset my stomach, and my daughter said they weren’t good for my kidneys. Then I saw Dr. Reyes, she sent me for physical therapy. That was… tiring. All those stretches and exercises. It helped a little, but it was hard to keep up with. And frankly, Doctor, it didn’t last. That’s why I'm here, to be perfectly honest. I’m tired of trying things that just… don't work. I don’t want to rely on pills, and I don’t want to end up needing surgery. This marijuana… well, it’s just another option, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. So, a history of NSAIDs with gastrointestinal side effects, and physical therapy with limited long-term benefit. And your daughter is pushing for medical marijuana. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Can you stand for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though, please forgive me if I’m a bit unsteady. These knees aren't what they used to be. I hope you don't expect me to do any jumping jacks.
DOCTOR: No, jumping jacks are not required. Just want to assess your range of motion and stability. Alright. Knees… some crepitus on flexion and extension. Tenderness to palpation on the medial joint line bilaterally. Back… limited range of motion, mild discomfort with forward bending. Gait is slightly antalgic, favoring the left side. Alright. We'll need to review your medical history in a bit more detail. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Penicillin, Doctor. I had a rather unpleasant reaction to it as a child. And… well, I seem to get a bit of a rash with sulfa drugs. Nothing life-threatening, but it's best to avoid them, if possible. Otherwise, I don’t believe I have any… serious allergies. Just the usual hay fever in the spring. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not a complicated case. Just an old woman with achy joints. Though, I do try to stay healthy. I eat my vegetables and I walk as much as I can, despite everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Penicillin and sulfa allergies noted. And you're currently taking no medications, correct?
PATIENT: Well… not currently. I used to take something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. But Dr. Abernathy took me off of it a few years ago, said my numbers were looking good. And then there was that arthritis cream he prescribed, but I stopped using it because it didn’t do much. So, no, Doctor. Nothing regularly, if that's what you mean. Just the occasional pain reliever if things get really bad. Which, lately, has been happening more and more often. Honestly, I'm just hoping there's something – anything – that can help me get back to my garden. It’s foolish, I know, but it means a lot to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no current medications, past use of NSAIDs and arthritis cream with limited benefit, and a history of hypertension that is currently well-controlled. Given your history, and your daughter's… enthusiasm for medical marijuana, I suppose we could consider a trial. However, I need to be clear. The evidence supporting its use for osteoarthritis is limited, and there are potential risks and side effects to be aware of. We'll need to monitor your response closely. Are you prepared for that?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I wasn't expecting a miracle, mind you. And I certainly don't want to be a bother. I understand there are risks with anything, and I'm willing to be monitored, if that's what's necessary. My daughter… she's done a lot of research, and she assures me it's quite safe, if taken properly. I trust her judgement, mostly. Honestly, at this point, I’m willing to try something. Anything is better than sitting around feeling sorry for myself. But I do have a question, if you don't mind. What exactly would this “trial” entail? And what are these “potential risks” you mentioned? I'd like to be fully informed, before I agree to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. A trial would involve starting with a low dose of a CBD-dominant formulation, likely a tincture or oil, taken sublingually. We'd start with a very small amount, and gradually increase the dosage over several weeks, monitoring your pain levels, sleep, and any potential side effects. As for risks… common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, and changes in appetite. Less common, but more serious, risks include interactions with other medications, and potential effects on liver function. Because of your history of hypertension, we'll need to monitor your blood pressure closely. And it’s important to remember that medical marijuana is not a cure. It may provide some symptomatic relief, but it’s not a long-term solution. Do you understand all of that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I believe I do. Low dose, CBD-dominant, taken under the tongue. Monitor pain, sleep, and side effects. Watch my blood pressure, and… it’s not a cure. Just relief. It sounds… manageable. Although, the liver function part does worry me a bit. My sister, she had some trouble with her liver later in life. But… if it’s a small dose, and we monitor it closely, perhaps it won’t be a problem. Honestly, Doctor, my daughter has been reading about all these different strains, and she thinks a particular one might be good for inflammation. But… I suppose I should leave the specifics to you, shouldn't I? You’re the doctor, after all. If you think it’s worth a try, then I’m willing to give it a go. But I do want to emphasize… I'm not looking for a high, or anything like that. Just a little bit of relief, so I can get back to my garden.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll start with a low dose of a full-spectrum CBD oil, with a low THC content. I'll write you a prescription, and I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to assess your response. During that time, please keep a detailed log of your pain levels, sleep quality, and any side effects you experience. And if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as dizziness, nausea, or changes in mental status, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, yes, actually. My daughter mentioned something about different ways to take it. Oils, tinctures… even edibles. Which one is best, in your opinion? And… is there anything I should avoid doing while taking it? Like, is it safe to drive? I do have a doctor's appointment next week, and I usually drive myself. I don't want to get into any trouble. And… is it alright to take it with my vitamins? I take a multivitamin every morning. Honestly, Doctor, I'm just trying to be thorough. I don’t want to cause any problems. It’s just… a lot to take in, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's address your questions one at a time. As for delivery methods, oils and tinctures are generally preferred for their faster onset and more precise dosing. Edibles have a much slower onset and can be difficult to control. We'll start with a tincture. As for driving, it is not recommended while taking medical marijuana, even if you don't feel impaired. The effects can vary significantly, and it's best to err on the side of caution. And regarding your vitamins, there are no known interactions with a standard multivitamin, but it’s always best to inform your other physicians about any new medications you're taking. I’m writing all of this down for you. Do you feel comfortable with this plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I think so. Oils, no driving, inform my other doctors… It sounds… sensible. And I appreciate you writing it down. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. It’s just… I’m a bit apprehensive, to be honest. It’s not like I’ve ever done anything like this before. But… if you think it might help, and you’re monitoring me closely, I’m willing to give it a try. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. And… I’ll be sure to keep a detailed log, as you requested. Hopefully, it will all go smoothly. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I have a daughter waiting. And she'll be wanting to know what you said.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. And remember, if you experience any concerning symptoms, contact my office immediately. Have a good day.
