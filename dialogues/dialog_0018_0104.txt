DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. StHilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time. My throat… it hurts. Been hurting for a few days now. Just… sore. Is that all you need to know? I work long hours, you see. Very important work.
DOCTOR: I understand you're pressed for time, Ms. Ottaviani, and I appreciate you coming in despite that. “Sore throat” can mean a lot of different things, though, and I want to be sure we get to the bottom of it efficiently. To help me understand, could you tell me a little more about the soreness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More details? Look, it just hurts when I swallow. That’s it. Like… sandpaper, maybe? I don’t know. I don’t usually get sick. I’m a very strong woman. It's probably nothing. Are you going to give me something for it, or what?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you letting me know you generally stay healthy, Ms. Ottaviani. It is helpful to know that. Sandpaper is a good way to describe it – that tells me it’s quite an irritating pain. And yes, my goal is to figure out what’s causing the soreness and get you feeling better. To help me determine the best course of action, could you tell me if you've had any other symptoms alongside the sore throat?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What are symptoms? Look, I just told you, my throat hurts. Is that not a symptom? I haven't... I don't feel anything else particularly wrong. Maybe a little tired, but I always feel a little tired. It’s the work, you understand. Long hours, very precise work.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Ms. Ottaviani. A sore throat is a symptom. My apologies for phrasing that poorly. I just want to be thorough. When I ask about other symptoms, I'm trying to see if there's anything else happening that might help me understand the cause of the sore throat. Let's try this: Have you noticed a fever, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I don’t feel hot. Chills… well, it gets cold in the factory sometimes. And aches... I ache all over after a long day at work, but that’s just… work. Honestly, Doctor, are you a doctor or an interrogator? I need to get back to my shift.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm coming across as overly detailed, Ms. Ottaviani. I assure you, I am a doctor, and I simply want to gather enough information to provide you with the best possible care, and do so efficiently. I understand your time is valuable. Let’s shift gears slightly. Have you noticed any cough, runny nose, or congestion?
PATIENT: No cough. No runny nose. No… what was that other word? Congestion? No. Just the throat. It's always the throat. I don't understand why this is so difficult. I’m a perfectly healthy woman, and I don't have time for all these questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. It is helpful to know what symptoms you aren't experiencing. Now, have you been around anyone else who has been sick recently – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Sick people? At the factory? Always. People call out sick all the time. It’s… unavoidable. I try to keep my distance. Don't want to catch anything. Honestly, it's probably just the air in there. Dusty, you know? Very dusty.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Ottaviani. Dusty air certainly could be contributing to your discomfort. Now, just a few more quick questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any white spots or pus on your tonsils, or any difficulty breathing or swallowing?
PATIENT: Pus? Now you're just being… unpleasant. I haven’t looked at my tonsils, Doctor. I have work to do. And no, I can swallow, clearly. It hurts, but I can do it. And no difficulty breathing. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite insulted. Are you sure you're a real doctor?
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize if my questions are causing you distress, Ms. Ottaviani. I assure you, I am a qualified physician, and I would never intentionally cause you discomfort. I am asking about these things to rule out more serious possibilities. Given your description of the sore throat, the lack of fever or other systemic symptoms, and your mention of the dusty work environment, it’s possible this is simply a case of pharyngitis – inflammation of the throat – caused by irritation. However, to be certain, I would like to briefly examine your throat. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Examine my throat? Honestly. Fine. Get it over with. But make it quick. I have a shift to get back to, and this is taking far too long. Just… do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. Just a quick look… I see some mild redness in the back of your throat, and your tonsils are slightly swollen, but I don’t see any exudate – pus – or significant inflammation. Your uvula appears normal. It doesn't appear to be a severe case, which is reassuring.
PATIENT: See? I told you it was nothing. Just a bit of irritation. Can I go now? I really need to get back to the factory. They’re probably short-handed without me.
DOCTOR: Based on my examination, I agree with you, Ms. Ottaviani. It appears to be a mild case of pharyngitis, likely caused by irritation, as you suspected. While it doesn’t seem to be anything serious, I do recommend a few things to help soothe your throat and prevent it from worsening. Would you like me to share those with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But keep it brief. I don't have all day. And please, no fancy medical terms. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. To help soothe your throat, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – warm tea with honey is especially good. Over-the-counter throat lozenges or spray can also provide temporary relief. Try to avoid irritants like smoke or dust, if possible, and get plenty of rest. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or significant pain – please seek medical attention immediately. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Warm tea, lozenges, rest… avoid dust. Yes, that makes sense. Honestly, it’s just common sense. I told you it wasn’t anything serious. Is there anything else? I really must get going.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Ottaviani, that covers it. I don't believe any further treatment is necessary at this time. I will document my findings and recommendations in your chart. Given your employment situation and lack of insurance, I’m happy to provide you with a note for your employer explaining your visit and my recommendations, if you would find that helpful. Would you like me to do so?
PATIENT: A note? Hmm… yes, actually. That would be… useful. They're very strict about absences. Just something simple, saying I saw the doctor and need to avoid dust. Don’t make it sound like I'm terribly ill, though. They’ll think I'm contagious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. I can absolutely do that. Here you go. It states that you were evaluated today for pharyngitis, likely due to environmental irritation, and advises you to minimize exposure to dust as a precaution. It does not mention any contagious illness. I hope you feel better soon. If anything changes, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Thank you… I suppose. I really must get back to work now.
