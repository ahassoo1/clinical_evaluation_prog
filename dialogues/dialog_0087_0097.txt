DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I am here because my husband—a very practical man, you see—insists I get one of these… documents. An advance directive, he called it. Or a POLST form. Something to do with… what happens if I am unable to speak for myself. Honestly, it all seems rather morbid, but he’s quite insistent. I would simply like the paperwork, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your husband is proactive in ensuring your wishes are known, and you’re here to fulfill that. It’s not morbid at all, Ms. Chilla; it’s actually very responsible and thoughtful of both of you. We can certainly complete the paperwork, but to do that properly, I need to ask you a few questions. It ensures the document accurately reflects your preferences. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Questions? Honestly. I suppose… as long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a class to prepare for this afternoon, you see. And I do have a rather extensive vocabulary to review. I trust you won’t be asking me to… to detail every hypothetical ailment? Because frankly, the thought is rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Chilla, nothing like detailing every ailment. We'll focus on your general wishes regarding medical care should you be unable to communicate them yourself. It's about big-picture preferences – things like resuscitation, intubation, artificial nutrition. It shouldn’t take long at all. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant health conditions?
PATIENT: Significant conditions? Well… I wouldn't say significant. I have a touch of seasonal allergies, naturally. The pollen count this year has been atrocious. And my blood pressure, the doctor tells me, runs a little high, but I manage it with a good diet and a great deal of chamomile tea. Nothing requiring… drastic interventions. I assure you. I am a very healthy woman, all things considered. I've never been one for complaining about minor discomforts.
DOCTOR: Alright, seasonal allergies and mildly elevated blood pressure noted. And you manage that with diet and chamomile tea, that's good. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of loratadine during peak pollen season, and occasionally ibuprofen for a headache. Nothing… concerning, I promise you. I’m not one for relying on pharmaceuticals unless absolutely necessary. I believe in letting the body heal itself, within reasonable limits, of course. And proper hydration. That's very important, you know. It's dreadful how many people don't drink enough water. It affects the complexion terribly.
DOCTOR: Loratadine and ibuprofen, understood. No regular pain medications or other prescriptions?
PATIENT: No, nothing of the sort. Really, Doctor, are you trying to imply I'm some sort of fragile patient? I’ve led a very active life, traveled extensively—Morocco, naturally, but also several times to Europe. I require no… coddling, thank you very much. I simply wish to obtain this form and be done with it so I can return to my preparations for the fall semester. My students require stimulating intellectual discourse, and I cannot provide that if I am wasting time filling out endless questionnaires.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Chilla, and I apologize if my questions seem excessive. It's simply my responsibility to gather a complete picture of your health. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine care?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. I have a very low tolerance for… invasive procedures. Hospitalized? Perhaps for the birth of my son, many years ago, but that was perfectly routine, a very uncomplicated delivery, I assure you. And that was… decades ago. I have excellent genes, you know. My grandmother lived to be nearly ninety, and she maintained a remarkably sharp mind until the very end. So, no. No surgeries, no prolonged hospital stays. Are we getting closer to this paperwork yet? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. No surgeries, no hospitalizations beyond childbirth. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, cancer, diabetes, perhaps?
PATIENT: Family history? Now you're delving into my relatives’… indiscretions? Honestly, Doctor. I barely knew most of them. My father was a rather private man, and he certainly didn't discuss the ailments of his cousins. I believe my aunt suffered from some sort of nervous condition, but that was generations ago. My mother was remarkably healthy, she lived a very simple life. I suppose… my grandfather had a touch of arthritis in his later years, but that's hardly significant, is it? People get arthritis, Doctor. It's hardly a family tragedy. Really, I fail to see how this is relevant to my health. I am a perfectly capable woman, and I am wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. Nervous condition in an aunt, arthritis in a grandfather. Let's move on to your social history, if you don't mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Good heavens, no! Really, Doctor, what sort of establishment do you think this is? I am a respected educator, a pillar of the community! I do enjoy a small glass of wine with dinner on occasion—a nice Merlot, perhaps—but that’s hardly a vice. And no, I do not smoke. The very idea! My lungs are perfectly clear, I assure you. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, as I’ve already explained repeatedly. Are we finally going to get to this paperwork, or am I to be subjected to further interrogation regarding my personal habits? I have a syllabus to finalize, you know. A syllabus. It requires careful consideration.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. No smoking, occasional wine, and a healthy lifestyle. One final question before we proceed. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Honestly! I told you about seasonal allergies. To pollen. Is this some sort of test? I have no allergies to medications. None. Never have. I take loratadine, as I have repeatedly stated! Is this all some sort of elaborate exercise in… trivial pursuit? I came here for a form, Doctor, not an inquisition. I feel perfectly capable of dictating my wishes, I simply require the appropriate document to do so. Are we finished yet? Because frankly, my patience is wearing exceedingly thin. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. No known allergies to medications. Let’s proceed with the advance directive. However, given your understandable frustration and reluctance to engage in a detailed medical history, and given the importance of accurately reflecting your wishes, I recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment with a specialist who can dedicate more time to this process. This will ensure your document is thorough and legally sound. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A specialist? Are you suggesting I am somehow… inadequate to make these decisions? This is preposterous! I came here for a simple form, and now you're suggesting I require further… scrutiny? No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I will take my business elsewhere. I assure you, there are other physicians in this town, and I am quite certain I can find one who is willing to simply provide the paperwork without subjecting me to this… ordeal. Good day, Doctor. And I sincerely hope you reconsider your methods in the future. This has been a profoundly unpleasant experience. .
