DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, to be honest. I’ve been going to the restroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, certainly. It's been… troubling me. I don't quite know why it’s happening, and I confess my memory isn’t what it once was, so recalling specifics is… challenging.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if recalling details is difficult. We’ll take our time. So, you've noticed an increase in your frequency of urination. Can you tell me approximately how often you're needing to go to the restroom, compared to what's normal for you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is a good question. Normal… hmm. Well, before, I suppose I’d go… perhaps three or four times a day? Now… it feels like every hour or two. Sometimes even less. It’s… quite disruptive, and I worry a bit. It's hard to say precisely, as the days seem to blend together a little, if I’m being truthful. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Ms. MacVittie. It’s very common for things to not be perfectly clear, and we'll work through it together. So, an increase to approximately every one to two hours. Have you noticed any changes when you need to go?
PATIENT: Changes… yes, actually. I seem to feel the urge quite suddenly, and… it's not always a full bladder feeling, you understand? Sometimes it’s just a… a pressure, or a discomfort. And… sometimes, I have a little difficulty starting. It’s not painful, thankfully, just… a bit of a struggle to get things going. I hope that isn’t too… indelicate of a description.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. MacVittie. That’s perfectly alright – it’s important to be thorough, and I appreciate you sharing those details with me. Difficulty starting, and a sense of urgency even when not feeling a full bladder – those are helpful things to know. Aside from the increased frequency and those sensations, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No… no pain, thankfully. And no burning sensation either. It’s mostly just the… the inconvenience, and a little worry about what it could be. I confess I’ve been trying not to drink too much water, thinking it might help, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference. I haven't noticed any blood, either, if that's something you were going to ask. I try to be mindful of those things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the lack of pain, burning, and blood. It's smart to be mindful of those details. And avoiding excessive fluid intake is reasonable, but it's important not to become dehydrated. Now, have you noticed any changes in your thirst levels recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. Perhaps a little more thirsty, but I attributed that to the warmer weather, if you understand. It’s been quite hot lately, and I tend to feel parched quite easily. I haven't been exceptionally thirsty, though. I wouldn't say I'm constantly reaching for a glass of water. Just… normal for summer, I suppose. Though, now that you mention it, I have been waking up once or twice during the night to use the restroom… which is new.
DOCTOR: Waking up during the night to urinate is a helpful piece of information. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, urinary tract infections, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult one. My medical history isn’t… well, it’s a bit spotty, if I’m honest. I believe I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… things like that. I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back. As for anything diagnosed… I don’t believe so. I was divorced some years ago, and my former husband handled most of the medical appointments. I’m afraid I don’t have much recollection of specific diagnoses. I do recall having some… digestive issues on occasion, but nothing serious enough to warrant a formal diagnosis, as far as I know. I apologize for being so vague. I wish my memory were more reliable.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. MacVittie. It’s perfectly alright if details are unclear. We can work with what you remember. So, no formal diagnoses that you're aware of, and some occasional digestive issues. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. I haven’t had any surgeries, thankfully. I… I remember being quite afraid of hospitals, even as a child, so I always avoided them if possible. I’ve had the usual vaccinations, I suppose, but nothing more… invasive than that. I don't believe I've ever been hospitalized for anything significant, either. Just the occasional… cold, perhaps. I truly haven’t had much cause for medical intervention, thankfully. It’s… rather frustrating that I can’t recall more details about my past health, but it seems my memory is determined to remain stubbornly elusive.
DOCTOR: It's alright. We'll do the best we can. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – diabetes, kidney problems, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family wasn’t very forthcoming about health matters, if I’m honest. My mother… she wasn’t one to discuss such things. I know my grandmother, on my mother’s side, passed away at a relatively young age, but I believe it was a heart condition. My father’s side of the family… I wasn't particularly close to them, so I’m afraid I have very little information about their medical history. I believe my uncle had some… trouble with his blood pressure, perhaps? But beyond that, I’m afraid I can’t offer much assistance. It’s… rather disheartening that I know so little about my family’s health background. Perhaps my mother kept records somewhere, but I haven’t been able to locate them. I apologize for being so unhelpful. It seems I’m consistently unable to provide concrete information.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Ms. MacVittie. It's very common for families to not discuss these things, and it’s perfectly alright that you don't have all the answers. We can proceed without detailed family history if that’s the case. Now, just a few more questions. Could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Oh. Well. I’m divorced, as I mentioned earlier. I don’t… currently have a partner. I live alone. I worked as a concierge for many years, but I retired a few months ago. I enjoy gardening, when the weather permits. I read a good deal. I don’t… socialize much these days. I have a few acquaintances, but no close friends, I’m afraid. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion. I don't use any recreational drugs. It’s… a rather quiet life, if I’m honest. Perhaps a little too quiet, at times. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I apologize if my answers are… underwhelming.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. MacVittie. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, one final set of questions before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I haven't ever knowingly had an allergic reaction to anything. I can eat most foods without issue. I’ve never been stung by a bee, or exposed to poison ivy, to my knowledge. I haven't taken any new medications recently. I took some over-the-counter pain relievers for a headache a few weeks ago, but I didn’t experience any adverse effects. I truly don't have any known allergies. I suppose I’m rather fortunate in that regard. I apologize for being such a… straightforward case. It feels rather unusual to have so few medical concerns.
DOCTOR: You're not a "straightforward case" at all, Ms. MacVittie. Everyone’s health is unique. Now, with your permission, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a neurological assessment. We can also check a urine sample. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright. A physical exam seems… sensible. I suppose it’s the best way to determine the cause of this issue. A urine sample as well, certainly. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please proceed when you’re ready. I apologize if I seem a little anxious, it’s simply… I’m not particularly fond of medical examinations, if I’m honest. But I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. I’ll explain everything as I go, and we’ll take things at your pace. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, and your pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular. That’s within a normal range. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Strength is normal in all extremities. Do you have any pain or discomfort with this?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. Just a… slight tingling sensation in my legs. It’s not painful, just… unusual. It’s difficult to describe. It’s not a sensation I experience often. Perhaps it's simply the nervousness. Everything else feels… as it should, I suppose. A little strange to be prodded and poked, but not painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. The tingling sensation could be related to the exam, or simply normal. Now, if you could provide a urine sample, we can send that off to the lab for analysis. I’ll leave you some privacy to do so, and I’ll be right outside when you’re finished. Please just let me know when you’ve collected the sample.
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. A urine sample. That sounds… sensible. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll be just a moment. I appreciate your patience.
