DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Voytek. It is a pleasure to meet you. I am here, if I understand correctly, to see if my… situation qualifies for help at home. My daughter explained something about… hospice care, I believe? She made the appointment. I am not entirely sure of the details, myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like your daughter is exploring some options for support, and that’s good. Hospice care is a really valuable resource, but it's important to understand if it's the right fit. Let me pull up your information… alright, I see you're 54 years old. Before we talk about hospice specifically, can you tell me a little bit about why your daughter thought it might be helpful to come in today?
PATIENT: Yes, 54, that is correct. August 2nd, 2025, if you require the date for your records. Well, I… I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer some months ago. It has… progressed. I tire easily. Eating is… difficult. And it is becoming harder to manage things on my own, even with my daughter’s help. She worries, naturally. And I do not wish to be a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pancreatic cancer is a serious diagnosis, and it sounds like you’re dealing with a lot right now. It’s good you’re here to explore your options. So, you mentioned fatigue and difficulty eating. Can you tell me more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, “fatigue” is… an understatement, perhaps. It is not merely being tired after a long day, Doctor. It is… a constant weight. I can walk across the room, perhaps, but then I must sit for a long time afterward. Even simple tasks, like… preparing a cup of tea, leave me breathless. It started gradually, of course. But it has become… debilitating, lately. It impacts everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, “constant weight” – that's a very helpful way to describe it. And how about the difficulty with eating?
PATIENT: It is… a loss of appetite, primarily. But more than that, it is… discomfort. Pain, sometimes, though not constant. It feels as though… the food does not digest properly. I have lost weight, I believe. My clothes are… looser than they once were. I try to eat, of course. But it is becoming less and less enjoyable. I mostly… sip soup, now. Or eat small portions of… bland things.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, loss of appetite, discomfort with eating, some pain, and weight loss. And you're primarily sticking to soups and bland foods. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Yes, that is an accurate summary. And… yes. There has been some nausea, occasionally. Not frequently, thankfully. And… a few instances of vomiting. Mostly after… attempting to eat something more substantial than soup. It is… unpleasant, naturally. And it discourages me from eating, which… I suspect exacerbates the problem. It’s a vicious cycle, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It certainly can be. I’m going to examine your abdomen, just to get a better sense of things. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Hmm. I’m noting some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, and your abdomen is slightly distended. It doesn't seem acute, but it's something to be aware of. Have you been having any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. A little discomfort, yes, but not… agonizing. And yes, there have been changes in my bowel habits. More… irregularity, if I may. Sometimes… constipation. Other times… the opposite. It is… unpredictable. I did not think it was particularly noteworthy, but… you are asking, so I mention it. It has been… worsening recently as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. The irregularity and worsening of that is helpful information. We've covered a lot already, and it sounds like your symptoms are definitely progressing. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work to check your organ function and nutritional status. Also, a recent CT scan would be helpful if you've had one in the last few months. Do you happen to know when your last scan was?
PATIENT: Yes, a CT scan… let me see. My daughter handles most of these arrangements, you understand. I believe it was… approximately six weeks ago. She mentioned something about comparing it to previous scans to see if… things had changed. She said it was on July 12th, 2025, if that is helpful. I do not recall the specifics, but I trust her memory implicitly. She is very… organized.
DOCTOR: Excellent, July 12th is very helpful. I'll access those results through the system. Okay, I'm reviewing the CT scan now... it does show some progression of the tumor, unfortunately, and some fluid accumulation. The blood work will give us a clearer picture of how your body is coping with everything. While we wait for those results, let’s talk about your goals for care. Since your daughter brought up hospice, are you thinking about comfort care and support at home?
PATIENT: Yes, “comfort care” sounds… appropriate. I do not wish to prolong things unnecessarily. If… if there is nothing more that can be done to… cure me, then I would prefer to be comfortable. And to remain at home, if possible. I do not wish to be a burden on the hospital. And I… I wish to spend my remaining time with my daughter. She has been… very good to me. So, yes. Comfort care at home sounds… agreeable. What does that entail, precisely? I confess, I am… a little apprehensive.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable and thoughtful approach, Mr. Bahta. And you're not a burden at all. Hospice care isn’t about giving up; it’s about focusing on quality of life. It provides a team – including a doctor, nurses, a social worker, and often a chaplain – to manage your symptoms, provide emotional and spiritual support, and help your daughter with the practical aspects of care. It can include pain management, assistance with bathing and dressing, and just someone to talk to. It's very individualized to your needs. We’d have a meeting with your daughter and the hospice team to create a care plan. Does that sound… less daunting?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds much less daunting, Doctor. A “team,” you say? That is… reassuring. The idea of being alone… that was the most concerning part, I confess. If there is someone to help my daughter, to share the… the responsibility, then I am much more amenable to the idea. A meeting with the team, you say? When would that be possible? And… what if I decide it is not for me? Is there any… obligation? I do not wish to be impolite.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, there's no obligation whatsoever. You can withdraw at any time. The hospice team is through a local agency, and they're very good. I can have them contact your daughter tomorrow to schedule a meeting. It’s usually done in your home, so you're comfortable. They'll explain everything in detail and answer all your questions. While we wait for that, I'm going to write you a prescription for some anti-nausea medication to help with the discomfort. It may not solve everything, but it should take the edge off. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, anti-nausea medication sounds… excellent. Anything to alleviate the discomfort would be appreciated. And having the team come to my home… that is very thoughtful, Doctor. Yes, please have them contact my daughter tomorrow. She is… quite capable. She will handle the arrangements. I believe her name is… Eloise Bahta. Is that sufficient information? And thank you, Doctor. You have… put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Eloise Bahta – perfect. Here is the prescription for the anti-nausea medication. It's called Ondansetron, and you take it as needed. I’ll also send a referral to the hospice agency with Eloise’s contact information. They'll reach out to schedule the meeting. We’ll also monitor your blood work results closely to see how you’re doing overall. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have answered all of my questions. You have been… most kind and patient. Thank you again for your time. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I… I feel much better prepared now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I’m here if anything else comes up. Take care, and I wish you and Eloise all the best. .
