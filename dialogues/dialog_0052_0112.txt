DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, and it’s… disruptive. I’m not entirely sure why, and I haven’t a clue what might be causing it. It just… started, I suppose. A little while ago. I don’t recall exactly when.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to discuss these things with me; it’s why I’m here. Many patients experience similar concerns, and we can certainly investigate what’s going on. When you say "quite a lot," could you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Quantify… Oh dear. That sounds very official. Well, normally I'd go, perhaps… three or four times a day? And that's perfectly normal, I think. But now… it's more like every hour, or even more often. Sometimes I feel like I just went, and then I need to go again shortly after. It’s… inconvenient, and a bit worrying, to be frank. I'm not sure if that helps? It's difficult to keep track, honestly.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. A noticeable increase in frequency is certainly worth investigating. And you mentioned it started "a little while ago"—roughly how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… the difficult part. It feels like several weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month? It's all a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. I haven’t been keeping a diary or anything. Work has been rather demanding lately, and I haven’t been paying close attention to… well, to anything really. It just gradually became more noticeable, and then… here I am. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Ms. MacVittie. It's common for these things to develop gradually, and it's not always easy to pinpoint the exact start date. Aside from the increased frequency, have you noticed any other changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I don’t think so. No pain, thankfully. And the stream seems… normal, I suppose. Not weaker, not stronger. Though, now that you mention it, I might feel a little more urgency sometimes. Like I really have to go right now. It's not always a comfortable feeling, and I've had a couple of… near misses, if you understand what I mean. But overall, it’s mostly just the frequency that’s bothering me. No blood, no burning… just a lot of trips to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. The urgency is good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your fluid intake?
PATIENT: Fluid intake… I don’t think so, no. I generally drink the same amount of water as usual – perhaps a little more in the warmer weather, but nothing drastic. I don’t drink a lot of sugary drinks, mostly just water and the occasional cup of tea. I haven't consciously increased my intake, and I certainly haven't been deliberately trying to drink more. It's all rather perplexing, to be honest. Is it possible it's something I ate? Or perhaps stress? Work has been quite demanding, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Those are both reasonable considerations, Ms. MacVittie. Stress can certainly play a role in bladder function. And dietary factors can sometimes contribute to urinary symptoms. To get a clearer picture, let's review some other aspects of your health. Have you had any recent illnesses, such as a urinary tract infection?
PATIENT: A urinary tract infection… Not that I'm aware of, no. I haven’t been feeling unwell, and I haven’t had any fever or pain in my back or sides. I haven’t taken any antibiotics recently, either. I do try to stay healthy, and I’m generally quite careful about hygiene. I've never had a particularly bad infection before, thankfully. Though… I did have a bit of a cold a few months ago, but it was very mild and cleared up quickly. Nothing that would cause… this, I wouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Oh dear. Let me see. I haven't had any major illnesses, thankfully. I had chickenpox as a child, of course, and I broke my arm once when I was younger. But nothing serious. I don’t have any chronic conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure. I had my appendix removed about ten years ago, but that was a routine procedure and I recovered well. I used to suffer from migraines, but they’ve been much less frequent in recent years. I don’t think… is there anything specific you’re looking for? I apologize for being so vague, it's just… I don’t often think about my medical history, to be honest.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Ms. MacVittie. That information is very helpful. Appendectomy ten years ago, occasional migraines, and no chronic medical conditions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a serious allergic reaction to anything. I occasionally get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that's just mild sneezing and a runny nose. Nothing that requires medication. I can eat all sorts of foods without any problems, and I haven't had any adverse reactions to any medications in the past. I'm quite lucky, I think. I've always had a strong constitution. Unless… are there any common allergies I should be thinking about? I apologize for being so clueless, it’s just not something I’ve ever had to worry about.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize. It’s good to know you have no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not currently. I don't take anything regularly. Occasionally, I might take a pain reliever for a headache, but that's very infrequent. And sometimes, I take vitamin C during the winter months, but that's just for a boost. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, and nothing long-term. I try to stay healthy through diet and exercise, so I don't rely on medications. I don't even have a regular brand of pain reliever, I just buy whatever's on sale at the pharmacy. I'm afraid I'm not very organised when it comes to these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. No regular medications or supplements. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe, and she was diagnosed with arthritis later in life. My father was generally quite healthy, though he did have heart problems in his later years. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had diabetes. But other than that, I don’t recall any major medical conditions running in the family. It’s not something we discussed much, to be honest. Everyone was always quite private about their health. I’m afraid I don’t have a very detailed family medical history to share. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. MacVittie. Hypertension, arthritis, and diabetes in the family. And lastly, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you briefly describe your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I work as a concierge at a rather busy hotel, so I’m on my feet quite a lot throughout the day. It can be quite demanding, running around and assisting guests. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fresh fruits and vegetables, and I drink plenty of water. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I used to go to the gym regularly, but I haven’t had much time lately with work being so busy. I enjoy reading and spending time with friends when I can. Overall, I would say I lead a fairly active and healthy lifestyle, despite the long hours. Is there anything specific you’re interested in? I’m happy to provide more details if you’d like.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. MacVittie. It sounds like you maintain a reasonably healthy lifestyle despite the demands of your job. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just relax and take some normal breaths. I'm now going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your reflexes appear normal, and your blood pressure is 128/76 mmHg. Within the normal range. I don't detect any obvious abnormalities during this examination. Your abdomen is soft, and there's no tenderness to palpation. However, given your symptoms of increased urinary frequency and urgency, I'd like to order a urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection and assess for any other abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear there’s no tenderness, Doctor. Yes, a urinalysis sounds perfectly sensible. I’m happy to proceed with that. I’d like to rule out anything serious, of course. How will that be done? Will I need to provide a sample now? And… is there anything else you recommend at this point? I apologize for all the questions.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Ms. MacVittie. Questions are always welcome. Yes, we’ll need a urine sample now. I’ll provide you with a sterile cup, and I’ll explain the collection process. It's a simple mid-stream clean catch. While we await the results of the urinalysis, I recommend keeping a bladder diary for the next three days, noting the time and volume of each urination, as well as any associated urgency or discomfort. This will help us establish a baseline and identify any patterns. Depending on the results of the urinalysis, we may also need to consider further investigation, such as a blood test to assess your kidney function and a pelvic exam to rule out any other underlying causes. But let’s start with the urinalysis and bladder diary, and we’ll proceed from there. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A bladder diary… Yes, that sounds manageable. And I understand about waiting for the urinalysis results before proceeding further. I’m happy to keep the diary, and I’ll follow your instructions carefully. A pelvic exam… well, that sounds a bit daunting, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m grateful for your thoroughness. Is there anything else I should be aware of while I wait for the results? Any specific things I should avoid, or any symptoms I should pay particular attention to? I apologize for being such a worrier.
DOCTOR: You’re not a worrier at all, Ms. MacVittie. It’s perfectly natural to be concerned when experiencing new symptoms. For now, continue to drink your usual amount of fluids – about eight glasses of water a day – unless I advise otherwise. Avoid excessive caffeine or alcohol, as these can irritate the bladder. And if you experience any of the following symptoms, please contact me immediately: fever, chills, flank pain, blood in your urine, or inability to urinate. These could indicate a more serious infection. Otherwise, just focus on keeping the bladder diary and try not to stress too much. We’ll review the results of the urinalysis as soon as they’re available and discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and kindness, and I feel much more reassured now. I’ll be sure to follow your instructions carefully and keep the bladder diary diligently. Thank you again for your time and attention. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Or should I simply wait for you to contact me with the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. No, you don’t need to do anything further for now. My staff will contact you within 2-3 business days with the results of the urinalysis. If you haven’t heard from us by then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you all the best, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor Shely. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I will certainly contact you if I have any questions. Have a wonderful day.
