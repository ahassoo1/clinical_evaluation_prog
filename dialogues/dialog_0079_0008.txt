DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, yes. My… ears. They feel blocked, sort of full. It’s been… a while now, I think. Honestly, the days all blur together a bit. It's just… annoying, mostly. Makes it hard to hear sometimes.
DOCTOR: “Blocked” and “full,” I see. And you say this has been going on for some time… do you have any sense of how long, roughly?
PATIENT: Ugh, that’s the hard part. Months, definitely. Maybe… six? Longer? I really can't say for sure. It just… gradually got worse, I suppose. I don't really keep track of these things. My wife… she always did the remembering. It’s… difficult now.
DOCTOR: Six months or longer, progressive onset. Very good. And has this been in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Or… maybe it started in one and then moved to the other? Honestly, it’s hard to tell. They both feel… the same now. Full. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… muffled. Everything sounds a bit distant.
DOCTOR: Both ears, not painful, muffled sounds. Alright. And have you noticed any ringing in your ears—a buzzing or hissing sound—at any time?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe? It's not constant. Comes and goes. Faint, if it's there at all. I mostly notice it when it’s quiet, I guess. Like, at night. I usually have the television on. It helps… drown things out. Does that make sense? I don’t know if that’s ringing though, exactly. More like… a high-pitched whine, sometimes.
DOCTOR: A high-pitched whine, intermittent. I understand. Have you experienced any dizziness, or a feeling of being off-balance?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. No more than usual, anyway. I'm… not the most steady person, even on a good day. But I haven’t fallen or anything. No, no dizziness, I don’t think. Just… a bit clumsy, always have been. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any changes in your hearing besides the fullness?
PATIENT: Changes… well, I suppose I ask people to repeat themselves more often. My grandkids, mostly. They mumble, you know? But I figured that was just them. I haven’t really noticed anything else, no. Not that I can recall, anyway. Everything sounds… quieter, generally. But that could be my age, couldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any significant past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history… right. Let me think. I had… pneumonia, years ago. A bad bout. And… my blood pressure, it’s a bit high, the doctor always said. I take pills for it. Besides that… not much, I don’t think. My wife handled all that paperwork, you see. I’m sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: Pneumonia, hypertension. And you mentioned taking medication for your blood pressure—can you tell me what that medication is, if you know?
PATIENT: Ugh, the name… It's a little white pill. Small. I take it every morning. I have no idea what it's called. It starts with a… B, maybe? Or a P? I really don’t pay attention to these things. My wife… she kept track of everything. I just take what she told me to take, you know? I'm terribly sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can look that up later. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I mean, I don't go out of my way to eat strange things, but I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything. I don’t think. No, no allergies. Unless… dust? I sometimes sneeze a lot, but that's just dust, right? Not an allergy. Is that important?
DOCTOR: No, dust is unlikely to be significant in this case. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, I think. That’s the only one I can remember. A long time ago. Besides that… no, I don't think so. My wife would have remembered if I had any, wouldn't she? She always knew everything. It’s… difficult. Everything feels so hazy. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy. Alright. And finally, do you have any family history of hearing loss or any other relevant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… Now that's a tough one. My mother… she was a bit hard of hearing when she got older. But I think that was just age, you know? And my father… he had… heart problems, I think. And diabetes. But hearing loss… I don't recall anyone specifically having trouble with their ears. It was a big family, you see. Lots of people. I don't really keep track of all of that. I'm sorry, Doctor. This is probably very frustrating for you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, thank you for what you could recall. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please? My ears are a bit sensitive, you see. And… please don’t take too long. I have… things to do. But yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lean forward a bit. Alright. I do see some cerumen—earwax—in the ear canal. And the tympanic membrane—the eardrum—appears slightly… dull. Similar findings in the left ear. Some cerumen, and a slightly dull tympanic membrane. It’s difficult to get a clear view, though. I also notice some mild swelling around both ear canals. Alright. I will now perform a quick hearing test. I will place headphones on your ears and you will indicate when you hear a tone.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Headphones are fine. Just… let me know what I need to do. I hope it won’t take too long. And… I’m not very good at these things, you know. I have trouble hearing sometimes, as you know. But I’ll do my best. Just hurry, please?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to start with the right ear. I will play a series of tones at different pitches. Please raise your hand only when you hear a tone, no matter how faint. It’s important to be honest, even if you only think you might hear something. Ready?
PATIENT: I… think I heard something. Very faint. It was… low. Is that right? It's hard to tell. Everything sounds muffled, you see. Please just tell me when I'm supposed to raise my hand. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s fine. And now, the left ear. I will play a series of tones at different pitches. Please raise your hand only when you hear a tone, no matter how faint.
PATIENT: I… barely heard something. Really faint. Very low again. Is this working? I’m not very good at this, you see. It’s… frustrating. Everything sounds so distant. Please just… tell me when I need to do something. I’ll try my best. But I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you. Based on the examination and the quick hearing test, it appears you have mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears, primarily at the lower frequencies. The cerumen buildup is likely contributing to this, as well as some possible mild inflammation of the ear canals. Now, I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but this could be caused by a variety of factors. It’s unlikely to be a sudden onset problem. It seems to have developed gradually. The most likely course of action at this point is to remove the earwax. It’s a relatively simple procedure. We can also consider a topical steroid for the inflammation. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Earwax… inflammation… Sounds complicated. Topical steroid… is that… bad? Is it something I have to take? I don’t really like taking things. And… what about my ears being full? Will that go away? Honestly, Doctor, I just want to be able to hear again. It’s… isolating. I don't want to bother my grandkids anymore. But… what if it doesn't work? And how much will all of this cost? I have… limited funds. Just… tell me what the simplest thing is, please. The thing that will make me hear again, quickly and easily. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I understand your concerns. Let's break it down. The earwax is likely contributing to the feeling of fullness and muffling. Removing it is the simplest first step. It’s not a medication; it's a physical removal, we can use irrigation or manual removal. The topical steroid is a cream we’d apply to the ear canal to reduce any inflammation, which can also improve hearing. It’s not something you ingest. It's a relatively safe and straightforward treatment. As for cost, let me have the billing department prepare an estimate for you. We will work with your insurance to determine your out-of-pocket expenses. I cannot guarantee a full return of hearing, as we don’t know the underlying cause yet. But removing the wax and addressing the inflammation is a reasonable first step, and often provides significant improvement. I wouldn’t recommend any treatment if I didn’t think it would be beneficial. Would you like me to proceed with the wax removal?
PATIENT: Wax removal… alright. Yes, please. If you think it will help. Just… please be gentle. And quickly, if possible. I really don’t want to spend too much time here. And… please let me know the cost before you do anything. I don't want any surprises. I’m trusting you, Doctor. Just… get me to hear again. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will have the billing department speak with you regarding the cost estimate before we proceed. Then, we will gently remove the earwax, and I will examine your ears again to assess the results. I will also explain the use of the topical steroid if we decide that is appropriate. Nurse, could you please prepare an irrigation solution and obtain a cost estimate for Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… good. I appreciate that. Just… hurry, please? I don’t like being here. It… brings back bad memories. But thank you. Really. Just… get me to hear again. That’s all. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. We will do our best. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
