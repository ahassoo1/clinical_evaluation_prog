DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I been... getting red in the face. Like, flushing. Happens sometimes. Not always, but enough to bother me, you know? It's my face, mostly. And neck a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Flushing – redness of the face and neck that comes and goes. And you say it’s been happening enough to bother you. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. When… that’s a good question. It's hard to say exactly. Not after eating anything special, not that I know of. Sometimes when I'm talking, maybe? Or if I walk a little fast. Not always, though. It just... comes. I don't think it's the weather. It was hot yesterday and I didn't flush. I don't know. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Withycombe. It sounds like it's not consistently triggered by anything specific. So it seems to happen somewhat randomly, or with exertion or talking. Do you notice anything else happening when you flush?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe a little warm. Like a hot flash, but not… all over. Just my face and neck, like I said. And it doesn't last long. Few minutes, maybe. Then it goes away. I don’t get dizzy or anything. Just red. It's… embarrassing, mostly. Especially if I'm talking to someone. They look at me funny.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, localized warmth and redness, not accompanied by other symptoms like dizziness. And it resolves fairly quickly. Have you noticed any changes in your overall health recently – any weight loss, fatigue, fever, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no changes like that. Weight is the same, I think. I haven’t weighed myself in a little bit, but my clothes fit the same. Not tired more than usual, and no fever or sweating at night. I sleep okay. My wife… she would have noticed if I was sick. But she… well, she's gone now. That was… a few years ago. So, I don’t have anyone to tell me these things anymore. But I feel okay, generally. Just this flushing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Withycombe. And I’m sorry for your loss. It’s good you're aware of any changes in your health. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. The doctor… my old doctor, he always said I was pretty healthy. Maybe a little high cholesterol, he said once, but he didn’t give me anything for it. Just told me to eat less fried food. I don’t remember much else. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Since my wife got sick, mostly. It's hard to explain. Didn’t seem important. Until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a history of slightly elevated cholesterol in the past, but no other significant medical conditions diagnosed. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. No hospital stays. Just… the usual colds and flus when I was a kid. Nothing serious. I broke my arm once, when I was young, playing cricket. But that was a long time ago. They put it in a cast, and it healed. That’s it, really. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Not much goes wrong with me. Usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family… my father had… something with his heart, I think. He was always tired. But he smoked a lot, so it was probably that. And my mother… she had trouble with her stomach. But I don't know what it was. Everyone on my side is pretty old when they go, if that makes sense. Long life, mostly. Not a lot of… big sicknesses. My wife's side… they had more trouble. But I don't remember exactly what. She did all the talking with the doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some history of heart issues on your father's side and stomach problems in your mother’s family, and more health issues generally on your wife's side. Now, I’m going to ask about some lifestyle factors. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My wife didn't like it, so I never started. And I don't drink much either. Maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes, but not every night. Just… when I'm feeling lonely, maybe. Not a lot. Mostly I just drink water. And tea. I like tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No smoking and minimal alcohol consumption. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything. And I haven't been around anything that makes me sneeze or get a rash in a long time. I used to be allergic to some kinds of flowers when I was a kid, but I grew out of it. I don't think I have any allergies now. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to think I'm perfectly healthy. This flushing is just… a strange thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. No pills, no vitamins, nothing. I don’t like taking medicine if I don't have to. I always figured I was better off just letting things be. My wife… she took a lot of pills. It made her feel worse, she said. So I never started. I just drink my tea and try to eat right. That's it. I think that's everything, Doctor. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe, thank you for that thorough information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also take a look at your face and neck. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. Just tell me if you see anything wrong. I just want to figure out what’s causing this flushing. It's just… unsettling, you know? It comes and goes without warning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds normal, no murmurs. Your lungs are clear. I do notice some mild redness on your cheeks and neck. There are no visible rashes or lesions. I'm also noting some telangiectasias – small visible blood vessels – on your cheeks. Your lymph nodes feel normal – no swelling or tenderness. Given your blood pressure and the telangiectasias, a few possibilities come to mind. It could be rosacea, which is a common skin condition, or it could be related to your blood pressure. Sometimes flushing can be a symptom of hypertension. It’s also possible it's a combination of things, or something else entirely. To be sure, I’d like to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… that sounds… okay. If that’s what you think is best. I just want to know what's going on. Rosacea? Is that… serious? And what is a thyroid? I don't understand all these medical words. My wife always handled things like this. I just… I just want to feel normal again. If those tests will help, then yes, please. Let's do them. Do I need to make another appointment to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe. No, rosacea isn’t serious in the sense that it's not life-threatening. It's a chronic skin condition that causes redness, flushing, and sometimes small bumps. It can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. As for the thyroid, it's a gland in your neck that produces hormones that regulate your metabolism. We want to make sure that’s functioning properly. I’ll order the blood tests now. They’ll be done at the lab just down the hall. The nurse will give you a requisition form. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. I'll call you as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’d recommend avoiding things that seem to trigger the flushing – things like spicy foods, alcohol, and excessive sun exposure. We can also talk about ways to manage your blood pressure, even while we're waiting for the test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Avoid spicy food… that might be hard, I like my curries. But I can try. And I'll stay out of the sun. That’s not a problem. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It's… comforting to know what's going on, even if it's just a little. Thank you. Now, about the nurse… where is the lab? Is it far?
DOCTOR: The lab is right down the hall to your left. It’s just past the waiting room. The nurse, Sarah, is just outside, she'll escort you and get you set up. She'll explain the process. It shouldn't take long. And we will get to the bottom of this. I promise. Is there anything else I can answer for you before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I'll see you when the results are back. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. And don’t worry, we'll figure it out. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon.
