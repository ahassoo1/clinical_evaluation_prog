DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. My foot... it hurts very much. Been hurting for a little while now, and it’s getting worse, I think. It’s a sore, right here. <points to foot> It doesn't heal good.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. “A little while now” is rather vague, Mr. Stoegbauer. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh. Specific... yes. Maybe... two, three months now? Hard to say for sure, time goes quick when you get old. It started small, like a little cut, but it just... stayed. And got bigger. And now it’s very painful to walk. I try to wear slippers all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three months. And it started as a small cut that hasn’t healed properly. You said it's painful to walk. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. But it’s mostly there. Even when I’m resting, I feel it a little. When I try to walk, though... oh, that’s bad. Feels like little needles. And sometimes, it feels warm, you know? Not a fever warm, but... the foot itself.
DOCTOR: Warmth... alright. Have you noticed any redness, swelling, or any discharge from the area?
PATIENT: Redness... yes, a little bit. Not a lot, but it’s red around the sore. And... maybe some wetness sometimes. Not much, but when I change my sock, it looks a little bit... different. I always put a clean bandage on it. I try to keep it clean.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms alongside this foot pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And no chills. Just... the foot. And I get very tired, but I think that’s just getting old. I sleep a lot. I don't feel sick otherwise. I eat my food, I drink my water. Just... this foot is a problem. A big problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The doctor told me I have... the sugar sickness. Diabetes, he called it. Been told to watch what I eat, and take the medicine. I try to do that. And my heart... it gets a little fast sometimes, but the doctor said it's okay. Old age, he said.
DOCTOR: Alright, diabetes and some episodes of a fast heart rate. Do you remember what medications you are currently taking for these conditions, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s hard to remember. Little pills, mostly. I take one in the morning, and one at night, I think. For the sugar. And... sometimes a little white pill for my heart, when it feels funny. My daughter helps me with them, mostly. She fills the little box for me every week. I don’t know the names, sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can sort that out. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I had my appendix out when I was young. A long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing rough. But that's it, I think. Nothing else. No surgeries in a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Oh, I have a daughter. She’s good to me. Lives nearby. And... I had a wife, a long time ago. She passed away a few years back. Sad time, that. But my daughter takes care of me now. She’s a good girl.
DOCTOR: I understand. Do you have any family history of diabetes, heart problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother... she had the sugar sickness too. And my father… he had a bad heart. He passed away when he was not very old. So, yes, I think so. Both of them had problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. I don't do any of that. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol. Bad for you, you know? And… no, no funny pills or anything like that. Just my medicine from the doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe… a little itchy when I eat shrimp sometimes, but not too bad. Not an allergy, really. Just a little itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Stoegbauer. That’s very helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I'd like to take a look at your foot. Could you please remove your sock and shoes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Here you go. It’s not a pretty sight, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see the ulcer here. It’s approximately… two centimeters in diameter. There’s some surrounding redness and swelling, and as you mentioned, some discharge. It is warm to the touch, and tender when I press here. Based on what you’ve told me and this examination, it appears you have a foot ulcer, likely complicated by an infection. Given your history of diabetes, this is a concerning finding. We need to take some steps to address this quickly.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Infection? That doesn’t sound good. What do we need to do, Doctor? I don’t want to lose my foot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Stoegbauer. We're going to do everything we can to prevent that. The first step is to determine the extent of the infection. I'm going to order some blood tests to check for signs of infection in your system. I’ll also need to obtain a sample from the ulcer to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. This will help us choose the most effective antibiotic. Additionally, it's crucial to control your blood sugar levels. High blood sugar can hinder the healing process and worsen the infection. We'll discuss your current diabetes management plan and see if any adjustments are needed. I may also refer you to a podiatrist, a foot specialist, for further evaluation and wound care. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests, and the… pod-ee-a-trist? Okay. And I will try harder with my sugar. My daughter helps me, she reminds me to take the pills. How long will it take to get the results? And… will it hurt? The tests, and the… wound care?
DOCTOR: The blood test results usually take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. The wound culture may take a little longer, perhaps three to five days, as it needs to be analyzed in the lab. As for the tests themselves, the blood draw is a quick pinch, you might feel a little discomfort, but it's generally well-tolerated. The podiatrist will likely debride the wound, which means removing any dead or infected tissue. This can be a little uncomfortable, but they will use local anesthesia to numb the area. They may also apply a special dressing to the wound. We’ll do everything we can to minimize any discomfort. In the meantime, it's important to keep the wound clean and dry. Avoid putting any pressure on your foot as much as possible. Please contact the office immediately if you notice any worsening redness, swelling, pain, or fever. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Keep it clean, and don’t walk on it too much. And call if it gets worse. Okay. My daughter will help me with all of that. She's very good. So… what about the medicine? Will I have to take more pills? And will they make me feel sick? I get so tired already.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will likely need to start an antibiotic, in pill form, to fight the infection. We’ll choose one that is appropriate for your condition and minimizes potential side effects. It's true that antibiotics can sometimes cause side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, or stomach upset. However, not everyone experiences these side effects, and we can discuss strategies to manage them if they occur. It’s important to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better before the medication is finished. This helps ensure that the infection is completely eradicated. I will write the prescription for you now, and the nurse will explain the dosage and potential side effects before you leave. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to check your progress and review the lab results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A follow-up next week. And the nurse will explain the pills. That’s good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I hope… I hope everything will be okay.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. We're going to do everything we can to get you feeling better. It's good that you're proactive about your health and have your daughter's support. We’ll monitor your progress closely, and make adjustments to your treatment plan as needed. Let me go ahead and write that prescription, and I'll have the nurse come in to explain everything to you. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we’re in this together.
PATIENT: .
