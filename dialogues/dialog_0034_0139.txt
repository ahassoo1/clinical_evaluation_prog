DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… fitness check. For… referee work. Need paper say I okay. Want to be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A pre-participation physical for referee work. I understand wanting to be efficient with your time. We’ll do our best to make this as streamlined as possible while still ensuring a thorough evaluation. First, let’s go over some general information. I see here you’re 31 years old. Are there any changes to your medical history since your last visit, if you recall?
PATIENT: Last visit… long time ago. Not much change. I… wife… she gone two years. After that, just work. No big problem. I have insurance, private. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Thank you for letting me know. I understand loss can be difficult, and it’s not uncommon to put things like routine check-ups on hold during challenging times. So, focusing on your health now, have you experienced any new or ongoing medical problems – anything at all – since you last saw a doctor?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Maybe… back little sore sometimes. From work. Lift heavy things. Not always, though. Just… when busy. Old work. Not new.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent back soreness related to lifting at work. That’s good information to have. Can you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Uh… dull ache. Lower back. Not sharp. Not go down leg. Just… when I bend over, or lift something really heavy. Rub it, feel better. Usually gone next day.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache in the lower back that improves with rubbing and resolves within a day or so. That sounds like a fairly common musculoskeletal issue. Now, let’s briefly go through a quick review of systems. This just helps me get a broader picture of your overall health. Have you noticed any recent changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… no. Same as always. Need glasses for far away, that’s it. Get new ones last year. Everything okay. Not dizzy or blurry.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations – any fluttering or racing of your heart?
PATIENT: No. No heart trouble. Never. I… work hard. Lift heavy. Heart good. Sometimes tired, but that’s just work, not heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits – anything like diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No. Everything… normal. Sorry. Not good talk. Just want to finish quickly, if possible. Is need to do running test now? I ready.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Shanor, and I apologize if these questions are uncomfortable. I just need to cover some basics to ensure we’ve identified any potential concerns. We will get to the physical part shortly. Just a couple more quick questions, then we'll move on. Have you noticed any significant weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: No. Weight… same. Maybe little less when busy, work hard, no eat good. But usually same. 134, I think. Not change much.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable weight around 134 pounds. And finally, have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats in the past few weeks?
PATIENT: No. No fever. No chills. No… sweats. I work every day, maybe sweat then. But not sick sweat. Just work sweat. Can we do test now? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. No fever, chills, or night sweats. Thank you for answering those questions. Now, let’s move on to the physical exam. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief musculoskeletal assessment, paying attention to your back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That okay. Quick, please. I… need to go after. Blood… okay. Temperature… okay. Just… quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Blood pressure is 128/76, heart rate is 72 and regular, and your lungs sound clear. Reflexes are normal. Now, let's check your back. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ouch. Little sore. See? That’s why I said. Not good bend. Can’t reach toes. Not much. Stop now? Hurts a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I see that causes some discomfort. I’m noting that you have limited range of motion and discomfort with forward bending. There’s some tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region, but no signs of acute injury. I'm going to check your strength and sensation in your legs just to be thorough. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Standing. Be careful. Don’t push too much. Want work today, Doctor. Just say I okay. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Your strength and sensation appear to be normal in both legs. Based on the history and physical exam, it appears you have some chronic lower back discomfort, likely related to your work. There are no signs of any neurological deficits or acute injury. However, I do recommend some measures to help manage this. Would you be open to discussing those briefly?
PATIENT: Manage… yes. But quick. I need paper. Say I okay to referee. I do not need… massage or… long talk. Paper is good. Is that possible? Just say okay for work. Quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for brevity, Mr. Shanor. Given your clinical presentation and your desire to return to work quickly, I can provide a note stating that you have been evaluated and are currently able to perform the duties of a referee, with the understanding that you have some chronic lower back discomfort. However, I strongly advise you to practice proper lifting techniques, maintain good posture, and consider incorporating some regular stretching exercises to help prevent further aggravation of your back pain. Would you like me to write that note for you now?
PATIENT: Yes. Write note. Say okay. Referee. That good. Thank you, Doctor. Just write it. Quickly. I go now. Very busy.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Shanor. This note states that you have been evaluated and are currently able to perform the duties of a referee. Please let me know if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, and don't hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. I wish you all the best with your work. .
PATIENT: Thank you. Good bye. Busy. Very busy. .
