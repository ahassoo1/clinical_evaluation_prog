DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Finco. Aye, lovely to meet you as well. Well, it's this… nausea, really. Been happening most mornings now, for the past couple of weeks, I'd say. It’s a bit unsettling, especially with my heart not being what it used to be, you know? I get a bit worried it's something… serious on top of everything else.
DOCTOR: I see. Nausea for the past couple of weeks, more prominent in the mornings, and understandably causing you some worry given your heart history. That’s perfectly reasonable. Can you describe the nausea for me?
PATIENT: Aye, that sums it up nicely. As for describing it… well, it's not like a proper sickness, if you understand me. It's not usually vomiting, thankfully. It's more like… a queasy feeling, right in my stomach. Like I've eaten something that didn't quite agree with me, but I can't put my finger on what. It usually comes on pretty quickly, and lasts for a good hour or so. Sometimes I feel a bit lightheaded with it too, but that doesn’t happen every time. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Benic. A queasy feeling, not necessarily leading to vomiting, coming on quickly, lasting about an hour, and occasional lightheadedness. We’ll definitely get to the bottom of this. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. I’ve been trying to keep track, but it’s a bit hard to be certain. I don't think it's anything I've eaten, I've been eating the same things for a while now. It doesn’t seem to be worse after activity, either. I suppose… sometimes it's worse if I lie flat for too long. Not always, mind you, but maybe a wee bit. I do take my medication every morning, same time as usual. Oh, and I've been a bit stressed lately, my nephew’s gotten himself into a bit of trouble, but that's hardly new, is it? I'm just trying to think of anything different...
DOCTOR: Okay, so no obvious dietary link, not related to activity, potentially worse when lying flat, medication is consistent, and some stress – though ongoing. That gives us a few things to consider. Let’s talk about that medication for a moment. What medications are you currently taking, and what are they for?
PATIENT: Right, aye, the medications. Let me see… I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. That's for my blood pressure, and to help the heart, the doctor said. And then there's Digoxin, I think it's 0.125 milligrams, also once a day, that's for the… the rhythm, to keep it steady. And then sometimes, when I'm feeling particularly breathless, I use a Ventolin inhaler, that’s Salbutamol, just as needed. Does that cover everything? I’ve got the list here if you'd like to see it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Benic, thank you. Lisinopril 20mg for blood pressure and heart support, Digoxin 0.125mg for rhythm, and Salbutamol inhaler as needed for breathlessness. It’s good you have that list with you. Now, regarding allergies – do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've been stung by a few bees over the years, being Scottish and all, but no more than a bit of swelling and discomfort. Nothing serious, never needed an EpiPen or anything like that. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication the doctors have given me before. I suppose I would have remembered that, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you certainly would. That's good to know, Mr. Benic. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides your heart issues and high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had pneumonia a few years back, maybe six or seven years ago now. Needed a week in the hospital for that, wasn’t pleasant. And I used to have terrible trouble with my knees, arthritis, but that's calmed down a bit with the physio and the medication. Other than that… not much, really. I've always been fairly healthy, for an old man. Bit of a bad back sometimes, but who doesn't have a bad back these days? I think that’s everything significant, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia about six or seven years ago, requiring hospitalization, and arthritis in the knees, which has improved with physiotherapy and medication. And some occasional back pain. Thank you. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Aye, I had my appendix out when I was a lad, must have been… oh, goodness, nearly sixty years ago now. And I had a wee operation on my knee a few years back, to tidy things up, the doctor said. That's it, really. Nothing major. Both were a long time ago now and recovered well from both of them.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy in your youth, and a knee operation a few years back, both with good recovery. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a tricky one. My father had heart trouble, that’s why I was always so careful about my own health, even when I was young. He died relatively young, in his sixties, from a heart attack. My mother… she had high blood pressure, like me, but she lived to a good old age, nearly ninety. And my sister… she has diabetes, type 2, but other than that, not much I can think of. It's not a family that's known for its long illnesses, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble in your father, high blood pressure in your mother, and type 2 diabetes in your sister. Thank you. Now, just a couple of questions to round things off. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Aye, certainly. I live on my own, in a wee cottage just outside of town. I used to work as a librarian, but I’m retired now. I enjoy reading, naturally, and gardening. I try to get out for a walk most days, when the weather’s decent. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a wee bit of whisky now and again, for medicinal purposes, you understand. I eat fairly well, mostly home-cooked meals, though I do treat myself to a bit of cake now and then. I wouldn’t say I’m terribly active, but I try to keep myself going.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mr. Benic. A quiet life, reading, gardening, walking, no smoking, and a little whisky for medicinal purposes – very sensible. Alright, Mr. Benic, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, would you mind if I just had a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps check your abdomen?
PATIENT: Not at all, go right ahead, Doctor. I'm used to the poking and prodding, being an old man and all. The more you check, the better, I always say. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic, take a deep breath for me… and again… good. Your heart rate is a little irregular, as expected, and I can hear some mild crackling in the lower part of your lungs, which could be due to a bit of congestion. Your abdomen is soft, but I do detect a little tenderness in the upper left quadrant. Nothing too concerning at this stage. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Alright, thank you for that, Mr. Benic. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found on examination, it sounds like your nausea could be due to a number of things. It could be related to your heart condition, or it could be something else entirely. The tenderness in your abdomen is something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Right, that’s what I was thinking myself. So, what do you suggest we do, Doctor? Should we get some blood tests? Or maybe a scan? I'm happy to do whatever you think is best, I just want to get to the bottom of this and feel a bit more like myself again. It’s just unsettling, you know, not knowing what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Benic. It’s always unsettling when you don't know what's going on. I think blood tests are a good first step. We should check your kidney and liver function, your electrolytes, and your cardiac enzymes to rule out any heart-related issues. We should also check your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes, as there's a family history. I'm also going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and rule out any infection or congestion. And given the tenderness in your abdomen, I think a scan—an ultrasound of your abdomen would be sensible. It's non-invasive and can help us see if there's anything going on with your liver, gallbladder, or pancreas. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds very thorough, Doctor, and perfectly sensible to me. The more you check, the better, as I said before. A wee bit of poking and prodding is nothing if it means getting to the bottom of this. So, when would I be able to get these tests done? And how long do you think it will take to get the results? I do have a bit of a busy schedule, with my gardening and all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you feel that way. I'll have the lab requisitions printed out for you now. You can go to the lab downstairs anytime that’s convenient for you, they take walk-ins. The X-ray can be done at the radiology department, just across the hall. I'll send a request over to them as well. They usually have same-day appointments. The results typically take 24-48 hours for the blood tests, and the X-ray report should be back within a few hours. The ultrasound will take a bit longer, usually a few days, as they need to schedule an appointment with a sonographer. Once we have all the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if your nausea gets significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms, such as vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Right, that sounds a good plan. 24-48 hours, a few days for the scan… I can manage that. Aye, thank you, Doctor. That’s all very clear. Hmm… I don’t think I do, not at the moment. You’ve explained everything very well. Just… hopefully, it's nothing too serious. I do get a bit anxious about these things, being an old man and all. Thank you again, Doctor Finco. I appreciate your time and your thoroughness. I’ll go and get these tests done now, then. And I’ll see you again soon, hopefully with some good news.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. I understand your anxiety, and we’ll get to the bottom of this together. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the meantime. Take care, and please let me know if there's anything I can do to make things easier for you. .
PATIENT: Aye, thank you kindly, Doctor. I will. And goodbye to you as well.
