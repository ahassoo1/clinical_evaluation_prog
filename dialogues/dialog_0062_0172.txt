DOCTOR: Hi Candice, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, really, it’s just this…social thing. My husband insisted. New to the area, you know. Doesn’t mean I need a doctor. Honestly, I was perfectly capable where we were before. Just a formality, I suspect.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes these things are just a formality, but it's good to get things checked out when you're settling into a new place. Even if you feel perfectly healthy. Let’s just go through a few things to get a baseline, okay?
PATIENT: A “baseline”? Is that what the young people are calling it now? Very well. But do try to be quick about it. I have…commitments.
DOCTOR: I'll be as efficient as possible, I promise. "Baseline" is just a way of saying we’ll get a good overview of your general health. First, could you tell me a little bit about why you moved to the area?
PATIENT: My husband, Harold, wanted to be closer to…well, to a certain nephew. A rather tiresome young man, if you ask me, but Harold’s very fond of him. It was his decision, entirely. I simply…accompanied him. It’s a long story, and frankly, not a terribly interesting one. Do we have to discuss family history?
DOCTOR: No, we absolutely don’t have to, if you’d prefer not to. Though it can sometimes be helpful. Let's skip that for now then. How about this: are there any medical conditions you have been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Treated for? Goodness. At my age, one accumulates things. Honestly, I can’t recall specifics. A touch of…arthritis, perhaps? And my vision isn’t what it once was, naturally. But nothing…serious. I've always been quite robust, you see. I doubt any doctor before me had much to do beyond a yearly check-up.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and some changes in your vision. That’s good to know. And you said “accumulates things.” Is there anything else you remember—even if it feels minor—that we should note down?
PATIENT: Minor… Well, there was that incident with the shingles, years ago. Dreadful rash. Harold fussed terribly. But it cleared up, didn’t it? I haven’t thought about it in… decades. Really, I’m not a frequent visitor to doctors’ offices. It's a waste of perfectly good time.
DOCTOR: Shingles, okay. Good to know you had that. It's important to note for potential nerve-related issues later on. And you're right, time is valuable. Let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, a little something for my joints, when they act up. Harold manages all of that, you see. He has a system. I couldn’t possibly tell you the name. Some little white pill, I believe. And perhaps an eye drop…for the dryness. Honestly, I leave all the specifics to him. It's much easier that way.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We can often get a list from your pharmacy with Harold’s permission. Let’s see... any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens, no. I've eaten everything, travelled everywhere. A little shellfish gave me a touch of indigestion once, but that was years ago and I suspect it was simply…bad shellfish. I'm not a delicate flower, doctor. I have a very strong constitution. Allergies are for…others.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! Alright, no known allergies. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a general overview. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Must we? Really, I’m quite sure it's unnecessary. But…very well. Get it over with, I suppose. But please, be quick about it. I have…commitments. And do try not to poke and prod too much.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: There. Done. Is that sufficient? Honestly, I find these things rather…invasive. I’ve always preferred a good book to a doctor’s examination. Are you quite finished?
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, although I do detect a very slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning, but we’ll make a note of it. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you extend your arm, please?
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss…My husband always said I was a perfectly healthy specimen. He’ll be furious if you tell him otherwise. Do hurry along. I have…commitments, you know. And I’m not particularly fond of waiting rooms. They’re dreadfully depressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 145/88 and your pulse is 72, regular. A bit elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now I'm just going to quickly check your reflexes... and listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Lie back? Really. It's rather undignified, isn't it? But... very well. Just please be expeditious. This is all rather… unnecessary, in my opinion. My husband will hear about this, you know. He always insists on knowing everything. And he's quite a…demanding man. Do try not to poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, listening to your abdomen now. Sounds normal. No unusual noises. A little tenderness in the lower right quadrant when I press... but nothing dramatic. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function – just a quick balance and coordination test. Could you please sit up, and then stand?
PATIENT: Balance and coordination, you say? Really, doctor. I’ve managed perfectly well for seventy-nine years, thank you very much. And I assure you, I haven't fallen. At least, not recently. This is all rather…degrading, in my opinion. My husband will hear about this. He always insists on knowing everything. Hurry along, please. I have…commitments. And a perfectly good book waiting for me.
DOCTOR: I see. You do seem a little unsteady on your feet. Nothing too concerning, but we'll note that as well. Okay, that’s the quick physical exam done. Thank you for your patience. Now, to get a better picture, I’d like to order a few routine blood tests – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. Also, a urinalysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Urinalysis? Really, doctor, this is becoming quite excessive. My husband will insist on knowing the results, and he’ll spend weeks worrying. Honestly, I'm perfectly capable of managing my own health. But... very well. If it must be done, it must be done. But please, tell me it won’t take too long. I have…commitments, you know. And I’m not particularly fond of needles. Just get it over with quickly, please. And ensure the results are sent to Harold promptly. He’s quite insistent on being informed of everything. Stop.
