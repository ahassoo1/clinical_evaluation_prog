DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bigger. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Doctor, you say? Yes, yes. My son, he make appointment for me. Something about… the mine. He worry too much, that boy. I feel fine, you hear? Fine! Been working in that hole longer than you been alive, I reckon. But he say I need check-up. Something about… bad air. He always been a worrywart.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good of your son to be proactive about your health, even if you feel well. “Bad air” could mean a few different things, and it’s always best to rule things out. So, just to be clear, you’ve been working in a mine for a long time?
PATIENT: Long time? You have no idea! Since before… well, a long time ago. Underground. Digging things out of the earth. Heavy work, you know? Machines and… dust. Lots of dust. Always dust. But I wore a mask. Most times. Not always perfect, mind you. Sometimes it get in the way. But I still get the job done. Always have.
DOCTOR: I see. That is a long time, and it sounds like physically demanding work. The dust is definitely something we need to discuss. Have you noticed any changes in your breathing since working in the mine?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I breathe! People breathe, Doctor. Always have. Sometimes a little… cough. Old man cough, you know? But that’s just… old age. I’m eighty-six years old! You expect me to breathe like a young boy? Nonsense. No, no changes. Just… tired sometimes. Heavy work, remember?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, a little tiredness is expected at eighty-six, especially with heavy work. But just to be sure, could you tell me a bit more about this cough?
PATIENT: Eh? What more you want to know about cough? I cough! When I have something stuck in my throat. Or when dust get to me. Like I say, lots of dust in that mine. It’s a dry cough mostly. Not much… phlegm. Just… hack, hack. Gets better when I drink water. Old man cough. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough that improves with water. That's helpful to know. Now, besides the cough and tiredness, have you noticed anything else different lately?
PATIENT: Different? Let me think… My knees ache, sometimes. Getting up from the chair is… a process. But that's just old age, like I said. And… I forget things. Small things. Where I put my spectacles. What I had for breakfast. But who doesn’t forget things at my age? My son say I repeat myself sometimes. He get annoyed with me. But he always was a bit… impatient.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those things can be common with age. Just to get a better picture of your overall health, I’m going to ask you a few questions about different parts of your body. It’s a standard part of a check-up. First, how about your heart?
PATIENT: My heart? It's still beating, you see! Been beating for eighty-six years! Sometimes it… flutters a little. Like a bird in a cage. But it always settles down. No pain, no… big trouble. Just flutters. Like I say, old age. Everything gets a little… shaky when you get old.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Palpitations, or feeling like your heart is fluttering, can happen. Do you notice if anything specific seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Trigger? No! Just… happen. Sometimes when I climb the stairs. Sometimes when I get excited. Like when my grandchildren visit. They’re wild ones, those children. Run around like… like little monkeys! Gets my heart going, you see? No rhyme or reason. Just… happens.
DOCTOR: I see. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about your lungs. Do you experience any shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Not really. I get a little… winded when I climb the stairs, but that's just… old age! I told you! And… no, no wheezing. Never wheeze. And chest pain? No. Sometimes a little… ache in my back, but that's from the heavy work. Lifting things. Old injuries. Not my chest. My chest is fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No wheezing or chest pain. Let’s move on to your stomach and bowels. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, any stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Eh? My belly? I eat! I like to eat. My son try to put me on a diet, but I tell him, “No! I need my strength!” Sometimes a little… heartburn. Spicy food, you know? But that’s just… spicy food! No pain, no… throwing up. And… my bowels? They work. Sometimes a little… slow. Old age! Everything slow down.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let’s talk about your brain and nerves. Have you noticed any headaches, dizziness, weakness, numbness, or changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Eh? My head? Sometimes a little… fuzzy. Like when I wake up. But that’s just… old age! And… no dizziness. I don’t fall over or anything. Weakness? My legs get tired sometimes. But that’s… you know. And… no numbness. My hands work fine. I can still hold a cup of tea. And… my vision? A little blurry. But I have spectacles! And my hearing? A little… faded. But everyone talks too quietly these days!
DOCTOR: Okay. That's helpful. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Eh? Let me think… The doctor, long ago, he say my pressure was a little… high. Gave me some pills. I took them for a while. Then I ran out. Didn’t seem to make much difference, so I stopped. And… no, no diabetes. Never had that. And… no heart problems. Like I said, my heart still beating! Mostly fine. I had malaria, many years ago. Very sick. But I got better.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. History of hypertension, malaria. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Eh? Surgeries? Let me think… Long time ago, when I was a young man, I had my appendix out. Very sick. But I got better. And… no, no other surgeries. Never needed them. I am a strong man! Mostly. I broke my arm once, falling from a tree. But it healed. No hospital, no surgery. Just a bandage. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Appendectomy, fractured arm. Now, do you know of any serious medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or dementia?
PATIENT: Eh? My family? Let me think… My father, he died old. Very old. But I don’t know what he died from. My mother, she died from… something. I was a young boy. My sister, she had… troubles with her stomach. But I don’t know what kind of troubles. Mostly, they just… died old. Not much… fancy sickness in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Limited family medical history. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I live! I wake up, I eat, I sleep. I drink tea. I visit my grandchildren. I used to work in the mine, like I said. Now I mostly… sit. Watch television. My son says I watch too much television. He says it’s bad for my brain. But what else I going to do?
DOCTOR: I see. And have you ever smoked cigarettes or used any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: Eh? Smoke? No! Never smoked in my life! Bad for you, you see? My father, he smoked. Terrible cough he had. No, no smoke for me. Always been a healthy man, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Eh? Drink? Sometimes. A little beer. On a special occasion. Like when my grandchildren visit. Or when there’s a party. But not much. I don’t need it. Mostly. My son says I drink too much. He worries too much, that boy. But I just… enjoy a little beer sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Eh? Allergies? No, no allergies. I eat everything. I never had a problem. Sometimes my skin get a little itchy. But that's just… old age! And… no, no allergies. And… I take some pills for my waterworks. The doctor gave them to me. But I forget the name. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No allergies. And you take medication for your prostate. We can discuss that further. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if that's alright. It will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Eh? Exam? You want to poke and prod? Well… alright. I suppose. But be gentle! Old man, you see. Everything a little… fragile. And don’t take too long. I have a television program to watch later. But go ahead. Be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Your heart sounds a bit strong, but there are no murmurs that I can hear. Your lungs sound clear, but I do notice that you have some decreased air movement in the lower lobes. Blood pressure is 148/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but overall strength is good. Coordination is slightly impaired. Finally, I palpate his abdomen, noting any tenderness or masses. </stage> Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I do feel a slightly enlarged prostate. Everything seems okay, but I do notice a few things that we may want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Eh? Investigate? What you mean? You poking around and now you find trouble? I told you! Old age! Everything getting old and… loose. Enlarged what? My prostate? What’s wrong with my prostate? I feel fine! Mostly.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “trouble,” Mr. Bigger. An enlarged prostate is very common as men get older. It can sometimes cause urinary symptoms, like difficulty starting or stopping urination, or needing to go frequently. It doesn't always cause symptoms though. Given your age, the decreased air movement in your lungs, and the enlarged prostate, I recommend a few tests to get a better picture of what’s going on. Would you be willing to get a chest x-ray, a urine test, and a blood test to check your prostate-specific antigen level?
PATIENT: Eh? X-ray? Urine test? Blood test? You want to take all my blood? And… what’s this… PSA? Sounds… fancy. And expensive! I don’t need all these tests! I feel fine, mostly. Is this because I watch too much television? My son say it’s bad for my brain. But what else I going to do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bigger. It’s not because you watch television. These tests are simply to help us understand what might be causing any changes you've experienced, and to rule out anything serious. The chest x-ray will help us see your lungs more clearly. The urine test checks for infection. And the PSA test is a blood test that can help us screen for prostate cancer, which is more common as men get older. The tests aren't overly expensive, and are usually covered by insurance. They are relatively quick and painless. Would you be open to discussing them further with your son?
PATIENT: Eh? Cancer? You think I have… cancer? No! I don’t want to hear about cancer! I’m an old man! I’ve lived a good life. I don’t need… poking and prodding and tests for… cancer. No, no tests. Tell my son whatever you want. I’m not doing any tests. I just want to go home and watch my television program. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. Your health is your decision, and I respect your choice. I won't pressure you into any tests you don't want. However, I am concerned about the decreased air movement in your lungs and the enlarged prostate. Even without tests, we can discuss some strategies to manage those things. For example, avoiding smoking, staying hydrated, and practicing good bladder habits can help. I will document your concerns and explain my findings to your son. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Eh? No questions. Just… go home. And watch television. That’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You were… gentle. Mostly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bigger. I’m glad I could help, even if it was just to listen to your concerns. Please, take care of yourself. If you experience any changes in your health, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Here’s a card with our number. Have a good day, and enjoy your television program.
