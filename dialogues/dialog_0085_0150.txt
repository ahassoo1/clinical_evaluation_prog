DOCTOR: Good morning, Angelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I'm 51. And I want to… have a baby. Without any… complications. Is that possible? I don’t have time for a lot of trouble, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable goal, Angelle. It’s good you’re thinking ahead and planning. Having a baby at 51 is certainly possible, though there are some things we’ll want to discuss to minimize risks and maximize your chances of a healthy pregnancy. To start, have you been trying to conceive already?
PATIENT: Trying? No. I haven’t been trying. I just… decided. And now I’m here to make it happen. I don’t believe in wasting time with… preliminaries. I need to know what needs to be done, not how long it’s been since my last… whatever it is people talk about.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to be efficient, Angelle. And we can definitely focus on a plan of action. However, a little background information is still helpful to ensure we're taking the safest and most appropriate approach for you. Before we discuss options, could you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Fine. What do you want to know? I don't get sick. I eat reasonably. I’m… tall. And I used to be very active, though that was a while ago. I fix bicycles. It's physical enough, alright? What else is important? Honestly, doctors always ask endless questions. It's terribly inefficient.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Angelle. Knowing you’re generally healthy and active is a good starting point. "Reasonably" is helpful – could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Look, I have coffee. Sometimes toast. Lunch is usually… a sandwich, or leftovers. Dinner… depends. I don’t sit around cataloging every single thing I ingest. It’s food! I don't have a laboratory in my kitchen. Is this really necessary? This isn’t a gourmet cooking show.
DOCTOR: You're right, it doesn’t need to be a precise inventory. Just getting a general sense helps. And you’re correct, it’s not about judgment, just information. Okay. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past – anything you’ve been treated for, surgeries, or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Divorced. Does that count as a medical condition? No, nothing serious. I broke my wrist once, falling off a… never mind. It was years ago. Perfectly healed. A little arthritis, perhaps, in my hands from the bicycle work. That’s all. Really. Don’t make me list every minor ache and pain. I need this done, not a life history project.
DOCTOR: Okay, a healed wrist and some hand arthritis – good to know. And no, divorce doesn’t count as a medical condition. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… coffee. And sometimes ibuprofen for the arthritis. That's it. Don’t bother writing that down. Everyone takes ibuprofen. Is this going anywhere? I have appointments, you know. I didn’t plan to spend the entire day dissecting my daily habits.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Angelle. We are getting somewhere. I just want to be thorough. Ibuprofen is good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. My mother had… high blood pressure. And my aunt, on my father’s side, had something… with her stomach. Cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago. Frankly, I don't keep tabs on the medical misfortunes of distant relatives. It's rather depressing, don't you think? I'm a healthy woman. I don’t need a litany of family illnesses weighing me down.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Angelle. Knowing about a family history of high blood pressure and a possible stomach cancer is helpful, though. Now, before we discuss potential options, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Do you think I look like someone who would smoke? Honestly, the questions! It’s insulting. I fix bicycles, not… whatever it is people who smoke do. Next question, please. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt insulting, Angelle. I assure you, I didn't mean to offend. Okay. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. I don't get falling-down drunk, if that's what you're implying. It's… relaxing. Is this a moral inquisition now? I came here to have a baby, not be interrogated about my social life.
DOCTOR: I understand, Angelle. We are getting closer to understanding your overall health. To be thorough, have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Yes. Once. A long time ago. It didn't… work out. And frankly, I don’t want to relive the details. It was a difficult time. Let’s just say it wasn’t a positive experience. And that is all I’m going to say about it. Now can we please move on to what can be done?
DOCTOR: I understand, Angelle. You don’t have to share anything you’re not comfortable with. Knowing you've been pregnant before is helpful. Given your age and previous pregnancy, we’ll want to run some tests to assess your current health and fertility. Would you be willing to do some bloodwork to check your hormone levels, a complete metabolic panel, and a blood count?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever tests are absolutely necessary. But I want a clear explanation of what each one is for, and what the results mean. No medical jargon, please. And I want it done as quickly as possible. I haven’t got all day. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Of course, Angelle. I will explain everything in plain language. First, we’ll need a blood sample. The bloodwork will give us a baseline of your overall health, including your hormone levels, which are crucial for a successful pregnancy. We’ll also check your blood count to make sure you’re not anemic, and your metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Then, I’d like to do a pelvic exam to check the health of your reproductive organs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Absolutely not. I do not want anyone poking around down there. I'm here to discuss having a baby, not to be subjected to… that. Is there absolutely no way around it? Honestly, this is becoming increasingly unpleasant. Can’t we just take some pills or something? I don’t understand why this is necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Angelle. A pelvic exam allows me to assess the health of your uterus and ovaries, and to check for any potential issues that could affect your ability to conceive. However, we can start with the bloodwork. If the bloodwork shows any concerns, or if you experience any difficulties conceiving, then we can discuss the possibility of further testing, including a pelvic exam or an ultrasound. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Bloodwork first. But if anything is abnormal, I want a very clear explanation of what it means, and what the options are. No vague medical terms, no beating around the bush. And I want everything done as efficiently as possible. Honestly, this whole process is rather… cumbersome. Let’s get it over with. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I completely understand. I will explain everything clearly, and we'll proceed as efficiently as possible. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. The phlebotomist will draw your blood. It will take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I will give you a list of things you can do to prepare your body for pregnancy – things like taking a prenatal vitamin, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding alcohol and smoking. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, vitamins, healthy diet… I've heard it all before. Just get me the list. And please, no lectures. I’m a capable woman. I’ll manage. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have appointments. Where is this lab? And make it quick, please. I don’t have all day. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Angelle. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. The phlebotomist is expecting you. Here’s the handout with information about prenatal vitamins and healthy lifestyle choices. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. Have a good day, Angelle.
