DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful tiredness. Comes on suddenly, you see. And… and the young man at the lab said something about my… my numbers being off. Something about muscles? Honestly, I don't keep up with all that nonsense. It’s just… exhausting, the whole thing.
DOCTOR: "Numbers being off," you say. Right. And this tiredness… sudden onset, you mentioned. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Oh, dear. Well, I'll be doing something perfectly normal. Washing dishes, maybe. Or weeding the garden – though I don’t do much of that anymore, back’s not what it used to be. And then, poof. Just… completely wiped. Like someone pulled the plug. I have to sit down, right then and there. It doesn’t last forever, mind you. Just… a good while. Several hours, sometimes. And it’s… inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Several hours, you say. And this happens with minimal exertion?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Minimal! I’m not climbing mountains, Doctor. I’m a sensible woman. It’s not like I’m… well, some of these young people today, always rushing around. No, just normal things. Everyday things. It used to be just after a particularly long… well, I used to do a lot of diving, you see. But that was years ago. Now it just happens… randomly. And it's quite bothersome, thank you very much. It makes me feel… useless.
DOCTOR: Diving?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Commercial diving. My husband and I, we did it for… well, a long time. Before all this… tiredness, of course. It was a good life, hard work, but good. Not for the faint of heart, mind you. All sorts of things down there. Pipelines, mostly. And salvage. Though I don’t rightly remember all the details anymore. It was a long time ago, and frankly, it’s not something I dwell on. It's just... I don’t understand why I’m so tired now. It makes no sense. A good strong life, and now this.
DOCTOR: And you said the lab mentioned something about your “numbers”?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The young man. He kept talking about creatine… something. And my muscles. Said they were… damaged, or something along those lines. Honestly, Doctor, I didn’t catch half of it. All those medical terms. I just nodded and smiled. I told him I trust you to sort it out. I don’t have the patience for all that technical jargon. It’s all very well for you, but for a sensible woman like myself... it's just bewildering. Honestly, it’s probably just old age. Though I hate to admit it.
DOCTOR: Creatine kinase, likely. It's a muscle enzyme. Now, have you experienced any muscle pain along with this fatigue?
PATIENT: Muscle pain… hmm. Not exactly pain, Doctor. More like… achey. A general achey feeling. Especially in my legs, I think. And sometimes my arms. But it's not a sharp pain, you understand. It's more… uncomfortable. Like after a long journey, maybe. Or a hard day’s work. Though, as I said, I haven’t done much work lately. It's hard to say, really. Perhaps it’s just growing old. My husband always said I was too sensitive. Maybe I just notice things more.
DOCTOR: And you mentioned your husband?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Arthur. We… well, we did everything together. Diving, mostly. He was the strong one, really. I was the brains of the operation, naturally. He passed… oh, it must be fifteen years now? More than that, perhaps. Time slips away, you see. A good man. A very good man. He would have known what to make of all this tiredness. He always had a sensible head on his shoulders. And he wouldn't have put up with all these… numbers and enzymes. He’d have wanted a straight answer.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get a basic physical exam done. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we’ll rule out the obvious. Please lie back on the examination table. And try to relax. Though I suspect that may be difficult.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A physical exam. Very well. Though I don't see what poking and prodding will accomplish, frankly. But if you think it's necessary… Just be gentle, dear. My joints aren’t what they used to be. And don’t expect me to be flexible. I haven’t been underwater in years.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no organomegaly. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Strength is 4/5 bilaterally. Now, your muscle strength is slightly diminished, but not significantly. Your reflexes are normal. It’s likely just age-related weakness. However… given your fatigue and slightly elevated creatine kinase levels, we need to rule out a few possibilities.
PATIENT: Possibilities? Oh, dear. What sort of possibilities? Don't tell me it's something dreadful. I haven't the energy for dreadful. Is it catching? I don't do well with illnesses. Arthur always took care of things like that. Is it… is it expensive to fix? I'm on a fixed income, you see. And Medicare doesn’t cover everything, or so I’ve heard. Honestly, Doctor, you're starting to worry me. Just tell me straight. What’s wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Now, now, Ms. Oitker, let’s not jump to conclusions. The most likely explanation is simply deconditioning. You haven't been active recently, and your muscles have weakened as a result. However, given your history of commercial diving, we need to rule out a rare possibility: chronic exposure to toxins or… a subtle muscle disorder. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. I’ll also refer you to a neurologist for an electromyography, or EMG, to assess your muscle function. It’s a simple test, though it can be slightly uncomfortable. As for your concerns about cost… Medicare should cover most of these tests, but it’s best to verify with your insurance provider. Let’s not dwell on the worst-case scenarios. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. Let me think. I don’t think so. Arthur always handled the medications. He was very careful about those things. I remember once, years ago, I had a bit of a rash after eating some shellfish, but that was a long time ago. It wasn’t serious, just a bit itchy. And I don't eat much shellfish these days. It's expensive, you see. But I can’t be certain. Honestly, Doctor, I have a terrible memory for such things. Is this important? Will it affect the tests? I just want to get this sorted, and get back to my garden. Though I’m not sure I have the energy for gardening at the moment. It's all very… upsetting.
DOCTOR: A mild shellfish allergy is unlikely to interfere with these tests. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just the one. For my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. A small white pill. I take it every morning. Arthur used to make sure I didn’t forget. And… sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take ibuprofen. But not regularly, mind you. Just when it’s particularly bad. And I take a multivitamin, of course. Everyone should take a multivitamin. But that’s hardly a medication, is it? Honestly, Doctor, I'm hardly a complicated case. Just a tired old woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. I’ve documented your medications. We’ll proceed with the blood work and the neurology referral. The lab orders are being sent electronically to the facility on Elm Street. They should contact you to schedule an appointment. The neurologist’s office number is also being sent to you. I advise you to follow up with the neurologist as soon as possible. And I suggest you avoid strenuous activity until we have a better understanding of your condition. Now, do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: Questions? Well… how long will this all take? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks and weeks. And… will these tests be painful? I don’t have a high tolerance for pain, you see. Arthur always said I was a bit of a wimp. And… Will this… will this make me any better? I just want to feel like myself again. Before all this… tiredness. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Something simple? Besides resting? Because frankly, resting is rather boring.
DOCTOR: The blood work should be completed within a week. The neurology appointment… well, those can take some time to schedule, but I’ll send a referral with a notation of urgency. The EMG, while mildly uncomfortable, is generally well-tolerated. As for what you can do in the meantime… Gentle stretching, perhaps. And stay hydrated. Beyond that, I recommend avoiding any activities that exacerbate your fatigue. As for feeling better… well, that depends on the results of the tests. I assure you, we’re doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Now, here are the paperwork with your lab orders and referral information. If you have any concerns, you can contact the clinic’s nursing line. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Though I still don't understand why I'm so tired. It doesn't make any sense. A good life, hard work, and now… this. Well, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. Though I'm not terribly optimistic. Arthur always said doctors don't really know much. But I suppose it's worth a try.
DOCTOR: Very well. Get well soon, Ms. Oitker. .
