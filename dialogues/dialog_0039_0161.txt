DOCTOR: Hello, Helaina. Welcome. It's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest, a friend of mine suggested I come talk to you about… about something to help prevent HIV. She said it’s a preventative pill, and I figured it couldn’t hurt to learn more. I don’t have a lot of details, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Helaina. It sounds like you’re asking about PrEP – Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. It's a very good question to ask and a smart thing to be proactive about. It is a preventative pill, you're right. Before we talk more about that, though, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Sure. Overall… I think I’m okay. I work as a parking attendant, so I’m on my feet a lot, which is good. I try to eat healthy, mostly. I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups, but honestly, they don’t ask much about… this sort of thing. I’m single, never married, and I don’t really… well, I don’t have a steady partner. Does that make sense? I just want to be careful, you know?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Helaina, and it's very responsible of you to think about this. It's good you're looking after your health. Knowing a little more about your medical history would be helpful. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times, actually. My doctor made me get tested when I first started with Medicare, just as a baseline, I guess. And then… maybe once or twice after that, just during routine checkups. Everything always came back negative. I remember distinctly because the nurse was very nice each time, and she explained everything clearly. I don’t recall the exact dates, though, sorry. It’s been a few years, though. Definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Let me just see if I can find those records here… Ah, yes, I see a few HIV tests listed from 2022 and 2023, all negative. That’s helpful. Now, aside from those tests, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, climbing a tree – silly, I know. Had a cast on for a while, but that was it. And I get the usual colds and flu every now and then, but nothing major. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, all things considered. I’ve always been careful about… germs and stuff. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Helaina. And being careful is always a good thing. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. Oh! And I use a cream for my hands, because my job makes them really dry. It’s just a regular lotion, though, nothing prescribed by a doctor. Just Eucerin, I think it’s called. I don’t take anything regularly, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And no allergies to medications that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to worry about bee stings, because my grandmother was allergic, but I’ve never been stung, so I haven’t had to find out. So, no, I don't have any medication allergies. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Helaina. Just making sure we cover all the bases. Now, before we talk specifically about PrEP, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Social history… what do you mean by that exactly? I’m not sure I understand. Is that… about my personal life? I just want to be clear about what you’re asking. I'm happy to answer, but I'm a bit private, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand completely. I apologize if that term is a little vague. By social history, I simply mean things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. And, as you suspected, it can also include questions about sexual activity, but only to the extent that it’s relevant to your health and to considering whether PrEP might be a good fit for you. You only need to share what you’re comfortable with, and we can skip anything you’d rather not discuss. It’s all confidential, of course.
PATIENT: Okay. That makes more sense. Well, I don’t smoke, never have. And I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a year. And definitely no recreational drugs. As for… the other part… I haven’t had a sexual partner in a long time. It’s not something I’ve been actively involved in, and honestly, when I do meet someone, I'm very cautious. I always use protection, if anything happens, but… it’s just not a regular thing. Does that answer your question? I feel a little silly talking about this.
DOCTOR: No, you shouldn't feel silly at all, Helaina. It's good you're being honest with me. And that information is helpful. It sounds like you are being very responsible with your health. Now, given your history, PrEP could be an option to consider. It’s a daily pill that can significantly reduce your risk of contracting HIV. It's very effective, but it's not a perfect solution, and it does require regular checkups and testing to make sure it’s working properly and doesn’t have any side effects. Before we decide if it's right for you, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and run a few blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it could help, I’m willing to do whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to be as safe as possible. A physical exam and blood tests are fine. When can we do that? I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: You're not taking up any time at all, Helaina. It’s my job to make sure we explore all options. Let’s go ahead and do the physical exam now. It will just be a routine check of your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Then we'll do a blood draw for HIV testing, kidney function, and a few other basic tests. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Just let me know what I need to do. I’m ready when you are. And… thank you, Doctor. For being so understanding. It’s a little nerve-wracking talking about all this, but you’ve made me feel much more comfortable.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. It's perfectly normal to feel a little nervous, and I'm glad I could help. We’ll take things at your pace. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit here on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here we go.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80 – that’s a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. We can keep an eye on it. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes and look in your ears and throat. It’s just a quick routine exam.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if anything feels… strange. I'm a little ticklish, just a warning.
DOCTOR: Noted about the ticklishness! Ears look clear, and your throat is normal. Everything looks good physically. Now, we’ll just need to do a quick blood draw. We'll send those off to the lab and should have the results in a few days. Do you have any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. No latex allergies. I've had blood work done before, so I know what to expect. Just let me know when you're ready. I’m a little afraid of needles, to be honest, but I’ll try to be brave.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Helaina. It will be quick, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. Just look away if you prefer. Okay, all done! Just keep pressure on that for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. And we’ll have those results back to you as soon as possible. You can head to the front desk, and they’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you, Doctor. You were very kind and patient. I feel much better now, knowing we’re getting everything checked out. I’ll go to the front desk and schedule a follow-up. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Take care! .
