DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot... it’s been bothering me. A sore, you see. A bad sore that won’t go away. It hurts to walk, even with slippers.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s making it difficult to walk, even with slippers. I understand. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It started small, like a little cut, maybe from a stone in my shoe. But it just got bigger and red. Now it’s… well, it’s open. And it sometimes smells a little. I try to keep it clean with soap and water, but it doesn’t seem to help much. I also have the… the sugar sickness, you know? The doctor told me years ago. Does that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you for telling me all of that. It sounds like it started as a small wound and has unfortunately worsened. And yes, the “sugar sickness,” or diabetes as we call it, can absolutely play a role in how wounds heal. It can sometimes make it harder for them to get better and increases the risk of infection. So, to clarify, it’s on the bottom of your foot, near the toes, it’s open, and you’ve noticed some odor. And you have a history of diabetes. How long ago were you diagnosed with diabetes, and are you currently taking any medications for it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time ago, Doctor. Maybe… thirty years? More? I went to a different doctor then, on the other side of the island. He gave me pills, but… well, I stopped taking them after a while. They made me feel… not good. I just try to eat healthy now, mostly fish and poi. I don’t take anything for it now. Is that… bad? I should have told my other doctor I stopped, but… he moved away.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being honest with me, Mr. Stoegbauer. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Stopping your medication without talking to a doctor is something we need to address, as uncontrolled diabetes can definitely contribute to slower healing and increased risk of complications with wounds like this one. We can discuss getting that managed again later. Right now, let’s focus on your foot. When did you first notice the sore becoming open and smelly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The smell… maybe a week ago? No, maybe a little longer. Maybe ten days? It was getting redder and redder, and then I noticed the smell after I took my slippers off one night. That’s when I knew I needed to see someone. It wasn't a strong smell at first, just… noticeable. Now it’s… stronger, I suppose. I've been trying to put a clean cloth over it, but it doesn’t help much. It still hurts to put my weight on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the smell has been present for roughly ten days and is getting more noticeable, and it’s painful to put weight on it. I appreciate you sharing that detail. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or redness spreading up your leg from the foot?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I feel warm sometimes, but that’s just the weather, you know? It’s always warm here. And no chills. The redness… well, it’s all on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It hasn’t gone up my leg. I’ve been looking at it every day, and it’s stayed right there. I worry about it getting worse, that’s why I came.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear that the redness hasn’t spread. Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer, I'd like to take a look at the foot now, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll need to examine it to get a better understanding of what we’re dealing with. Could you please remove your slipper and sock for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. I understand. There. Be careful, it might hurt a little. It’s tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the wound. It’s located on the plantar surface of your foot, near the metatarsal heads. It's approximately 2 centimeters in diameter, and there is some surrounding redness and swelling. There's some exposed tissue, and I do see some pus. Based on what I see, it appears you have a developing foot ulcer, and it does show signs of infection. The exposed tissue and pus are concerning, especially given your history of diabetes. We need to address this promptly to prevent it from getting worse. I'm going to order a culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. I’ll also check your blood sugar levels to get a better baseline. It is important to control your blood sugar. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good. An infection… I was afraid of that. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, Doctor. Not that I know of. I haven’t taken antibiotics in… a long time. Maybe twenty years? I used to get sick a lot as a boy, but I haven’t had much trouble lately. Just this foot, now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, that’s good. It’s helpful to know you haven't taken antibiotics recently. To get a better understanding of the overall situation, and to help rule out any deeper infection, I'd like to order an X-ray of your foot. This will help us see if the infection has affected the bone. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. If it will help, do it. I don’t mind. I just want this foot to get better. It’s been troubling me for too long. Where will we do it? And will it take long? I have a potluck to go to later this afternoon. My friend, Leilani, she makes a wonderful kalua pig.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The X-ray will give us a clearer picture. We have an X-ray machine right here in the clinic. It will only take a few minutes, and then the technician will get the images to me. It shouldn’t interfere with your potluck, but we’ll need about 30 minutes total, including the prep and review of the images. While we’re waiting for the X-ray results, let’s discuss a plan to address the infection. Given your history of diabetes, it’s important to be aggressive with treatment. I’m going to prescribe an oral antibiotic to start. It’s very important that you finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Finish all the pills, even if I feel better. I’ll remember that. What kind of pills are they? And will they make me feel sick? I worry about feeling bad, you know. I like to feel strong. And will they interact with anything? I sometimes have a little poi with my fish.
DOCTOR: That's a good question to ask. I’m prescribing Amoxicillin-Clavulanate, it’s a common antibiotic used to treat skin infections. Some people experience mild side effects, such as nausea or diarrhea, but these are usually temporary. If you experience any severe side effects, like difficulty breathing or a rash, please contact me immediately. As for interactions with poi, there are no known interactions between Amoxicillin-Clavulanate and poi. You should be able to continue enjoying your meals as usual. It’s always a good idea to stay hydrated while taking antibiotics, so make sure to drink plenty of water. Let's get that X-ray done. I’ll explain everything in more detail once we have the results.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your kindness. Let’s get the X-ray done, and then we can talk more. I trust your judgement. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Great. The technician, Kai, is ready for us. He will position your foot and take the images. It won't take long at all. I'll be right outside when you're finished. Just let me know if you need anything.
PATIENT: .
