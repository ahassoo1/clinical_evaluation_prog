DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I’m Dr. Jami Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's my legs, you see. Just…weakness. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a terrible cold. Not just a sniffle, mind you, a proper cold with everything. Now my legs feel like jelly sometimes, especially when I try to stand up. It’s quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: "A proper cold," you say. Right. And this weakness… is it in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Definitely both. It's not like one is completely gone, but they both just…give way a little. It’s worse in the mornings, I’ve noticed. Makes getting out of bed a real chore. You wouldn’t understand, I suppose, unless you’ve had to deal with a proper cold yourself.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Firestone, I understand the concept of weakness. And while the severity of a cold is…subjective, let's focus on the legs. You said it's worse in the mornings. Any pain associated with this weakness?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not exactly pain. It's more…a heavy feeling. Like I've been running a marathon and haven't had a proper rest. And it’s not constant, you see. It comes and goes. It’s just…disconcerting, really. I’m a tour guide, Doctor. I need to be able to walk. It’s a bit of a problem, wouldn’t you say?
DOCTOR: A tour guide…yes, I suppose that does present a challenge. And this feeling of heaviness – does anything relieve it?
PATIENT: Well, sitting does, naturally. And if I just…wait a bit, it seems to ease up. It’s not a cure, mind you, just temporary. I tried one of those heating pads, you know, the ones you plug in? Didn't do a thing, honestly. Waste of electricity, if you ask me. It’s just… frustrating. People expect a certain level of energy from a tour guide, and I’m not sure I’m delivering right now.
DOCTOR: Right. So, weakness in both legs, worse in the mornings, relieved by sitting, no relief with a heating pad… Have you experienced anything like this before, Ms. Firestone?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this, anyway. I've had the usual aches and pains, you know, getting older and all that. But this is… different. It’s not a muscle ache, it’s more…deep. And it came on so suddenly, right after the cold. It’s quite worrying, honestly. I don’t usually bother doctors with minor things, but this isn’t minor. I have tours booked for the next month! I can't just cancel everything.
DOCTOR: I see. And regarding that cold, did you have any fever, cough, or other symptoms beyond the usual?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A proper fever, Doctor, for a couple of days. A terrible cough, kept me up all night. Stuffy nose, sore throat, the whole nine yards. I took some over-the-counter medication, of course. Those decongestants, and some cough syrup. Didn’t seem to do much good, really. It just…ran its course. I thought I was getting better, and then this started. It’s all rather inconvenient, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any other medications regularly, Ms. Firestone?
PATIENT: Just the usual, Doctor. A little something for my blood pressure, nothing dramatic. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it last winter. I’m usually quite healthy, you know. I eat well, I try to get some exercise when I can… well, when my tours aren’t keeping me busy, naturally. I don't go around complaining about every little ache and pain, you know. It’s a waste of everyone’s time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll need you to sit on the examination table. We’ll check your reflexes, strength, and a few other things. Just so we have a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. I suppose that’s… necessary. Though I must say, I'm not one for being poked and prodded. But if you insist. Just try to be quick about it, Doctor. I have things to do, you know. Tours to plan.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I’m going to tap on a few spots here and there. Knee reflexes are…present, though a little diminished. Ankle reflexes are also present, but somewhat weak. Now, can you please try to push your feet against my hands?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s…unpleasant. Very well. There. Is that enough? It feels…difficult. It requires more effort than it should, I think. It's not as strong as it used to be, that much I can tell you. Honestly, I’m starting to worry this is something serious. I’d be terribly upset if I had to cancel my tours.
DOCTOR: Strength is…reduced bilaterally, as expected. Now, can you please try to stand up?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is…difficult. There. See? It’s not as easy as it used to be. It feels… unsteady. And my legs feel… weak. Perhaps you should just write me a prescription for something and be done with it. I really don’t have time for extensive testing. Honestly, I’m quite sure it’s just a lingering effect from the cold.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, while I appreciate your…optimism, your symptoms – the weakness, diminished reflexes, difficulty standing – are concerning. It’s not simply a lingering effect from a cold. We need to rule out some other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, and kidney function. And I also recommend an MRI of your lumbar spine to assess for any nerve compression.
PATIENT: An MRI? Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds… excessive. I told you, it’s just a cold! I’m a busy woman, I don’t have time to spend all day in a hospital getting poked and prodded and scanned. And an MRI… that’s quite expensive, isn’t it? Medicare will probably give me a hard time. I think you're overreacting, quite frankly. Perhaps a different doctor might offer a simpler solution?
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your concerns about time and expense. However, dismissing these symptoms without investigation would be irresponsible. I have a duty to ensure you receive the appropriate care, and that includes ruling out potentially serious conditions like nerve damage or spinal cord compression. These tests are necessary to provide an accurate diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. If the results are normal, then we can revisit your initial assessment. But without them, we’re simply guessing. I strongly advise you to proceed with the blood work and MRI. I can provide a referral to a reputable imaging center and assist with any insurance pre-authorization.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Fine. But if it turns out to be nothing, you are going to hear about it. And I expect you to expedite this process. I have tours booked, you know. I can’t just sit around waiting for test results. And if Medicare gives me any trouble, you will be dealing with it. Get the referral. And the pre-authorization. And make it quick. I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. I am generating a referral for an MRI at Coastal Imaging. I will also submit a pre-authorization request to Medicare. The imaging center will contact you directly to schedule the appointment. In the meantime, I will order the blood work. You can go to LabCorp on Elm Street. I have already sent the order electronically. Here is the lab order. Please take this to LabCorp. The results will be sent to my office within 24-48 hours. I will contact you as soon as I have the MRI results. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… make sure everything is expedited. And don't bother contacting me unless it's absolutely necessary. I’ll be busy. I suppose I’ll be going then. Thank you… I guess. .
