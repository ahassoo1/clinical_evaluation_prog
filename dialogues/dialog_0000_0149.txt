DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell Gunasekara, 83 years old. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it's about… them wanting me to do things. Things I don't need. Honestly, doctors these days... always poking and prodding. I just want to be left alone, really. I’ve lived this long without all their… fuss.
DOCTOR: Right. “Wanting you to do things.” Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmph. Well, my grandson, bless his heart, keeps taking me to specialists. They want to… scan my feet, do bloodwork, something about my balance… Honestly, it's a waste of time. I’ve got a bit of a ache, everyone gets aches when they get to my age! It's just… bothersome, that’s all. And expensive, you know. Medicare only covers so much.
DOCTOR: An ache, you say. And these specialists… they're concerned about your balance as well?
PATIENT: Concerned! That's a strong word. They think I’m unsteady. I just… take my time, that’s all. I'm a careful woman. Always have been. It’s not like I’m falling all over the place. My grandson keeps fretting, says I nearly tripped over the rug last week. But rugs are treacherous things! Anyone could trip on a rug. Honestly, the young people worry too much.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it was a single incident with the rug. And they’re recommending these tests… scans and bloodwork, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, scans. And bloodwork. Honestly, it’s all very… invasive. And for what? They say it’s to rule things out. Rule what out? I feel perfectly fine, aside from the usual aches and pains. My feet just get tired, like anyone else's after a long day. I used to dance, you know. For years! Now they want to poke and prod like I'm some broken machine.
DOCTOR: Dancing, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Ballroom dancing. Every Saturday night. For… oh, goodness, decades. I was quite good, you know. A very graceful dancer. Until my husband… well, that’s another story. But I haven’t danced in years, naturally. Though I still feel like I could. It’s just… difficult getting around now. Which isn’t a reason to stick needles in me and scan my poor feet!
DOCTOR: Alright. And these aches… where exactly are you feeling them?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere! Mostly in my feet, of course. The arches, I think. And sometimes my ankles. It’s a dull ache, not a sharp pain. More like… a tiredness. Like they’ve been walking for miles and miles, even when I haven’t left the house all day. It comes and goes, really. I just don't understand why they need to make such a fuss over it.
DOCTOR: Do you notice any swelling in your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmmm… sometimes, I suppose. Not much. Maybe a little bit at the end of the day. But I always put my feet up! I read about it in one of those magazines, you know. Putting your feet up helps with the swelling. It’s probably just from sitting too long. I’m not one to rush around, always been more of a quiet sort.
DOCTOR: And has this tiredness or ache been getting worse lately, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s a hard question. It comes and goes, you see. Some days it’s barely noticeable, other days it’s more bothersome. I suppose… maybe it’s a little worse than it used to be. But honestly, I’ve had aches and pains for so long, it’s hard to say. Everything starts to ache when you get to my age, you know.
DOCTOR: You mentioned you used to dance ballroom. Have you experienced any falls besides the incident with the rug?
PATIENT: Falls? Oh, no, not really. Well… there was that one time, years ago, when I was still dancing with Harold. He tripped, actually! Not me. He wasn’t looking where he was going and stepped on my foot. We both went down, but it wasn’t a fall, you understand. More of a… tumble. That was Harold's fault entirely. And that was decades ago. I haven’t fallen since. Just that rug, recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just take a quick look at your feet and ankles. I’m feeling a bit of tenderness here, on the outside of your right ankle. And some mild swelling. It’s not severe, but it’s there. Your reflexes seem a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But don’t go poking too much! It's sensitive, you know. There. Careful now… Don’t want to topple over like some old lady!
DOCTOR: Alright. A few steps forward… and back. Now, a slow turn, if you would. That’s good. Okay. Please sit back down.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… tiring. I told you, I don’t rush around. It’s all a bit much, honestly. My grandson insists I need “exercise” and “strength training”. Honestly, I’ve lived this long without all their modern nonsense. Is it really necessary to poke and prod just to prove I’m not falling apart?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s not necessarily about “proving” you’re falling apart. But based on what you've told me, and what I've observed during the exam, there is some decreased strength and balance. This, combined with the swelling and tenderness in your ankles, could be contributing to the feeling of tiredness and the near-fall incident. It's likely a combination of age-related changes, and potentially some mild arthritis. To be thorough, I do think some bloodwork is warranted to rule out other potential causes, and an X-ray of your feet to assess for arthritis. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Bloodwork and X-rays… Honestly, it’s just too much fuss. I don’t like needles, you know, and all that radiation can’t be good for you. I told you, I just want to be left alone. Can't we just… ignore it? Put a nice warm compress on my feet and call it a day? My grandson will have a fit if he finds out I refused, though. He worries so much. Honestly, it’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand your reluctance. But these tests aren’t about unnecessary “fuss.” They’re about ruling out anything serious. For example, we need to check your vitamin levels, and ensure there isn't something else contributing to your weakness. The X-ray would help us to determine the extent of any arthritis, which we can then manage with appropriate treatment. It’s about being proactive, Wynell. I wouldn't recommend these tests if I didn't think they were necessary. Perhaps we can start with the bloodwork, and hold off on the X-ray for now if you're hesitant. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just the bloodwork then. But no poking and prodding! And I want the results explained to me in plain English. None of that medical jargon, understand? I don’t need to know about every single little thing, just if it's something serious. And if it's nothing, then that’s the end of it. I don't want to be put on any of those… medicines, if I can help it. They always have side effects, you know. Honestly, it's all so complicated.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just the bloodwork, explained in plain English. No unnecessary medications, unless absolutely needed. I can certainly do that. We’ll draw the blood here in the office. The results should be back in about a week. While we wait for those results, I recommend continuing to elevate your feet whenever possible, and avoiding any activities that cause pain or instability. If you experience any sudden or worsening pain, or if you do fall, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… tell my grandson I said hello. He worries so much, you know. And please, no surprises. Just tell me the truth, plain and simple. I've lived a long life, and I don't need any fancy medical explanations. And… that’s all. Honestly, I’m ready for a nap now. This whole thing has been quite exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be sure to tell your grandson hello. And I promise, plain and simple. We'll go over the results thoroughly when they come back. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood. You just relax now, and try to get some rest. Thank you for coming in today, Wynell.
