DOCTOR: Bonjour, Madame Queener. Welcome. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… swelling. It’s in my leg, mostly. After the cancer treatment, you see. It’s just… uncomfortable. And a little worrying.
DOCTOR: I see. Swelling in the leg after cancer treatment. Yes, that certainly warrants a look. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did I notice it? Let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? A little bit at first, and now it’s… bigger. I thought it would go away on its own, but it hasn’t. It’s mostly my right leg, but sometimes the left feels a bit funny too. It's hard to say exactly when, though. Everything feels a bit… blurry lately.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Madame Queener, it’s perfectly understandable. Memory can be affected by… well, many things. A month ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a month, I think. Maybe a little longer. It’s… it’s not painful, exactly. Just… heavy. And warm. And sometimes it feels tight, like my skin is too small. Does that make sense? I don't know all the fancy words for things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Heavy, warm, and tight… those are good descriptions. It sounds like it could be a few different things. To help me narrow it down, could you tell me a little bit about the cancer treatment you received?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The treatment… it was… a long time ago now. It was… radiation, mostly. And some… pills. Lots of pills. I went every day for… weeks, I think? Then I had to take the pills at home. It was… tiring. And I lost my hair, of course. I don’t remember exactly what they said the name of the cancer was, just that it was… bad. Does that help? I’m sorry I’m not very good at remembering details.
DOCTOR: No, please don’t apologize. You’re doing just fine. It’s perfectly normal to not remember every detail, especially after something like cancer treatment. We can look up the specifics in your records. Just to confirm, you had radiation therapy and some oral medications… and it was some time ago now?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Radiation… and the pills. It was… last year, I think. Maybe the year before? Honestly, time is… slipping away, you know? I just want this swelling to go away. It makes it hard to walk, and I like to walk. I walk to the bakery every morning for my croissant! And I can’t do that if my leg hurts.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Walking is important. And croissants are very important. We’ll do our best to figure this out. Now, besides the leg swelling and the difficulty walking, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been… more tired than usual, I suppose. But I’m always a little tired! It’s hard to say if it’s more tired. And my skin… it feels a little dry, maybe? It itches sometimes. And… oh! I’ve been feeling a bit breathless, especially when I climb the stairs. That’s new, I think. Is that important? I don’t want to bother you with too many things.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t worry about bothering me. These are all important things to know. Fatigue, dry, itchy skin, and shortness of breath… Yes, those are definitely things we need to investigate. Now, do you have any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see. I… I think the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high, once. A long time ago. He put me on a pill for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. It made me feel dizzy. And… no, I don't think so. No diabetes or heart problems that I know of. I try to eat healthy, mostly. And I don't smoke. I used to, but I quit years ago. A long, long time ago. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful. High blood pressure in the past, now off medication, and a history of smoking, but you’ve quit… Excellent. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with a history of blood clots, heart problems, cancer, or swelling in the legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. A long time ago. She was always very frail. And… my aunt, on my father’s side, she had cancer. Lung cancer, I think. But that was a long time ago too. No one else, not that I know of. My father was very healthy, and so was my brother. They both… they both passed away a long time ago. It's hard to remember everything. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Madame Queener, don’t apologize. It's perfectly understandable that it’s hard to remember. We'll just take things one step at a time. Now, just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes. I take a vitamin D pill every day. The doctor said I wasn't getting enough sun. And… that’s it. Just the vitamin D. I used to take something for my arthritis, but I stopped taking it a long time ago. It didn't seem to help much, and it made my stomach upset. No, that’s it. Just the vitamin D. I promise! I don't take many pills. It makes me feel… foggy.
DOCTOR: Very good. Just vitamin D. Now, before we proceed with an examination, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of! I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, and I’ve never had a rash or anything like that. No, no allergies. I'm very lucky, I think. Is that all the questions? I'm starting to feel a bit tired again. Could we maybe get to the… the part where you look at my leg?
DOCTOR: Yes, Madame Queener, that is all the questions for now. And absolutely, we can proceed with the examination. I apologize for the lengthy questions, but it's important to gather as much information as possible. If you’ll just have a seat here, I’ll take a look at your leg. I’ll start by checking your pulse and blood pressure, and then we’ll examine the swelling. It may be a little uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. As long as it's not too painful. I’m ready. Let’s get it over with, please. I just want to know what’s going on. My croissant is waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a look. First, I’m going to check your pulse in both legs. Okay, the pulses feel… slightly weaker on the right leg, but not drastically so. Now, let’s take a look at the swelling itself. Hmm… there is definite swelling, mostly around the calf and ankle. And there is some pitting edema present. Do you see this slight indentation?
