DOCTOR: Hi Annelle, welcome. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well... it's my skin, you see. It’s become... rather yellow. A friend suggested I come see someone. Something about my liver, I think? It's all a bit fuzzy, truthfully. I do apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. That’s perfectly understandable. Yellowing of the skin is definitely something we want to take a look at, and your friend is right to suggest getting it checked out. It could be related to your liver, but there are other possibilities too. To help me figure out what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I first notice…? Let me think… It feels like… a few weeks now? Perhaps a month? It started subtly, I suppose. I didn’t pay much attention at first, attributing it to… well, I’m not entirely sure what I attributed it to. It just seemed to creep up on me. I truly wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And has it been getting worse steadily, or has it come and gone?
PATIENT: Oh, steadily, I believe. Yes, it hasn't really gone away. It fluctuates a little, perhaps looks brighter some days than others, but it’s… consistently there. It worries me a bit, you see. I’ve never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Annelle. Consistent yellowing is definitely something we need to investigate. Besides the yellowing, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Let me see… I’ve been rather tired lately, more so than usual. And my appetite… it's been poor. Not that I eat much to begin with, mind you, but… even less than usual. And sometimes… a bit of discomfort in my stomach, just under my ribs on the right side. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all important information, Annelle, thank you. The fatigue, decreased appetite, and discomfort in your right upper quadrant could all be related. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no discomfort and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate that stomach discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale… hmm. Well, it’s not severe. It's more… a nagging ache. I’d say… a 3, perhaps? Sometimes it's barely noticeable, and other times it's a bit more… insistent. It doesn’t take my breath away or anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear… changes in… those? Well, let me think. My stool… has been rather pale, I believe. Lighter in color than usual. As for my urine… I hadn’t really paid much attention, truthfully. I suppose it looks normal. Is that… concerning? I truly apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No, Annelle, don’t apologize at all. You’re giving me plenty of helpful information. Pale stools can be significant, so thank you for mentioning that. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or liver disease?
PATIENT: Liver disease… now that you mention it, a doctor did say something about that, many years ago. Perhaps fifteen or twenty years ago? It wasn’t serious, I don’t think. Just a slight inflammation, something easily treated, or so they said. I don’t recall the specifics, I’m afraid. I’ve never been diagnosed with diabetes or heart problems, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my gallbladder removed, quite a long time ago. Perhaps thirty years ago? It was a routine procedure, I believe. And I was hospitalized once, when I was younger, with a bad case of pneumonia. But that was… a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I don't take anything regularly. Just an aspirin now and again for aches and pains. That's it, I think. I try to avoid medication if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, and do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can't recall ever being allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, before we proceed, I want to ask a few questions about your family history. Are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: Oh dear… my parents are both gone now, passed away many years ago. My brother… he’s in a nursing home, I believe. I haven’t seen him in quite some time, truthfully. A difficult situation.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you know of any major medical conditions that ran in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or liver problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… My mother had heart trouble, I believe. She was quite frail in her later years. And my aunt… on my father’s side… she had some sort of stomach illness, quite serious, I recall. I don’t know the specifics, I’m afraid. Liver problems… not that I recall, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? Oh dear. Well, I'm retired now, so I don't do much. I enjoy reading and spending time in my garden when the weather permits. I don't smoke and I rarely drink alcohol. I used to be quite active, but… well, age has slowed me down a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Annelle. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed. I want to get to the bottom of this, if possible. I do hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender or painful. I do notice some tenderness in your right upper quadrant, just under your ribs. And your liver feels slightly enlarged. It's not dramatically so, but it’s enough to warrant further investigation. I’m also noticing some mild swelling in your ankles. Have you noticed that before?
PATIENT: Oh, you noticed that, did you? Yes, my ankles have been a bit swollen lately. I thought it was just from sitting too much, to be honest. I hadn't really paid much attention. The tenderness… yes, that's where it feels uncomfortable. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I truly hope not.
DOCTOR: Okay, Annelle. The combination of the yellowing skin, the tenderness and enlargement of your liver, and the swelling in your ankles suggests a few possibilities. It could be related to your previous liver inflammation, or it could be something new. One possibility is a blockage in the bile ducts, which could be causing the yellowing and liver tenderness. Another possibility is a problem with your heart that is causing fluid to build up in your ankles. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will help me assess your liver function, kidney function, and look for any signs of infection. I also want to order an ultrasound of your abdomen to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests and ultrasounds… It all sounds rather… involved. But yes, Doctor, please. Do whatever you think is necessary. I want to know what’s going on. I truly appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I just… I hope it’s not too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Annelle. I understand your apprehension. We'll take things one step at a time. I’ll write up the orders for the blood tests and the ultrasound now. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the blood before you leave. The ultrasound can be scheduled for tomorrow morning. I also want to mention, given the swelling in your ankles and some of the other symptoms, it would be prudent to get an EKG to check your heart function. Would you be comfortable with that as well?
PATIENT: An EKG… Oh dear. Well… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. Please. I want to be thorough. I just… I’m not fond of medical procedures, if you understand. But I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Annelle. We’ll keep everything as quick and comfortable as possible. The EKG is a simple, painless test. Here’s a requisition for the blood tests and the order for the EKG. The lab and the EKG technician are both right down the hall. Once you’ve had the tests done, please let the receptionist know, and they’ll schedule your ultrasound for tomorrow morning. I also want to be upfront with you. While we wait for the test results, it’s important to rule out any serious conditions. Depending on what the tests show, you may need to see a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or a cardiologist. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a specialist… it all seems rather overwhelming. No, I don’t think so… not right now. I’m just trying to process everything. Thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so patiently. I appreciate your kindness. I suppose… I’ll go and get the tests done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Annelle. Take your time. And remember, we’ll go through this together. Here’s my card with the clinic number. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. I’ll be expecting your test results tomorrow. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I truly appreciate everything. Good day.
