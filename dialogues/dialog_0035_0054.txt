DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Cough, yeah. Been coughing… a long time. And tired. Very tired. And my nose… always blocked, feels like. Gets bad sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, fatigue, and a stuffy nose. How long have you been dealing with these symptoms, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: Long time… really long. Maybe… six months? Or more? Hard to say. It comes and goes, you know? Worse in the cold weather, I think. But it never really goes away. Just… less bad sometimes. I forget when it started exactly. My wife reminds me about things, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, roughly six months or more of a cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion, with it being worse in colder weather. Does anything specifically trigger the cough, or make it worse besides the cold?
PATIENT: Hmm… not sure. Dust maybe? When I’m working… with the tires… lots of dust. Makes it worse, I think. And… sometimes when I lie down at night. It’s bad then. Starts coughing and can’t really sleep. Not sure if that's something to do with it, though. I just… cough. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dust exposure at work seems to be a trigger, and it’s worse when lying down at night. Is the cough producing any phlegm, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah… sometimes. Not always. When it’s bad… it’s… yellow-ish. And thick. Other times… just dry. Like… scratchy. Sorry. It’s not nice.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Tati. That’s good information to know. And the color and consistency can be helpful. Has there been any blood in the phlegm at all?
PATIENT: Blood? No… I don’t think so. Not that I remember. My wife would have noticed, right? She always checks when I cough bad. No blood… I’m pretty sure. It’s just… yellow stuff, mostly. Sometimes clear when it’s not so bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No blood is good. Now, let’s talk about the fatigue. How would you describe the tiredness?
PATIENT: Just… always tired. Even after sleep. Like… heavy. Hard to get going in the morning. Working is hard. Lifting tires… more hard now. Used to be easy. Now… I need lots of breaks. And even then… feel like I could just… sleep. My wife says I fall asleep on the sofa a lot, watching TV. She worries.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it's a persistent fatigue that doesn’t improve with rest, and is impacting your work. Have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but not like… sick fever. Chills… no. Weight loss… I don’t know. I haven’t weighed myself. I think I’m the same? Maybe a little thinner, but… I’ve been eating normally. I like my food! My wife does all the weighing. She keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or significant weight loss. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. I don't take any medicines usually. Just… sometimes pain killers for my back, when it's bad from lifting tires. But… nothing regular. And no… food allergies. I eat everything!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you only take pain relievers as needed for back pain. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or COPD?
PATIENT: Um… no, not that I remember. I went to the clinic a few times for… colds. Normal stuff. But… never been told I have anything… special. Pneumonia… is that bad? I think my grandfather had that, a long time ago. But me… no. Just coughs, and tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No! No surgeries. Never been in the hospital. Lucky, I think. Always just tried to take care of myself. Work hard, eat good… that’s what my father always said. Never needed a hospital.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family—like heart disease, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Um… my father… he had… heart problems, I think. He had to watch his food. And my mother… she had… sugar problems? Diabetes, maybe? My wife knows all these things. She keeps track. I just… remember they had to be careful with what they ate. Nothing for me, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked. Don't like it. Makes me cough just thinking about it. My wife doesn't like it either. She always says it's bad for you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Mr. Tati. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs, and take your temperature and blood pressure. Could you please sit up and lean forward?
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if it's cold… or hurts. I don’t like the cold on my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. And another one… Okay. I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs, Mr. Tati. And there's a slight decrease in airflow on both sides. Your temperature is 99.2 Fahrenheit, and your blood pressure is 130/80. I’d also like to check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen is 94%, which is a little on the lower end, but not critically low. Based on what you've told me and what I'm hearing, it sounds like you could be experiencing bronchitis, possibly with some underlying asthma. However, to rule out other possibilities—like pneumonia or COPD—I'd like to order a chest X-ray. And I'd also like to order a sputum culture to check for any infection. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: X-ray… and… sputum? What does that mean? Is it bad? Bronchitis… asthma? I just want to stop coughing… and not be so tired. Will it cost a lot of money? I don’t have insurance… my wife… she works so hard…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tati. An X-ray is a picture of your lungs that helps us see if there's any sign of infection, like pneumonia. The sputum culture is a test to see if any bacteria are causing the infection. It just involves coughing up a sample of mucus. The bronchitis means inflammation of the airways, causing the cough and wheezing. Asthma is a chronic condition that causes the airways to narrow and swell. I know you don't have insurance, and I'll do my best to minimize the cost. We can discuss options for payment. The clinic has some financial assistance programs available. The estimated cost for the X-ray is $150, and the sputum culture is around $75. Before we proceed, I want to be upfront. While it’s likely bronchitis, it’s important to rule out anything more serious. Would you like me to explain the other possibilities we're ruling out?
PATIENT: $150… and $75… Okay. My wife… she will be angry, but… if it’s important, then okay. Pneumonia… you said? What’s that like? Is it worse than… this? And COPD… is that something… old people get? If it's just bronchitis… can I get medicine? To stop the cough?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tati. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can cause fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. It can be serious, which is why we want to rule it out. It's often more severe than bronchitis, and may require hospitalization. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a lung condition that can develop over time, often in people who smoke. It’s more common in older people, but not exclusively. We’ll do the X-ray and sputum culture, and then we'll have a better idea of what's going on. If it is bronchitis, yes, we can definitely prescribe medicine to help relieve your cough and make it easier to breathe. We can start you on an inhaler to open your airways and a cough suppressant to help with the coughing. I'll write you a referral for the X-ray now. It’s at the imaging center across the street. Once you get the results, you can bring them back to me, and we’ll discuss the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Inhaler… and cough medicine… that sounds good. Across the street… easy. I can walk. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. My wife will be happy to hear there's medicine. I will go now, and get the X-ray. And bring the results back to you.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Tati. Here’s the referral. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before you get the results. We are here to help. Get well soon. And please, try to rest as much as possible. We will get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you very much. I will. Rest… and come back with the results. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Tati. Take care.
