DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need a check-up for a team tryout, really. Gotta make sure I'm alright to go. Don't want any surprises out there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-participation physical. That's smart to get checked out beforehand. To start, can you tell me a little more about the team tryout?
PATIENT: It’s…uh…a wrestling team. Local thing, mostly younger guys, but I’m giving it a shot. Been training for a few months, feel alright, but they want us all checked out by a doctor first. Seems reasonable. Just hoping it doesn’t take too long, got some things I need to get to later.
DOCTOR: That's good you're taking it seriously, and yes, a good idea for the team to require physicals. Wrestling can be quite demanding. A few months of training is good—have you wrestled before, or is this a new activity for you?
PATIENT: New-ish. I did a little when I was younger, back in Mongolia, but it wasn't…serious. More like playing around with friends. This is more organized, you know? Real training, real rules. Trying to see if this old body can still handle it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so getting back into it after a while. That's helpful to know. Before we get to a physical exam, let’s go over some basics. Do you have any current medical problems – anything you're being treated for right now?
PATIENT: Not really. Nothing major, anyway. My knees get a little creaky sometimes, but that's just getting old, I guess. No doctors, no prescriptions, nothing like that. Mostly just trying to stay active.
DOCTOR: Alright, just some normal wear and tear, then. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. When I was a kid, I broke my arm falling off a horse. Had to have it set, I think. That was…a long time ago. Everything healed alright, though. And, uh, I was in the hospital for a bad flu once, but that doesn’t really count, does it? Just a few days.
DOCTOR: No, a childhood broken arm and a flu episode don't really concern us at the moment. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife used to make all sorts of things…she liked to experiment. Always good, though!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And are you currently taking any medications – even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every now and then. And if my knees are really bothering me, I'll take some ibuprofen. But it's not a regular thing. Maybe once a month, if that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that your relatives have had?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s…tough. My family back home…we didn't really talk about that stuff much. My father, he was strong, worked hard his whole life. My mother…she died when I was young. I think she had…something with her lungs, but I don’t remember the details. And I haven’t seen most of my family in a long time, so I don’t really know what’s going on with them. Sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kingan. It's common not to have a complete family medical history. We'll work with what you know. Now, a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, none of that. Never been much for it. Makes me feel sluggish. I like to stay sharp, you know? Mostly just tea and staying active.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Alright, let’s get a quick physical exam then. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your joints and muscles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Let's get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the better. I appreciate you keeping it quick, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths in and out for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the edge of the table and let your arms hang relaxed?
PATIENT: Alright. Just let me know if anything feels weird. Don't want to pull anything. Getting old, you know.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for someone your age. That's not necessarily a cause for concern. Now, I’m going to check your joints. Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Okay, there we go. A little stiff, but they work. Feels a bit of a creak in there. Like I said, getting old. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: There is some mild crepitus – that’s the clicking sound you’re feeling – and a slight limitation in your full range of motion, but no significant swelling or tenderness. It sounds like some mild osteoarthritis, which is common with age and activity. We can discuss some strategies to manage that if it becomes more bothersome. Now, let's check your shoulders and elbows. Can you raise your arms and rotate them?
PATIENT: Alright, here we go. Feels a bit tight in the shoulders, not much pain, just…stiff. Like everything else, I guess.
DOCTOR: There’s some limited range of motion in your shoulders and some mild tightness. No significant tenderness to the touch. Alright, one final thing: I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated, and your pulse is 72, regular.
PATIENT: Slightly elevated, huh? Is that…bad? I don't usually bother with doctors, so I don’t really know what those numbers mean.
DOCTOR: It’s not an immediate emergency, but it is something we should keep an eye on. 140/90 is considered Stage 1 hypertension. It means your blood pressure is a little higher than the ideal range. We can discuss lifestyle changes – like diet and exercise – that can help lower it. I’d also recommend monitoring it at home and potentially repeating the measurement in a few weeks to see if it’s consistently elevated. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Never thought I’d need one. My wife used to keep track of everything, but…well. So, no, I don't have one. Is it something I need to get?
DOCTOR: It would be a good idea to get one, Mr. Kingan. Since your blood pressure is slightly elevated, monitoring it at home would give us a better understanding of how it fluctuates and if any lifestyle changes are making a difference. They're relatively inexpensive and easy to use. Now, considering everything, you’re generally in good health for your age, but we have a few things to address. The mild osteoarthritis in your knees, the slightly elevated blood pressure, and the tightness in your shoulders. Given you’re planning to wrestle, I think it’s important to be proactive. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Wrestling… So you’re saying I can still wrestle? As long as I…keep track of stuff? And maybe take it a little easier? And…what about the knees? Is there anything I can do about them, besides just…taking it easy? I don’t want to pull a muscle or something.
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe you can still wrestle, but with some precautions. We’ll want to monitor your blood pressure, and it’s important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard, especially initially. Warm up thoroughly before each session and cool down afterward. As for your knees, there are several things you can do. Regular, low-impact exercise, like swimming or cycling, can help strengthen the muscles around your knees and provide support. Physical therapy could also be beneficial to improve your range of motion and teach you exercises to manage your discomfort. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen, can help with pain, but shouldn't be used long-term. And we can discuss whether a knee brace might be helpful during wrestling practice. I’m going to recommend that you purchase a blood pressure cuff to monitor your blood pressure at home. I'll also provide you with a handout on exercises for osteoarthritis and a list of local physical therapists. Would you like me to write a note for your team to indicate that you’ve had a physical exam and to encourage them to be mindful of any limitations you might have?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A note for the team would be great. I don't want them pushing me too hard right away. They’re a young bunch, full of energy. And thank you, Doctor. This is…more helpful than I expected. I really appreciate you taking the time. I’ll get the blood pressure cuff and try those exercises. Is there anything else I need to do, or…is that it for today? I really do have to get going soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kingan. I’m glad I could help. I’ll write that note for your team right away. For today, I recommend keeping a log of your blood pressure readings twice a day, and if you experience any worsening pain in your knees or any concerning symptoms like dizziness or shortness of breath, please contact me immediately. I’ll also give you a handout with information on hypertension and osteoarthritis. Here's the note for your team: "To Whom It May Concern: Mr. Kingan has completed a physical examination and is cleared to participate in wrestling activities. However, please be mindful of his age and encourage him to warm up and cool down thoroughly before and after each session. He has mild osteoarthritis in his knees and slightly elevated blood pressure, so please encourage him to listen to his body and avoid overexertion. Contact Dr. Sieh if any concerns arise." Do you have any questions about anything before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Sieh. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate it. I’ll get the cuff and start keeping track. And I'll let you know if anything comes up.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kingan. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care, and good luck with your wrestling!
