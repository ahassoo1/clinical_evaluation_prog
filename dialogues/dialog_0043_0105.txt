DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Uh, well, I'm here about getting... the surgery. The weight loss surgery. It's been on my mind for a while, and my wife thought it was a good idea to get it checked out. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details about why exactly, just that it’s something I need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kochubey. Weight loss surgery, or bariatric surgery, is a significant decision, and it's perfectly alright that the details aren't fresh in your mind. We can certainly go over everything thoroughly today. I see here you're 38 years old. To help me understand your situation better, and to ensure this is the right course of action for you, could you tell me a little more about your weight history?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, 38, yeah. Seems right. Weight history... Honestly, Doctor, it’s kind of a blur. I've always been… bigger, I guess. As a kid, definitely. And it’s just kind of stayed that way. I mean, I've tried diets, here and there, but nothing really stuck. It's hard to remember specifics, you know? Like, when I gained the most, or when I tried what diet… it all blends together. I work in retail, so I'm on my feet a lot, but... I eat when I'm stressed, and that’s pretty much all the time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Kochubey. Many people struggle with weight management, and it sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for a long time. It's common for diets to not be sustainable long-term, and stress certainly can play a significant role. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately what your highest weight has been, and what your current weight is?
PATIENT: Hmm… highest weight… that’s a tough one. I'm pretty sure it was around 300 pounds, maybe a little more? It was before I got married, I think. And right now… I weighed myself a couple weeks ago, and it was 285. Something like that. It fluctuates, you know? It really depends on the week.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kochubey. That's helpful information. Knowing your weight history gives me a better understanding. To move forward, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. This will just involve checking your blood pressure, heart rate, listening to your lungs, and palpating your abdomen. It’s a standard part of the evaluation process for bariatric surgery. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just… let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable, okay? I’m not good with… surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kochubey. I will explain everything as we go and stop immediately if you experience any discomfort. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. Slightly elevated. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some fullness in the upper abdominal region. No tenderness to palpation. Your weight is 285 pounds, and your height is 155 centimeters. That gives you a Body Mass Index, or BMI, of 37.8, which does qualify you for consideration for bariatric surgery. Do you have any known allergies to medications or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Okay, good to know. I didn't realize there was a number involved. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I get hay fever sometimes, in the spring, but that’s it. Nothing serious. And… no medical conditions, not really. I get headaches sometimes, but everyone gets those, right? Oh, and my wife mentioned something about my cholesterol being a little high last year, but I haven’t really followed up on it. I don’t really go to the doctor much unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Kochubey. Seasonal allergies aren't a concern for our purposes. We’ll need to address the headaches and elevated cholesterol, though, as both can be relevant to the surgery and your overall health. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. I take ibuprofen sometimes, for my headaches. Just when they get really bad. And… occasionally, a multivitamin. My wife gets them for me, says I should be getting more vitamins. That’s it, I think. Nothing else regularly. Well, I drink coffee, if that counts. Lots of coffee.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Ibuprofen as needed and a multivitamin. And lots of coffee – noted. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s another thing I’m not great with. My mom passed away a few years ago, she had… I think it was diabetes, maybe? And heart problems, definitely. My dad is still alive, but he’s not in great shape. He’s pretty old, and he’s had some issues with his knees, I think. And… my brother is healthy, as far as I know. We don’t talk much. I don’t really know much about anyone else. We weren’t really a close family. Does that help? I'm sorry, I wish I had more information for you.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s common not to have a complete family medical history. Knowing about your mother's diabetes and heart problems is helpful, though. That does increase your risk. Now, before we discuss the different surgical options, I need to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never smoked a cigarette in my life. My wife would kill me if I even thought about it. She’s very health-conscious. I try to be too, but it’s hard.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And what about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I have a beer sometimes, maybe on the weekends. Just one or two, usually with dinner. Nothing too crazy. It helps me relax. Sometimes more, if I've had a really stressful week. But I don’t really drink alone. And my wife usually has one too, so it's not like I’m hiding anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest with me, Mr. Kochubey. I understand. Now, considering your overall health, your weight history, and your lifestyle, I believe you could be a candidate for bariatric surgery. However, before we proceed, I'd like to order some blood work to assess your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and overall metabolic health. I also recommend an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. If that’s what we need to do, let's do it. Blood work and… an EKG, right? I just want to feel better, you know? I want to be able to… play with my grandkids someday, if I’m lucky enough to have any. And I want to be able to keep up with my wife. She deserves someone who can do more than just sit on the couch.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kochubey. And those are excellent motivations. I'll write the orders for the blood work and EKG now. The lab is just down the hall. You'll need to fast for 12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drink except water. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Twelve hours… okay. No food, just water. That’s… manageable, I guess. So, I can’t even have coffee? That might be the hardest part. But yeah, I can do it. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… how long will it take to get the results? I'm a little anxious about waiting.
DOCTOR: That's a valid question, Mr. Kochubey. Typically, it takes about 24-48 hours for the lab results to come back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they're available to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you have any urgent concerns, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I'll also have a nurse reach out to you with detailed instructions for the fasting period and the EKG. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. A nurse will call. That’s good, I’m glad to know someone will explain everything clearly. 24-48 hours… I can wait. Thank you, Doctor Kalinski. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s been a long time since I felt like someone actually understood what I’m going through.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It is my pleasure. I understand this is a significant step, and I am here to guide you through the process every step of the way. I’ll have the nurse call you shortly with those instructions. Until then, please take care. If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to call. It was a pleasure meeting you today.
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor. I will. I'll definitely call if I need anything. Thank you again. Have a good day, Doctor Kalinski.
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Mr. Kochubey. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
