DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Giganti. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Yes, well, it’s my ear. It feels…full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? Been like that for a bit now. Not really painful, just…annoying. I suppose. I don’t really…remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A feeling of fullness in your ear, not particularly painful, but bothersome. And you’re not certain when it began. Let's try to narrow that down a bit. Has this been happening constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Yes, that’s it. More often now, though. Definitely more often. I… I was working outside a lot last week, maybe? With the crops. Does that…sound right? I get confused easily these days. It’s just…there, and then not. Then there again. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, and it seems to be occurring more frequently, especially after working outside. Working with crops… that’s helpful information. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not really. Maybe a little…dizziness sometimes? But I get dizzy easily anyway, to be honest. It’s not new. And…no, that’s it, I think. No pain, no ringing…just the fullness. It makes it hard to hear sometimes, which is…difficult with my job.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no new dizziness, just the usual. No pain or ringing in the ear. And the fullness is impacting your hearing. That’s important to note. Now, have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, tubes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Infections… when I was a boy, maybe? A really bad earache once, I think. But…it was a long time ago. I don’t really remember the details. My wife… she used to handle all that sort of thing. I just…went to the doctor when she told me to. Sorry. It’s…difficult to recall. No tubes, I don’t think. Definitely not recently.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. No need to apologize at all. We'll work with what you do remember. So, a possible ear infection in childhood, but nothing recent. Let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never really had a reaction to anything. My wife…again, she always asked me about those things. I just…ate what she gave me. I’m sorry, I’m not much help, am I? I really don’t keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s very common for patients to not remember specific details, and we'll gather all the information we need. No allergies, that's good. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just…a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor prescribed it a few years ago. A small white pill. I think it's… Lisinopril? Yes, that sounds right. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, a little something from the drugstore. Just…when needed. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and an occasional sleep aid. Thank you. Now, before we proceed with a quick examination of your ear, could you briefly tell me about your general medical history?
PATIENT: General history… Well, I was…generally healthy, I suppose. Until my wife passed away. That…that really took a lot out of me. Aside from that…high blood pressure, as I said. And… I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it’s not too bad. No major surgeries or anything like that. Just…getting old, I guess. I don’t really… go to the doctor much otherwise.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s completely understandable that your health may have taken a backseat. We’ll focus on getting you feeling better now. So, high blood pressure and some arthritis. Now, do you have any family history of ear problems, hearing loss, or any other significant medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Family… my mother, she had some trouble hearing towards the end, I think. Yes, she used to turn the television up really loud. But…that's all I can really remember. My father was healthy as a horse, always working. I don't recall any other ear problems in the family, no. Nothing significant, anyway. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It's just...a blur, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Your mother’s hearing loss is good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears, just to take a look and see what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Please, go ahead. I just…I hope it’s not anything serious. I need to be able to hear when I’m inspecting the crops, you see. It's important. The sooner I finish this, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lean forward a bit. I’m going to gently insert this instrument into your ear to take a look. It might be slightly cool, but it shouldn’t cause any discomfort. Hmm… I see some cerumen – earwax – present, which is normal. The ear canal appears clear otherwise. The left ear is similar – some cerumen, canal is clear. The tympanic membrane – that’s the eardrum – appears slightly…dull. It's not markedly inflamed, but there's a reduced mobility when I puff air into the canal. Based on the examination, it appears you have some impacted cerumen in both ears, and a slight reduction in eardrum mobility, likely related to the wax buildup. This could be contributing to the feeling of fullness and difficulty hearing. This is a common issue.
PATIENT: Wax… is that bad? Will I need… surgery? I really don’t want any surgery. Is there anything else… something serious wrong? I thought it might be an infection. That's what my wife always worried about.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, wax buildup is not serious. It’s a very common issue, and it’s easily treatable. We certainly don’t need to consider surgery. An infection is a possibility, but based on the examination, it doesn't appear to be present at this time. The dullness of the eardrum is more likely due to the wax obstructing my view. We can start with a simple earwax removal procedure. There are a few ways to do this—we can try irrigation with warm water, or I can use a small instrument to gently remove it. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Irrigation… with water? That sounds… messy. And what if it goes in too far? The instrument… is that painful? I don't like the idea of anything in my ear. Honestly, I just want it gone. I just want to be able to hear again. Is the instrument… very sharp? I'm really not good with… things near my ears. My wife always did these things.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about procedures involving your ears. The instrument I use is not sharp—it's a small, curved tool designed to gently loosen and remove the wax. It's a very common procedure, and I assure you, I'm very careful. We can start with a very gentle attempt using the instrument. If you feel any discomfort at any point, please let me know immediately, and we can stop. Alternatively, we can try over-the-counter earwax softening drops for a few days and then re-evaluate. That might be a less invasive first step. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: The drops… yes, the drops sound better. Less… poking around. How long do I need to use them for? And what do I do… do I just put them in and hope for the best? My wife always had very specific instructions. And what if they don't work? I really need to be able to hear.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. We’ll start with over-the-counter earwax softening drops – I recommend Cerum-Lyse or Debrox. You’ll want to use them twice a day for about five to seven days. To use them, lie on your side with the affected ear facing up. Gently pull your ear up and back to straighten the ear canal, and instill the recommended number of drops – usually five to ten. You should feel a slight tingling sensation. Stay lying on your side for about five to ten minutes to allow the drops to soak in. Then, gently wipe away any excess liquid with a clean tissue. After five to seven days, if you still have a feeling of fullness, we can re-evaluate and consider other options, such as a gentle irrigation or manual removal. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Twice a day… I can do that. And if it doesn't work, then we can… talk about the other things. Thank you, doctor. I just want to be able to hear again. It's…difficult when you can't hear properly. I suppose. Is there anything else I need to know? Or… am I finished for today? I have some crops that need attending to, you see.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It's completely understandable that you want to get back to your crops. Just a few things. Avoid getting water in your ears while using the drops. And if you experience any pain, dizziness, or drainage from your ear, stop using the drops immediately and contact the clinic. Otherwise, you’re finished for today. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to see if the drops have been effective. We can then assess the situation and determine the next steps. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… the follow-up. I'll remember to schedule it. Thank you again, doctor. You've been very helpful. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and take care. .
