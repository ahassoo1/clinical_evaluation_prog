DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… well, my face gets very red. Like, flushing. It happens sometimes, not all the time. It’s… bothersome. I don’t know why it happens, that’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Withycombe. It’s certainly understandable to want to figure out the cause of something that’s bothersome. So, this flushing – when does it typically happen?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Sometimes when I eat… spicy food, maybe? And sometimes… just happens. I was talking with my neighbor yesterday, and it started then. I was telling him about my garden… tomatoes are doing very well this year. It just… came over me. Not when I’m working with the patients though. Never happens then.
DOCTOR: I see. So it seems to be somewhat unpredictable, but can be triggered by certain things like spicy food, and sometimes occurs spontaneously, even during relatively calm activities like talking. And interestingly, it doesn’t happen when you're working with patients. That's helpful information. Could you describe what the flushing feels like?
PATIENT: Feels… warm. Very warm face, and neck. Like a hot flash, maybe? My wife… she used to get those. Not itchy, not painful. Just… hot. And red. Very red. People… they look at me. It makes me a little shy. It goes away after a little while. Maybe ten, fifteen minutes. Sometimes longer.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so clearly, Mr. Withycombe. Warmth and redness, lasting roughly ten to fifteen minutes, sometimes longer. It’s understandable that it makes you feel self-conscious. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed anything else that seems to trigger the flushing, besides spicy food?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I drink tea, sometimes. Black tea, with a little sugar. Doesn’t seem to do anything. I used to drink… a little wine, with dinner. But I stopped that, after my wife… passed. I don’t think that was it either. I don't go out much, so not much sun. Just… comes and goes. It's very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear association with tea, wine, or sun exposure. And you mentioned it began after your wife passed. I understand that was a difficult time, and sometimes stress or emotional changes can manifest physically. To help rule out other possibilities, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart problems, or skin conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I was always very healthy. My wife… she was the one with the little problems. High blood pressure, she had. I always took care of her. I go to the dentist, regular checkups. That’s all. Never been to a specialist, nothing. I don't take any pills, any medicine. Just… vitamins, sometimes. Old man vitamins, you know?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Withycombe. So, no pre-existing medical conditions, no regular medications, and just occasional vitamins. And you haven't had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing cricket. But that was a long time ago. Just the usual things, colds, flu. Nothing serious. My wife… she had a surgery, on her knee. But I haven't been in a hospital for anything, myself. I'm a pretty simple man, you see?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Withycombe. No surgeries or hospitalizations, apart from the broken arm as a child. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: My family… they were all healthy too, mostly. My father, he lived to be 85. Mother, 90. They lived in India, you know? I came here when I was young. They didn't have much trouble, nothing like… this. My sister, she has… arthritis, maybe? In her hands. But that’s all I can think of. Nobody with… flushing. Or red faces. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of good health overall, with your sister having arthritis, but no one with similar symptoms. Just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My wife… she used to smoke, a little. But I always told her it was bad for her. I never liked it. I don't drink much alcohol either, like I said. Just tea. And water. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables. My garden helps with that. Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant… very good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, minimal alcohol, and a healthy diet. That's all very good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing that I know of. I can eat anything. I haven’t had a problem with… bees, or pollen, or anything. I’m a pretty… plain man, you see? Very simple. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I think that’s everything. Is there anything else I should tell you?
DOCTOR: No, I think that’s a very thorough history, Mr. Withycombe. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be causing this flushing, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to know why my face gets red. It’s… bothersome. Please, do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Withycombe. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat here, and I'll get started. Alright, Mr. Withycombe, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not concerningly so. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your skin appears normal at the moment. I do not see anything immediately alarming. Given your history and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing something called rosacea. It’s a common skin condition that causes facial redness, flushing, and sometimes small, visible blood vessels. It can be triggered by various things, including spicy foods, stress, and even temperature changes. However, the exact cause isn't always known. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Rosacea… I’ve never heard of that. But… what you said about the spicy food and… stress. That does sound right. When I’m worried, my face always gets red. And when I eat the peppers, definitely. Is that… bad? Do I need medicine? Will it… get worse? I just want it to stop. It makes me shy.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mr. Withycombe. Rosacea isn't usually a serious condition, but it can be bothersome and affect your quality of life. The good news is that it’s manageable. There are various treatment options available, depending on the severity of your symptoms. For mild cases like yours, we can often start with lifestyle modifications and skincare. That includes avoiding triggers like spicy foods, managing stress, using gentle skincare products, and protecting your skin from the sun. We can also consider topical creams to help reduce redness and inflammation. To be sure, I'd like to start with a trial of some gentle skincare and trigger avoidance for the next few weeks. I'm going to recommend a mild cleanser and a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. I'll also give you a list of common rosacea triggers to avoid. If that doesn't provide enough relief, we can discuss other options, such as prescription medications. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: That sounds… good, Doctor. Very good. I can try that. No spicy food… I can do that. And the sunscreen… I always liked being in the garden, but maybe I should wear a hat too? And the stress… that’s harder. I miss my wife very much. But I will try. Gentle cleanser… and sunscreen. And avoid the peppers. Is there a specific cleanser you recommend? And… where do I get this sunscreen?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Withycombe. And yes, a hat is a great idea! Sun protection is very important. As for the cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser or CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser. Both are fragrance-free and non-irritating. You can find them at most pharmacies – Walgreens, CVS, even Target or Walmart. As for the sunscreen, look for one labeled "broad spectrum" and with an SPF of 30 or higher. EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 is a good option, but there are many others available. I'll also give you a handout with more information about rosacea and its management. I want to see you back in four weeks to see how you’re doing with the skincare and trigger avoidance. If your symptoms worsen before then, or if you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful. Gentle cleanser… sunscreen… avoid the peppers. I will try my best. Thank you very much for listening to me. It’s… nice to talk to someone who understands.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I’m glad I could help. It’s my pleasure. Remember, managing rosacea takes time and patience, but with a little effort, you can definitely improve your symptoms and feel more comfortable. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and please take care. .
