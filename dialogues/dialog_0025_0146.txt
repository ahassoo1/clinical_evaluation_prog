DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thanks, Doc. Muscle weakness, mostly. It’s…hard to explain exactly when it started, but it's been getting worse the last few weeks. Feels like I don't have the strength I used to, you know? Especially in my arms and legs. It’s making work…difficult.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. “Muscle weakness, getting worse over a few weeks…” And what kind of work do you do, Mr. McKinnon?
PATIENT: I’m an insurance appraiser, auto damage. Basically, I go look at wrecked cars and figure out how much they’re worth, how much the repairs will cost… lots of walking around, looking under cars, writing things down. Sometimes lifting small parts to get a better look. It's not heavy lifting, but it requires some strength, definitely.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. So, physically demanding, but not…back-breaking. And you said it’s affecting your work. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. It's things like…getting up after kneeling to look at something under the car is harder. Or holding my tablet steady while I'm writing notes feels tiring after a while. Just…little things adding up, really. And I dropped a fender the other day – not a big one, but still. Never done that before. I’m worried it's gonna get to the point where I can't do the job at all.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has this weakness been all over, or is it worse in certain areas?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my arms and legs, like I said. My legs feel…heavier, I guess. And my grip isn’t what it used to be. Not really anything else, thankfully. No pain, no numbness… just…weakness. It's pretty consistent too, doesn't really come and go.
DOCTOR: Alright. And let's go a little further back. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Actually, yeah. I’ve…lost a little weight. Maybe ten pounds or so, over the last month? Didn’t really think much of it at the time – been busy with work, kinda skipped a few meals here and there. But thinking about it now… it probably wasn't just the work schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, ten pounds unexplained weight loss in a month is worth noting. And have you had any fever, night sweats, or fatigue along with this weakness and weight loss?
PATIENT: No fever, thankfully. And…not really night sweats either. I get tired, sure, but everyone gets tired, right? It's just…regular work tired. It hasn't been anything…extreme. I mean, I’m not dragging myself out of bed or anything. It's more like… needing an extra cup of coffee to get going in the morning, that kind of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, strep throat. Nothing major. No diabetes, no heart problems, no nothing. I’ve been pretty healthy my whole life, honestly. Didn’t think I’d be sitting here with a doctor at 38 complaining about weakness.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed any surgeries. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but it healed up fine with a cast. That's it. Seriously. I’m usually as healthy as a horse. This whole thing is really throwing me off.
DOCTOR: Okay. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family… Hmm. My dad had high blood pressure, but that's about it. My mom was healthy as can be, lived to be 85. No real history of…muscle problems, or anything like that. We’re a pretty healthy bunch, generally. It’s just…weird.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… I drink coffee, like I said. Maybe two or three cups a day. I don’t smoke. Don’t really drink alcohol much, maybe a beer on the weekend sometimes. I eat…okay. I try to, anyway. I don’t have a ton of time to cook, so it’s a lot of takeout, but I try to pick healthy options when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. I can take pretty much anything without a problem. I’ve never had a reaction to a medicine in my life. I'm really racking my brain trying to figure out what’s going on here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Sure, Doc. No problem. Let me just… stands up slowly There we go. A little wobbly, but I'm standing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let me check your reflexes first. Doctor Fourney gently taps Mr. McKinnon’s knees and checks his biceps. Those are…slightly diminished. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay. squeezes Doctor Fourney’s hands Like that? It feels…weaker than usual. I'm trying, Doc, but it doesn’t feel like I’m putting as much force into it as I normally would.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you push against my hands with your legs?
PATIENT: pushes against Doctor Fourney's hands with both legs Okay, I'm pushing. It feels like...it takes more effort than it should. Not a ton of power behind it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. And let me just feel for any muscle wasting. Doctor Fourney palpates Mr. McKinnon’s arms and legs. I don’t feel anything significant…yet. Okay, Mr. McKinnon, please sit back down. We’re going to run some labs. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. We're also going to check your creatine kinase, just to rule out any muscle damage. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds…good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Creatine…what-now? Is that…serious?
DOCTOR: Creatine kinase – CK – is an enzyme released when muscle is damaged. It’s not necessarily serious, but a high level can indicate a problem. We need to see what your levels are before we get concerned. The lab results should be back in a few days. I’m also going to order a urinalysis, just to rule out any kidney issues. We’ll review the results together then, and decide if we need to do any further testing, like an EMG or MRI. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds…thorough, Doc. I appreciate it. EMG and MRI… okay. I’ll keep track of the tests. A few days, right? Okay. I really just want to get back to work, but not if I’m gonna collapse or something.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. We’re being cautious, Mr. McKinnon. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’m going to give you a referral to a neurologist. It’s better to have a specialist rule things out if need be. I'll have the nurse print out the lab orders and the referral information for you. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid any strenuous activity. And if you experience any new symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, severe pain, or changes in your vision – please go to the emergency room immediately. Any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, a neurologist…got it. No strenuous activity, got it. And if anything gets worse, ER. nods slowly No, I don’t think I have any questions right now, Doc. Just…thank you. I really appreciate you taking the time to look into this. I'm just…a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Worry is understandable. We'll get this figured out. The nurse will be right with you to schedule the labs and discuss the referral. Just focus on taking it easy and listen to your body. Don’t push yourself. And remember, we're taking things one step at a time. .
