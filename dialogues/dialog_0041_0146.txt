DOCTOR: Hi Edric, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It's… well, my muscles feel weak. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it's starting to worry me. I just want to figure out what's going on, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Weakness can be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. "A little while now"... can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started maybe six weeks ago? At first, I just noticed it was a little harder to lift things at work – you know, car parts, things like that. I figured I was just getting old, honestly. But it’s been getting worse each week. Now it’s… harder to even get out of a chair sometimes. It’s mostly in my legs and arms, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks, gradually worsening… mostly legs and arms. That's helpful. And you mentioned it's impacting lifting things at work and now getting out of a chair. Is it symmetrical – meaning, is it happening equally on both sides of your body, or is one side weaker than the other?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I think… it’s pretty much the same on both sides, yeah. Both legs feel about equally weak, and same with my arms. It’s not like one arm is completely useless or anything, but they both just feel… tired, all the time. Like they don’t have much power.
DOCTOR: Alright, symmetrical weakness, gradually worsening over six weeks… and a feeling of tiredness, lack of power. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not really. No pain, no numbness, no tingling. I haven’t noticed any dizziness or anything like that either. I have been a little more tired overall, but honestly, who isn’t these days? It's hard to say if that’s related. I haven’t been sleeping great, but that’s just stress, I think. Work's been busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, numbness, tingling, or dizziness. Increased fatigue, but possibly related to stress and sleep. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing diagnosed. I've never really been sick, to be honest. Just the usual colds and flu every now and then. No surgeries, no serious injuries… I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. My family… my dad had some problems with his blood sugar when he got older, but that’s about it. I don't think my mom had any major health issues.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know – no prior medical history, no surgeries, family history limited to your father’s blood sugar issues. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I drink a lot of water, that's about it. Oh, wait… sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s maybe once or twice a month. That’s it. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, mostly no medications, occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My wife used to say I had an iron stomach. She passed away a few years back, so... But yeah, no allergies.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. That must be incredibly difficult. Thank you for sharing that. Okay, no known allergies. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never smoked a day in my life. I don't drink alcohol either. And definitely no recreational drugs. I just… never got into any of that. I work hard, and I try to stay healthy, you know? I figure that's the best way to be.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Alright, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your strength, reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. Let's get it over with, if you don't mind. I got work waiting for me, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, squeeze my hands as hard as you can… good. And now the other hand… Alright, strength seems relatively normal so far. Now, let's check your legs. Can you try to push your feet against my hands like you’re pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Is that enough? It feels a little harder than it used to, honestly. Like I’m really having to try to push. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. And it's helpful that you notice that difference. Okay, reflexes are… a little diminished, but not significantly. Coordination seems intact. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline. Everything sounds clear so far. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from anxiety about your symptoms. Do you have any pain anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. Just… tired. Like my muscles are just worn out. My heart feels okay, I guess. It's just been beating faster than usual lately, especially when I'm trying to lift things. But I figured that was just from the effort. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, the diminished reflexes and slightly elevated heart rate along with your reported weakness are things we need to investigate further. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without more information. There are a number of possibilities, including vitamin deficiencies, nerve issues, or even early signs of a muscle disorder. I'm going to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, electrolyte balance, and thyroid function. I also want to get a creatinine kinase level, which can help us see if there's any muscle damage. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work is fine. I just want to know what's going on, and get this figured out. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the results back to us. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available. We'll definitely need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Depending on what the blood work shows, we might consider further testing, like an MRI or a referral to a neurologist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. A few days isn't too bad. I appreciate you explaining everything. MRI and neurologist… that sounds a little scary, honestly. But I guess I'll do whatever I need to do. Just let me know when I need to come back. And thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Edric. I understand your concern about further testing, and we'll take things one step at a time. We’ll discuss all the options thoroughly before making any decisions. No, nothing else for now. My nurse will give you the lab requisition and instructions on where to go for the blood work. She'll also schedule your follow-up appointment. If you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – like significant difficulty breathing, new numbness or tingling, or severe pain – please go to the emergency room immediately. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will. I appreciate it. .
