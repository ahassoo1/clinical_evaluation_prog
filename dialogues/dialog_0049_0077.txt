DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Good morning to you too. They tell me I gotta come. Some kinda check-up 'cause of… the mine. No problems, mind you. I feel fine. Been feeling fine for… well, a long time now. They just want me to come, that’s all. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, sometimes preventative care is useful, even when one feels fine. The “mine”... could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What kinda question is that? I worked in the mine! Underground. Digging things up. Loading and moving. Heavy work. Been doing it most of my life. Now I’m retired, but… they sent a letter. Something about dust and… air. Honestly, I didn't read the whole thing. My daughter, she filled out most of it. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Right. The mine. And this letter… was it from the mining company?
PATIENT: Mining company? Maybe. I don't keep track of those things. They send a lot of papers. Legal stuff, mostly. My daughter handles all that now. She says something about them being responsible… for making sure old workers don't… fall apart. Sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing, if you ask me. I worked hard, never complained.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see here there's a record of your employment with the Consolidated Minerals Group for… forty-two years. And a note about a recent screening program they're offering for former employees due to potential long-term health risks associated with coal dust exposure. That would be the letter.
PATIENT: Coal dust? Is that what it was? I knew it was something like that. Dust everywhere, always. You get used to it. Wore a mask, of course. Though, back then… they weren’t the fancy ones you have now. More like a cloth over your face. Kept the big chunks out, I suppose. But dust… you breathe some in, no matter what.
DOCTOR: Yes, masks have improved significantly over the years. Okay, so you worked in the mine for forty-two years, exposed to coal dust. And you’ve been feeling generally well since retiring?
PATIENT: Generally well. Yes. No cough. No trouble breathing. Can still walk up the stairs, though my knees complain a bit sometimes. Old age, you know? Not the dust, I'm sure. I eat my greens, you know. My wife, before she passed, she made sure I ate my vegetables. Good woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. No cough, no breathing difficulties. Some knee pain, which you attribute to age. That’s good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy levels? What kinda question is that? I'm eighty-six years old! My energy levels ain’t what they used to be, naturally. I get tired quicker than I used to, if you must know. But that’s just… being old. I don't go running marathons anymore, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: No, I wasn’t suggesting marathons, Mr. Bigger. Just trying to get a complete picture. Any wheezing or shortness of breath, even with minimal exertion?
PATIENT: Wheezing? No. Shortness of breath? Not really. Maybe when I climb a lot of stairs, but I take my time. I ain't in a hurry to go anywhere these days. I used to be able to run up those stairs like a goat, back in my younger days. But those days are long gone. You trying to find something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: I am simply performing a routine assessment, Mr. Bigger. As part of the mining company’s screening program, we need to document your respiratory health. Have you ever been diagnosed with bronchitis or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Bronchitis? Pneumonia? Hmm… let me think. I had a bad chest cold once, a long time ago. My wife made me drink some kinda tea, and that fixed me right up. I don’t know if that was… bronchitis or pneumonia. The doctor just gave me something for the fever, I think. Back then, doctors didn't tell you everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. No formal diagnosis of bronchitis or pneumonia. Let's do a quick listen to your lungs, just to be certain. Could you please sit up straight and take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Deep breaths? Alright. But don’t expect much. They ain't what they used to be, you know. There. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Okay. I do hear some diminished breath sounds, especially at the bases of your lungs. And a few scattered wheezes. It's not dramatically concerning, but it warrants further investigation. Have you ever smoked, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Smoked? Me? Never touched a cigarette in my life! My wife, she used to smoke a little. Socially, you know? But I always told her it was a foolish habit. No, never smoked. Always been healthy, mostly. Until old age started catching up, that is.
DOCTOR: Alright, no history of smoking. Given your history of coal dust exposure and the findings on auscultation, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung disease, such as chronic bronchitis or pneumoconiosis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray? Now you want to take pictures of my insides? What for? I told you, I feel fine! Is this something the mining company is making you do? I don’t like the sound of this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, the X-ray is a preventative measure. It's a standard procedure for individuals with your exposure history, to ensure there are no long-term effects from the coal dust. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it's best to be thorough. The mining company has recommended this screening, yes, as a responsible course of action. It's a quick and painless procedure. Would you prefer I explain the risks and benefits in more detail?
PATIENT: Risks and benefits? What kinda risks? Radiation, I suppose? Look, I've lived a long life. I ain't afraid of a little dust, and I certainly ain’t afraid of a little radiation. But I don't see the point. I feel fine. This is just a waste of time and money, if you ask me. But… alright. If you insist. Just get it over with quickly. But I'm telling you, you won't find anything.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. I'll write the order for the chest X-ray now. The radiology department is just down the hall, and they will schedule you for the procedure. It should take about fifteen minutes. After the X-ray, we'll review the results together. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler. It can help open up your airways and alleviate any wheezing you may be experiencing. Would you like me to explain how to use it?
PATIENT: Inhaler? Now you're giving me medicine for something I don't even have? Look, I’m a stubborn old man, alright? I don't like taking pills, and I certainly don't need an inhaler. But… alright. Explain it. But if I start feeling funny, I’m blaming you. And the mining company.
DOCTOR: Very well. This inhaler contains a medication that helps relax the muscles in your airways, making it easier to breathe. You'll shake it well, and then take one puff when you feel short of breath or wheezing. After you take the puff, hold your breath for ten seconds. It’s important to exhale slowly and deeply. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hold my breath? Ten seconds? Sounds complicated. I always did have trouble with instructions. Shake it… one puff… hold my breath… Exhale slowly… It’s a lot to remember for an old man. What if I forget? What if I shake it too much?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Bigger. It seems complicated, but it’s quite straightforward once you get the hang of it. If you forget, just ask a family member to remind you. There’s a leaflet in the box with clear instructions. And there’s no such thing as shaking it “too much”. As long as you hear the medication rattle inside, you’re doing it correctly. We'll review the technique again before you leave. Do you have any questions about the inhaler at this point?
PATIENT: Rattle? You mean like… bones? Bones rattling inside a medicine? That doesn’t sound right at all! Look, I don't like this. I'm going home. I’ll just… breathe slowly. That’s what I’ve been doing for eighty-six years, and it’s worked so far. You’ve given me too much fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. I understand your reluctance. I will not push you to take the inhaler if you are uncomfortable. However, I strongly recommend you consider using it, especially if you experience any shortness of breath or wheezing. The order for the chest X-ray has been sent, and you can schedule it at your convenience. I will give you a written summary of our discussion, including the instructions for the inhaler, just in case you change your mind. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just… get me out of here. This has been a waste of my time. A complete and utter waste. And tell the mining company I said they’re sending old men on wild goose chases. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I need a nap.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. I’ll have the nurse escort you to the exit. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And I do hope you have a restful nap. This contains all the information we discussed today. Take care.
PATIENT: .
