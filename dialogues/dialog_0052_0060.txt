DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, it’s…family history, mostly. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had…well, a lot of things. And my uncle, he went pretty early. I just…I want to make sure I’m okay, you know? It’s probably nothing, but better safe than sorry, right? It's just…things run in families.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. It is very wise to be proactive about your health, especially given your family history. “Things running in families” is a perfectly valid reason to seek a medical evaluation. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a little more about what “a lot of things” refers to with your grandmother, and what happened with your uncle?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Well, my grandmother… she had diabetes, I think. And then… heart problems, definitely. She was always in and out of the hospital. And then, later on… some kind of cancer, I think it was in her lungs. It was a long time ago, honestly. My mom doesn't really talk about it much. And my uncle… he was younger, maybe in his fifties. I think it was his heart. Sudden. Just… gone. It was… a shock. I don't even know exactly what happened. They just said heart failure, I think. Look, I’m not a doctor, okay? I just know it was bad.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Theriot. It can be difficult to recall specifics, and it’s perfectly alright if you don’t have all the details. Diabetes, heart problems, and a history of cancer in your grandmother, and the sudden cardiac event in your uncle… that does give us a starting point. To build a more complete picture, let's start with you. Do you currently have any medical conditions – anything that you’ve been diagnosed with or are being treated for?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I had strep throat once when I was a kid, but that's about it. I’m pretty healthy, actually. I eat okay, I guess. I try to. I don't smoke, never have. I drink… socially. A couple of beers on the weekend. I work a lot, so I don't have time for much else, honestly. I’m a teacher. Postsecondary. Engineering. It's stressful, but… it’s a job. What does this have to do with anything? Is this about lifestyle? Because I can try to be healthier, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Theriot. No history of significant illness, no smoking, and only social alcohol consumption – those are all positive factors. And understanding your lifestyle and stress levels is certainly relevant. We’re simply gathering information at this stage. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason other than the strep throat you mentioned?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve been pretty lucky, actually. I broke my arm once when I was a kid – climbing a tree, being an idiot – but that’s it. Nothing serious. I’ve always been… robust. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Honestly, I feel fine. That's why I'm here, because... well, you know. Family. I just want to be sure. This is getting a bit ridiculous, isn't it? I'm probably wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Theriot. Your concerns are valid, and it's always better to be thorough, especially with a family history like yours. You haven't had any surgeries or hospitalizations – that’s helpful information. Now, let's talk about your family a bit more directly. You mentioned your grandmother and uncle. Do you know if any other family members – perhaps parents, siblings, aunts, or cousins – have had any health issues, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. This is…complicated. My mother’s side is…old. Lots of people. Lots of…problems. My mom has high blood pressure, I think. She takes pills for it. And my aunt, the one on my mom’s side, she had breast cancer, a few years ago. She’s…okay now, I think. She lost a lot of hair, but she’s fine. My dad’s side…they’re healthier, mostly. He had some arthritis when he got older, but that's about it. Everyone on that side lives a really long time. It’s weird, honestly. One side is a mess, the other is…perfect. It's like genetics are playing a joke on us. Look, it's a lot. Are you writing all this down?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting everything carefully, Mr. Theriot. Thank you for sharing all of this information. It's helpful to have a complete picture. So, to summarize: Your mother has high blood pressure, and your aunt on your mother’s side had breast cancer. Your father’s side has a history of longevity with relatively good health. Now, regarding you specifically, do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I told you, I’m pretty healthy. I eat my vegetables…sometimes. I mean, I try to. Look, I’m an engineer, okay? I deal with logic and precision. I don't really need…stuff. I get enough sleep…usually. I mean, when I’m not grading papers. Honestly, I think my biggest health problem is stress. But you can't take a pill for that, can you? This is…frustrating. I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Theriot, and I apologize if it feels that way. We’re simply gathering information to assess your overall health risk, given your family history. The questions aren't meant to be an interrogation. And you’re right, there isn’t a single pill for stress, though there are many strategies to manage it. Finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or other substances?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I eat everything. I'm Indian, okay? We have a lot of spices. I've never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I think my biggest problem is… I just worry too much. It’s the family thing, I guess. Everyone's always sick or dying, so you just…expect it. It’s ridiculous. Look, can we just…do a test? See if I have everything? That would be great. I just want to know, you know? Is my heart okay? Is my blood sugar okay? Just tell me something concrete.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for something concrete, Mr. Theriot, and we will certainly proceed with some testing. Based on your family history – particularly your grandmother’s diabetes and heart problems, your aunt’s breast cancer, and your mother’s high blood pressure – I recommend a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your blood sugar, kidney function, and electrolytes, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a complete blood count. We can also do an electrocardiogram to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that sounds… good. That’s what I want. Just…test me. Tell me if everything is okay. Please. Honestly, I’ve been stressed about this for weeks. Just knowing something…anything…will be a relief. Okay. Let's do it. What do I have to do? Blood work? ECG? Whatever it takes. Just get it over with. Is it going to be painful? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. We’ll start with the blood work and the ECG. The blood work will require a small sample of blood to be drawn from your arm. It is a brief pinch, and most people tolerate it well. If you’re anxious about needles, please let the phlebotomist know, and they can take extra care to make you comfortable. The ECG is completely painless – it involves placing small adhesive sensors on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart’s electrical activity. If you’re ready, we can head to the lab now. The lab technician will draw your blood, and then we can proceed with the ECG here in the examination room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, let’s just get it done. Blood first, then…sensors. Whatever. I'll try not to faint. Honestly, this is ridiculous. But…okay. Let's go. Just…lead the way. The sooner this is over, the better. And… please tell the needle person I'm a bit of a wimp. Just…be gentle. That’s all I ask. Is it going to take long? I have a grading deadline on Friday.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. I will personally inform the phlebotomist of your aversion to needles, and they will be extra gentle. The blood draw shouldn’t take more than ten to fifteen minutes, and the ECG will be relatively quick as well—perhaps another ten minutes. We will try to be as efficient as possible so you can meet your grading deadline. If you’ll follow me, the lab is just down the hall to your right. We’ll get everything taken care of promptly.
PATIENT: Okay. Let’s go then. Honestly, I’m probably wasting everyone’s time. But…it’s better safe than sorry, right? It's just... the family thing. It always is. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: It is never a waste of time to prioritize your health, Mr. Theriot. Your concerns are valid, and it's wise to be proactive, especially with your family history. I’ll be right here to guide you through the process. We'll get this taken care of quickly and efficiently. Here we are. The phlebotomist, Sarah, is expecting you. I’ll wait just outside if you prefer, or I can stay with you if you'd like.
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay. Please…just stay nearby. I don’t want to be alone in there. It's just…needles. It's stupid, I know. But…please? Just be close. And…remind them to be gentle. Okay. Here we go. This is going to be awful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Theriot. I’m right here. I’ll make sure everything goes smoothly. “Sarah, this is Mr. Theriot. He’s a bit anxious about needles, so if you could be extra gentle, that would be greatly appreciated.” Just focus on your breathing, and let me know if you need anything at all. Sarah is very skilled and will make the process as comfortable as possible.
PATIENT: Just…hurry up. The sooner it’s over, the better. Honestly, this is ridiculous. But…okay. Do whatever you need to do. Just…be quick. And…gentle. Please. It's just… I don't like this. At all.
DOCTOR: “Alright, Mr. Theriot, just a quick pinch. Try to relax your arm. Deep breaths, remember?
PATIENT: Ugh! That…that wasn't very gentle! Honestly, it feels like a stab wound. Are you sure you're a professional? It's okay…it's okay… just… hurry up. Please. I feel lightheaded.
DOCTOR: “Oh dear, I apologize sincerely, Mr. Theriot. Sometimes the veins can be a bit tricky, and it takes a bit of maneuvering. It really is only a moment longer. I'm being as careful as possible.” “You're doing very well, Mr. Theriot. Just focus on your breathing. It's almost done.”
PATIENT: Just…finish it! Please! I feel sick. Honestly, I hate needles. I really, really hate them. Is it almost done? Tell me it’s almost done.
DOCTOR: “Alright, all done, Mr. Theriot. Just hold this here for a few minutes, and you’ll be all set.” “Here you go. Take a few deep breaths. You did wonderfully, despite your aversion to needles. It’s completely normal to feel a little shaken up after that.” “Let’s sit down for a moment, and you can relax before we proceed with the ECG.”
PATIENT: Ugh. I…I need a minute. Honestly, that was awful. The worst. I don’t know how people do this regularly. Is the ECG…more needles? Please tell me it’s not more needles.
DOCTOR: “No, Mr. Theriot, the ECG doesn’t involve any needles at all. It’s completely painless. We simply apply small, adhesive sensors – like stickers – to your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart’s electrical activity. It takes only a few minutes, and you can be fully clothed for it." “I understand your anxiety, and I apologize again for the unpleasant experience with the blood draw. We'll take things at your pace. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay. No needles. That’s…good. Stickers are okay. I can handle stickers. Yes. Please explain it. Just…tell me exactly what’s going to happen. And…how long it takes. And…that it won’t hurt. Please. I just want this over with. Honestly, my grading deadline is looming, and I’m wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: “Certainly, Mr. Theriot. Absolutely. The ECG is a very straightforward procedure. We’ll have you lie comfortably on your back, and our technician will gently place small, adhesive sensors—they’re about the size of a quarter—on specific points on your chest, arms, and legs. These sensors detect the electrical signals produced by your heart with each heartbeat.” “The technician will then connect these sensors to a machine that records your heart’s activity on a graph. The whole process takes only about five to ten minutes, and you won’t feel anything at all – no pain, no discomfort. You can simply relax and breathe normally while the machine does its work. After that, we’ll review the results together." “Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay. Lie down. Stickers. No pain. Five to ten minutes. Yeah. That… sounds okay. As long as it doesn't involve anything sharp. Let's just…get it over with. Lead the way. But please… make sure those stickers are gentle too. Honestly, my anxiety is through the roof.
DOCTOR: "Absolutely, Mr. Theriot. Gentle stickers, I promise. And we'll take things at your pace. I’ll be right there with you every step of the way.” “If you’ll lie back, we can get started. The technician, Lisa, is ready to apply the sensors. She’s very skilled and gentle.” “Lisa, this is Mr. Theriot. He’s a bit anxious, so if you could be extra careful and explain everything as you go, that would be greatly appreciated.”
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go. Just…stickers. No pain. Please. Just…hurry up. Honestly, I’m wasting valuable time here. My grading deadline is looming, and this is taking forever.
DOCTOR: “Alright, Mr. Theriot, I’m going to place these small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. They’re just like Band-Aids, and they won’t hurt at all. I’ll clean the area with a little alcohol first, just to make sure the sensors stick properly. You might feel a slight coolness when I apply them, but that’s all.” “There you go. Just a little coolness. We’ll place a few more now, and then we’ll connect them to the machine.” “You’re doing very well, Mr. Theriot. Just relax and breathe normally. We’re almost finished.”
PATIENT: Okay. Coolness. Just a little. Breathe normally. Just…hurry up. Honestly, my grading deadline is looming. This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: “Alright, just a few more now. This one goes on your arm…and this one on your leg. Almost finished. You’re doing great.” “Alright, we’re all set. Just lie still and relax for a few minutes while the machine records your heart’s activity. It’ll only take a few minutes.” “You’re doing wonderfully, Mr. Theriot. Just focus on your breathing. We’ll review the results together shortly.”
PATIENT: Just…relax. Just relax. Just…get it over with. Honestly, this is taking forever. My grading deadline is looming.
DOCTOR: “Alright, we’re all done, Mr. Theriot. That wasn’t so bad, was it?
PATIENT: Ugh. No. It was awful. But… it’s over. Is it done? Can I go now? Honestly, my grading deadline is looming, and I’m wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: “Yes, it’s all done, Mr. Theriot. You can absolutely go now. Lisa will send the results to me, and I’ll review them as quickly as possible. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes to analyze the ECG. I’ll let you know the results as soon as I have them." “Why don’t you go back to your office and try to relax?
PATIENT: Okay. Relax. Right. Thanks. Let me know as soon as you have something. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of time. But… thanks.
DOCTOR: "You're very welcome, Mr. Theriot. I’ll let you know as soon as I have the results. And remember, prioritizing your health is never a waste of time. Try not to stress too much, and I'll see you shortly.” .
