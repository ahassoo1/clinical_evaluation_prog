DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I am Dr. EADDY. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain… when I breathe deep. It’s been… a little while now. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Things aren’t so clear these days.
DOCTOR: I see. Pain with deep breathing. And you say you’re not certain how long this has been occurring?
PATIENT: That's right. A few weeks, maybe? Hard to say. It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it’s just a little ache, other times… sharper. It doesn’t last long, thankfully. I just want to make sure it’s nothing… serious. I’m an old man, Doctor. These things happen.
DOCTOR: Indeed. “These things happen.” Very well. Can you describe the location of the pain, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… right here, I think. Sometimes it feels like it’s going into my back a little, too. But mostly here. It’s hard to pinpoint. It’s not… a bad pain, usually. Just… noticeable. Especially when I try to take a good, deep breath. Like I said, it doesn’t last long. Do you… need me to be more specific? I’m sorry I’m not very helpful.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful to be more precise, Mr. Ruocco. Is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, a pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… um… it's more of an ache, I guess. Not sharp, definitely not. And not really a pressure, either. Just… a discomfort. Like a soreness, deep down. It’s… hard to explain. It's not the kind of pain that stops me from doing things, you understand? I still work… construction, you know. Mostly managing now, not doing the heavy lifting. But I’m still on my feet. Does that make sense? I don't want to cause trouble. Is this something serious?
DOCTOR: So, an ache with deep breaths, localized to the upper chest, occasionally radiating to the back. You state it does not impede your daily activities. Have you experienced any cough, fever, or shortness of breath accompanying this pain?
PATIENT: Cough… not really. I had a little tickle in my throat last week, but that’s it. No fever, no. And I haven’t been short of breath… not that I’ve noticed. I get a little winded sometimes, climbing stairs, but that’s just from being old, I think. No, no cough, no fever, no shortness of breath. Just this… ache. I really don't want to bother you with something small, Doctor. I've lived a long life, and things wear down, you know? But my daughter… she insisted I come. She worries.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, and palpate your chest wall. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm not as spry as I used to be. Is this okay? I don't want to… mess things up.
DOCTOR: Take a few more deep breaths, Mr. Ruocco. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, although slightly diminished in the bases, consistent with age. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the upper sternum. No crepitus noted. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated. This doesn't immediately suggest anything alarming, Mr. Ruocco, but given your age and the reported tenderness, we should order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying musculoskeletal or pulmonary issues.
PATIENT: An X-ray, huh? Alright, that sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… not too much radiation, if you could? My daughter… she’s always worried about things like that. So, it’s not… serious? You don’t think it’s my lungs? Or my heart? I just want to get back to work, you know? Managing the crew… they need me. Is it alright if I schedule that X-ray for tomorrow? I have a meeting in the afternoon.
DOCTOR: We are utilizing low-dose radiation technology, Mr. Ruocco. I understand your concerns. An X-ray is a precautionary measure, to provide a more definitive assessment. It’s unlikely to be a serious cardiac issue, given the examination findings, but we must be thorough. Yes, scheduling the X-ray for tomorrow is acceptable. I will have the radiology department contact you directly to arrange the appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had any trouble with medications. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but nothing serious. I usually just take something over-the-counter for that. No, no allergies. My wife… she always kept track of those things. It’s been a long time. Just… no allergies. I’m pretty sure. Is there anything else? I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll proceed with the chest X-ray as scheduled. Once the results are available, we will review them and discuss the appropriate course of action. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased pain, shortness of breath, fever – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time. Just… try not to worry too much about it, alright? I’m an old man, things ache. It’s probably just that. I’ll schedule that X-ray. Thank you again, Doctor EADDY.
