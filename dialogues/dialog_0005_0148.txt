DOCTOR: Alright, Noelani Stepro, 44 years old. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. It’s… pain. Down there. I… I don’t quite know how to explain it. It’s just… painful.
DOCTOR: “Down there,” okay. Well, a lot of things can cause pain in that area. Let’s try to narrow it down. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. Honestly, Doctor… my memory isn’t what it used to be. I feel like… a few weeks, maybe? It’s been coming and going, not constant, but… noticeable when it happens. I wish I could be more specific. It just sort of… started.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, coming and going… alright. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… It's… a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it’s sharper, but not always. It’s not… a constant throbbing, if that makes sense? More like… a heavy feeling, and then a quick stab now and then. It’s hard to say, really. Does that… help at all?
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with occasional sharp pains. And where exactly are you feeling this pain?
PATIENT: Um… well, in my… testicles, I suppose. Both of them, sometimes just one. It's… difficult to pinpoint exactly. It's just… there. I’m sorry, it feels silly explaining this. Is that… normal to talk about?
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Ms. Stepro. Men experience testicular pain for various reasons, and it's perfectly normal to discuss these concerns with your doctor. That's what I'm here for. So, both testicles are affected at times. Is anything specific that brings on the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know. Um… not that I’ve noticed, really. It doesn’t seem to be related to anything. Walking, sitting, lying down… it just happens. Sometimes after I’ve been working with the wood, maybe? But I’m on my feet a lot with that, so it could just be from that. I honestly can’t say. It’s just… random.
DOCTOR: Random, okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm… I don’t think so. No fever, no nausea. Everything else feels… normal, I suppose. Maybe a little tired lately, but I always chalk that up to the work. I haven’t noticed any swelling, or… anything like that. No change in urination, or… other things. Just the pain. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Stepro, given your description, it could be a number of things – everything from a minor muscle strain to something a bit more concerning. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s causing it. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table, and I’ll take a look. I’m going to palpate your abdomen and then do a testicular exam. It will be quick, but please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that’s… okay. Not really. A little pressure, but no pain. It just feels a little strange, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. That one. That one feels… tender. Just a little bit, when you press there. It's not… sharp pain, but definitely uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. I feel a small… nodule on your left testicle. It’s quite small, but it’s definitely there. I'm also noting some mild swelling and tenderness. Given your description of the pain and my findings during the exam, we need to rule out some possibilities. The most important thing we need to do right now is an ultrasound. It will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. I'm also going to order a urine test to rule out infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… and a urine test… Yes. Yes, that sounds… necessary. If that’s what you think is best. Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? What could it be? I’m getting quite scared now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepro, it's too early to say definitively. A small nodule could be a number of things – most often, it's a benign cyst or a varicocele – but it could also be something more concerning, like a tumor. That’s why we need the ultrasound to get a better look and determine what’s going on. It’s important to rule out any potential issues. The urine test will help us determine if there’s an infection contributing to the pain. I want to be upfront with you – we need to take this seriously. I'm going to schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning. We will get the results back quickly, and then we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… okay. No… I don’t think so. Not right now. Just… what if it is something bad? What are the… the next steps then? Will I need surgery? I'm very nervous about all of this. And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepro, it's completely understandable that you’re feeling anxious. Let’s take things one step at a time. We haven't even seen the ultrasound yet, so we don't know what we're dealing with. If it is something requiring further intervention, there are many options available. If it turns out to be a tumor, surgery might be necessary, but that's not a certainty. We would also discuss other options like radiation therapy, depending on the type and stage of the tumor. And if surgery is necessary, it’s usually very effective, especially when caught early. Pain management is also a priority, and we would ensure you’re comfortable throughout the entire process. Right now, we need to focus on getting the ultrasound results. I’m going to write you a referral order, and the radiology department will schedule the appointment. They’ll explain the procedure to you in detail. Do you want me to write down the name and number of a good oncologist, just in case?
PATIENT: Yes… please. That would be… very helpful. Just knowing… knowing someone is there. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly, even when I’m… scared. I really appreciate it. I think that's all for now. I just… I need to process everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stepro. It's my job to make sure you have all the information you need. Remember, we're going to take this one step at a time. Don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns, even if it's just to talk. I will also be calling you tomorrow after I receive the results to discuss the plan. Here's the referral for the ultrasound and the oncologist information. Please take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much until we have more information. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I… I think I’ll just go home and try to rest. Goodbye, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepro. You take care now. And please, call if you need anything at all. .
