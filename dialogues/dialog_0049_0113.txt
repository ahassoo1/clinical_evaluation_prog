DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nestingen, you said? Hmm. Well, it’s this… business with the, uh… needing to go. A lot. It’s just… inconvenient, you know? Especially when I’m out working on the farm. It’s not like it used to be, that's for sure. Though, to be honest, I don’t rightly remember when it used to be, exactly. Just… less.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, as we get older, things do change. “Needing to go a lot,” you say. Is this a recent development, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I suppose. Though, everything feels gradual when you get to be my age, doesn't it? It's not like I woke up one day and suddenly needed to run to the… well, you know. It just… crept up on me. Honestly, I’ve been meaning to get it checked for a while now, but things always come up on the farm. You understand. It’s not like I can just stop tending to the crops, you know?
DOCTOR: Farming. Yes. A demanding profession. And your memory… you mentioned it's not what it used to be?
PATIENT: Demanding is one word for it. Exhausting is another. And the memory… well, let's just say I don't recall things as vividly as my wife does. She keeps track of everything, bless her heart. I get bits and pieces, flashes really. It's frustrating, to be honest. Not that it matters much, really. What’s done is done, right? But… this with the… frequent visits, I think it's been worse the last few months. Maybe. It all blurs together. Do you… need me to be more specific? Because honestly, I'm not sure what specifics you're lookin' for.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s try to be systematic. When you say “frequent,” how many times a day would you estimate you’re needing to urinate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking the impossible. I don't count, Doctor. I'm a farmer, not a bookkeeper. Let me think… More than usual, definitely. Before, I could go all morning without needing to go. Now… it feels like I'm just constantly… going. Maybe… six, seven times a day? It could be more, I really don’t know. And sometimes at night, too, which is new. Interrupts my sleep, naturally. My wife gets annoyed. Says I’m rattling the bed.
DOCTOR: And when you urinate, do you feel like you are completely emptying your bladder, or do you feel like you still need to go afterwards?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a good question. You know, I hadn’t really thought about it. Now that you mention it… sometimes I feel like I’m still… holding back. Not a lot, but a little. Like there's a bit left. It's not painful, just… not fully empty. It’s a strange feeling. Never used to be like that. Though, again, I don't remember when it changed. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It does. It does. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Thank goodness for that. Pain… sometimes a little discomfort, a dull ache low down, but nothing serious. It comes and goes. I just figured it was my age, you know? Things achein’ here and there. I don’t make a fuss over every little twinge. My wife is the one who finally convinced me to come see you. She says I'm ignoring things too much. She's probably right, to be honest. Always is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any difficulty starting to urinate?
PATIENT: Difficulty… hmm. Not usually. It usually starts alright. Though… sometimes it takes a moment. Not a long moment, mind you. Just… a little hesitation. Like it needs a bit of… encouragement. I don't know if that makes sense. It’s not a strong stream right away, if you know what I mean. Weak, maybe? Then it gets going. It’s not painful, just… not as powerful as it used to be. Honestly, Doctor, I’m probably making too much of nothing. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll check your abdomen and do a quick prostate exam. It’s standard procedure, given your symptoms. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A prostate exam? Oh. Well, now. I’ve heard things about those. Not pleasant things. Is it… absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, I’ve never had one before. And frankly, the thought of it doesn’t fill me with joy. I suppose if you say it's necessary… but I'd appreciate a little warning before… well, you know.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure to rule out any abnormalities, Mr. Segretto. It's a quick exam, and it will give us valuable information. It's unlikely to be particularly comfortable, but I will be as gentle as possible. We'll need to perform it to determine the cause of your symptoms. It's preferable to proceed with a thorough examination now rather than delay and potentially miss something important. Do you have any… anxieties about the procedure I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Anxieties? Well, Doctor, I'm an old man. I've lived a long life, seen a lot of things. But that doesn’t mean I enjoy having… things poked and prodded. It's just… a little undignified, you know? And I've always been a private person. I suppose if you say it’s important… alright. But please, be quick about it. And gentle, as you said. My wife will have my hide if I come home complainin’. She always says I’m too stoic, need to speak up when somethin’s botherin’ me. Very well. Let’s get it over with. But warn me before you… begin. A little warning is all I ask.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie on your left side with your knees drawn up. I’ll explain each step as I go. It will only take a moment. And remember, it's important to be relaxed. The more tense you are, the more uncomfortable it will be.
