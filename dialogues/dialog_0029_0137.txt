DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s wonderful that you’re thinking about what’s best for both you and your son. We'll get everything sorted out with this exam so you have the paperwork the facility needs. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall… hmm. I okay, I think. I get tired easy. Old lady tired, you know? And my knees… they bother me sometimes. But I walk… I still walk to the store, most days. And I eat good food. My son, he make sure of that. I take… one pill. For… for my water pressure. Doctor back home, he give it to me.

DOCTOR: That’s good. Drinking water and eating fruit is excellent. Now, Ms. Abdollahi, I'm going to ask about any medications you're taking, beyond the blood pressure pill. Do you take anything over-the-counter, like pain relievers, vitamins, or herbal supplements?

DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your mother and some sort of blood condition in your sister. We can try to get more information later if that’s alright. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, no smoke. Never smoke. My husband, he smoke a little, but he gone now. I no like smoke. Bad for you. I always tell him, but… he like it. I no smoke. My son, he no smoke either. Is good.

DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine occasionally. That's fine. Now, Ms. Abdollahi, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Is… is good. You check me. I hope I no have nothing bad. Is good to know. Where you want me to… to go?
DOCTOR: Just have a seat on the table here, Ms. Abdollahi. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, look in your ears and eyes, and feel your abdomen. It won’t take long. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. Is little cold in here, no? But is okay. You do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a little cool. I’ll see if I can adjust the temperature. Your blood pressure is 140 over 85. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your ears look good, no sign of infection. And your eyes look healthy as well. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Just relax. Do you feel any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… just little full. I eat good today, Doctor. My son, he make nice lunch. But no pain. Everything feel… normal. Maybe little tired, but… that is old age, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And your abdomen feels soft. Okay, Ms. Abdollahi, that completes the basic physical exam. Everything seems reasonably normal, though your blood pressure is a little elevated. Now, do you have a list of any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think so. My son, he write everything down. Here. Is… is little messy, sorry. He write it last time I see doctor. Is… is for the blood pressure, and… and the vitamin C. That is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, this says you're taking Lisinopril 10mg once a day for your blood pressure, and you occasionally take Vitamin C 500mg. That matches what we discussed. Now, I’d like to order a few lab tests, just to get a more complete picture of your health. We’ll check your blood count, kidney function, liver function, cholesterol, and blood sugar. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lab tests? Is… is that needles? I no like needles. Is… is very important? My son, he say I need to do everything for the old people place. But I no like needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, it will involve a small blood draw, a needle, I understand your concern. It is important, Ms. Abdollahi, but it won't take long, and it's often the best way to get the information we need. It will help us make sure you’re healthy enough for the assisted living facility and identify any potential issues that need to be addressed. We can minimize discomfort. It's a quick pinch, and then it's over. Would you like me to explain the tests a little more?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. If is for the old people place, I do it. My son, he say I need to do everything right. But… but can you be quick? I no like needles. And… and can I sit down? I feel little dizzy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We will take things slowly and you are in safe hands. I will get the nurse to draw the blood. She’s very gentle. And I’ll stay right here with you. It will only take a few minutes. We'll start by having you sit up a little. I'll also get you a glass of water. Just breathe deeply. The nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: Okay… Water is good. And… and you stay with me? My son, he no here. Is good to have Doctor with me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I'll stay right here with you the whole time, Ms. Abdollahi. You’re not alone. We’ll just wait for the nurse. Just focus on your breathing. Deep breaths in… and slow breaths out. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: Little cold, maybe? But… is okay. You stay with me is enough. I… I worry about the old people place. Is good place, my son say. But… is different. I live with my son now. He take care of me.
DOCTOR: It's completely normal to feel anxious about a big change like that. It’s a big adjustment, and it's okay to feel sad or worried about leaving your current situation. It sounds like you have a wonderful son who cares for you very much, and that’s something to be grateful for. We’ll do everything we can to make sure you're healthy and prepared for this transition. The nurse should be here any moment now. Just try to relax. We’ll take things one step at a time.
PATIENT: Okay. Is… is that her? Is she… gentle? I no want too much blood.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is Nurse Ramirez. She is very experienced and very gentle. She’ll take good care of you. Nurse Ramirez, this is Ms. Abdollahi. She’s a little anxious about the blood draw, so if you could be extra reassuring, that would be wonderful. I'll stay right here with her the whole time.
