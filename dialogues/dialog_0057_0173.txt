DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Sieh, nice to meet you too! Well, I've just been getting these chills lately, and it's kind of annoying. It's not a fever or anything, just…cold. It's been going on for a few days now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills for a few days. I understand. And when you say chills, can you describe them a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It's not like a shaking cold, more like…a sudden wave of coldness that goes through me. It happens on and off, and it doesn't matter if I'm warm or not. Like, I could be sitting in the sun and still get them. They don't last very long, maybe a few minutes each time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Sudden waves of coldness, even when you're warm. And how frequent would you say these waves are happening throughout the day?
PATIENT: It's hard to say exactly… maybe like, four or five times a day? Sometimes more, sometimes less. It's not constant, thankfully. It's just…enough to be noticeable and a bit worrying, you know? I haven't been feeling sick otherwise, which is why I figured I should check it out.
DOCTOR: Right, intermittent chills, four or five times a day, and no other symptoms. That's good information. Now, aside from the chills, have you noticed anything else at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I've been a little tired, but honestly, who isn't? Work's been busy. No cough, no sore throat, no aches… nothing else really stands out. Oh! Maybe a little bit of a headache a couple of times, but it's really mild and goes away quickly. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, a little fatigue and very mild, intermittent headaches. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, just to get a more complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. I don't really have much of a medical history, thankfully. I had the usual childhood stuff, like chickenpox, but nothing major. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but it healed fine. And I had a pretty standard divorce a couple of years ago, if that counts! Other than that, I’m generally pretty healthy. I do have private insurance through work, if that’s relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know about the insurance, thank you. And no chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing chronic. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. I try to eat pretty well and get some exercise when I can, even though it's hard with work. Honestly, I'm usually a pretty healthy person, which is why these chills are so strange. It just doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No significant past medical history. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully! I’m pretty lucky in that regard. Just the broken arm when I was little, and that didn’t need surgery, just a cast. Anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… My mom has high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather on my dad's side had diabetes. Other than that, not really that I know of. My family isn’t really the type to talk about medical stuff much, if that makes sense. It's more like, "Oh, Grandma had something," but nobody really knows what it was. Sorry if that’s not very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jailenne. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history in detail. High blood pressure in your mother and diabetes in your grandfather – we’ll make a note of that. Now, I'm going to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a while ago. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm not really into any of that. I prefer a good cup of tea, honestly! Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does. No smoking, no recreational drugs, and very occasional alcohol use in the past. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. I try to get everything I need from my diet. Maybe a multivitamin sometimes, but I’m not very consistent with it. Honestly, I'm pretty good about avoiding medication if I can help it. That's everything, right? Is it time for you to examine me?
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Excellent. Yes, let's move on to a physical exam. If you could please have a seat on the table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and just do a general physical assessment. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'm a little nervous, but I trust you, Dr. Sieh. Just let me know if anything feels weird or uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Lymph nodes feel normal, no swelling. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Ears look normal as well. Your pulse is 72 and your blood pressure is 120/80, which is within the normal range. Everything appears normal on the initial physical exam. Now, based on what you've told me, and what I’ve found, the chills, fatigue and mild headaches, we need to explore potential causes. It could be something as simple as a mild viral infection, or stress. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some routine blood work. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds…reasonable. I mean, I'm glad everything seems normal, but I'm also glad you're being thorough. Blood work sounds good. I just want to figure out what's going on and get back to feeling normal. Is it a lot of blood? I'm a little squeamish. And will my insurance cover it?
DOCTOR: It's not a lot of blood, Jailenne, just a standard vial or two. We'll be checking a complete blood count to look for signs of infection or anemia, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. And yes, your private insurance should cover it. I'll have the lab technician confirm your coverage before they draw the blood, just to be certain. I'm going to write the order now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll call you when they're ready. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that all sounds good. A couple of vials, insurance should cover it… I can handle that. I just hope it's nothing serious. Thank you, Dr. Sieh, for taking the time to listen and not dismissing my concerns. I appreciate it. Should I fast before the blood work?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. It's important to me that you feel heard. And yes, please do fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, just water. It will give us the most accurate results. Here's the lab order form. They'll give you instructions at the lab as well. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss a plan. It usually takes a couple of days. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – like if you develop a fever, severe headache, or body aches – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you head down to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Fast for 8-12 hours, contact you if things get worse… got it. Thank you again, Dr. Sieh. I really appreciate your help. I'll go down to the lab now and get it done. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. You too. Please let the lab technician know if you have any questions, and don’t hesitate to call the clinic if anything comes up. We'll be in touch once the results are back. Take care!
