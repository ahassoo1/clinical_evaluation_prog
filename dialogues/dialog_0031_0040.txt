DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side… my flank, I think they call it. And I keep getting these water infections, you see. It’s been happening on and off for a while now, and it's starting to get a bit bothersome. The doctor back home mentioned something about my kidneys, but I didn't quite catch all of it.
DOCTOR: I see. Flank pain and recurrent urinary tract infections. That is concerning, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me more about this flank pain?
PATIENT: Right. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It's not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a dull ache, mostly. It comes and goes, and it’s usually on my right side, but sometimes it feels it on both sides. It gets worse if I move around too much, or if I've been standing for a long time. It doesn't really stop me from doing things, but it's always there, you know? And sometimes it feels like it goes right through to my back. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache, intermittent, right-sided primarily but sometimes bilateral, worsened with movement, radiating to the back. That’s helpful. And how long have you been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's been… a few years, I think. On and off. It started very mild, just a little niggle now and then. But it’s been getting worse over the last year or so, definitely. The water infections… they started around the same time, maybe a little later. It's hard to keep track, to be honest. Things sort of blend together when you get to my age, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's easy for things to blur over time. So, the pain and the infections have been present for a few years, worsening over the last year. Now, concerning the urinary tract infections – how often would you say you’re experiencing them?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It used to be maybe once or twice a year, but lately it’s been more like every two or three months. Sometimes a bit more frequent if I haven’t been drinking enough water, I think. It’s uncomfortable, of course, but I’ve been treating them with the usual medicines the doctor prescribes. But they keep coming back, which is what worried me enough to come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increasing frequency of UTIs, now roughly every two to three months, despite treatment. That is definitely something we need to investigate further. Have you noticed any other symptoms with these infections?
PATIENT: Well, the usual, you know. Needing to go to the toilet all the time, even when there's not much there. A burning sensation when I go. Sometimes a bit of blood in the urine, but not always. And I get very tired, a bit achy. It’s not a strong tiredness, more like a general feeling of being unwell. I haven't had a fever or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, frequent urination, burning sensation, occasional blood in the urine, and a general feeling of malaise with the infections, but no fever. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A doctor back home – a specialist – told me I have something wrong with my kidneys. Polycystic Kidney Disease, I think it was called. He explained it to me, but I'm afraid a lot of it went over my head. Something about lots of little cysts on my kidneys. He sent me for some scans, but I haven't really kept up with it since. It wasn’t causing me much trouble at the time, so I didn't push it too hard. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very important. Polycystic Kidney Disease is a significant condition, and it absolutely explains a lot of what you're describing. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with PKD?
PATIENT: Let me think… it must have been… oh, goodness… about ten years ago, I'd say. Maybe a little longer. I was having some routine blood tests, and they came back a bit off. That led to the scans, and the specialist explained it to me. He said it’s something you inherit, that my father had it too. He said it could cause problems down the line, but at the time, I felt fine. I just had regular check-ups for a while, and then… well, life gets in the way, you know. I haven’t been back to that specialist since.
DOCTOR: I understand. Life certainly does get in the way. So, diagnosed with PKD about ten years ago, inherited from your father. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, but that was a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, when I was a bit clumsy. But no surgeries or hospital stays since then. Mostly just the usual colds and flu, you know. Nothing that needed a doctor for very long.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Just the antibiotics when I get a water infection, like I mentioned before. The doctor usually prescribes Trimethoprim. And sometimes I take paracetamol for aches and pains, but not very often. Otherwise, no. I try to avoid taking too many medicines, if I can. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Trimethoprim for UTIs as needed, and paracetamol occasionally. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I haven't had any problems with medicines. I'm a pretty simple man, you see. Not much bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone in a small house in town. I keep myself busy, mostly gardening. I enjoy that, keeps me active. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with my dinner once a month, if that. I try to eat healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables. I'm retired now, so I have plenty of time for those things.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to perform a physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever’s needed to figure out what’s going on with me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I'll also check your blood pressure and temperature. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Do you feel any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. Just a little bit of… pressure, maybe. It's not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, like I described before. It’s a little bit more tender on my right side, but not too bad. There. That’s a bit more sensitive, I think. But it's not unbearable.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m also going to check your lower extremities for any swelling. Your legs look good, no swelling. Okay, based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, I’m concerned about a few things. Your history of PKD, the recurrent UTIs, and the right flank pain are all suggestive of complications related to your kidney disease. The tenderness in your right flank could indicate a kidney infection or even a cyst that is becoming infected or causing obstruction.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good, does it? An infection, you say? I was hoping it wasn't anything too serious. What sort of tests do you think we need to do to find out for sure? And what can we do about it, if it is an infection? I'm a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Espinueva. It's best to get a clear picture of what's going on, and we will. To do that, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a urine analysis and urine culture to confirm if you have an active urinary tract infection and to identify the specific bacteria causing it. Second, a complete blood count to look for signs of infection, such as an elevated white blood cell count. And most importantly, I'd like to order a renal ultrasound to visualize your kidneys and assess their size, shape, and the presence of any cysts, obstructions, or other abnormalities. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds reasonable, Doctor. A scan to see what’s happening inside… that makes sense. I don’t think I have any questions about the tests themselves. Will these tests require me to go to the hospital? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m a bit anxious about waiting, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable to be anxious about waiting, Mr. Espinueva. The good news is that none of these tests require a hospital stay. The urine analysis and culture can be done right here in the clinic today. The renal ultrasound can be done at the imaging center across town. I’ll write you a referral, and they usually can get you in within a day or two. The urine results should be back within a few hours, and the ultrasound results typically take 24-48 hours to be reviewed by the radiologist. I will call you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. A couple of days… I can manage that. And you’ll call me as soon as you have the results? That's good to know. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Drinking lots of water, I suppose?
DOCTOR: Yes, drinking plenty of fluids is an excellent idea. Aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. Also, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. If you experience any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or increasing flank pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here’s the referral for the ultrasound. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much better knowing we’re getting this sorted out. I'll make sure to drink plenty of water.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if anything changes. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
