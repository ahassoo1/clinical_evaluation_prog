DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Redfern’s the name. Yeah, uh, sleep, mostly. And, well, feeling… not exactly bad, you understand. Just… not good. It’s been a bit of a thing since… well, since things happened. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I just figured I’d see if there was something to be done about it. Not a big fan of just… letting things be, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Redfern. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulties with sleep and a general sense of not feeling your best, and that these issues began following some significant events. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to address these concerns. Could you elaborate on what you mean by "things happened"?
PATIENT: Ugh. Right. That. It's… complicated. My wife, she… passed away. A little over a year ago now, I think? Time kinda blurs. It was… sudden. And things haven't really been the same since. I just… I don't sleep well. Wake up a lot. Not exactly nightmares, just… restless. And I don't have much energy, honestly. I get by, I fix instruments, but it's… effort. Is that what you wanted to know? It feels silly talking about it, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Redfern. It’s not silly at all. Losing your wife is a profoundly difficult experience, and it’s completely normal to experience difficulties with sleep and energy levels following such a loss. In fact, it would be unusual not to. A little over a year ago… that’s a significant amount of time, and grief can certainly have a lasting impact. Thank you for sharing that with me. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about your sleep?
PATIENT: Right, sleep. Okay. Well, I get in bed, usually around eleven, twelve-ish. Not a strict schedule, you understand. I used to be more regimented, but… what’s the point? Anyway, I lie there. Sometimes I drift off quick enough. Other times… hours. Just… thinking. Then I wake up. A lot. Maybe three, four times a night. Get up for water, sometimes. And I don’t exactly feel refreshed when I do get up in the morning. Just… tired. And I’m not really… hungry anymore either. Doesn't help with the energy, I suppose. Is that… detailed enough? I’m not much for listing things, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mr. Redfern. It sounds like you're experiencing both difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings throughout the night, leading to non-restorative sleep. And you’ve also noticed a decrease in your appetite. Those are all things we need to consider. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your weight since your wife passed away?
PATIENT: Weight? Not really. I mean, I haven’t exactly been trying to lose weight. Or gain it, for that matter. Probably a bit less, if I’m honest. My clothes are… looser, I suppose. But I wouldn’t say it’s anything dramatic. I’m a big fella anyway. Always have been. 190, give or take. And I’m… not exactly small. Not fat, you understand. Just… substantial. Is that… sufficient? I don’t really weigh myself regularly. Seems a bit pointless, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Redfern. It's helpful to know that you haven't noticed a significant weight change, even if your clothes feel a bit looser. We often use weight as a marker for overall health, but it’s not the only factor, and you're right, it's not always a reliable indicator. Now, regarding your energy levels and appetite… have you noticed any changes in your mood, perhaps feeling sad, hopeless, or irritable?
PATIENT: Irritable? Probably. I suppose. My… colleagues, they try to be understanding. But it's… tedious, constantly explaining things. They don’t get it. Hopeless… yeah, maybe a bit. Not constantly, but… some days. It just… feels like what’s the point, you know? Fix another violin, tune another piano… it’s all just… noise. Sad… well, obviously. It's not exactly a cheerful situation, is it? I try not to dwell on it. Makes things worse. But yeah, all of the above, probably. Just… not something I actively think about, if that makes sense. It just… is. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm just listing complaints now. It's all rather… pathetic.
DOCTOR: It's not pathetic at all, Mr. Redfern. It’s completely understandable to experience those feelings following such a profound loss. In fact, what you're describing – changes in mood, energy levels, sleep, and appetite – are all common symptoms of grief, and it’s important to acknowledge them. It sounds like you're still very much processing your loss, and that’s a natural part of the healing process. Now, let’s move onto some other questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. I've always been… sturdy, you understand. A bit of a cold now and then, the usual. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. Put me on some pills, but I stopped taking them. Didn't feel like they were doing much, and I don't like being reliant on… things. Other than that? Nothing major. Never broken any bones, never been in hospital. Just… generally robust. I'm a practical man, you see. I fix things, I don't need fixing. That's probably a silly thing to say. Is that what you wanted to know? It's all rather… boring, isn't it? No exciting medical history to report.
DOCTOR: It's not boring at all, Mr. Redfern. Knowing you have a history of high blood pressure is important, even if you’re not currently taking medication for it. We'll need to discuss that further. It’s good that you generally consider yourself to be in good health, though. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. Not a fan of… being cut open. Seems counterproductive. I fix things without dismantling them, if I can. Why would I let someone dismantle me? No. Never had any surgeries. Not even… tonsils, or anything like that. Always managed to avoid the… blade. Is that what you wanted to know? I'm rather… particular about my body, you see. It gets me where I need to go. And it fixes instruments. Why mess with a good thing? It all seems rather… unnecessary, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Redfern. It's good to know you haven't had any surgeries. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety, in your family?
PATIENT: Mental health… hmm. That’s… difficult. My family… we don’t really talk about those things. My father was… a stern man. Didn’t believe in… feelings, you understand? He was a builder, very practical. My mother… she was quiet. Just… kept to herself. I don’t recall anyone being… officially diagnosed with anything. There were… whispers, perhaps. My aunt, she was… eccentric. But that’s hardly the same thing, is it? We weren’t a family for… sharing. More for… doing. So, honestly, I don't know. Probably not. Or maybe. It’s really hard to say. They’re all… gone now, anyway. Does that… answer your question? It’s all a bit hazy, really. It's not something we ever discussed.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Redfern. It's understandable that you wouldn't have that information. Knowing family history can be helpful, but it’s not always possible to obtain. Let’s move on to your social habits. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched the stuff. My wife… she hated it. Said it smelled awful, and it was bad for your health. She was very… persuasive. And I suppose I agreed with her. I have no need for it. It seems a rather… pointless habit, frankly. Just… damaging. No, I don’t smoke. Never have, never will. And I certainly don’t enjoy being around people who do. It's a rather… unpleasant smell. Is that… sufficient? I'm a practical man, you see. I prefer clean air. And clean instruments. Everything should be… well-maintained. That includes my lungs.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Redfern. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I used to, occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Or a beer when watching football. Nothing excessive, you understand. But after… well, after my wife passed, I stopped. Didn't seem… appropriate. It didn't help. Just… made things worse. So, no. I don't drink. Not anymore. There's really no point, is there? It just… dulls the senses. And I need my senses. For fixing instruments. And… well, for getting through the day. So, no. No alcohol. Is that… what you needed to know? It’s all rather… self-explanatory, really. Some things just… aren’t helpful. And alcohol is one of them.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Redfern. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let’s talk about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements. You mentioned stopping the medication for your blood pressure, but are you taking anything else currently?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I stopped the blood pressure pills, as I said. And I don’t really believe in… relying on things. I prefer to fix things myself, you understand? If I need something, I try to find a natural solution. I eat well, mostly. And I get enough sleep… well, I try to. But no medications. Not even aspirin. I don’t like putting things into my body that don’t belong there. It seems… counterproductive. I'm a practical man, you see. I prefer… simplicity. So, no. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Is that… clear? I'm rather… careful about what I consume. Everything should be… natural. And I prefer to avoid… artificial enhancements. It's all rather… straightforward, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very clear, Mr. Redfern. Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I’ll check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and just take a general look at you. It will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. I suppose it can’t hurt. Though I doubt you’ll find anything. I’m a sturdy man, as I said. But go ahead. Do your… thing. Just… try not to poke around too much. I’m not particularly fond of being… prodded. But fine. Do your exam. I’ll try to… cooperate. Is there anything I need to do? Remove my shoes, perhaps? Just… tell me what you need. I’m a practical man, you see. I’ll do whatever is necessary. Just… let’s get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the better. Is that… alright? I’m not particularly looking forward to it, but I suppose it’s… necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. You can remain fully clothed, no need to remove your shoes. Just relax as best as you can. Your heart rate is regular, a bit elevated at 78 beats per minute, but not concerning given your current state. Lung sounds are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your blood pressure is 145/90. That is elevated, and confirms the previous diagnosis of hypertension. We'll need to discuss management of that. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Reflexes are normal and neurological function appears intact. Overall, your physical exam is relatively unremarkable, but the elevated blood pressure is something we need to address.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Well, that's… not surprising. I haven’t been paying much attention to those things, as I said. Not a fan of… doctors and needles and pills and all that. Just… not my thing. But… what does that mean? Do I need… medication? I was hoping to avoid that. Is there anything else I can do? Eat less salt? Exercise more? I fix instruments all day, that's exercise, isn't it? Just… tell me what I need to do. I'm a practical man, you see. I'll do whatever is necessary. But I’d rather avoid… pills, if possible. It all seems rather… unnecessary. Just… tell me what my options are. And keep it simple. I don't want any complicated explanations. Just… the basics. Is that… alright? I’m trying to… cooperate, but I'm not particularly fond of all this… medical talk.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Redfern. It’s good that you’re already considering lifestyle changes like reducing salt intake and maintaining physical activity – those are excellent first steps. And yes, fixing instruments does involve physical exertion, which is beneficial. However, given that your blood pressure is significantly elevated, lifestyle changes alone may not be sufficient to bring it under control. Untreated hypertension can lead to serious complications like heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. We have several options. We can start with a trial of lifestyle modifications for a few months and recheck your blood pressure. If it doesn’t improve, we can consider starting you on a low-dose medication. There are many different types of blood pressure medications available, and we can find one that’s right for you with minimal side effects. Alternatively, we can start medication now and monitor your blood pressure closely. This would allow us to get it under control more quickly and reduce your risk of complications. Before we decide on a course of action, I'd like to order some blood work to assess your kidney function and check for other underlying health conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… of course. More poking and prodding. Just… what I needed. Fine. Do it. Get it over with. But I’m not promising anything. I still think medication is… unnecessary. I’d rather try the lifestyle changes first, I suppose. Reduce salt, exercise more… I can do that. But I don’t want to be on pills forever. Is that… possible? A trial period? And then recheck? No promises, mind you. I still think it’s all a bit… overblown. But fine. Let’s try the lifestyle changes first. And then we’ll see. But I’m not particularly optimistic. Just… get the blood work done. And keep it simple. I don’t want any complicated explanations. Just… the basics. Is that… alright? I’m trying to… cooperate, but I’m not particularly fond of all this… medical intervention. It just seems… excessive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. That’s perfectly reasonable. We can certainly start with a trial of lifestyle modifications and recheck your blood pressure in three months. We'll also do the blood work today as a baseline. I’ll give you a list of recommendations for dietary changes, including reducing sodium intake, and tips for incorporating more physical activity into your daily routine. Here’s the handout. It includes information on healthy eating and exercise. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for three months from today to reassess your blood pressure and review your progress. In the meantime, if you experience any symptoms like severe headaches, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s all. Just… try to keep it simple, alright? No complicated explanations, no unnecessary interventions. Just… the basics. I’m a practical man, you see. I fix instruments, I don’t need… fixing. But fine. I’ll try the lifestyle changes. And I’ll come back in three months. Just… don’t expect miracles. And no complicated explanations. Is that… alright? I'm trying to… cooperate, but I’m not particularly fond of all this… medical bureaucracy. It just seems… excessive. Just… the basics. Alright? I think that’s all. Can I… go now? I have instruments to fix.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Redfern, you can go now. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I’ll keep things as simple as possible. Here's a card with the clinic’s contact information and the lab’s address. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you in three months.
PATIENT: .
