DOCTOR: Hi Zoie, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's nice to meet you too. Um... what was I saying? Oh yes. It's my waterworks. They're not... working so good, you see. Hard to... push it out. Like it's stuck. It's been a little while now. Not sure how long though. Old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're having difficulty with urination – feeling like you can’t empty your bladder completely, and it's been going on for a bit. It can be common with age, but we want to figure out what's going on to make sure we can help. When you say “a little while”, can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe… a month? Or two? It all blurs together these days, you know? My husband, he usually notices first. He says I'm going to the bathroom more often, but not much comes out. Does that make sense? I don't want to be a bother, dear. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: No, not a bother at all, Zoie, and that’s helpful information. So, more frequent trips, but less urine each time, for about a month or two. Okay. And are you having any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain…? No, not really pain. More of a… discomfort. Like I have to try harder, you see? And sometimes, after I'm done, it feels like there's still some left in there. Not a sharp pain, just… not right. My back aches a bit sometimes too, but I have old bones, so who knows with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort with straining, a feeling of incomplete emptying, and some back discomfort. Alright. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Fever…? No, I don't think so. My husband would've said something. And… the color? It looks… yellow, I guess. Like it always does. Smell…? I don't sniff my waterworks, dear! I really don’t pay much attention to that. Sorry, I'm not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly fine, Zoie! Don't apologize. We'll get to the bottom of this. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history… Hmm. That was… a long time ago. I had a bad heart for a bit, but they fixed it. A long time ago now. And… arthritis, of course. Old age. I saw a doctor for my blood pressure a while back too, but I can't remember what he said. Lots of pills, I think. My husband keeps track of all that now. He’s got a good memory, thank goodness. I don't remember much of anything these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart issues that was addressed, arthritis, and high blood pressure. Do you happen to know what medications you're currently taking for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you're asking the hard questions! Let me see… pills… little white ones… and some pink ones… I really don't know the names. My husband, he sorts them out every week in those little plastic boxes. I just take what he gives me. He'd be much better at telling you. He's in the garden right now, though. I don’t want to bother him. I’m sorry, dear. I wish I could be more helpful. It's just… everything gets mixed up in my head these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie, that's perfectly okay. We can certainly ask your husband later. Let’s move on to something else then. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm… let me think. Yes! I had my gallbladder out. A long, long time ago. And… I think I had something on my knee once, but it was so long ago, I barely remember it. They fixed it and that was that. Nothing else comes to mind, dear. Everything is so fuzzy these days. I hope I'm not wasting your time.
DOCTOR: No, you're not wasting my time at all. This is all helpful information, Zoie. And just to be thorough, can you tell me about any major illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Family… my sister, she had that… the sugar sickness, they called it. Diabetes, I think. And my brother, he had a bad heart, too. He didn’t take care of himself. And… well, lots of people in my family lived long lives, but they all just… faded away, you know? Old age catching up with them. Nothing dramatic, really. Mostly just… wearing out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes and heart disease. Now, I'm going to ask you about a few things that aren't necessarily related to your waterworks, just to get a complete picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. My husband sometimes says I shouldn’t eat so much sugar, but I don't listen to him. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything in a long time, so I assume I don't have any allergies. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that's just the old skin, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, or drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh heavens no! I wouldn’t touch those things with a ten-foot pole! My husband, he used to have a little drink now and then, but he stopped years ago. We’re good, clean-living folks, dear. Always have been. Never bothered with all that nonsense.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie, that's very good to know. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and do a quick check of your reflexes. Then I’ll need to do a little urine test to check for infection or anything else that might be causing your symptoms. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well, alright. I suppose that’s necessary. It's been a long time since anyone poked and prodded me. Just be gentle, dear. Old bones, you know. And a urine test… oh dear. That always feels so silly. But if you think it’s best, then go ahead. Do what you need to do, dear. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a little tenderness lower down, near your bladder. Now, could I get a urine sample from you?
PATIENT: Oh, that tickles a bit! Tender, you say? Well, no wonder. Old age is catching up with everything, I reckon. A urine sample… oh dear. Where do I…? It’s been a while since I did this. Is there a… a special room? I don't want to make a mess. And I hope I can still go… It's been a bit tricky lately, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. There’s a bathroom right down the hall. I can give you a little cup and a lid, and I’ll show you how to collect a sample. It’s perfectly fine if it takes a moment. Don’t rush, and don't worry about making a mess - that's what we're here for. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Just let me know if you need any help.
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, dear. You're very kind. A bathroom… right down the hall. I'll… I'll be right back. Wish me luck!
