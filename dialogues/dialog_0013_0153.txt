DOCTOR: Hi Brando, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, tell me – what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, something about a check-up? For… acting, I think. They said I needed a clearance. Honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy. I do a lot of ushering and ticket taking these days, mostly. Not much acting acting, if you know what I mean. Just trying to get this over with quickly, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, a clearance for… ushering and ticket taking. Got it. And you're not doing a lot of…performance acting currently?
PATIENT: No, no performances. Not for a long, long time. Mostly just making sure people find their seats, that sort of thing. It’s… less strenuous, let's put it that way. Is this going to take long? I have… appointments later.
DOCTOR: No, we'll try to be as efficient as possible. Just need to get some basic information and do a quick physical exam. It shouldn’t take too long at all. First, let’s just confirm some things. You said you’re here for a clearance, do you know who requested this clearance?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Honestly, I don’t. I got a letter… or maybe an email? Something about needing to be checked out before I… well, before I could continue. It was through the agency, I think. The one that sends me on the ushering gigs. Old Man Hemmings runs it. A real piece of work, that one. But… I can’t remember the specifics.
DOCTOR: Okay, “agency” run by someone named Hemmings. We can try to track down more information if needed. No worries for now. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a lot to remember. Let me see… High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned something years ago, but I haven’t really been back for regular check-ups. I mostly just try to ignore things until they get really bad, if I’m being honest. I'm… not a fan of doctors. A little dizzy sometimes, but that could be the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible high blood pressure, occasional dizziness. We’ll definitely check that out. And you said you haven't been to the doctor regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. Too expensive, mostly. And… well, it's never been anything serious. Just aches and pains, you know? Old age creeping in, I suppose. I haven't got insurance, either. Makes it harder to… bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, no insurance, occasional dizziness, and a history of possible high blood pressure with limited regular care. I understand. We'll do our best to get a good picture of what's going on today. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. A long, long time ago. And… maybe a broken arm? Fell off a bike. I was a reckless youth, you see. Hospitalized… probably for the tonsils. Nothing major, as far as I recall. It’s all very… faded.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, broken arm, no other significant hospitalizations. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Just some aspirin, when my joints ache. And… sometimes a little something for sleep, if I can’t get to rest. It's not… regular. Just when I really need it. I don't even remember the name of it. Something… blue? The bottle is blue, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional aspirin for joint pain, and a blue bottle sleep aid, used intermittently. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else – like food, pollen, or animals?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. I used to get hay fever as a kid, but that was ages ago. Nothing serious. I eat… most things, really. No shellfish, I don’t care for shellfish. But that’s a preference, not an allergy. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. So, just to recap: possible high blood pressure in the past, occasional dizziness, joint pain, intermittent sleep aid, no known allergies. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… a personal question, isn’t it? I used to smoke, a long time ago. Gave it up years and years ago, though. Don't touch it anymore. A little wine with dinner sometimes, but very little. And… absolutely not with the other things. I’m a respectable man, Doctor. Well, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, former smoker, very occasional wine. That’s good to know. And, just one last thing before the exam: How's your energy level generally?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… fading, you know? I get tired easily these days. Especially after a long day on my feet, making sure everyone gets to their seats. A lot of walking, a lot of smiling. It’s… draining. I spend most evenings just trying to rest. Not very energetic, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased energy level. Alright, Brando, thanks for answering all those questions. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Get it over with quickly, if you could. I really do need to be going soon. It's just… I get anxious around doctors. Always have. But… do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, we'll be as quick as possible. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your ears, nose and throat… Your ears look clear, your nose is normal, and your throat looks a little dry, but otherwise okay. I’m also noting some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you experience that often?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Oh, yes, sometimes. Especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just from being on my feet for so long. It usually goes down overnight. Nothing I’ve ever really worried about. Is that… bad? I hate to be a bother, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It could be related to being on your feet, but we should investigate further. Given your elevated blood pressure, occasional dizziness, the ankle swelling and your history, I'd like to order a few tests. I want to check your kidney function, your electrolyte levels, and do an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests…? Oh dear. More waiting, more poking and prodding. Look, I really don’t have insurance, Doctor. Can’t I just… take it easy? Cut back on the work? I’m not a young man anymore, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost. Let’s talk about that. The lab work will cost approximately $150, and the EKG about $75. We can explore options for financial assistance, and I have information about some lower-cost labs in the area. But given your symptoms, it’s important to rule out anything serious. Ignoring these things could lead to bigger problems down the line. While we wait for the results, I recommend reducing your physical activity, avoiding excessive salt intake, and monitoring your blood pressure at home if possible. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a lot of money. I don’t have a blood pressure cuff. Never thought I’d need one. I… I’ll have to think about it. I really don’t like the sound of all these tests. Is it absolutely necessary? Could it just be… stress? I worry a lot, you see. About the work, about money… about everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. We can start with just the lab work for now, and see what the results show. It'll give us a better picture of what's going on. If those results are concerning, then we can discuss the EKG. It’s a reasonable compromise. I’ll give you a lab requisition and instructions on how to prepare. And while we wait, I really advise you to try and reduce your stress levels. Is there anything I can recommend for that, perhaps some relaxation techniques?
PATIENT: Relaxation techniques…? Oh dear. I mostly just try to sleep it off. Sometimes a little… brandy helps, but I know that's not a good idea. Sleep… yes. I suppose that's the best I can do. Alright, lab work. Fine. Just… please make it as quick as possible. I really do need to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here is the requisition for the lab work. The address is 123 Main Street, and they're open until 5 PM today. They do not require an appointment. Please fast for 12 hours before the blood draw, and drink plenty of water. I’m also going to give you a handout with some information about managing high blood pressure and stress. Do you have any questions about the lab work or the instructions?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Fast for 12 hours… yes. Water. 123 Main Street. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. I’ve got enough worries as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brando. We'll take it one step at a time. Once you have the results, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. We can discuss the findings and create a plan. In the meantime, try to rest, stay hydrated, and reduce your stress as much as possible. Here’s my card with the office number. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your appointment.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll… try my best. .
