DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. Now, why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Renzi, was it? Yes, yes. Well, to be honest, I don't really need to be here, you know? My daughter just thought… well, she worries too much. Said I should just get a check-up. Seems a bit silly, if you ask me. I feel fine. Mostly. Just… old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's good of your daughter to encourage you to come in, though. Preventative care is always a good idea, even if you're feeling well. And "old" doesn't necessarily mean unwell! We can certainly do a basic check-up to put your mind at ease. Just to start, could you tell me a little more about what "mostly" means?
PATIENT: Oh, well... it's just little things. You know, aches and pains. Nothing a good lie-down doesn't fix. And… sometimes I forget where I put things. Not important things, thankfully. Just… my glasses, or the TV remote. It’s probably just age. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I used to be so sharp, you know. Worked in the operating room for years. Everything had to be perfect. Now…well. It slips.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very common to experience some memory changes as we get older. And aches and pains certainly come with time, as well. You mentioned working in the operating room—that sounds fascinating! A very demanding profession, I imagine. Just to get a clearer picture, when did you start noticing these memory slips?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard question. It wasn’t sudden, you know? More like… gradually. A few years, I suppose. Maybe five? It’s difficult to say exactly. My husband… well, he passed away about seven years ago. Things have been a little blurry since then. I mostly remember things before he… well. Before. It’s all a bit muddled. It wasn’t just after, though. It was happening a little before, I think. A little.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can certainly affect our memory and concentration. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way after a loss. And it sounds like these memory concerns were present even before your husband passed away. To get a better understanding, are you noticing any difficulty with things like remembering recent conversations, following instructions, or finding the right words when you speak?
PATIENT: Oh, conversations are fine, mostly. People talk too much, if you ask me. But… sometimes I have trouble remembering what I was going to say. Like, I'll start a sentence, and it just… vanishes. And finding words... yes, that happens sometimes. Not all the time. Just… when I'm tired, maybe? Or stressed. It's not a constant thing, Doctor. Really. I’m still perfectly capable, you know. I still manage my house, and I go to church every Sunday. I just...forget little things.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like these difficulties are intermittent and may be related to stress or fatigue. That’s good information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, such as headaches, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty with balance?
PATIENT: Oh, no headaches, thankfully. I get enough trouble without those. My vision… well, it's not as sharp as it used to be, but I have glasses, as you can see. Weakness? No, not really. A little tired sometimes, but that's just old age again. Balance… hmm. I haven’t fallen or anything. But… sometimes I feel a little unsteady when I stand up quickly. Just a little. Nothing to worry about, I’m sure. It’s probably just low blood pressure or something. Honestly, Doctor, I think my daughter is making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re able to articulate all of this, Ms. Calvery. It’s always better to be thorough, even if you think it’s a minor issue. Feeling unsteady when standing up can be related to low blood pressure, but it's also good to rule out other potential causes. Now, do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My husband, he had high blood pressure. Terrible thing. But me? Not that I know of. The doctors always said I was perfectly healthy. I used to go for yearly check-ups, but… after he passed… it just sort of slipped my mind. I think they mentioned my cholesterol was a little high, once. But I don’t remember what they said to do about it. I probably just ignored it. I never really understood all those numbers, anyway. Too complicated. Mostly, I just take a little something for my arthritis. It’s in my hands, you see. Makes them stiff and achy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known medical conditions, a possible mention of high cholesterol in the past, and medication for arthritis. That’s helpful. And what about any surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries... let me think. Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy, a long time ago. When I was… I don’t know, maybe in my thirties? It was a very common thing, back then. And… I think I had my gallbladder out, too. But that was so long ago, I barely remember it. Everything is a bit of a blur, you know? They didn’t bother me much, none of them. Mostly, I just remember being relieved when it was all over. I’m not one for hospitals, if you ask me. Too much… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy, hysterectomy, and gallbladder removal. Thank you for sharing that. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the one for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, there’s the arthritis medication. It’s… a little pink pill. I take it twice a day. And… I think that’s it. Sometimes I take something for a headache, if it’s really bad. But that’s just over-the-counter. Tylenol, I think. Oh! And I take a vitamin D supplement. My daughter says I don’t get enough sunshine. She worries too much, that girl. But it’s a little white pill. I take it with breakfast. That’s all, I think. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the arthritis medication, occasional Tylenol, and a vitamin D supplement. That’s very helpful. Now, Ms. Calvery, before we move on, I'd like to ask about any allergies you may have—to medications, food, or anything else.
PATIENT: Oh, allergies... hmm. I don't think I have any, really. I eat everything, pretty much. Never had a problem with food. And… I haven’t taken any new medications recently, so I haven’t noticed anything. I used to be allergic to bee stings, as a child, but that was a long time ago. I haven't been stung in years. Honestly, Doctor, I think I'm a pretty healthy person, all things considered. It’s just… the little things, you know? The forgetting, and the unsteadiness. My daughter is just making a fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to hear you feel generally healthy. Now, just to complete the picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. That will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, looking in your ears, and a brief neurological assessment – checking your reflexes and balance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I suppose so. But I don't like doctors poking and prodding, you know? I always feel so… vulnerable. And I don't like being told what to do. But if you think it's necessary… alright. But please be gentle, Doctor. And don't take too long. I have a luncheon with my friends later.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. I'll be as gentle as possible and we won't take long. This is just a routine check to get a better understanding of your overall health. First, let's take your blood pressure. Could you please relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Relax, she says. Easy for you to say. My blood pressure is always a little high at the doctor’s office. It’s the anxiety, you know? All these… things. Just take it quickly, please. I really do hate this part. It makes me feel so… confined.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, as you suspected, but not drastically so. It's good to know your baseline, and we can recheck it later if needed. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally for me, please.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. My heart’s always been strong, you know. I used to be very active. Dancing, mostly. My husband loved to dance. It feels a little cold, that thing. Is everything alright? You don’t sound very cheerful.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, which is good. No unusual noises or crackling sounds. Everything sounds normal so far. The stethoscope is a little cold, I apologize for that. Now, I'm just going to take a quick look in your ears with an otoscope.
PATIENT: Oh, be careful! My ears are very sensitive. I used to get ear infections as a child. Terrible pain. Is everything alright? You’re taking a long time. Are my ears dirty? My daughter always tells me I should clean them better.
DOCTOR: Your ears are clear and there's no sign of infection. A little bit of wax, as is normal, but nothing concerning. And no, your ears aren't dirty at all. Now, just a quick neurological assessment. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Please just follow it with your gaze.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. It’s a bit blurry, you know? I really should get my eyes checked. But I hate going to the eye doctor, too. All those… machines. And they puff air in your eyes! Horrible. Am I doing it right? It makes me a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Ms. Calvery. A little dizziness is normal with this test. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and follow my instructions. I’ll ask you to squeeze my hands when I touch them. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. My hands are a little stiff, you know? Arthritis. Just be gentle. And don’t squeeze too hard. Am I doing it right? It’s a bit strange, having someone touch my hands like this.
DOCTOR: You're doing very well, Ms. Calvery. You have good strength in your hands, despite the arthritis. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes. I'll tap a small hammer on your knees, and your legs should kick out slightly. This might feel a little strange.
PATIENT: Oh… no! I don't like that! It makes me jump! My husband used to do that to me, and I always hated it. It feels so… invasive. Please don't do that again. It really hurts. I told you, I don't like being poked and prodded!
DOCTOR: I am so sorry, Ms. Calvery. I didn’t realize it would upset you so much. I will absolutely not do that again. I apologize for causing you any discomfort. We can stop the exam right now if you'd like. It's clear you're feeling quite anxious. Let's just take a few deep breaths. I'm concerned about your anxiety level. We’ve only completed a partial exam, but I’ve gathered enough information for now. Would you like to discuss your concerns and explore potential causes of your forgetfulness and unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. You scared me, you know? It just brought back… bad memories. And I don't like being touched without warning. It makes me feel… vulnerable. Yes, let's talk about the forgetfulness. And the unsteadiness. But please, no more poking and prodding. It just makes it worse. My daughter is probably right, something is wrong. But I don’t want to be treated like a… like a science experiment. Just… tell me what you think. And be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. I completely understand. I apologize again for making you feel uncomfortable. I will not do anything without your full consent, and we'll focus on discussing your concerns without any further physical examination at this time. Based on what you’ve told me – the gradual onset of memory slips, the occasional unsteadiness, and your overall health history – several possibilities come to mind. It’s important to rule out treatable causes, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or side effects of medication. Sometimes, these types of symptoms can also be related to age-related changes in the brain, or even early stages of dementia. However, it's too early to make any definitive diagnosis. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some basic blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and overall health. We can also consider a cognitive assessment to evaluate your memory and thinking skills in more detail. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh… blood tests? More poking and prodding? Well… I suppose so. If it will help figure out what’s wrong. But please, tell the person drawing the blood to be gentle. I faint easily, you know. And I don't like needles. A cognitive assessment? What’s that? Is it like a… a test? Will it be hard? I don’t do well with tests. My daughter is probably right, I am losing my memory. But I don’t want to be told I’m… well, you know. Just… make it quick, please. And be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I completely understand your concerns. The blood tests are relatively quick and simple. I'll make a note to have the phlebotomist be extremely gentle, and we can take breaks if you need them. I will also be present during the blood draw, if you would like. The cognitive assessment is a series of simple questions and tasks designed to evaluate your memory, thinking skills, and attention span. It's not a difficult test, and it's not meant to be intimidating. It’s simply a way for us to get a better understanding of your cognitive function. It will take about 30 minutes. We can do it here in the office, and I'll explain each task as we go. If you’re comfortable with that, I’ll write the orders for the blood tests and schedule the cognitive assessment. Then, we can review the results together and discuss the next steps. It is important to rule out other causes. Would you like me to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it's necessary. But please, be patient with me. My memory isn’t what it used to be, and I get confused easily. And I don’t want to be rushed. But… can we do the assessment another day? I'm feeling a little overwhelmed right now. Just the blood tests, for today. And please, tell the person drawing the blood to be very gentle. I really don’t like needles. Just… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. That's perfectly fine. We can certainly postpone the cognitive assessment for another day. Let's focus on getting the blood tests done first. We'll take things at your pace, and I will be here to support you every step of the way. I'll write the orders for the blood tests now and give them to you. I'll also include a note to the phlebotomist requesting extreme gentleness, as you requested. Once the results are back—usually in about a week—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… the blood tests. And please, make sure the person drawing the blood is gentle. And that they don’t make me lie down. I get dizzy easily, you know. And… thank you. For being patient with me. I appreciate it. It's just… this is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Calvery. I completely understand. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, and I’m here to help in any way I can. I will personally speak to the phlebotomist before the blood draw to ensure they are gentle and accommodating. And I'll make a note in your chart to avoid having you lie down. Here are the lab orders. You can take these to the lab at your convenience. They are located just down the street. Once you have had the blood tests done, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss the results. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your patience. It’s just… getting old isn’t easy. I think I’ll just go home and take a nap now. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Calvery. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and get some rest. Goodbye, Ms. Calvery.
PATIENT: .
