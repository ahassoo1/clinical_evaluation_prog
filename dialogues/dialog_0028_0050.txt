DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Pavlovic, is it?
PATIENT: Pavlovec, actually. Brodie Pavlovec. And yes, that's me, I think. It's… hard to keep track these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s not dwell on that. So, Mr. Pavlovec, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, this cough. It just won’t quit. Been… a long time now. Dry, mostly. Feels like something’s tickling the back of my throat all the time. Not much else, really. Just… tired of coughing. It’s a bother.
DOCTOR: A cough, you say. And how long has this “long time” been, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Months, I suppose. Maybe… six months? Longer? It all kinda blends together, you know? I used to work with a lot of… dust. Down at the shop. Maybe it started then? I don't really remember exactly. Everything's a little fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Right. So, six months or more of a dry cough, potentially related to dust exposure. Do you recall any fever, chills, shortness of breath, or chest pain with this cough?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I recall. No chills, either. Shortness of breath… sometimes, when I walk up the stairs. But I’m an old man, Doc, so that's not new. Chest pain… no, not really. Just… uncomfortable. Like a tickle that won't go away. It’s mostly worse at night, I think. Keeps my wife awake… well, it used to keep my wife awake. She’s… gone now. Sorry, I get turned around sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, cough for six months or more, dry, worse at night, occasional shortness of breath with exertion… and you’ve experienced a loss recently. I see. Any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I get tired easily, like I said. And… sometimes I wheeze a little when I breathe. Not all the time, just now and then. And my appetite’s not what it used to be, but… that could just be old age. I used to eat like a horse. Now, not so much. It's hard to get motivated sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, occasional wheezing, decreased appetite… Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Not that I’ve noticed. I don’t look at my feet much, to be honest. I mostly wear these old work boots. They're comfortable, even if they are worn out. I suppose I should… but I haven’t. No, I don't think so. I’d probably remember that, wouldn't I? It’d be hard to miss.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never had much trouble with anything, to be honest. I used to take some pills for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off them a while back. Said I didn't need them anymore. I don’t remember what they were called… and no, no food allergies or anything like that. I eat just about anything. Used to, anyway.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just some… cream for my hands. They get dry and cracked from working on cars all those years. And sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, when it really flares up. But that’s it, I think. Just the cream and the arthritis pills sometimes. Can't remember what they're called either, honestly. Old age, you know? It's a terrible thing.
DOCTOR: Right. So, hand cream and occasional arthritis medication… Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she used to tell me it was a terrible habit. And I listened to her. Always did. No, never smoked. And no drinking much either, except maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. Nothing serious. Not a smoker, Doc. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any family history of lung problems, heart disease, or other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… That’s a tough one. My mother… she had some trouble breathing when she got older, but I don’t know what it was. And my brother, he had a heart problem, I think. But… it was a long time ago. We weren't very close, you see. Lots of siblings, scattered all over. I don’t really know much about their medical histories. Sorry, I wish I could be more help. My memory just isn't what it used to be. It's a shame.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that’s… something. Let’s have a listen to your lungs. Please, take a deep breath for me. And another one.
PATIENT: Like this, Doc? Feels like there's gravel in there sometimes. It's been that way for a while. I just thought it was old age.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is some wheezing and diminished breath sounds, particularly at the bases of both lungs. Now, let's check your heart. Heart rate is a little fast, but regular. No murmurs. Your weight is also quite low, 107 pounds. Have you lost weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, is it? 107? I hadn't even noticed. Well, I haven't been eating much, like I said. Not much appetite. I guess that would explain it, wouldn't it? Everything's just... gone downhill lately, I suppose. The wife bein' gone, the cough, the tiredness... it all adds up. I used to be a strong man, you know. Worked on cars all day, every day. Now... not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you likely have chronic bronchitis, potentially exacerbated by your decreased appetite and weight loss. It's important to rule out other causes. We'll need to get a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and some blood work to check for infection and other issues. Do you understand?
PATIENT: X-ray, huh? And blood work? Sounds… serious. I don’t know… I don’t like hospitals much. And I don't have insurance, Doc. Can’t really afford all that, you know? Is it really necessary? Could it just be… a bad cold? It's just a cough, after all. A really stubborn cough, but… just a cough.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pavlovic, while it could be a cold, your symptoms have persisted for a long time, and you’re losing weight. That’s concerning. The X-ray and blood work are necessary to rule out more serious conditions, like pneumonia or even lung cancer. I understand your concerns about cost. Let me see what resources are available at the clinic… We may be able to find assistance programs or offer a reduced rate. But we need to get this checked out. Do you consent to the X-ray and blood work?
PATIENT: Assistance programs… you mean, it wouldn't cost me everything? Well… alright. If there's help available, I guess so. But please, Doc, be gentle. I don’t like needles much either. And… try to explain things to me slowly, okay? My head gets foggy sometimes. If you find anything serious… just tell me straight. I can handle it. I think. Alright. Let's get it over with. But promise me you'll be gentle.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the X-ray. I'll explain everything as clearly as possible. We will proceed carefully. The nurse will be right in. .
