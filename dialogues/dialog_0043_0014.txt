DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Limtiaco. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Afternoon to you too, Doctor. Kalinski, you said? Yes, that's right. Hmm… well, it’s about some papers, I think. My wife, bless her heart, she said I need something for… work? Something about time off, or… maybe if I can’t work at all. Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. It has to do with my job, Directors, Religious Activities and Education, you see. She handles most of the paperwork these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're needing documentation related to your employment with Directors, Religious Activities and Education. It’s very common for patients to need such forms completed by their physician. To best assist you, could you elaborate on why you believe you might need time off or be unable to work?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… it’s hard to say exactly. Things just haven't been… right, lately. A bit tired, mostly. And forgetful, even more than usual, if you can believe it! It’s making it hard to concentrate on… well, on anything really. I'm still doing the job, mind you, but it takes a lot more effort. My wife noticed it first, said I was repeating myself a lot. She’s a smart woman, my wife. Does that make any sense? I don’t even remember when it started, to be honest. It just… crept up on me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you've been experiencing a gradual decline in your energy and cognitive function, which is understandably concerning. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m falling asleep all day, Doctor. More like… a constant dragging feeling. Like I'm wading through mud. And even after a full night’s sleep – and I do get a good eight hours, thankfully – I still wake up feeling… not refreshed. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… heavy. And it affects everything, you see. Thinking, remembering… even just getting through the day. It wasn’t this bad a year ago, I don’t think. Though, like I said, my memory… it’s not what it used to be. I used to be able to recall dates and names with ease, now… well, it’s a struggle. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. A persistent dragging feeling even after adequate sleep, and a decline in cognitive function – specifically memory – over the past year. It sounds like we need to investigate this further. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. This is called a review of systems, and it helps me rule out potential causes. First, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely. Ask away, Doctor. I’ll do my best to answer. Appetite… hmm. That's a good question. I think… I think it’s been a little less than usual. Not a huge amount, but I don't crave things like I used to. And my wife says I’ve lost a little weight, but she's always fussing over my weight, bless her heart. She likes me nice and sturdy, she does. I wouldn't say I’ve been trying to lose weight, definitely not. It’s just… food doesn’t seem as appealing, I guess. I still eat, mind you, but not with the same gusto. Does that make sense? I haven't been sick or anything, just… less hungry.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss are important details. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a question. Let me think… Well, no, not really. Everything seems to be… regular, if you'll excuse the bluntness. No constipation, no diarrhea, nothing out of the ordinary in that department, thank goodness. I’ve always been… fairly regular, if you know what I mean. My wife would be the first to tell you! She keeps a very close eye on these things, she does. So, no changes there, thankfully. A small blessing, I suppose. Is that helpful? I feel a bit silly talking about all this, but I’m trying to be as honest as I can.
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all, Mr. Limtiaco. You’re being very helpful, and honesty is crucial. Now, have you noticed any difficulties with sleep other than feeling unrefreshed?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question, Doctor. Hmm… well, I can fall asleep easily enough, thankfully. It's not like I’m tossing and turning all night. But I do wake up… a couple of times, maybe. Just little things. Needing to go to the bathroom, or just… thinking about something. Nothing major, usually. I usually get back to sleep pretty quickly. But it’s not a solid, uninterrupted eight hours, if you know what I mean. I used to sleep like a log, you see. Now it’s… fragmented, I suppose. Does that make sense? I don’t feel anxious or anything, just… little disruptions. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, fragmented sleep is definitely important. Now, I’m going to ask about some other areas. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, now that you mention it… I think my vision has been a little blurry, maybe? I thought it was just my glasses needing a cleaning, to be honest. I haven't gotten around to taking them in yet. I used to be able to read the small print in the newspaper without any trouble, but now I have to hold it a little further away, or squint a bit. Nothing dramatic, mind you. Just… a little less sharp, I suppose. I haven't had any pain or anything, just… a little fuzziness around the edges. Is that what you're asking about? My wife hasn't said anything, but she always has her own glasses on, so she probably wouldn't notice. Does that help? I feel like I’m listing off a lot of small things, but maybe they add up to something?
DOCTOR: They absolutely add up, Mr. Limtiaco. It's good you're sharing all of this. Now, have you experienced any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, no weakness or numbness, thankfully. My legs feel a little heavy sometimes, especially at the end of the day, but that’s probably just from being on my feet so much with my job. Directing religious activities… it requires a lot of moving around, you see. But no actual weakness, and definitely no numbness. I can still walk and move around just fine. My hands are steady too. I haven’t dropped anything or had any trouble with dexterity. No, no weakness or numbness at all. That's a relief, isn't it? I'm glad to hear myself say that, at least. Is that helpful, Doctor? I hope I'm not boring you with all this.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Limtiaco. You're not boring me; you're providing me with valuable information. Now, have you noticed any changes in your mood – feeling sad, anxious, or irritable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… I wouldn’t say sad, exactly. But I've been a bit… more easily frustrated, perhaps. Little things that wouldn’t bother me before now seem to get under my skin. And I suppose I'm not as patient as I used to be, especially with my wife. She understands, bless her heart, but I feel bad sometimes. And I've been a little… less enthusiastic about things, I suppose. Not depressed, exactly, but… a little less joyful. I still enjoy my work, and I still enjoy spending time with my family, but… the spark isn’t quite as bright, if you know what I mean. Does that make sense, Doctor? It's hard to explain. Is that important? I just… haven’t been feeling quite like myself lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you've been experiencing some changes in your emotional state as well – increased irritability and a decrease in overall enthusiasm. Now, before we move on, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… High blood pressure, yes, I was diagnosed with that about ten years ago, but it's been well controlled with medication ever since. My doctor keeps a close eye on it. Other than that… no, no diabetes, no heart disease, thankfully. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I had a bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but that's about it. And I had my appendix out when I was a young man, but that was a long time ago. Nothing major, really. My wife handles all the appointments and keeps track of everything, so I'm not always sure what's going on. But I haven't been hospitalized for anything serious in years. Is that helpful, Doctor? I hope I'm not forgetting anything. I’m getting old, you know, things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: You're doing wonderfully, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s good to know about the well-controlled hypertension. And don’t worry about forgetting things, it happens. Are you currently taking any medications other than those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh yes, let me think… besides the blood pressure medication, I take a multivitamin every day, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for a little ache or pain. Nothing regular, just when I need it. And my wife makes me take fish oil for my brain, she says it's good for memory! Bless her heart, she’s always looking out for me. Other than that, no, no other medications. Just the basics, really. I try to stay healthy, you see. Is that helpful, Doctor? I hope I'm not boring you with all these details. I just want to be as honest as I can.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Limtiaco. That’s very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… No, no known allergies, thankfully. I haven’t had any allergic reactions to anything that I’m aware of. I can eat all sorts of foods, and I haven’t had any trouble with medications either. My wife always double-checks everything before I take it, just to be safe. She’s very cautious, bless her heart. No, no allergies at all. Is that helpful, Doctor? I hope I'm not forgetting anything. Sometimes things slip my mind, you know. I’m getting older, things aren’t as clear as they used to be.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Mr. Limtiaco. Don't worry about forgetting things, it happens to everyone. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, my mother lived to be 88, she was very healthy. My father passed away when he was in his 70s, he had some heart trouble. As for other relatives… my aunt had Alzheimer's, I think. Or maybe it was dementia? It was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details very well. And my uncle had diabetes. Other than that, no major health problems that I'm aware of. It wasn't a family that talked a lot about health, you see. We just kind of… dealt with things as they came. Is that helpful, Doctor? I hope I'm not forgetting anything important. It’s hard to remember things that happened so long ago. My wife probably knows more about this than I do.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Family history of Alzheimer’s and diabetes are important details. Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, that gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes and neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Go ahead and do what you need to. I’m a little worried, I must admit, but I know you’re here to help. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? And please, don’t hesitate to ask if I can clarify anything. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. But I’ll do my best to cooperate. Just take your time. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. His heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. His lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. His reflexes are slightly diminished. Finally, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam. His balance is stable, but his coordination is slightly impaired. His cognitive function is… mildly impaired. He has some difficulty with recall and word finding. Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Based on the physical exam, there are a few things I'm noting. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, there's a slight murmur, your reflexes are diminished, and there's mild impairment in your coordination and cognitive function. These findings, combined with your reported symptoms, raise some concerns.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good, does it? What does it mean, Doctor? I'm a little worried now, I must admit. Is it something serious? I've been feeling off for a while now, but I didn't realize it was this bad. My wife will be very concerned. Should we get some tests done? What kind of tests? I just want to know what's going on, and what we can do about it. I trust your judgement, Doctor, just tell me what you think.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mr. Limtiaco. It's important to remember that these findings don't necessarily indicate anything definitive. However, given your symptoms and the examination results, I do recommend some further testing to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for any underlying infections or deficiencies. I also recommend a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Additionally, I'd like to order a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out any thyroid problems. To investigate the cognitive concerns, I recommend a Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain. This will help us look for any structural abnormalities. Finally, I'd like to order a cognitive assessment to evaluate your memory and thinking skills more thoroughly. This can be done by a neurologist. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a lot of tests. MRI, you said? I've never had an MRI before. Is it painful? And a neurologist? I didn't even know I needed a neurologist! My wife will be very worried about all this, I just know it. But… yes, alright. If that's what you recommend, then I suppose we should do it. I want to know what's going on, and I trust your judgement. Just… please explain everything carefully to my wife. She gets very anxious, you see. And tell me what to expect with each test. I just want to be prepared. How long will it take to get the results? And what happens after we get them? Will we need to come back for another appointment? I just have so many questions. But I suppose we'll take it one step at a time. Alright, let's do the tests. Just please, be gentle with my wife.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. I understand your concerns, and I will be as gentle and thorough as possible when explaining everything to your wife. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. It doesn't involve any radiation, and it's generally painless. You will lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it's important to remain still during the scan. It can be a little noisy, so we'll provide you with earplugs. The scan usually takes about 30-60 minutes. As for the neurologist, they specialize in disorders of the nervous system, including memory and cognitive problems. They will perform a more detailed assessment of your cognitive function and help us determine the cause of your symptoms. The results of the blood tests should be available within a few days. The MRI results may take a little longer, usually a week or so. Once we have all the results, we will schedule another appointment to discuss them with you and your wife and develop a treatment plan. I'll have my nurse schedule those appointments for you now and provide you with detailed instructions for each test, including any necessary preparation. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so carefully. I feel a little better knowing what to expect, even though it's still a bit scary. Please, remember to be gentle with my wife. She'll be very worried, you see. And if you could explain everything to her in simple terms, that would be wonderful. She doesn't understand medical jargon very well. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and understanding. And I trust your judgement. Let's just hope we can figure out what's going on and get me back to feeling like myself again. I think that’s all for now. Yes, let's have your nurse schedule those appointments. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I assure you, I will be as gentle and thorough as possible when speaking with your wife. My priority is to ensure both you and your wife feel comfortable and informed. I’ll have the nurse come in now to schedule those appointments and provide you with the necessary instructions. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. I wish you and your wife all the best, and I look forward to seeing you both soon.
