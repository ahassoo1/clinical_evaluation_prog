DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Rover, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Cleo Rover. Just…Cleo is fine, most folks call me that. It's a bit easier to remember than the full name, you know? Been a long time since anyone used it all.
DOCTOR: Very well, Cleo. Let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well… honestly, I don’t fully remember all the details. Something about… insurance? My daughter, she set this up. Said it was important for… later on. Long-term care, I think she said? I mostly just do what she tells me these days. My memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. Long-term care. And you’re here for… a general check-up because of this potential need?
PATIENT: A check-up… yeah, I guess so. Seems like that's what she said. I mostly move things around, you know? Freight, boxes… stuff like that. Been doin' it a long time. It’s… physical work. I can still do it, mostly. Just… slower, sometimes. Is this about bein' able to keep doin' it? Or about what happens when I… can't? I get confused easy.
DOCTOR: Let’s try to be specific, Cleo. You mentioned physical work. Are you experiencing any pain, weakness, or difficulty with your usual activities?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. My back mostly. Old injuries, I guess. It flares up when I lift somethin’ heavy, or if the weather’s bad. Weakness… not really weakness, exactly. More like… tired. Just gets tired quicker. And like I said, rememberin’ things… that’s the hardest part. I’ll start a job and forget what I was doin’ halfway through. It’s… frustrating. I don’t want to be a bother to anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Back pain, fatigue, and some memory issues. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit… dizzy. Not all the time, but enough to worry. And… oh! I have trouble sleepin’ sometimes. Just layin’ there, starin’ at the ceilin’. My wife… she always had a good sleepin’ remedy. But she’s… gone now. It's hard to explain. I guess it just feels… empty sometimes. Does that count as a symptom?
DOCTOR: Dizziness and insomnia. And you’ve experienced a recent loss. We’ll note that. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not much change there. I still eat. My daughter makes sure I do. She worries about me. Weight… I don't really keep track. Probably lost a little, maybe? Clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven't stepped on a scale in… well, a long time. I mostly just eat what’s put in front of me. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with… pills or nothin’. My wife always took all sorts of things, but I mostly stuck to just… toughin’ it out. She'd always ask me if I was takin’ somethin’ for a headache, but I always said no. I don't really like takin' medicine, if I can avoid it. It always made me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes, for my back. When it really hurts bad. A little somethin' my daughter gets for me. White pills, I think. She tells me what to take and when. I don't really pay attention to the name. I just take ‘em. And… sometimes, a little somethin’ to help me sleep. But not every night. Just when I really can’t.
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll need to get the exact names of those medications. Do you have a list, or perhaps the bottles with you?
PATIENT: Bottles… hmm. No, I don't think so. My daughter keeps those. She handles all that stuff. I just… take what she gives me. I’m sorry, I know I’m not very helpful. I wish I could remember more. She always says I need to write things down, but I never do. It just feels… too much.
DOCTOR: Cleo, it's important that you have a clear understanding of what you're taking. We'll need to contact your daughter to get this information. In the meantime, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions—diabetes, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… I don't think so. Not that I know of. The doctor… back when my wife was still alive… he said my blood pressure was a little high sometimes. But he gave me some pills for it, and I took ‘em for a while. But I stopped, because they made me feel… dizzy. I don't remember much about it, honestly. Everything feels… fuzzy. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure, previously treated. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Years ago, I had my appendix out. When I was young. And… oh! I broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin’ off a roof. They fixed it up, but I don’t really remember much about it. Just… pain. And a cast. That’s all. Nothing since then, I think.
DOCTOR: Family history. Are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: My parents… no. They’re both gone now. Passed away a long time ago. My brother… he moved away, years and years ago. To the city. Haven’t seen him since. We don’t really talk much. He always was… different. Never really liked the cold, like me and my folks.
DOCTOR: And what did your parents pass away from, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh… that's… hard to remember. My father, he worked on boats his whole life. I think… something with his lungs? From the salt air and the cold. He always coughed a lot. And my mother… she just… got old, I guess. Her heart, maybe? She was a good woman. She always worried about everyone. It's all so long ago, everything feels… blurred.
DOCTOR: Very well. Social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never did. My wife always said it was bad for you. And I… well, I didn't want to disappoint her. Drink… sometimes. A little beer, with supper. Not much. Mostly just to relax. And… no. Never touched nothin’ else. Never had any use for it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Just give me a sec... Old bones creakin', you know? It takes a bit longer these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 148 over 82… not ideal. Pulse is 78… regular. Respiration is 16. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, but no wheezing or crackles. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can see it. It's a little blurry, but I can see it. Just... takes a bit longer, you know? Everything feels a little… hazy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Is that okay? Not as strong as they used to be, I guess. I do a lot of work with my hands, but… it gets harder, you know? It gets tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, can you stand on your tiptoes?
PATIENT: Woah! There we go... It’s harder than it looks, Doc. Used to be able to do that easy. My legs… they ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on this brief examination, and your history… it seems we have some concerns about potential weakness, some balance issues, and possible memory decline. We'll need to get those medication names from your daughter, and I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. I’m also referring you to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation of your memory and balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist?… Memory… yeah, I figured as much. It's just… frustrating, you know? Not bein’ able to remember things. And blood work… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doc. Just… try not to poke too many holes in me.
DOCTOR: I'll have the nurse schedule those appointments for you before you leave. I’m also sending a referral to a specialist. The nurse will provide you with instructions. In the meantime, try to avoid any heavy lifting, and be careful with your balance. We’ll follow up once we have the blood work results. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. I guess… will this mean I can't… work anymore? That's what I'm most worried about. I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't work. It’s all I've ever done.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say, Cleo. We need to determine the cause of your symptoms first. It may not prevent you from working, but we need to prioritize your safety. We'll discuss this further once we have more information. Now, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will go over the discharge instructions and schedule the appointments. Thank you for your time. .
PATIENT: Okay… alright. Thank you, Doc. I… appreciate it. I guess I'll just… wait for the nurse then.
