DOCTOR: Right. Candis Hardenburgh, 79. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day, so let's just get this over with. I've been…tired. Really tired. And I've been eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but…I crave it. It sounds ridiculous, I know it does. But it's happening. It's been worse lately.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt… Yes, well. That is… unusual. How long has this “craving” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe six months ago? It was just a little bit at first. A tiny bit of clay I found in the garden. Thought it was just a phase, you know? Old lady things. But it's gotten worse, like I said. I find myself… looking for it. And it doesn't even taste good! It's just… I need it. Does that make any sense? I doubt it. You probably think I'm losing my mind.
DOCTOR: Six months… And you're actively seeking it out now. Hmm. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Besides being exhausted and…well, the dirt thing? Not really. My joints ache a bit more than usual, but that's just getting old, isn't it? I used to be quite the gardener, but now… even that’s too much. And I’ve lost a little weight, I suppose. Though, honestly, maybe that's a good thing. I was probably carrying a few extra pounds. Don't know why I'm telling you all this. It's not like you're going to fix my life.
DOCTOR: Weight loss… How much weight, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, land. I don't weigh myself regularly. Vanity, you know? But… maybe five, ten pounds? Something like that. It’s not a dramatic change. I just… my clothes don't fit quite the same. And I haven't been as hungry. Though, truthfully, what is there to eat these days? Everything's either full of sugar or chemicals. Honestly, it's a wonder anyone is healthy anymore. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Really? Is that what we're discussing now? Look, I came here because I’m tired and I eat dirt, not to talk about… that. Honestly. But fine. No, not really. Everything’s… normal. As normal as it can be for someone my age. Is this going to take much longer? I have a doctor’s appointment, you know. A real doctor, not… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had the flu, badly, back in '87. And a touch of arthritis, the doctor said. Years ago. Nothing serious. I've always been pretty healthy, actually. Strong as an ox, I was. Used to be. I didn't spend much time at the doctor's office. Waste of time, most of it is. Are you writing all this down? Because it's not exactly a thrilling story.
DOCTOR: Arthritis… What kind?
PATIENT: Honestly, I have no idea. The doctor just said “arthritis.” Rheumatoid, or something like that. I don't remember the specifics. It's in my hands, mostly. Makes gardening difficult, as I mentioned. It’s not… debilitating. Just achy. I took some pills for it for a while, but they didn't really do much, so I stopped. Don't bother with pills, if you ask me. Mostly just make you feel worse. Is this getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no. Never had a surgery in my life. I don’t believe in cutting people open unless it's absolutely necessary. My mother always said, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” She was a sensible woman. I’ve been very careful with my body. Until this… dirt thing, of course. Which, frankly, is just embarrassing. Are you going to ask me about my childhood now? Because I’m really not in the mood.
DOCTOR: Family history, then. Any significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother lived to be 92, very strong woman. She had high blood pressure towards the end. My father… he died young, heart attack. But he smoked like a chimney, so that’s not surprising. And my brother… he had some kind of cancer, years ago. Lung cancer, I think. He didn’t take care of himself, poor man. Smoked and drank too much. Honestly, bad habits run in the family. Are we done yet? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to do a quick physical exam. And I’m going to order some blood work. The dirt eating, combined with the fatigue and weight loss... it's concerning. It could be a number of things, and we need to rule some things out. Please don’t interrupt, and just… let me do the exam.
PATIENT: Oh, lovely. More poking and prodding. Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. I just wanted someone to tell me I was tired and needed a vacation, not… a full investigation. But hurry up, please. I have things to do. And try not to be too rough. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, but… slightly tender in the upper quadrants. Reflexes are diminished, but symmetrical. Joint swelling noted, consistent with arthritis. Blood pressure 130/80. Pulse 72. Temperature 98.6. Mild pallor. "I'm going to order a complete blood count, iron levels, and a basic metabolic panel. We'll also need to check your thyroid function. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I don't take medications. Never have, really. Except for some ibuprofen for my arthritis, years ago. But I stopped taking that. It didn't agree with my stomach. Just made me feel… unwell. Honestly, I don't trust those pills. Full of chemicals, they are. And I’m not allergic to anything as far as I know. Just… life, I suppose. Is that all? Can I go now? I’m starting to feel even more tired just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. I’m going to order the labs. The nurse will draw your blood before you leave. It’s likely the fatigue and dirt eating are related to an iron deficiency anemia, but we need to rule out other causes. I'm also going to recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist. It's best to get your digestive system checked out, given your unusual craving. Please schedule that appointment as soon as possible. And try to avoid eating any dirt in the meantime. It won’t help with the testing. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist? Honestly. You think my stomach is the problem? It's just… dirt. A little dirt. I've been eating dirt for six months, not swallowing rocks! And now you want me to see a specialist? This is ridiculous. Fine. I'll schedule the appointment, but I'm not promising anything. And I can't promise I won't eat a little dirt. It's a craving, you know? Not a conscious decision. Honestly, I feel like you're making a mountain out of a molehill. And please, don’t tell anyone about this. It's embarrassing enough as it is. Now, can I finally go? I need a nap. A very long nap. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will help you schedule the appointment. And I understand your… concerns. Just please follow up with the gastroenterologist as soon as possible. We need to rule everything out. Have a good day. .
