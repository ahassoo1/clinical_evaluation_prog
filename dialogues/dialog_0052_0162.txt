DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. My name is Dr. Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't really have a lot of time, so… it’s my stomach. Been bloated. Really uncomfortable. Honestly, I just want to know what I gotta do to make it stop. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I understand your time is valuable, and we’ll get straight to the point. Bloating can be quite disruptive. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort? It feels… full. Like I ate a Thanksgiving dinner, even when I haven’t. It's just… there. And it’s been happening, oh, I don't know… a while now. Weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. I don’t really keep track of that kinda thing. Look, is it serious? That’s what I need to know. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Kristofik, and we will certainly address whether this is serious. "Weeks, maybe" is helpful information – thank you. The fact that it comes and goes is also useful. To get a clearer picture, could you describe when it tends to happen?
PATIENT: When? Honestly, I haven’t noticed a pattern. After I eat sometimes, but not always. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night. It’s… random. Really random. I’m tellin’ ya, it’s just annoying. I don't need a whole investigation, alright? Just fix it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Kristofik. The randomness does make it a bit more challenging, but we’ll do our best. Even without a clear pattern, there are several possibilities we should consider. To help narrow things down, could you tell me a little about your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? What do you mean? I eat. Regular food. I don’t go for any fancy stuff, you know? Meat, vegetables… whatever's on sale at the grocery store. I ain't one of those people with special requests. I used to eat a lot more, before… well, never mind. Point is, I eat normal stuff. Is this going somewhere?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Kristofik. "Normal stuff" gives me a general idea. The change in your eating habits you mentioned is also relevant. Could you elaborate on that—what changed, and when?
PATIENT: Look, it's not important. It was… after my wife passed. Didn’t have much of an appetite for a while. Still don’t, really. Everything tastes… bland. Just trying to get by, you know? I don’t need a life story session here, Doc. Is this bloating a symptom of something serious or not? That's all I care about. I got a job to do, people rely on me. This is wasting time.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Mr. Kristofik. I understand this is difficult, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Loss of appetite and changes in taste after a significant loss are common, and can certainly affect your digestive system. Given your recent history and the ongoing bloating, we should rule out some potential causes. I'd like to ask a few more questions, and then I’d like to perform a brief physical exam if you're comfortable with that. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. The faster we figure this out, the better. But don’t expect me to remember everything you ask. My memory ain't what it used to be. Physical exam… alright. Just don’t poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I will document everything carefully, and we'll take things at your pace. First, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I mean, maybe a little sniffle when pollen’s bad, but that's just normal, right? Everyone gets a sniffle. I’m a pretty tough guy. Don't need fancy pills for a little sneeze. I told you, I don't have time for this. Is there a quick test we can do? A blood test or somethin'?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Kristofik. Seasonal allergies are common and don't usually relate to the bloating we're discussing. We can certainly consider blood tests if needed, but I’d like to start with a physical examination to get a better sense of what’s going on. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Just some ibuprofen now and then for my back. Pile driving ain’t easy on the body. That's it. Maybe a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember to buy 'em. My wife used to handle all that stuff. I’m not a complicated case, Doc. Honestly. Just a sore back and a bloated stomach. Can we please move this along?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Ibuprofen for your back and occasional multivitamins. Thank you. Before the exam, let me just ask about your family history. Do any of your close family members have a history of digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. Look, my family...we didn't really talk about that stuff much. They weren’t ones for sharing problems. My dad had… something. Heart trouble, maybe? My mom… I don’t know. It was a long time ago. They’re both gone now. It wasn't a close family, alright? Can we skip this part? I'm tellin' ya, I got nothin'. Just… move on with the exam. This is a waste of everybody's time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. We can certainly move on. Alright. Let's proceed with the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently palpate your stomach to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Would you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just be gentle, alright? Don’t go diggin' around in there. Just get it over with. I got things to do, you know. This better be quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, Mr. Kristofik. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. They are…present, but slightly diminished. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Okay, can you point to where you’re experiencing the bloating?
PATIENT: It’s… all over, really. But it's worse… down there. It just feels… full and tight. Like I swallowed a balloon. And it kinda aches. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It's like that pressure. Is that normal? Is something seriously wrong with me? I’m tellin’ ya, Doc, I need to get back to work. My crew is waitin'.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Kristofik. Mild tenderness in the lower abdomen and a feeling of fullness are common symptoms. I’m also noting a slight distension of the abdomen. Percussion reveals some tympany, which can indicate gas. I don’t feel any masses or significant abnormalities. Based on this brief examination, it doesn't immediately suggest a serious emergency, but we still need to investigate further to determine the cause of your bloating and discomfort. Given your history and symptoms, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Ugh. Fine. Whatever it takes to make this go away. But I’m warnin' ya, I ain’t good with waiting. And I ain't comin’ back for a million appointments. What kinda tests are we talkin' about? Blood work? X-rays? Just tell me. The faster we do this, the faster I can get back to my life. Honestly, this is a pain. A real pain.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I’ll do my best to expedite the process. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your liver and kidney function, and a stool sample to rule out any bacterial or parasitic infections. We may also consider a CT scan of your abdomen if your symptoms persist or worsen. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Ugh. A stool sample? Seriously? Look, Doc, I'm a pile driver operator, not a scientist. This is gettin’ ridiculous. But fine. Fine, whatever you need. Blood work, stool sample… just tell me where to go and what to do. But I’m warnin’ ya, I got a schedule. And I expect results fast. I ain’t got time for a month-long investigation. Just get this over with. Can I go now? I got a crew waitin'. A whole crew. This is costin’ me money, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Kristofik, and I assure you I will expedite the testing as much as possible. Here are the lab requisition forms. You’ll need to take these to the lab down the hall. They’ll draw some blood, and I’ve included instructions for collecting the stool sample. It's important to follow the instructions carefully for accurate results. Once you have completed the tests, the results should be available within 3-5 business days. I will have my assistant contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any questions about the testing process or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Three to five business days? That's ages! Fine. Whatever. I'll just have to rearrange my whole schedule again. Ugh. No, I don't have any questions. Just get it over with. Can I please go now? I got a job to do. Seriously. A very important job. And people are relyin' on me. This whole thing has been a waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. You are free to go. Here's my card. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing your results with you soon.
