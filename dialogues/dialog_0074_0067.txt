DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor. Reisig, you said? Yes… well, it’s this pain. When I take a deep breath, it hurts. It’s… hard to explain exactly where it hurts, though. It’s just… when I breathe deep. I hope that makes sense. I don’t remember much else about it, to be honest. I just know it’s been bothering me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Ruocco. Pain with deep breaths can certainly be concerning. It’s alright that you don’t remember specifics; we’ll work through it together. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it…? Hmm… well, it’s not… sharp, exactly. More like… a dull ache. And it doesn't happen every time I breathe deep. Sometimes it’s fine, sometimes it’s… uncomfortable. Does that help? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things. It’s just… old age, I guess. Everything gets fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Ruocco. It’s common for things to feel less clear as we get older, and you're doing a very good job of describing what you're experiencing. A dull ache that comes and goes with deep breaths is helpful information. Now, does this pain radiate anywhere – meaning, does it feel like it spreads to other parts of your body, like your back, shoulder, or neck?
PATIENT: Radiate…? Oh. No, I don’t think so. It mostly stays… here. . Maybe a little bit in my… side, sometimes. But not much. It’s hard to tell, really. Everything feels a bit… tight, you know? Like a band around my chest. But I don’t know if that’s the pain spreading, or just… being old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly localized to your chest with perhaps some slight discomfort in your side. And you describe it as a tightness as well. That is very helpful. Now, has anything specific made this pain worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. . Not that I can recall. Maybe… maybe if I try to lift something heavy. But I don’t do much lifting these days. And it's not like it always gets worse. Sometimes I can lift a bit, sometimes I can’t. I really don’t remember. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I’m sorry for being so… unhelpful. Can we just… get this over with? I have some errands to run.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Mr. Ruocco. It's completely understandable that it's difficult to recall specifics, and I appreciate you sharing what you can. We will get through this. To help me get a better understanding, and to rule out anything serious, I would like to listen to your lungs and heart, and perhaps take your blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… listen to my lungs? Yes, I suppose that’s alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I really do need to get going. My daughter… she’s expecting me. Just… be gentle, okay? I bruise easily these days. And please, don’t poke around too much. I’m not a fan of being touched.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain everything as I go. We won’t poke around too much, I promise. If you could please sit up on the examination table for me, that would be wonderful. I’ll start by listening to your lungs with my stethoscope. Take deep breaths for me when I tell you to, please. I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds on your lower right side. That means the airflow isn't as strong there as it should be. It could be a number of things. I'm also going to listen to your heart now.
PATIENT: Diminished…? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good. Is that serious, Doctor? My heart… is that serious? I just want to know… am I going to be okay? I don’t want to end up in the hospital. My daughter… she’s got enough on her plate already. Just… tell me straight, okay? No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I understand your concern, and I want to assure you that I’ll be as straightforward as possible. Diminished breath sounds can be a sign of something concerning, but it doesn’t automatically mean something serious is happening. It could be caused by a number of things, like a small amount of fluid, a previous lung issue, or even just muscle weakness. Your heart sounds regular, but to get a clearer picture of what’s going on with your lungs, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. It will allow us to see if there’s any fluid or inflammation present. Would you be able to go to the imaging center today?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, I suppose so. Is it expensive? I… I don’t really have much money, you see. And I don’t have insurance. My wife… she had insurance, but… well, she’s gone now. And I never got around to getting my own. I just… I don't want any surprises. Just tell me how much it costs, okay? Then I can decide. If it's too much… well, I don't know what I'll do.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Ruocco, and I want to assure you that we’ll do our best to find an affordable option. Because you are uninsured, the cost of an X-ray can vary. Let me check with the imaging center to see what the cash price would be. Okay, I’ve spoken with the imaging center. The cash price for a chest X-ray is $150. They do offer a small discount if you pay in cash upfront, bringing the total down to $130. Is that something you think you might be able to manage?
PATIENT: $130… Hmm… Yes. Yes, I think I can manage that. My daughter… she can probably lend me some. But I’ll have to pay her back, you see. Alright. Yes, let’s do the X-ray. Just… when will I get the results? And will you… will you explain them to me? I don't want to be left in the dark.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Ruocco. I will explain the results to you in detail, and I won't leave you in the dark. The imaging center should be able to get the images to me within 24 hours. I'll review them as soon as I receive them and schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss them. How does tomorrow afternoon sound?
PATIENT: Tomorrow afternoon… yes, that should be fine. As long as it’s not too late. My daughter… she picks me up sometimes. Alright, tomorrow afternoon it is. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… being patient with me. And for explaining everything. It’s… nice to have someone who listens. Is there anything else you need me to do? Or can I go now? I really do need to get going. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. I’m glad I could help. And you're not a bother at all. I understand you have errands to run. No, that will be all for today. I’ll have my nurse schedule your follow-up appointment for tomorrow afternoon before you leave. Just head to the front desk, and they’ll take care of it for you. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, before your appointment. And please, take care of yourself, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. .
