DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Yadao. Welcome. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Thank you. Well, it’s…it’s my waterworks, really. Or, not working properly, I should say. It’s just…difficult to go. Takes me a while, and sometimes I can’t go at all.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Difficult to go,” meaning trouble starting the stream of urine, or feeling like you don’t fully empty your bladder?
PATIENT: Both, actually. It's hard to start it, like I have to push a little. And even when I do get it going, it doesn’t always feel like everything comes out. Like there’s still some left in there, you know? It’s been going on for…oh, maybe a month now, getting worse the last week or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month now, worsening in the last week. And you're having to strain to start, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. Any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no burning or pain. Not at all. It's not uncomfortable, exactly, just…frustrating. And a little worrying, I suppose. It just takes so long, and I have to go back and try again sometimes. It’s…well, it's inconvenient, mostly. And I don't want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. Frustrating and inconvenient, and wanting to prevent it from worsening. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself – color, smell, anything unusual?
PATIENT: No, not really. It looks normal, I think. The color is…well, yellow, like it usually is. And I haven’t noticed any different smell. I drink a lot of water, always have, so it’s usually pretty clear. I try to, anyway. A glass with every meal, like my mother always told me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Drinking plenty of water is excellent. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain alongside this difficulty with urination?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my back feels alright, thank you. No pain there at all. It’s really just…the waterworks, as I said. Nothing else bothering me, just this. I feel fine otherwise, really. A bit tired sometimes, but who isn't at my age?
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay. And just to get a fuller picture, have you had any surgeries or medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was a long time ago, and I recovered fully. Otherwise, not much. I’ve always been fairly healthy, I think. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, you know? Nothing serious. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that's it. Lisinopril, I believe it's called.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, pneumonia in the past, and currently taking Lisinopril for blood pressure. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can take most anything, as far as I know. Never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I've never had trouble with any medicines before, so I don’t believe I have any allergies. Is that alright? Should I be worried about something?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no allergies. And no, you shouldn’t be worried yet. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and do a gentle exam of your lower abdomen, just to get a better sense of things. It won’t be uncomfortable, I promise. It will help me narrow down what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. A physical exam is sensible, I suppose. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Not comfortable is fine, as long as it doesn't hurt. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Ms. Yadao, if you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope first, then I’ll just do a gentle press on your lower abdomen. I'll explain what I'm doing as I go. Okay. Your abdomen sounds normal. And no tenderness to palpation, which is good. I’m noting that you do have a slightly enlarged bladder, even though you recently voided. I don’t feel any masses. Everything feels normal to the touch. Now, I’d like to order a urine test—just a simple urinalysis—to check for infection or any other abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. A urine test. Alright. Yes, that's perfectly alright. An enlarged bladder…that sounds concerning, but if it’s not painful, that's good, I suppose. Whatever you think is best. Do you need a sample now?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do need a sample now, if you’re able. There’s a private restroom just down the hall. I’ll give you a collection cup and instructions. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample about halfway through. We’ll send that off to the lab, and the results should be back within a few hours. While we're waiting, based on your symptoms and my brief exam, it sounds like you may have urinary retention – difficulty completely emptying your bladder. It's common, especially with age, and can often be managed. It could be a few things causing it, and the urine test will help rule some things out. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Urinary retention…that sounds…serious. But if it's common, that's…reassuring, I suppose. A mid-stream sample. Yes, I can do that. So, it’s not necessarily anything too terrible? And the test will tell you what’s causing it? Is it something I should be worried about? My sister, she had problems with her kidneys once...I don’t want it to be that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's natural to worry, especially with a family history. It’s not necessarily anything terrible, and it's rarely related to kidney problems. Your sister's kidney issues may be a completely separate situation. Urinary retention can be caused by a lot of things – weakened bladder muscles, nerve problems, even certain medications. The urine test will help rule out infection, which is a common cause, and give us a clearer picture. I'm also noting that you are on Lisinopril, which can, in rare cases, affect kidney function. It's not a common side effect, but we’ll want to monitor that, just to be safe. Let’s get that urine sample, and then we'll discuss some possible next steps once the results are back. We will consider whether further investigation may be necessary, like a bladder scan. For now, there’s no need to panic. We'll take it one step at a time. Do you feel comfortable going to collect the sample now?
PATIENT: Alright. One step at a time. Yes, that sounds sensible. Lisinopril… I suppose everything has side effects. Yes, I can go collect it now. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. It’s…comforting to know you're thinking about everything. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Take your time, and let me know when you're finished. I’ll be right here.
