DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about time. I woke up this morning and…well, I can’t hear out of one ear. And half my face feels like it’s going to fall off. It’s quite distressing, really. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is distressing. Losing hearing and facial weakness coming on suddenly… that’s definitely something we need to investigate promptly. Can you tell me which ear is affected, and when exactly you noticed these symptoms this morning?
PATIENT: The left one. And…let me think. I woke up, went to say good morning to the parrot – Percy, he’s a blue and gold macaw – and that’s when I realized. Didn’t hear a thing. Then I went to brush my teeth and…that’s when I noticed the drooping. It’s all very…inconvenient. I was supposed to be pruning my roses today.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the hearing loss and facial drooping both started this morning, noticed around the time of waking and while brushing your teeth. And it’s the left ear and side of your face. Is the facial weakness complete—meaning can you not move any muscles on the left side of your face at all—or is it more of a weakness?
PATIENT: Complete is a bit strong. I can try to smile, but it looks…lopsided. Very unflattering. And blinking is…difficult. It feels like I’m straining. Honestly, Dr. AX, I just want to know what’s wrong and how quickly we can fix it. I don’t do well with uncertainty. Is it a stroke? Because my cousin Beatrice had a stroke last year, and it wasn’t pretty.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum, and it’s good you’re thinking about possibilities like a stroke—that’s a very sensible thing to do. It could be a stroke, but there are other things that can cause these symptoms as well, and we need to figure out exactly what’s going on. Before we jump to conclusions, let's gather some more information. I'm going to perform a brief neurological exam, which involves checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation. I'll also need to look closely at your ear, nose, and throat. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, lovely. More poking and prodding. Honestly, the indignity of it all. Fine. Get it over with. But be quick about it. I have things to do, you know. I doubt it’s anything serious. Probably just a pinched nerve. I read something about that once. Although, it wasn't in The Lancet…was it?
DOCTOR: I'll be as efficient as possible, Ms. Nissenbaum. And we will consider a pinched nerve—it's good you're thinking about possibilities. But it's important to rule out anything more serious first. Okay, if you could sit up straight for me. First, I'm going to check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll examine your ears with an otoscope. This just lets me look inside to see if there's any obvious inflammation or blockage.
PATIENT: Do hurry. I haven't had my morning Earl Grey yet, and this is rather unsettling. I hope you washed your hands. I have a very sensitive immune system, you know. I don't go near hospitals if I can help it. Too many germs. And please, don't poke too hard in my ear. It's quite sensitive. Honestly, I expect this is going to be a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. I assure you, Ms. Nissenbaum, I always wash my hands thoroughly between patients—your health and safety are my top priority. And I will be as gentle as possible with the ear exam. Okay… I'm seeing some slight redness in the ear canal, but the eardrum itself appears intact. No obvious signs of infection or fluid build-up. Now, I'm going to ask you to open your mouth wide so I can check the back of your throat and assess your facial nerves. Can you stick your tongue out for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It’s perfectly normal, as far as I can tell. And honestly, if you’re going to stare at my tongue, at least have the decency to offer a compliment. I’ve always been rather proud of my lingual dexterity. Is that a medical term? Never mind. Just get on with it. I have roses to prune.
DOCTOR: Your tongue appears normal, and there’s no obvious asymmetry in the back of your throat. Now, I'd like to check your facial movements a bit more closely. Can you raise your eyebrows for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It’s…difficult. As I said, the left side isn’t cooperating. Are you sure you’ve washed your hands? This feels…unsettling. Honestly, I blame Percy. He’s been sneezing a lot lately. Perhaps it’s avian flu.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the weakness on the left side is quite pronounced. And I appreciate your thinking through potential causes; it's good you're considering everything. While avian flu is a possibility, it’s less likely to present this way. Now, can you try to close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. It won’t close. See? It’s quite obvious, really. What is it? A stroke? Tell me straight. I don’t have time for beating around the bush. My roses… they need me. And Beatrice’s stroke was devastating. She still can’t properly hold a teacup. Is that going to be me?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your anxiety, and it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned, especially given your cousin’s experience. Based on what I've observed during the exam—the sudden onset of hearing loss, facial weakness, and difficulty closing your left eye—the most likely diagnosis at this point is Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy is a condition caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, often thought to be triggered by a viral infection. It causes weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. Importantly, it is not a stroke, and the vast majority of people recover fully, often within weeks or months. However, it's important to rule out other possible causes and start treatment as soon as possible. To be certain, I’d like to order a blood test to check for underlying infections, and potentially an MRI of the brain to rule out other conditions.
PATIENT: Bell’s palsy. Never heard of it. A viral infection, you say? Honestly, I have a very strong immune system. I take elderberry syrup, you know. And probiotics. And I avoid sugar. It’s probably just stress. All this fuss… over stress. Honestly. MRI? More poking and prodding? How long will that take? And will it interfere with my rose pruning? I swear, if my prize-winning ‘Queen Elizabeth’ is neglected because of this… I’ll be most displeased. Can’t you just give me some sort of…injection? Or pill? Something to fix it? Immediately?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, and your desire for a quick fix. The MRI is a necessary step to rule out other potential causes, such as a tumor or stroke, and ensure we have the correct diagnosis. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes, and we can schedule it for tomorrow morning, minimizing disruption to your rose pruning. While there’s no single “cure” for Bell’s palsy, we can start treatment immediately to help reduce inflammation and improve your chances of a full recovery. I recommend a course of oral corticosteroids—a medication to reduce swelling—and possibly antiviral medication. We can also discuss supportive care, such as eye drops to keep your left eye moist, as it may not close completely, and physical therapy to help strengthen your facial muscles. I’ll also provide you with a handout explaining Bell’s palsy, the treatment options, and what to expect. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly. No. I’m perfectly healthy. Although, I had a slight reaction to chamomile tea once. It made me rather sleepy. But that’s it. And I don’t want to be on any medication. It interferes with my system. Can’t you just…rub something on my face? A cream? A lotion? Something natural? I read about arnica for inflammation… And what about Percy? Is it contagious? He’s a very valuable parrot, you know. A blue and gold macaw doesn’t come cheap. I simply must know. And are there any side effects to these…corticosteroids? Will they make me gain weight? I’m very particular about my figure. Honestly, this is most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: While arnica is a good remedy for muscle soreness, it won't address the inflammation of the facial nerve causing Bell’s palsy. Unfortunately, we need a more targeted approach. Corticosteroids are very effective at reducing inflammation, and while they can have some side effects, they are generally mild and temporary. Potential side effects can include increased appetite, temporary fluid retention, and mood changes. We’ll monitor you closely, and adjust the dosage if needed. It’s unlikely to cause significant weight gain with a short course of treatment. As for Percy, it’s unlikely Bell’s palsy is contagious to birds. However, the underlying viral infection could potentially be transmitted. It’s a good idea to practice good hygiene—wash your hands thoroughly after handling Percy, and avoid sharing food or water with him. If he develops any signs of illness—lethargy, loss of appetite, respiratory symptoms—you should consult an avian veterinarian immediately. I’m also going to write you a referral to a neurologist for a formal evaluation and to confirm the diagnosis. They can also discuss more advanced treatment options if needed. Do you have any questions about the medication or the referral?
PATIENT: A neurologist? More doctors? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Fine. I'll see a neurologist. But I expect a prompt appointment. I don't have time to waste. And if this doesn't work, I’m holding you personally responsible. And good hygiene? I’m meticulous about cleanliness. Percy has a custom-built aviary, you know. It’s sanitized daily. I suppose I should go. I have roses to prune, and a parrot to supervise. And frankly, I’m still convinced this is all stress-related. A good holiday is what I need. Somewhere warm. With a spa. Oh, and one more thing. Will these…corticosteroids affect my Earl Grey? I simply must have my Earl Grey. It’s the only thing that gets me through the day.
DOCTOR: Corticosteroids shouldn't directly affect your Earl Grey, Ms. Nissenbaum. However, they can sometimes cause minor digestive upset, so you may want to start with a smaller cup to see how you tolerate it. I’ve scheduled the neurology appointment for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. They will contact you directly to confirm. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or questions. I hope you feel better soon, and that you’re able to enjoy your roses and your Earl Grey. .
