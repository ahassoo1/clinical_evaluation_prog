DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… my sinuses. They been… bothering me. It’s hard to explain, really. It’s just… pressure. A lot of pressure. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. Maybe a few weeks ago? I work with… the drills. For oil. It’s dusty work, sometimes.
DOCTOR: “A few weeks ago…” Right. Dusty work, you say. And it’s primarily pressure you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Mostly pressure. Like… behind my eyes and in my forehead. It doesn’t… hurt, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And sometimes, I feel… stuffed up? I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s hard to breathe through my nose sometimes, too. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a… relative term. Stuffy nose with pressure… it could be a number of things. Do you have any fever, chills, or cough accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. And I haven’t been coughing. Just… the pressure. And the stuffiness. I… sometimes I get a little headache with it, but it’s not a bad headache. More like… a dull ache. I’m sorry I’m not very good at explaining. It’s just… a feeling.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Boham. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Do you recall any recent illnesses, even a simple cold, prior to this pressure starting?
PATIENT: Hmm… a cold… I… I don’t think so. Maybe… maybe a little sniffle a month or so ago? But it didn't last long. Just for a day, I think. Nothing serious. I don't usually get sick. I work outside a lot, maybe that keeps me healthy? I don't really remember. It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: A brief sniffle a month ago… Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I… I feel tired sometimes, but I work long hours. So, that could just be the work. And my nose… it sometimes feels a little… dry? Is that… a symptom? I’m not sure. I don’t know much about this. I just want it to stop feeling so… full.
DOCTOR: Dry nose… Yes, that could be related. Let’s do a quick examination, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I… I trust your judgement. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: If you’ll just sit up here for me. I’m going to take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. And I'll listen to your lungs, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. It's a little cold in here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Open, please… Good. Hmm. Your eardrums look clear. Now the right ear… Also clear. No sign of infection there. Now, let's take a look at your nasal passages… Do you use any nasal sprays or drops?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't use anything like that. Never have. Just… my nose. It gets stuffy sometimes. And dry. I don't do anything special for it. It’s just… a nose. I don't understand all the things you're looking at. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: There’s some mild swelling of the nasal turbinates, and the mucous membranes appear a little irritated. Not dramatically so, but present. Now, open wide and say “ah”… Your throat looks clear as well. No visible signs of infection there. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Alright. So, based on the examination, it appears you have some nasal congestion and irritation, likely contributing to the pressure you’re feeling.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. So it's not… serious? I was worried it was something bad. What… what causes it? Is it the dust at work? And what can I do about it? I don’t want to take anything too strong, if I can help it. I get worried about medicines.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t appear to be anything overly concerning at this time. The dust at work is a likely contributor, certainly. Chronic exposure to irritants like that can cause nasal inflammation. As for what to do… I’m not one for prescribing medications unless absolutely necessary. I suspect some simple saline nasal rinses could provide some relief. They help clear the nasal passages and reduce inflammation. Over-the-counter decongestants could also be used sparingly, but I don’t recommend long-term use. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. My mother… she had some allergies, I think. Pollen, maybe? But I don’t know if I inherited them. I haven't ever really paid much attention. Saline rinses… what are those? Are they hard to do? I've never used anything like that before. I don't want to do anything wrong.
DOCTOR: They’re quite simple, Ms. Boham. It’s essentially flushing your nasal passages with a saltwater solution. You can purchase a pre-mixed saline solution at any pharmacy, or make your own with distilled water and non-iodized salt. There are also neti pots and squeeze bottles you can use. I can have the nurse print out some instructions for you. As for long-term prevention… minimizing exposure to dust at work would be ideal, if possible. Do you wear a mask at work?
PATIENT: A mask? No, Doctor. We don’t wear masks. It's… it's a dusty job. Everyone gets dirty. I've never thought about wearing a mask. Would that… really help? I don’t want to bother my coworkers. I don't want to be difficult. And I don’t want to complain. It's just… the pressure. It's just annoying.
DOCTOR: It would certainly help reduce the amount of dust you’re inhaling. It’s a simple preventative measure. As for your coworkers… perhaps you could suggest it to them as well. Prevention is always better than treatment. Alright. I'm going to recommend the saline nasal rinses, twice a day. If that doesn't provide sufficient relief, and you're still experiencing significant pressure, you can try an over-the-counter decongestant for a short period. But no more than three to five days, understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Three to five days. I understand. Saline rinses… twice a day. Okay. And… what if it gets worse? What if it doesn’t get better at all? I don’t want to just keep feeling this way. I just want it to stop. Is there anything else I should be doing?
DOCTOR: If it doesn’t improve after a week of consistent saline rinses, or if you develop a fever, severe headache, facial pain, or thick, discolored nasal discharge, you should seek medical attention immediately. Those could be signs of a sinus infection. As for other things… ensure you're staying well-hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids. And try to avoid irritants other than the dust at work, if possible. I also recommend avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. I'll have the nurse print out those instructions as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Hydrate, avoid irritants… and see you if it gets worse. Thank you. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I feel a little better now, knowing what to do. I hope the rinses work. I really do. I don't like feeling all… stuffy.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Boham. I hope they do as well. The nurse will be in shortly with the instructions. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will. Thank you again. Have a good day to you as well. .
