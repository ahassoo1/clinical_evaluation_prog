DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Brege, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Clide Brege. Look, doc, I got a fever again. It keeps comin' back, and it’s gettin' old, real fast. I just wanna figure out what's goin' on so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “getting old” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Brege. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. When did this fever start recurring?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started… oh, about three months ago, maybe? March, around then. It'll go away for a week, two weeks, and then bam, it's back. Usually in the evenings, I notice. I take some Tylenol, it helps for a bit, but then it just… comes back. It's not high high, you know? Just kinda warm. Enough to make me feel lousy.
DOCTOR: “Kinda warm.” Right. And what other symptoms do you experience with this fever, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Well, usually just tired. Real tired. And achy, like I been workin' in the garden all day, even when I haven’t. No cough, no… nothin' else really. Just feel beat down, you know? Like somethin's fightin' inside me. And I get a little bit of a chill sometimes, even when I'm warm. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, vague sensations aren't particularly helpful. Let’s try to be… systematic. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Nah, I don't think so. My wife, Maria, she's the one who keeps track of that stuff. But I ain't been eatin' less, that's for sure. Maybe a little, 'cause I don't feel so good when the fever hits, but nothin' drastic. I’m a pretty steady eater, always have been. You got any other questions? I got appointments later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's move on. Any recent travel, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Travel? No, not really. Just to the grocery store, you know? And to see my grandkids last month, but that was just a day trip. Nothin' fancy, nothin' out of the country or nothin'. Been stickin' close to home, mostly. This fever's keepin' me from doin' much anyway.
DOCTOR: And any changes in your bowel habits, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute. Now you're askin' personal questions. What's that got to do with a fever? I mean, I go to the bathroom like everybody else, doc. Is this really necessary? I just wanna know why I keep gettin' sick.
DOCTOR: It’s called a comprehensive history, Mr. Brege. We rule things out. Now, have you noticed any diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Look, I don't appreciate bein' asked about this stuff. I told you, I just got a fever! I'm a chiropractor, I know a little somethin' about the body, and I don't see what my… bathroom habits have to do with feelin' warm. I'm gettin' a little frustrated here. Can we just focus on the fever, please? I got folks waitin' on me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on, then. Have you been experiencing any night sweats?
PATIENT: Night sweats… hmm. Maybe a little. Maria says I sometimes kick the blankets off, but I sleep pretty warm anyway. She's always adjustin' the temperature. So I don't know if that's unusual or just her bein'… Maria. It’s not like I’m soaked or anything. Just a little warm when I wake up. Is that helpful? Look, I’m not good at rememberin’ these little details, okay? I'm just tryin' to tell you what's goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the Tylenol, when the fever hits. And sometimes a little something for my arthritis, but that's just as needed. Nothing regular. My wife keeps track of that stuff too, she'll know the names better than me. Look, is there a test you can do to figure out what’s goin’ on? I don’t wanna sit here all day talkin’ about blankets and… things. I got a practice to run, you know? Folks depend on me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Lie back on the examination table, please. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just hurry it up, doc. I got appointments stacked up this afternoon. Just let me know if you need me to breathe deep or somethin'. I'm not good with these medical things, you know?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lung sounds are clear, though slightly diminished basally bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Slight hepatomegaly noted. I’m also going to check your temperature, pulse and blood pressure now.
PATIENT: Okay, go ahead. Is that hepatomegaly… bad? What does that even mean? My wife, Maria, she always knows all the big words. Just tell me if it's somethin' serious, okay? I'm startin' to get worried now.
DOCTOR: Temperature is 100.8 Fahrenheit. Pulse is 88 and regular. Blood pressure is 130/80. The hepatomegaly simply means your liver is slightly enlarged. It can be caused by a number of things, and isn’t necessarily serious on its own, but it does warrant further investigation. Given your recurring fever and the slight enlargement of your liver, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out some potential infections and assess your liver function.
PATIENT: Blood work? What kind of blood work? And how long is that gonna take? I got folks waitin'! And… is it gonna be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know. This is gettin’ complicated. I just wanted somethin’ to knock this fever down, not a whole… investigation.
DOCTOR: We’ll need a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. It will take a few days to get the results back. As for the cost… I understand you don’t have insurance. Let me see if we can work something out with the lab. There may be a discount available, or a payment plan. It’s difficult to give you a precise figure at this point, but I’ll have the receptionist look into it for you. In the meantime, continue taking the Tylenol as needed for the fever, and try to get as much rest as possible. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Rest? I got a practice to run, doc! But… okay, I guess I can try. A few days, huh? That’s gonna be tough. And the money… Maria’s gonna be worried. Alright, fine. Just… tell the receptionist to call me if it’s gonna be somethin’ I can’t handle. And can I get a note or somethin' for work? To explain why I might be a little slow for a few days? Just… somethin’. I really need to get back. .
DOCTOR: Here's a note for your work explaining your recent illness and the need for potential adjustments. We'll call you as soon as the lab results are available. In the meantime, if your fever spikes significantly, or you develop any new symptoms like shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or jaundice, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
