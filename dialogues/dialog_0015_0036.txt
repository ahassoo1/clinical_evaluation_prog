DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I am here for... the check-up before the insurance starts, yes? Medicare sent me. It is a physical, I think they said.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. A Medicare welcome-to-Medicare physical. It’s good you’re getting that done. We'll go over your medical history, do a quick physical exam, and make sure everything is in order. Now, to start, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to come in today, beyond just the insurance requirement?
PATIENT: Honestly? It is mostly the insurance. I do not... feel sick. I work, I eat, I sleep. Everything is… fine. I do not understand why I need to talk about why I come if it is just for the paper. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Barban, even if it is primarily for insurance purposes, these physicals are an opportunity to establish a baseline for your health. Things can develop without you necessarily feeling sick. We want to catch anything early, if possible. It’s not just paperwork. But, if you insist, we can keep it brief. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant… conditions? No. I had the usual childhood things. Measles, chickenpox… my mother took care of it. Nothing… serious. I do not remember any doctors after that, until this. Is a bad back considered significant? It aches sometimes from the work. But I do not think it is important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Measles, chickenpox, and occasional back pain. And you say this back pain is related to your work?
PATIENT: Yes. I lift heavy boxes. It is what I do. Sometimes it hurts more than others. I take… what is it called… ibuprofen. The blue pills. It helps, mostly. It is not… a constant pain. It comes and goes. I do not need a doctor for a little back ache, no?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, even intermittent pain can indicate an underlying issue. Ibuprofen can mask the symptoms, but it doesn't address the root cause. What kind of work do you do, exactly?
PATIENT: I work at the food processing plant. Near the highway. We box the vegetables. Tomatoes, peppers, onions… all of it. A lot of lifting. A lot of bending. It is… work. My hands also hurt sometimes. From the boxes, you understand. It is rough on the skin. Do you need to know what vegetables I box? This feels very… detailed for a simple check-up.
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Mr. Barban. Your occupation gives me insight into potential stressors on your body. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My father… he passed away a few years ago. Heart. My mother… she is still living, in Yemen. I do not speak to her often. It is… difficult. I do not know much about his health problems, besides the heart. My mother… she is old. Old people have old problems, yes? I do not have details. She does not… share those things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Father, deceased, heart problems. Mother, living, details unknown. Do you have any siblings?
PATIENT: Yes. Two brothers, and one sister. They all live in Yemen. I do not see them often. We… communicate sometimes, but not about health things. They are busy with their own lives, and I am here. It is… different. I do not think they have any major problems. They seem… fine, when we speak. Is this really important, Doctor? Everyone has little aches and pains, no?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand you find this process tedious, but it’s my job to get a comprehensive understanding of your health background. Even “little aches and pains” can be important clues. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never. Smoking is… foolish. Waste of money. Bad for you. I drink… sometimes. A little tea. And occasionally… a beer with my coworkers. But not every day. A few times a month, maybe. It helps me relax after work. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: A few beers a month is unlikely to be a significant issue. Do you engage in any regular exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise? I lift boxes all day. Is that not exercise? It is… hard work. I do not go to a gym or anything. I do not have time for that. It is enough with the lifting. It keeps me… busy. Is this what doctors ask everyone? It seems… strange. I thought this was a physical, not a life review.
DOCTOR: Alright. No formal exercise. Now, to finish with the history, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I eat everything. Sometimes my skin gets… itchy, if I work with the tomatoes too much. But it is just a rash. It goes away. I am not… allergic to anything serious, no. Can we be done with the questions now, Doctor? I feel… tired of talking about myself.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Barban. Let's proceed with the physical examination then. Please step onto the scale. I will need your height and weight confirmed as well. And if you could please remove your shirt, we'll check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Fine. But I hope this does not take long. I have things to do. My height… it is almost two meters. I am a tall man. As for weight… I do not know exactly, but I am not… overweight. Just… solid.
DOCTOR: Your height is 1.88 meters, and your weight is 90 kilograms. That puts your BMI at… let's move on. Your heart sounds are regular, though slightly fast. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And finally, I'll just take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. It's a little elevated.
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? Is something wrong? I feel fine. I do not understand all this… measuring and listening. Is this because I lift boxes? This is probably because of the lifting. Everything is because of the lifting, no? Can we just… be done now, Doctor? I just want to know if I am healthy enough for the insurance.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your BMI is in the overweight range. While you feel fine now, consistently elevated blood pressure can lead to health problems down the line, such as heart disease and stroke. And yes, heavy lifting can contribute to this, but it’s not the only factor. Based on what I've observed, and your history, I would classify you as prehypertensive and recommend some lifestyle modifications. We'll also want to run some basic blood tests – a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a basic metabolic panel – to get a more comprehensive picture of your overall health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Pre-… what? Lifestyle… modifications? What does that even mean? Do I need to stop lifting boxes? Because that is not… possible. I need the job. And blood tests? More needles? This is becoming… complicated. I just wanted a simple check-up for the insurance, Doctor. Now you are telling me I have problems and need… changes? Is this what everyone gets? I do not understand any of this. Can you just tell me… am I healthy enough for the insurance, yes or no? I do not need all this… extra information.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your frustration. However, simply telling you "yes" or "no" without addressing these concerns would be irresponsible. The insurance company will require documentation of a physical exam and basic health screening. Based on my initial assessment, you are physically capable of working, but you have risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease. The lifestyle modifications I'm recommending – which include dietary changes, regular exercise – are to help mitigate those risks. We can also discuss options for managing your blood pressure if it remains elevated. I strongly recommend following through with the blood tests, so we can get a clearer picture of your health and develop a plan to address any potential issues. Do you consent to the blood tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. But I do not promise I will… change my diet or start… exercising. I lift boxes. That is my exercise. And I eat what I can. Do not expect miracles, Doctor. But yes, do the tests. Just… get it over with. I need to go to work after this. Can we be done soon? And what exactly is a lipid panel? You keep using these… words.
DOCTOR: Very well. A lipid panel measures your cholesterol levels – HDL, LDL, and triglycerides. It helps us assess your risk of heart disease. The lab technician will draw a small amount of blood from your arm. It shouldn't take long. They're ready for you now. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. I strongly advise you to reconsider your lifestyle choices, Mr. Barban. Your health is your responsibility. And remember, ignoring these issues now could have serious consequences down the line. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. .
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. I’m going to get the tests. But do not expect me to change. Stop.
