DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Galena. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it is… a bit embarrassing, but I have been having a lot of gas. More gas than usual, you see. It is… uncomfortable. And it happens often.
DOCTOR: Okay, gas… more than usual. And it’s causing you discomfort. I understand. That is uncomfortable. Now, when did you first start noticing this increase in gas?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it began, I believe, maybe… three weeks ago? Around the 15th of July, perhaps? It was… gradual. Not a sudden thing. Just… slowly getting worse, you see. I remember because the weather was very warm then.
DOCTOR: Three weeks ago, around July 15th… gradual onset. Okay. And has anything changed in your diet or routine around that time, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. Let me consider… Hmm. Not really, not that I can recall. I eat mostly the same things. I work at the burger place, so… well, I eat some burgers sometimes, of course. But I have been doing that for a long time. Nothing new, no. I walk to work, same as always. Perhaps… the tomatoes? I did eat a few more tomatoes than usual, maybe a week or so before it started. But not a large amount.
DOCTOR: Tomatoes… interesting. Okay. And besides the discomfort from the gas, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. Just the… the gas. And sometimes a little bit of bloating, you see. But not always. It’s not painful, just… full. And… well, it makes me a little self-conscious, if I am honest. Especially at work. It’s not good for business, you understand.
DOCTOR: Self-conscious, yes, I can appreciate that. No pain, just gas and occasional bloating. Alright. Let's just quickly run through some general health questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I have taken many medicines in my life, and never had a reaction. I am quite sure. I eat most things without issue, apart from… well, I don’t like olives. But that is a preference, not an allergy, you understand.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I do not take any pills or anything like that. Just… food. And water, of course. I try to drink plenty of water. My mother always said it was good for you.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. And have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I had the usual childhood things, you see. Measles, mumps… nothing serious. As an adult… I had my appendix out many years ago. Maybe fifteen years ago? But that was all. Otherwise, I have been quite healthy. A little bit of gas now, of course, but… that is why I am here.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed fifteen years ago, otherwise generally healthy. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she lived to be a very old age, 92, you see. But she had… arthritis, I think. And my father, he passed away when I was young. He had… problems with his heart, I believe. But I do not have either of those problems. It is… complicated to remember, you understand. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, complicated to remember. That's perfectly alright. Alright, Mr. Goodstein, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listening to your abdomen, and feeling it a bit. It will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on your back for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. Is there anything specific I should be doing? Breathing a certain way?
DOCTOR: Just relax and breathe normally, Mr. Goodstein. Okay… sounds are within normal limits. A little bit of… gurgling, which is to be expected. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. Just… a little bit of pressure, of course. But nothing painful. It feels… normal, I think. Perhaps a little bit full. But I said that already, didn't I? It is… difficult to describe. It is not sharp pain, just… discomfort. Like there is too much air inside.
DOCTOR: No guarding or rebound tenderness. Your abdomen is soft, although a little distended. Okay, Mr. Goodstein. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing excessive gas, possibly related to your diet. It could be something as simple as increased fiber intake or certain foods that you're sensitive to. However, to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a simple blood test – just a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. That will help us see if there's any underlying inflammation or other issues. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it will help, then yes, please. A blood test is fine. I trust your judgment. I want to make sure it is not something serious. It is… reassuring to know you are checking. What do I need to do? And when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s a requisition form. You can go to any lab that accepts Medicare. It just needs a simple blood draw. Fasting is not required. And the results should be back in about 2-3 business days. We can discuss them then. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a food diary – write down everything you eat and drink, and note when you experience gas. That might help us identify any triggers. And you could try over-the-counter simethicone - it’s a gas relief medication. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes perfect sense. A food diary… and the simethicone. I will do that. And I will go to the lab tomorrow. Thank you very much for your help. I feel much better knowing we are doing something about it. It is… a relief. I appreciate your time and patience. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or any warning signs I should look out for?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. Keep an eye out for any severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, or fever. If you experience any of those symptoms, please come back immediately or go to the emergency room. Otherwise, focus on the food diary and the simethicone. We’ll review the blood test results when they come back. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your kindness and patience. Thank you again for your time. I will see you in a few days, then. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. You take care of yourself. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before our next appointment. Goodbye. .
