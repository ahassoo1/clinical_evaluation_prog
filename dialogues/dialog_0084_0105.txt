DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s about getting surgery... for my weight, I guess. It’s a bit of a blur, to be honest, all the appointments and stuff. I think this is the check-up before that happens?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can be a lot to keep track of. So, you’re here for a pre-operative evaluation for weight loss surgery. Let's clarify a few things to make sure everything is clear. First, can you tell me a little bit about why you're considering surgery now?
PATIENT: It's... hard to say exactly. Things have been getting tougher, you know? Just… everyday stuff. Walking around, keeping up with my wife... it's getting harder. I get tired really easily. I don't really remember when it started being this bad, just that it is. I guess I just want to feel normal again. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like your quality of life is being significantly impacted. We want to make sure surgery is the right step for you, and that we’re addressing everything. So, aside from the tiredness and difficulty with daily activities, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my knees bother me, especially at the end of the day. And… I get out of breath pretty easily climbing stairs. I don't really get chest pain or anything, just… winded. I think I snore a lot, my wife complains about it, but I don't really notice when I'm asleep. Is that… a symptom? I don’t know much about this stuff.
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to mention, thank you. Knee pain, shortness of breath, and snoring – all can be related. Snoring can be a sign of sleep apnea, which we’ll definitely want to explore further. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… I don't think so. High blood pressure… maybe? I think a doctor mentioned something about it a while back, but I honestly can’t remember. I’ve seen a few doctors over the years, moving around and all. I don’t really have all my records handy. I think my cholesterol might be a little high, but again, I'm not sure. Sorry, this is all a bit fuzzy. I wish I was better at keeping track of things.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Kochubey. It’s common for things to get lost in the shuffle. We can try to piece things together. Okay, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a kid, a long time ago. They had to put a cast on it. And… uh… I had my tonsils out when I was little too, I think. Other than that… not really. No major hospital stays that I can remember. Nothing recently, for sure. It’s been a while since I’ve really been sick, honestly. Mostly just feeling tired these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. My family… we don’t really talk about health much. My dad… he had some heart problems, I think. He passed away a few years ago. And my mom… she had arthritis, really bad. She’s still around, but she’s not doing great. I think my uncle had diabetes, but I’m not positive. It’s hard to say, honestly. We weren’t really close. I don’t know much about their medical history, to be honest. Sorry again. It’s just… a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly understandable. We'll proceed with what you do know. Let's talk about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke, and I don’t use any tobacco. My wife doesn’t smoke either, thankfully. We both try to stay healthy, as much as we can. It's just… harder when you're carrying extra weight, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Just a glass of wine with dinner, maybe on the weekends. Nothing heavy. My wife will have a glass too. We don’t really go out drinking or anything. It’s not a habit, just… social. And relaxing, sometimes. But not every day, definitely not. I wouldn’t say I drink a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin sometimes, just a basic one. And… occasionally, when my knees are really bothering me, I'll take some ibuprofen. But that’s it, I think. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. Just the occasional ibuprofen for the pain. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things, taken different medications when I was sick as a kid, and never had a problem. I don’t think I have any allergies, but I can’t say for sure. I’ve never really been tested or anything. It’s just… never come up.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. Just let me know if anything feels… weird. I’m not really good with medical stuff, so… I’ll trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 148/92, which is a little elevated. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some fullness. I’m noting a BMI of 34, which classifies as obesity. Do you have any pain when I press here on your abdomen?
PATIENT: Ouch, a little. Not bad pain, just… uncomfortable. Especially right there. It feels kind of… full, like I ate a big meal. Even when I haven’t. It’s just… always a little uncomfortable. It’s something I’ve gotten used to, I guess. But it's there.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m also noting some mild edema in your lower extremities – a little swelling in your ankles and feet. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help us check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and other important markers. We’ll also want to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Definitely. Whatever you think is best. Just… let me know when and where to go for the tests. I’m not very good at remembering things, so… maybe a little reminder would be helpful? I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. I’ll have the lab draw scheduled for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM here at the clinic. And we'll get the EKG done right after the blood work. I'll also have a reminder sent to your phone. Based on what we’ve discussed today, and pending the results of your blood work and EKG, we’ll assess if you are a good candidate for weight loss surgery. We’ll also discuss the different surgical options and the potential risks and benefits. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Um… yes, actually. What… what if I am a good candidate? What happens next? And… how long does the surgery take? Is it… really painful? I’m a little scared, to be honest. I’ve never had any major surgery before. I just… want to feel better, you know? That’s all. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Mr. Kochubey. It's perfectly normal to be scared, and it's good you're asking these questions. If your tests come back showing you're a suitable candidate, we'll schedule a pre-operative consultation with the surgeon. They will go over the details of the surgery, answer any further questions you have, and obtain your informed consent. The length of the surgery depends on the specific procedure chosen, but most weight loss surgeries take between one to three hours. As for pain, you will experience some pain after surgery, but we manage it very effectively with medication. We'll also provide you with detailed pain management instructions to follow at home. There is also a significant rehabilitation process, but we’ll ensure you have all the support you need. It’s important to remember that this is a journey, and we’ll be with you every step of the way. We want to make sure you feel comfortable and supported throughout the entire process. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Do you have any other immediate questions?
