DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Mastrantonio. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Voytek. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing a rather… peculiar sensation in my back. It’s a popping, or clicking, sound and feeling. It’s been happening for a little while now, and frankly, it’s a bit concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sensation in your back. That's good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It seems to occur most often when I’m, well, moving. Specifically, bending or twisting. It doesn’t necessarily hurt each time, but it’s… noticeable. Sometimes there’s a slight stiffness afterward, but nothing debilitating. I work with transportation equipment – electrical systems mostly – so I’m often in awkward positions, reaching and working in tight spaces. I suppose that could be related.
DOCTOR: Alright, bending and twisting brings it on, and you’re an electrician, working in tight spaces… that definitely gives us some clues. Is it happening on one side of your back more than the other, or is it pretty central?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. I believe it's more prominent on my right side, just a bit below my shoulder blade. It's not constant, but when it happens, it’s definitely more noticeable on that side. I hadn’t really pinpointed that specifically before, but you’re right to ask. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a feeling of something clicking and a slight give.
DOCTOR: Okay, right side, below the shoulder blade. And no sharp pain, just clicking and a feeling of giving way. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse besides bending and twisting?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. Prolonged sitting seems to aggravate it. If I’m sitting for a long period, especially in a less-than-ideal chair, it tends to flare up more quickly when I do move afterward. And lifting, even relatively light objects, if done with a twisting motion, definitely makes it worse. I haven’t noticed anything that actively improves it, to be honest. Just avoiding those movements when possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, prolonged sitting worsens it, and lifting with twisting is bad. Avoiding movements helps. Have you ever injured your back before, Mr. Mastrantonio?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Quite a long time ago, when I was a younger man, I strained my back while helping a friend move some furniture. It wasn’t a severe injury, thankfully – no broken bones or anything like that – but it required a few weeks of physical therapy. It fully recovered, as far as I know, but perhaps it left some lingering vulnerability. It was probably… twenty years ago now.
DOCTOR: Twenty years ago… okay, good to know. And since then, have you had any other back problems, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, not really. There have been times when it felt a bit stiff after a long day, but nothing that didn’t resolve with a good night’s sleep or a warm shower. This clicking sensation is new, and it’s what’s concerning me. It’s not the pain, it’s the feeling of something not being quite right. I work with my hands, you see, and I need my back to be reliable.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Needing to be reliable for your work is important. Let’s do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Great. If you don’t mind, I’m going to have you stand and I’ll take a look at your posture and range of motion. Then I’ll palpate your spine and surrounding muscles. I’ll also check your reflexes and sensation. Just let me know if anything causes you pain or discomfort. Okay, can you bend forward and touch your toes, or as close as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Certainly. There we go. That’s about as far as I can comfortably go without causing any significant discomfort. It’s not painful, but I feel a bit of a stretch in my lower back. And I can feel that clicking sensation, though it’s quite faint.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And now, can you bend backward, gently?
PATIENT: Alright, that's as far as I'd like to go with that. It feels a bit tighter bending backward than forward, if that makes sense. Again, no pain, but a definite feeling of restriction. The clicking isn't as noticeable in this direction.
DOCTOR: Okay, restriction bending backwards, less clicking. Now, can you side bend to the right, and then to the left?
PATIENT: Alright, bending to the right… feels a bit more limited than the left. And yes, I can definitely feel that clicking sensation on my right side when I bend that way. It's not excruciating, but it's… present. Bending to the left feels a bit easier, with no clicking that I can detect.
DOCTOR: Okay, clicking on the right with side bending, easier movement and no clicking on the left. Now, if you’ll allow me, I’d like to palpate your spine and the muscles on either side. Just let me know if anything is tender.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please proceed. Ooh, that’s a bit tender. Right there, just below my shoulder blade on the right side. Not a sharp pain, but definitely sensitive to the touch. Everything else feels… normal, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a little tenderness right there. And I'm feeling some muscle tension on that right side as well. It doesn’t seem to be radiating anywhere, thankfully. Alright. Based on what I’m feeling, and what you’ve told me, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain or a facet joint issue on your right side. The clicking sound is probably related to slight inflammation or a bit of catching in the joint. It's good that there's no radiating pain, which makes more serious issues less likely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some X-rays of your lumbar spine, just to rule out any underlying structural problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. X-rays seem prudent. Yes, please, go ahead and order them. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I would like to know definitively what's going on, and ruling things out is a good approach. I have private insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, your insurance is fine; I’ll just need to verify your information. Okay, I’ve ordered the X-rays. You can schedule them at the imaging center down the street – I’ll have my assistant give you the information on your way out. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting, twisting motions, or prolonged sitting as much as possible. You can try using an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you’re not allergic, to help with any discomfort. And I’d like you to start doing some gentle stretching exercises – I can give you a handout with some recommendations before you leave. Once we have the X-ray results, we can discuss a more definitive treatment plan – that might include physical therapy, muscle relaxants, or, in some cases, injections. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds like a very comprehensive plan, Doctor. Avoiding lifting and twisting, over-the-counter pain relief, gentle stretching… and then the X-rays and a follow-up. Yes, that is perfectly alright. A handout with the stretching exercises would be greatly appreciated. Thank you again for your thoroughness and patience. I feel much better knowing we have a plan in place.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mastrantonio. I’m glad I could help. Here’s the handout with the stretching exercises. They're pretty simple – just focus on gentle movements, and don’t push yourself too hard. My assistant will schedule your follow-up appointment for after the X-rays. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as radiating pain, numbness, or weakness, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve answered all of my questions, and you’ve given me a very clear understanding of what's going on and what to expect. I appreciate your time and expertise. I’ll schedule the X-rays and follow your recommendations. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mastrantonio. Get some rest, and remember to be gentle with yourself. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well. .
