DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s good to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s my family, you see. Lots of… problems. My mother, she had… things. And my brother, not so good either. I just want to make sure I don’t get them, if that makes sense. Just peace of mind, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It's very proactive of you to think about your family history and your own health. “Peace of mind” is a perfectly good reason to be here. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a bit more about what your mother and brother experienced?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had trouble with her thinking. Forgetting things, mostly. Got worse and worse, you know? She… she didn’t know who people were at the end. It was sad. And my brother… he had shaking. Real bad shaking. Couldn’t hold a cup of tea, even. He… he passed away a few years back. It was quick. I don’t know… is that helpful? I’m not a doctor, you see. I don’t know the names of things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schwer, that is very helpful. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like both your mother and brother experienced significant health challenges. Based on what you've told me – trouble with memory progressing to not recognizing people, and shaking that impacted your brother’s daily life – it sounds like we should explore the possibility of neurological conditions. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. First, do you recall approximately when your mother and brother were diagnosed, or when their symptoms started becoming noticeable?
PATIENT: Oh… um. My mother… I think it was… maybe ten, fifteen years ago? It started slow, you know? Just little things. Forgetting where she put her glasses, then forgetting names. It took a while for us to realize it was… something. And my brother… he was diagnosed… oh, geez… maybe eight years ago? He complained about the shaking for a while before that, but he thought it was just stress. He worked hard. Really hard. I don’t know dates, Doctor. Sorry. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize at all, Mr. Schwer. Approximate timelines are perfectly fine. It's more important to get a sense of the progression. So, your mother's symptoms developed over perhaps ten to fifteen years, and your brother's shaking was present for at least eight years before his diagnosis. Now, have you experienced any similar symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… I have been forgetting things a little more lately. Not like my mother, not yet. Just… where I put my keys, or what I was going to buy at the store. Little things. And sometimes… my hand feels a little shaky when I’m trying to button my shirt. But I just thought I was getting old! I’m seventy-three, you know. Things start to go, right? I haven’t told anyone. Didn’t seem like a big deal.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Schwer. It’s easy to attribute those kinds of changes to age. However, given your family history, it’s good you mentioned it. We want to rule out anything more serious. To get a better understanding, could you describe the shaking in your hand a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not constant, you see. It only happens sometimes. When I try to do something… delicate. Like buttoning my shirt, or… writing my name. It’s a little tremble. Not real bad, like my brother’s. Just… a little shake. It doesn’t hurt. It’s just… annoying. And it seems to be worse when I’m tired, or stressed. I had a little trouble opening a jar of pickles the other day. That’s when I really noticed it. Does that make sense? I feel silly talking about this. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound silly at all, Mr. Schwer. It's good you're paying attention to these changes. The fact that it's intermittent and seems to be worse with fatigue or stress is helpful information. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms – any changes in your balance, your speech, your vision, or your mood?
PATIENT: Hmm… balance… no, not really. I feel a little unsteady sometimes, but I think that’s just my knees. They’ve always been bad. Speech… no, I don’t think so. I’m not saying things funny, am I? My wife used to tell me I talked too much, but… she’s gone now. Vision… a little blurry sometimes, but I have glasses. And mood… well, I get sad sometimes. I miss my wife. But that’s normal, right? Losing someone… it changes you. I don't think that's anything to do with… this. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to worry now. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable that you're worried, Mr. Schwer. And it’s good you're sharing these feelings with me. I want to assure you that we’re just gathering information at this point. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. Given your family history and the symptoms you've described, I'd like to perform a brief neurological exam. It will involve checking your reflexes, your balance, your coordination, and your cognitive function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a test? Okay. I guess so. But I’m not very good at tests. I never was. I always worried too much. What kind of test is it? Will it hurt? I don't want to be poked and prodded. And… will it take long? I have an appointment with the barber later. He’s good, you see. Hard to get in.
DOCTOR: It's a very simple exam, Mr. Schwer. Nothing to worry about at all. No poking or prodding, I promise. It will involve a few basic movements, some questions, and a quick check of your reflexes. It won’t hurt at all. It should only take about fifteen to twenty minutes. We can absolutely make sure you have plenty of time to get to your barber appointment afterward. If you’d like, we can take a quick break before we begin if that would make you more comfortable. Would you like to sit up now and we’ll get started?
PATIENT: Okay… fifteen minutes, you say? Alright. As long as it doesn’t take long. And no poking. You promise? My wife used to say I was a terrible patient. Always complaining. Let’s get it over with then. I suppose. Where do I sit?
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Right this way. And I promise – no poking. We’ll just be doing some gentle checks. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know, and we can stop. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breath… like this? Is that good? It feels funny lying back. I always get a little dizzy. And my back… it’s not what it used to be. I used to be a strong man, you know. Worked on a farm. Lots of lifting. But that was a long time ago. Is that what you want? Breathing? I’m doing it. Is there anything else? This is making me nervous.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Mr. Schwer. Your breathing sounds good. And yes, you're doing wonderfully. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Could you please relax your legs for me?
PATIENT: Relax… okay. But I always get a little jumpy. My wife used to say I had… twitchy legs. It’s a nervous habit. You’re going to hit my knees, aren’t you? With that little hammer thing? I don’t like that. It always makes my leg kick. It’s embarrassing. Just be gentle, okay? Very gentle. Here we go…
DOCTOR: Just a quick tap, Mr. Schwer. Okay, good. And on this side… Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Could you please stand up for me when you're ready?
PATIENT: Diminished? What does that mean? Is that bad? Oh… standing. Right. I’m a little wobbly. My knees… they’re not what they used to be. Be careful, okay? I don’t want to fall. This is… unsettling. Is that good enough? Standing… I’m standing. What now?
DOCTOR: That's good, Mr. Schwer. Just take your time. I'm right here if you need me. Now, if you could just try standing with your feet together and close your eyes for a moment. Just for a few seconds. If you feel unsteady at all, let me know immediately.
PATIENT: Close my eyes? Oh… that sounds… risky. I get dizzy easily, you see. What if I fall? I really don’t want to fall. I… I don’t know if I can do this, Doctor. It feels… unsafe. Maybe we should skip this part? I’m getting a little panicked now. It’s my knees, I swear. They’ve always been bad. See? I’m wobbly! Very wobbly.
DOCTOR: You're right, Mr. Schwer. We can absolutely skip this part. Your safety is the most important thing. It sounds like your knees are indeed contributing to your instability, and we don't want to push anything. Now, let’s just talk for a moment. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief examination we were able to do, it sounds like you have some symptoms that warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood tests and an MRI of your brain. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… thank goodness. Blood tests… that’s okay. I don’t like needles, but… it’s better than falling. And an MRI? What’s that? Is it safe? Will it hurt? I’ve heard things about those machines… loud noises and… I don’t know. I get claustrophobic easily. Small spaces… they make me anxious. I’m already worried enough as it is. This is all very… overwhelming. What are we even looking for, Doctor? What if it’s something bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schwer. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious about tests, especially when you're not sure what to expect. An MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is a painless imaging test that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the inside of your brain. It doesn’t use any radiation. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped machine. It can be a bit loud, and it does take a while, but we can provide you with earplugs and headphones to help with the noise. We can also offer a mild sedative if you’re concerned about claustrophobia. As for what we’re looking for, we want to rule out any structural issues in your brain that could be causing your symptoms – things like small strokes, or changes associated with conditions like Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease. We’re not necessarily looking for anything specific at this point, we just want to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The tests will help us to determine the best course of action, and we'll discuss the results with you in detail. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… no radiation, that’s good. And earplugs… and headphones. Maybe a pill too? If it’s really small… Parkinson’s… and Alzheimer’s… those sound… terrible. My mother… she had Alzheimer’s, you know. It was awful. Watching her… forget everything. I don’t want that. I guess… I guess I should just do the tests. But I’m really nervous, Doctor. Really, really nervous. When can I have them? And will someone be with me during the MRI? I don't want to be alone in that machine.
DOCTOR: You're right to be nervous, Mr. Schwer. It’s a big step, and it’s okay to feel anxious. And absolutely, someone will be with you during the MRI. A technician will be right there monitoring you, and they can communicate with you at any time. You won’t be alone. Let’s see… we can schedule the MRI for next week, on Wednesday morning. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Wednesday… yes, that should be okay. I don't have any appointments that day. But promise me… promise me someone will be right there? And they’ll tell me what’s going on? I don't want to be surprised. And what if they find something? What then? Will I have to… I don’t know… have surgery? Or take pills forever? This is all so scary, Doctor. I just wanted peace of mind. Now I’m more worried than ever.
DOCTOR: I understand your fears, Mr. Schwer, and I promise you, we’ll take things one step at a time. Absolutely, a technician will be right there with you throughout the entire MRI, and they will be able to answer any questions you have. They can also stop the test at any time if you feel uncomfortable. And if we do find something, we’ll discuss it with you in detail, explain all of your options, and create a plan that’s right for you. It may or may not involve surgery or medication, depending on the findings. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let's just focus on getting the MRI scheduled. I’m going to have my assistant schedule the appointment for you and give you detailed instructions about what to expect. We’ll also provide you with a contact number so you can reach out with any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… please make sure someone is there. And that they explain everything. I don’t want to be left in the dark. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I’m just… a nervous old man. I suppose I should go home and try to relax. But I don’t think I’ll be able to. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. And please don’t apologize for being nervous. It's perfectly understandable. We’ll take excellent care of you. My assistant will be right with you to schedule the appointment. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. Take care, Mr. Schwer. And try to relax as much as possible. .
