DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Asthore. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's good to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… feeling of getting weaker, you see. It's been happening slowly, over time. Not all at once, but… less strength, especially in my legs. It makes walking a little hard sometimes. My wife, she noticed it before I did, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information, thank you. It’s often helpful when family members notice things too. So, this weakness… you said it’s been gradual, over time. Can you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months ago? Or a little more? It started with just feeling tired after walking a bit, like after going to the store. Now… now it’s harder to get up from the chair sometimes. It's not pain, Doctor, just… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, starting with fatigue and progressing to difficulty rising from a chair. And you’ve emphasized it’s not pain, but a feeling of heaviness. Do you notice it more at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. In the mornings it's… the worst. Like my legs are filled with cement. It gets a little better as the day goes on, but never fully goes away. And after a lot of walking, like if we go to church, it’s bad again.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse in the mornings and after activity, improving somewhat during the day. That's helpful. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, my balance isn't what it used to be. I stumble a little more. And sometimes my vision gets blurry, but only for a short time. It’s hard to explain. Like looking through a foggy window, then it clears up. It hasn’t been happening a lot, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, balance issues and occasional blurry vision. Thank you for mentioning those. Do you recall anything that might have triggered the blurry vision – like standing up quickly, or being in a specific environment?
PATIENT: No, not really. It just… happens. It doesn't seem to matter what I'm doing. Sometimes when I'm reading, but sometimes just… while watching television. It doesn't last long, maybe a few seconds. It's not a big problem, but I thought I should tell you. My wife says I should tell you everything.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of her – and a wise suggestion. It's always best to give me as much information as possible. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me some years ago that I have… something with the nerves. Multiple… sclerosis, that’s what he called it. It’s been quiet for a long time, though. I haven’t been to a doctor about it in… oh, maybe ten years? I mostly just try to stay active.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of multiple sclerosis, diagnosed some time ago and relatively quiet for the past ten years. Thank you. And are you currently taking any medications for anything at all, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins, Doctor. Vitamin D, because the doctor said I wasn't getting enough sun. And sometimes I take a little something for my blood pressure, but only when it gets high. My wife keeps track of it, she reminds me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Vitamin D and occasional medication for blood pressure as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks when the doctor prescribes something, just to be safe, but… no allergies. I eat most things.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with similar conditions to what you’ve described, or any other significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother, she had some trouble with her balance when she got old, but I don't know if it was the same thing. And my brother, he has diabetes. That’s about all I can think of. My father was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life.
DOCTOR: Okay, some balance issues in your mother, and diabetes in your brother. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I try to stay busy. I used to be a trainer, like I told you, and I still help out a little at the gym when I can. Mostly I walk, and I like to garden with my wife. We have a small garden, vegetables and flowers. Not as much as I used to, though, because of… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, you're generally active, enjoying walking and gardening. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never even tried it. My wife doesn't like it, and I don't want to disappoint her. She's a good woman. I drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but not much.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Okay, Mr. Asthore, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie back on the table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though your breath sounds are slightly diminished at the bases. I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse now. Your blood pressure is 148/86, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are slightly diminished in your lower extremities, but present. Next, I’m going to assess your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm squeezing as hard as I can, Doctor. It doesn't feel as strong as it used to be, though.
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is somewhat reduced bilaterally, but equal on both sides. Now, let’s check your leg strength. Can you lift your right leg up, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: There… it’s up, but it's hard. It feels heavy, like I said.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. A bit of weakness in both legs, but slightly more pronounced on the right. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Can you stand up slowly and try to balance for a few seconds without holding onto anything?
PATIENT: Woah… It's… hard to stay steady. I feel like I might fall. I'm trying, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Easy now, that’s alright. It’s good you told me. Yes, I see some instability with balance. Okay, last thing for now, I'm going to check your feet. Sensation is slightly diminished in your feet, but not severely. I’m going to take a look at your medical records now for further information and results from any prior tests. One moment.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Take your time. I just hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Asthore. Your records confirm a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis dating back approximately ten years, with a period of relative quiescence. There are some notes about occasional relapses and remissions. The last neurological evaluation was some time ago, however. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings from my examination – the diminished reflexes, decreased strength, balance issues, and reduced sensation in your feet – I believe your symptoms are likely related to a recurrence of your multiple sclerosis. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and other conditions that can mimic MS symptoms. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation, including an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to assess the current disease activity. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If you think it’s best, I trust your judgment. An MRI… that’s a bit scary, but if it helps, then yes. And blood tests are no problem. I just want to know what’s going on, so we can do something about it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests now, and I’ll have the nurse schedule you for a neurology appointment. In the meantime, it’s important to avoid activities that exacerbate your symptoms, such as overexertion or prolonged standing. Gentle exercise, like walking for short distances, is fine, but listen to your body and stop if you feel fatigued or weak. We want to avoid any falls, so I recommend using a cane or walker if needed. I'll also prescribe Vitamin D supplements, as your levels appear low. I’m also going to give you a handout with information about multiple sclerosis and resources for support. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A cane… that sounds like… getting old, Doctor. But if it’s necessary, I guess I have to. What about… will this get worse? Is there something I can do to stop it? And my wife, she worries a lot. Will she have to take care of me completely?
DOCTOR: Those are very important questions, Mr. Asthore, and it’s good you’re asking them. The course of multiple sclerosis is unpredictable. Some people experience periods of remission with minimal symptoms, while others have progressive disease. The goal of treatment is to slow the progression of the disease and manage your symptoms. There are several medications available that can help, which the neurologist will discuss with you. As for what you can do, maintaining a healthy lifestyle – a balanced diet, regular gentle exercise, and avoiding stress – can all help. Staying active and engaged socially is also important. Regarding your wife, it’s understandable that she’s worried. It’s unlikely she’ll have to take care of you completely, but she may need to provide some assistance, especially during relapses. We can discuss resources for caregiver support, such as home health aides or respite care, to help alleviate the burden. It’s important to work as a team and communicate openly about your needs and concerns. We also have a social worker who can help with these conversations and connect you with local resources. Would you like me to schedule an appointment with her?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Talking to a social worker… that sounds like a good idea. My wife would like that. And thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I feel a little better knowing what’s going on, and what we can do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Asthore. That’s my job. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule your neurology appointment. Here’s that handout on multiple sclerosis and the contact information for the social worker. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. Thank you again for your time and patience. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Asthore. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Yes, thank you very much.
