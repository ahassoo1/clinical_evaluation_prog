DOCTOR: Alright, Jailenne Aslan. 29 years old. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Overgaard. It's just... I've been getting chills. Not like, a fever chill, just… cold. And it’s been happening on and off for a couple of days now.
DOCTOR: Chills, you say. "Just cold." Right. And how long exactly has this "just cold" been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… I guess on Monday? So, like three days now. Maybe four? It's hard to say exactly, it wasn’t super noticeable at first, just a little shiver here and there. But yesterday it was more… constant, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Constant, alright. And besides the chills, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit tired. More tired than usual, anyway. I just figured it was the heat, honestly. It’s been so hot! But yeah, definitely more fatigued. No cough, no sore throat, no stuffy nose… just cold and tired.
DOCTOR: Heat fatigue is common, certainly. But we shouldn't dismiss things too quickly. Are you experiencing any muscle aches or headaches along with this fatigue?
PATIENT: No headaches, thankfully. And muscle aches… not really, no. Maybe a little bit in my back, but I always get that from sitting at my desk all day. It's nothing new. It's hard to tell if it's related or just my usual aches, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. I see you've had a fairly standard health history, nothing immediately jumping out. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve taken pretty much everything over the years – antibiotics, pain relievers… never had a reaction. I’m pretty good with meds, thankfully!
DOCTOR: “Pretty good with meds” isn’t a medical assessment, Ms. Aslan. Still, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Oh, right, sorry! No, nothing currently. Not even vitamins or anything. I try to eat healthy, so I haven't felt the need. Just… the chills, and the tiredness. It’s just weird. I don’t usually get sick like this.
DOCTOR: “Weird” is subjective. Let’s try to be a bit more precise. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… I haven’t really been that hungry lately, but I also haven’t been trying to eat a ton with the heat. Weight… I don’t know, probably lost a pound or two? I haven’t weighed myself in a while, to be honest. It's summer, you know, I'm just wearing lighter clothes.
DOCTOR: "Lighter clothes" don't negate potential weight loss, Ms. Aslan. Alright. Now, tell me about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to stay pretty healthy, really. This whole chill thing is throwing me off.
DOCTOR: And your occupation?
PATIENT: Oh, right! I'm a Health Education Specialist. It's a little ironic, isn't it? I teach people about staying healthy, and here I am, all chilled out and tired. I work at a community center, mostly doing workshops and stuff.
DOCTOR: “Ironic” doesn’t rule out illness, Ms. Aslan. Alright. Let’s move on to a physical examination. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, check your temperature, and feel your lymph nodes. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. I have a lot going on at work, and I really don’t have time to be sick.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Lungs sound clear, but I'll listen again. Heart rate is normal, rhythm is regular. Temperature is 98.8 Fahrenheit. Now, let me palpate your lymph nodes… No noticeable swelling. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions. Everything appears within normal limits, at least superficially. However, these vague symptoms are… concerning. Given your profession and recent fatigue, we need to rule out a few things. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. A lot of tests! But if it’s going to figure out what’s going on, that’s good. Will I need to come back for another appointment to get the results? And how long will it take to get them back? I have a workshop next week that I really can’t miss.
DOCTOR: "A lot of tests" is necessary due to the… imprecise nature of your description, Ms. Aslan. The results should be back within 48-72 hours. I will have my assistant contact you with the findings. And yes, you will likely need a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, prioritize rest and hydration. If you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or any new symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. Do not simply "push through" anything. I will also be sending you a referral to an infectious disease specialist, just to cover all bases. Better to be safe than sorry, especially considering your profession.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s a lot. An infectious disease specialist, too? Wow. I just… I thought it was probably just a little bug or something. But okay, I’ll prioritize rest and I’ll definitely let you know if anything changes. And I’ll wait for the assistant to call. Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. I guess I’ll see you… whenever they call.
DOCTOR: Very well. Dismissed. And Ms. Aslan?
