DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, honestly? I don’t have time for this. I've been dealing with… problems. The runs, basically. And nothing the drugstore sells is touching it. It's been going on for… well, too long. I just need something that works.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds frustrating when over-the-counter medications aren’t helping, and you’re busy. “The runs” – so, diarrhea – and it’s been going on for a while. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: “A while” is an understatement. Weeks, okay? And it's not just a little… upset. It's constant. I'm lucky if I leave the house. And I need to know what's causing it. I don't go around eating questionable things. I have standards, you know. It's just… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Weeks of constant diarrhea… that definitely warrants investigating. And it’s good you’re proactive about knowing the cause. You mentioned you don’t eat anything questionable—that's helpful to know. Let's try to narrow things down. Besides the diarrhea itself, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Like what? I’m exhausted, obviously. Running to the bathroom constantly will do that to a person. And… sometimes my stomach cramps. Bad cramps. That's about it. Honestly, I just want it to stop. I don't have time for… details. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Exhaustion and stomach cramps along with the diarrhea – yes, that’s a good start. It's helpful to know you're experiencing those, even if you don't want to focus on details. We’ll try to keep it brief, I promise. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Are you suggesting something… serious? I just have a sensitive stomach, okay? I haven’t been sick to my stomach. No fever either. It’s just… constant. I’ve already told you that. I don't understand why I have to explain everything in such detail. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and that this is embarrassing to discuss. I’m not suggesting anything specific, Ms. Woodring, just gathering information to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Ruling things out is just as important as identifying them. You said you have a sensitive stomach – have you always had digestive issues, or is this a new development?
PATIENT: New. Definitely new. I used to be able to eat anything. Now? Forget about it. Spicy food is out. Dairy is questionable. Even just… regular food sometimes feels risky. It's ridiculous. It started a few months ago, maybe after that trip to… never mind. It doesn’t matter. It just started and it won’t stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this started a few months ago, and you've noticed changes in what you can tolerate. You mentioned a trip – was there anything specific about the food or water you consumed on that trip?
PATIENT: Look, are you implying I got something… from somewhere? I take precautions. I drink bottled water, mostly. I’m careful. It was just a short trip to visit my sister in… Washington. It doesn't matter. I ate normal food. Restaurant food, mostly. And now I’m stuck dealing with this. It’s probably just stress. I have enough on my plate without this.
DOCTOR: Okay, a short trip to Washington, restaurant food, and you suspect stress might be a factor. Stress definitely can impact digestion. But we still need to investigate to make sure it's just stress. Have you had any changes in your weight recently—unintentional weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Are you asking me if I’ve gotten fat? Look, I'm a little thinner, alright? I haven’t exactly been enjoying my meals, so yeah, I've lost a few pounds. It’s not like I’m wasting away, but… it’s noticeable. Honestly, this is just… intrusive. I just want a prescription.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Ms. Woodring. It’s important to gather all the details to ensure I can provide the best care. Losing weight alongside the diarrhea is concerning. Alright, let's move on to some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No. None. I can take most things. I haven't had any… reactions. I'm perfectly healthy, other than this ridiculous… problem. Just give me something to stop it. I have things to do. Can we please just skip to the solution?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you said you’re generally healthy. I understand you want a quick solution, and I’ll do my best to get you there. Just a few more quick questions, then I’ll do a quick physical exam. What medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my blood pressure. That’s it. Amlodipine, I think. Ten milligrams. And… that's everything. I don't take a lot of pills. I try to stay away from them. Now, can we please be done?
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine 10mg for blood pressure. Thank you. Alright, before we proceed with a prescription, I'd like to listen to your abdomen and check a few other things. It's standard procedure to ensure we're addressing everything appropriately. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But I’m warning you, if this takes much longer, I'm leaving. I have a painting job I need to get back to, and I'm already behind schedule. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: I understand. This won't take long. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. I'm just going to listen to your belly sounds and gently press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. Okay, I’m listening now… Your bowel sounds are… hyperactive. A bit louder than usual. And I’m feeling some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on your left side. Not severe, but definitely present.
PATIENT: Ouch! See? I told you something was wrong! It’s always painful. It's not just in my head, you know. You think I enjoy feeling like this? Now, are you going to give me something or what? I’m not going to sit here all day.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s painful, Ms. Woodring. I'm not dismissing your discomfort at all. The tenderness confirms there’s something going on that we need to address. Given the prolonged diarrhea, weight loss, and now tenderness in your abdomen, I don’t think this is something we can just treat with an over-the-counter medication. I’d like to order some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out any infections. I also recommend a stool sample to check for parasites or bacteria. And to be thorough, I think a CT scan of your abdomen would be helpful to get a better look at what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Stool samples? A scan? Are you serious? This is ridiculous! I just have a sensitive stomach! I don’t need a full medical investigation! I just need something to stop the diarrhea, not a battery of tests! This is wasting my time and frankly, it’s insulting. I think I’ll just go. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if this feels overwhelming. However, given your symptoms and the duration, it’s important to rule out more serious causes. Ignoring it could lead to complications. I understand you want to leave. While I respect your decision, I strongly advise against it. Prolonged diarrhea and weight loss can be signs of a serious underlying condition. I'm happy to discuss your concerns further and explain the rationale behind each test. Perhaps we can start with the blood work, and then reassess if further testing is needed?
