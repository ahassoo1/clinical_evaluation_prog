DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this pain I've been having. It's been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain can be really disruptive. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. Disruptive is a good word for it. Hmm… where to start? It’s mostly in my back, lower back, you know? And it kinda shoots down my leg sometimes. Not all the time, but when it does, oof, it's not fun.
DOCTOR: Right, lower back pain that sometimes radiates down the leg. That gives me a little more to work with. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started maybe… six weeks ago? Around the middle of June, I guess. It wasn't too bad at first, just a little ache after I’d been standing for a long time. But it’s gotten worse since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been progressively worsening over the past six weeks. And you mentioned it’s worse after standing. Are there any other activities that make it worse, or anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely worse when I’m standing. Bending over is pretty bad too. Sitting is alright, mostly. And lying down… that helps a lot. Especially on my side, with a pillow between my knees. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Way. You’re doing a great job explaining it. So, sitting and lying on your side with a pillow between your knees provides relief. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling, thankfully. And no weakness that I've noticed. It just hurts. A lot sometimes. It's more of a deep ache, you know? Not like a sharp, sudden pain. Mostly just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a deep ache, no numbness or weakness. That's good to know. Have you experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, I've had a little back stiffness here and there over the years, but nothing like this. This is… different. It's more constant, and it really limits what I can do. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t been able to do much of that lately. It just hurts too much to bend over.
DOCTOR: I see. So this is a new experience for you, and it’s impacting your ability to enjoy activities you like. Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it's been under control with medication for a while now. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well, and I walk when I can, but this back pain makes that harder. I don't really see a specialist regularly. Just my regular doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension is good. And no other major medical problems. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the Lisinopril for the blood pressure, yeah. One tablet every morning. And… that's it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. I'm not much of a pill-taker, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril, one tablet daily. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always says I’m too trusting, but I’ve never had any problems. She's the one with the allergies, poor thing. Pollen, dust, cats… you name it. But me? Nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I only drink a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe a glass, two glasses, a couple of times a week. Nothing heavy. I’m pretty careful about that. My wife doesn’t drink at all, so I don’t want to make a habit of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Way, thank you for that information. It’s very helpful. Now, would you mind if I performed a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead, Doctor. I want to figure out what's causing this pain, so do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could lie down on your back for me, that would be wonderful. I’m going to start by just feeling along your spine and checking your range of motion. I’ll also do a few simple tests to see how the pain affects your legs. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay, does this feel tender at all?
PATIENT: Yeah, right there, a little bit. Not super painful, but… yeah, that's where it usually hurts. A little to the left of my spine, kinda low down. It’s a dull ache, like you said. Not a sharp pain. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to palpation, slightly to the left of the midline, lower back. That's consistent with what you’ve described. Alright, can you gently bend forward and touch your toes, if you're able?
PATIENT: Oof, I can't really get all the way. It hurts too much. I can get this far, but it’s pretty uncomfortable. There, that makes it worse for a bit. Sorry. I'm not very flexible.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion, with increased pain with forward flexion. And do you feel any pain radiating down your leg when you do that?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. A little bit. It’s not bad, but I can feel it kinda shooting down my left leg, on the back of my thigh. Not all the way to my foot, just… the thigh. It’s the same side as where it hurts on my back. Is that… a bad sign? I hope it's not something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain radiating down the left thigh with forward flexion, corresponding to the side of the back tenderness. Alright, now I'm going to lift your leg straight up, keeping it as straight as possible. Just let me know if you feel any pain. Don't worry, we'll stop immediately if it's too uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay… it’s alright so far… wait… yeah, now I feel it. Down my leg. Not a sharp pain, but… that’s the same pain. The one that shoots down my thigh. Stop, please. It’s not terrible, but… yeah, that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, positive straight leg raise on the left side, reproducing the radiating pain. Alright, that's helpful to know. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and muscle strength in your legs, just to make sure everything is functioning normally. This is just a quick assessment. Your reflexes and strength seem to be normal on both sides, which is good. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain with possible sciatic nerve irritation. The pain radiating down your leg suggests some involvement of the sciatic nerve, but the normal reflexes and strength are reassuring. It doesn't sound like anything too serious, but we'll need to rule out other causes. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay, that's… a relief. Sciatic nerve… I’ve heard of that. A lumbar strain… is that like a pulled muscle? And is it something that will get better on its own? I guess I'm just worried about it being something worse. What do you think? And what do we do now? Is there anything I can do to feel better?
DOCTOR: Yes, a lumbar strain is essentially a pulled muscle in your lower back. It's a common injury. And often, it will get better on its own with time and proper care. However, since the pain is progressively worsening and radiating down your leg, I want to rule out other possibilities, just to be safe. I'd like to order a lumbar X-ray to rule out any structural issues, like fractures or arthritis. It’s a quick and simple test. We can also discuss some treatment options to help manage your pain in the meantime. Before we talk about treatment, do you have any history of osteoporosis or have you had any recent trauma to your back, like a fall?
PATIENT: No, no history of osteoporosis. My wife has a little bit, but not me. And no recent falls or trauma to my back. I haven’t had any accidents or anything like that. It just… started gradually. Like I said, it was just a little ache at first. It didn't happen after any specific injury or anything. Is an X-ray going to be expensive? I don't have insurance, so I’m a little worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of trauma or osteoporosis is good to know. I understand your concern about the cost. Let me check the approximate cost of the X-ray for you. Okay, the X-ray will be approximately $150. We also have a payment plan option available if that’s helpful. In the meantime, to help manage your pain, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the label. You can also try applying heat or ice to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Gentle stretching and low-impact exercises, like walking, can also be helpful. Avoid any activities that aggravate your pain, like bending, lifting, or twisting. Would you like me to write down these instructions for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be great. Writing them down is a good idea. I always forget things! And $150… okay, I think I can manage that. I’ll probably take the pain relievers and try the heat and ice. Walking… I can probably do that, as long as I don't push myself too hard. What about pillows? You mentioned lying with a pillow between my knees. Is that still a good idea? And is there anything I should be really careful about? Any red flags I should look out for? I don't want this to get worse.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. Yes, continuing to sleep with a pillow between your knees is a great idea – it helps to keep your spine aligned and reduces stress on your lower back. As for red flags, please be aware of these: any new numbness or weakness in your legs or feet, loss of bowel or bladder control, fever, or severe, unrelenting pain that doesn’t improve with rest or pain relievers. If you experience any of those symptoms, please go to the emergency room immediately. Also, if your pain doesn't start to improve within two weeks despite these measures, or if it gets significantly worse, we’ll need to reconsider our approach and potentially consider further imaging, like an MRI, or a referral to a specialist. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. New numbness, weakness, bladder problems, fever… and if it gets worse or doesn't improve in two weeks. I’ll keep an eye out for those. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little bit better knowing what’s going on, and what I can do to help myself. Let's go ahead and do the X-ray then, if you think it's a good idea. Can we schedule that for tomorrow? And what do I need to bring?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Way. I'm glad I could help. And yes, I do think the X-ray is a good idea, just to rule out any other potential causes. We can definitely schedule that for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Just come to the clinic like normal. No preparation is necessary. You don't need to bring anything except your identification. The X-ray technician will be expecting you. After the X-ray, they will send the images to me, and I’ll review them and let you know the results as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. 9:00 AM tomorrow. I'll make a note of it. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time and patience. I'll see you tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Way. It was my pleasure. Get some rest tonight, and I'll see you tomorrow at 9:00 AM. Have a good evening.
