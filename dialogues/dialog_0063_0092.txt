DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me in your own words what brings you in today. I have limited time, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Concise? Hmph. Well, I'm breathin' funny. Like...like an old bellows. And my mouth feels like the Sahara desert, you know? And my eyes... they itch. Just...itch. I don't know why I'm here, exactly. Someone told me to come. Medicare, probably.
DOCTOR: "Breathing funny"... that is rather vague, Mr. Guilds. An "old bellows," you say. Is this a recent development?
PATIENT: Recent? Look, lady, I'm 83. Things are always developin'. But... I guess it's gotten worse in the last...month? Maybe two? Hard to say. I don’t keep calendars for my lungs, you know. It just… takes more effort now. Like climbin' stairs, even when I'm not on stairs. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It's...helpful, Mr. Guilds, but still not particularly precise. And this dryness in your mouth – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant! Always there. Like I been eatin' sand. And it ain't just my mouth, it's my eyes too. They feel… gritty. Like somethin's stuck in 'em. Makes drivin' difficult, and you know how important drivin' is. I gotta get to the track!
DOCTOR: The "track," you say. Very well. Let's proceed with a brief examination. Please, have a seat and open your mouth. And try not to exaggerate your symptoms; it makes it more difficult to assess the situation.
PATIENT: Assess the situation? Lady, I am the situation! Fine, fine. But don't expect miracles. Old man’s mouth. It ain't pretty.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your oral mucosa appears somewhat dry, as you stated. No obvious lesions or inflammation. Tongue is... normal in appearance. Conjunctiva is mildly irritated, some dryness noted. Palpebratal fissures are normal. Now, take a deep breath for me, if you would. And another. Breathing sounds are... diminished bilaterally, but no wheezing or crackles noted. It seems you have some degree of dryness and mild irritation. It’s likely just age-related, Mr. Guilds, but we should rule out other possibilities. Have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Hmph. I get old, that's an illness. But… lemme think. No, nothin' recent. A little sniffle last winter, maybe? But that was ages ago. Everyone gets a sniffle. And I don't go see doctors for sniffles! Waste of time. What other possibilities are we talkin' about? This better not be somethin' serious. I got important things to do.
DOCTOR: Well, dryness can be a symptom of several things, Mr. Guilds. Dehydration, certain medications… even Sjogren's syndrome, though that’s less likely given your… age. Do you take any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… I take somethin' for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And somethin' for… well, for bein' old! My daughter brings 'em, I don't bother with names. She's a nurse, you know. Thinks she knows everything. Probably just sugar pills anyway. What's Sjogren's syndrome? Sounds fancy. And unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Sjogren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that causes dryness of the eyes and mouth, among other things. It’s not generally serious, but requires management. Your daughter is correct to provide medication, regardless of your opinion on its efficacy. Now, regarding your blood pressure medication, do you know the name or dosage?
PATIENT: Dosage? Lady, I told you, I don't keep track of these things! It's a little white pill. I take one every mornin'. Maybe two if my daughter yells at me enough. Honestly, I think she just likes playin' doctor. It’s somethin' with an 'A' in it, I think... Amlodipine? Is that right? Or somethin' like that. She tells me not to miss doses, somethin' about my heart. All these new words!
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes. That is a calcium channel blocker, used to treat hypertension. It can, in rare cases, cause dry mouth as a side effect. We will proceed with a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. This will help us rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. I'll also order a Schirmer test to assess your tear production. The lab requisition will be sent to the front desk. You can schedule an appointment for the tests there. Return with the results in one week. Is that understood?
PATIENT: One week? Tests? More waitin', more pokin'...Fine, fine. One week. But if it's somethin' serious, I'm holdin' you responsible. I got a race to get to! And don't expect me to come back if it’s just tellin' me to drink more water. My daughter already does that. Now, can I go? This whole thing is takin' up my valuable time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Guilds. You may go. Please adhere to the instructions provided by the front desk regarding the lab tests. And try to rest. Though, frankly, I doubt it will make much difference. .
PATIENT: .
