DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly. It’s been a while, though. A long while. It’s just… draining, you know?
DOCTOR: Draining, alright. And when you say “tired,” can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Not like just needing a nap tired. It’s… like I don’t have energy to nap. Like even thinking is hard work. I used to… I think I used to garden, but now… just the idea of bending over is… a lot. It’s… all over, really. Not just physical.
DOCTOR: So, this isn't simply fatigue that improves with rest. It’s a pervasive lack of energy impacting both physical and cognitive function. And you said you think you used to garden… is your memory generally reliable, Ms. Licano?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not at all. It’s… patchy. I get dates mixed up, forget names… things like that. My daughter helps me with… everything, really. She says I repeat myself sometimes. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. Sorry. Um… is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's good that you're aware of these changes, Ms. Licano. And it’s not something to be embarrassed about; we need to understand what’s going on. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Now, let’s try to pinpoint this tiredness a bit more. Is it worse at a particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… you know, that’s a good question. I… I think it's pretty much all day. But maybe… maybe worse in the afternoons? After lunch, definitely. I just want to… sit. And sometimes I do, and then I can't get myself up again. It's… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally present but worsening in the afternoons, with difficulty initiating activity. Do you notice any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I… sometimes I feel a little shaky? Like… on the inside, not like a visible tremble. And… my muscles ache a bit, mostly in my legs. Oh, and I've been… a little bit down, I suppose. Not sad, exactly, just… not really up for anything.
DOCTOR: Internal shakiness, myalgias – muscle aches, primarily in the legs – and a general lack of motivation. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… no, not really. I eat… when my daughter reminds me, mostly. She worries. And weight… I don't weigh myself. Haven’t in… a long time. I think I’m… thinner, maybe? But I’m always thin. I don’t really keep track.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… well, I sleep okay, I guess. I go to bed, I fall asleep. But I don’t… feel rested when I wake up. And sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, and then I can’t get back to sleep. I just… lie there. Thinking. Or… trying to.
DOCTOR: So, non-restorative sleep with some difficulty staying asleep. Now, let's go over your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… um… well, my daughter says I have high blood pressure. She manages all the pills, you see. And… I had a heart thing a few years ago, but they fixed it. That’s all I really know. I don’t… I try not to worry about it. It’s just… a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, and a prior cardiac event. Do you recall what that involved, Ms. Licano?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. It was… a long time ago. Something with… my heart not working right. I had to stay in the hospital. They put… tubes in me, I think. And then they fixed it with… a little wire, maybe? I really don't remember much. I was very sick. My daughter… she explained it to me, but I forget.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll review those records in detail. Any surgeries other than what you've already mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was young. A very long time ago. And… I think I had something on my knee, but that was… decades ago. Honestly, Doctor, it's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay. Appendix removal and a prior knee surgery. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you have any family history of medical conditions, like heart problems, diabetes, or memory issues?
PATIENT: Oh… my mother… she had heart trouble, I think. She died when I was… young. And my brother… he had… something with his mind, later in life. He forgot things. A lot of things. It was… sad.
DOCTOR: Maternal history of heart issues and a sibling with cognitive decline. And finally, Ms. Licano, can you tell me about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Oh… I don't really… go anywhere. I used to have friends, but… they've all moved away or… well. I mostly stay at home. My daughter visits. That's… nice. I don't drink or smoke, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited social activity, no history of smoking or alcohol use. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think. My daughter gives me pills for my… bones, she says. And sometimes something for… my stomach. It burns. And… oh! A little blue pill for… sleeping. But it doesn't really help. I think that’s it. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Multiple medications, including those for blood pressure, bones, stomach issues, and sleep. Let's move on to a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. We'll start with your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration—and then do a brief neurological assessment and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just… I want to feel better. It’s been a long time, you know? A very long time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano. I'll do my best. Blood pressure is 148/92, which is a bit elevated. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration is 16 and unlabored. Reflexes are… a little diminished, particularly in your lower extremities. Strength is 5 out of 5 in all major muscle groups, but there's some mild hesitation with grip strength. Coordination is… slightly impaired. Heart sounds are… regular rate and rhythm, but there's a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Alright, Ms. Licano. I’ve completed the initial physical exam. Your vital signs are slightly elevated, and I noted some mild neurological deficits and a heart murmur. These findings, combined with your reported symptoms and medical history, warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That sounds… serious. What does that mean? Are my bones bad? Is my heart… failing? I don't want to… well, I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious right now, Ms. Licano, but it does mean we need to gather more information. The neurological findings – the diminished reflexes and coordination – could indicate a number of things, and the heart murmur requires further evaluation. As for your bones, we'll need to review your bone density scans, if you've had any recent ones. I’m going to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, a vitamin D level, and an electrocardiogram to assess your heart function. I also want to order a brain MRI to investigate the neurological findings. Depending on the results of those tests, we may also need to consult with a neurologist and a cardiologist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… so many tests. A brain test? That sounds… scary. But… if you think it's necessary. Alright. Yes, do whatever you think is best. My daughter… she’ll want to know about all this. She always knows what to do. Can I… can I schedule all this at once? I don't want to have to come back here too many times.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Licano. It does sound like a lot, but these tests will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. We’ll do our best to schedule them as efficiently as possible. Let me see… I can schedule the CBC, CMP, TSH, and Vitamin D for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. The ECG can be done immediately afterwards. The brain MRI will require a separate appointment, as it takes longer, and we'll need to coordinate that with the radiology department. I can have my assistant schedule that for you next week, early in the week. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a low dose of Vitamin D, as your levels may be low, and that can contribute to fatigue. We'll adjust the dosage based on the test results. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh… tomorrow already? That’s… quick. Vitamin D… alright. Is that safe? I don’t want to take anything that will… make things worse. I always get so worried about side effects. My daughter says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned about side effects, Ms. Licano. The dose I’m prescribing is very low and generally well-tolerated. The most common side effects are mild and can include nausea or constipation, but those are rare at this dosage. The potential benefits of addressing a possible Vitamin D deficiency far outweigh the risks. I’m also going to write a referral for a cardiology consultation. It’s always best to get a specialist’s opinion when there’s a heart murmur. They can perform a more detailed evaluation and determine if any further treatment is needed. Would you like me to have my assistant schedule that as well?
PATIENT: Oh… a heart doctor and a brain scan? This is… a lot to take in. My daughter… she's going to be so busy. Yes, please. Schedule everything you think is necessary. I just… I want to know what's going on. Is there anything I need to do? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Licano. It does seem like a lot, but we’re taking these steps to ensure we get an accurate diagnosis and develop the best possible treatment plan. For now, there’s nothing specific you need to do. Continue taking your current medications as prescribed. Try to maintain a balanced diet and stay hydrated. And, most importantly, please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Here’s a summary of the blood tests, the MRI order, and the cardiology referral. My assistant will contact you to schedule the appointments. I'll review the results as soon as they’re available and contact you to discuss the next steps. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… patient. I just hope they find out what’s wrong. And that it’s not… too serious. My daughter… she’ll be here to help. She always is.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Licano. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We'll be in touch soon.
