DOCTOR: Hi Tasmia, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don't see why I even had to come in. It’s probably just stress.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. The nurse mentioned something about a recent blood pressure reading that prompted us to have you come in. Even if it is stress, it’s good we’re checking things out. It's always best to be sure, especially with something like blood pressure. Can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Look, I work really long hours. Civil engineering, you know? It’s not like sitting at a desk all day. It’s…out there. And my husband, well, he doesn't understand the pressure. So, yeah, I'm stressed. Is that what you want to know? I don't have time for a life story.
DOCTOR: No, not a life story at all! Just trying to get a sense of what’s been happening. Civil engineering sounds demanding. And it’s helpful to know about things at home that might be contributing. When did you first notice the high blood pressure reading?
PATIENT: The nurse called yesterday, after the machine at the pharmacy did it. I go there every week for…other stuff. Never had a problem before. It was just…higher than normal, she said. Honestly, those machines are probably wrong. People touch them all the time.
DOCTOR: That's fair – those pharmacy machines aren't always the most reliable. But it's good we’re following up. Do you happen to know what the reading was?
PATIENT: I don't. She just said it was too high and I needed to come in. I really don’t keep track of numbers. I leave that to other people. What is too high, anyway? Is it like, over 100? Something like that? I always thought 120 was normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. A normal blood pressure is around 120/80, and readings consistently above 140/90 usually prompt us to take a closer look. Let's just take a quick reading here to get a baseline. Then we can talk about what it means and if we need to do any further testing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry it up, okay? I have a site inspection this afternoon. And honestly, I don’t like being stuck in doctor’s offices. They always smell like…sick people.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We'll be as quick as we can. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Relax your arm for me, and try to take a few deep breaths. Okay, the reading is 152 over 98. It is a bit elevated. Now, one reading doesn't give us the whole picture. We should repeat it a couple of times to confirm. Let’s wait a few minutes and then take another one. Do you have any pain or discomfort anywhere right now?
PATIENT: Elevated? Of course it’s elevated. I told you I was stressed! And no, I don’t have pain. Just…annoyance. Look, is this going to mean pills? Because I really don’t want to take pills. They make me tired. I need to be alert on a construction site. Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you we’re not jumping to any conclusions about medication right now. We’re just gathering information. It's good to know you haven't noticed any pain. Okay, that reading is 148 over 95. Still a bit high. Since it’s consistently elevated, even with a repeat reading, it would be helpful to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Do you have any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: My grandfather, on my mom’s side, had something with his heart. He was…old, though. Lived a long life, actually. Smoked a lot of cigarettes. And my aunt has…well, she says she has high blood pressure. But she's always complaining about something. Honestly, I don’t really pay attention. They live on the reservation. Things are different there. Is this going to take much longer? I’m really losing daylight.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Family history can be important. And it sounds like there's some history on both sides. I want to run a few basic tests, just to rule things out and get a clearer picture. We'll do a blood test to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and a basic metabolic panel. And an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Seriously? Look, I don't have time for a whole battery of tests. Can't we just…monitor it? I’ll try to relax more. And maybe cut back on coffee. Is that enough? Honestly, I'm a busy person. This is taking up my whole afternoon. I need to be back on the site by five. Is that even possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tasmia. I wish we could just monitor it, but consistently elevated blood pressure, even if related to stress, needs to be investigated to rule out any underlying causes and prevent potential long-term health issues. The tests are pretty straightforward and won’t take long. The blood tests will take a few minutes, and the EKG is quick – just some stickers on your chest. We can try to get you out of here by five, but it will be tight. It’s important to remember that high blood pressure often has no symptoms, so it's good to be proactive. Would you be willing to let me order those tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. But if I'm late to the site, it’s on your head. And I swear, if these tests show nothing, I’m not coming back. This is a complete waste of my time. Let's just get the stickers on, okay? The sooner this is done, the sooner I can leave. Do I need to change or anything? I’m wearing work boots.
DOCTOR: Okay. No, you don’t need to change. Work boots are fine. Alright. Let’s start with the EKG. I'm just going to place these stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It won't hurt, and it won't take long. Just try to lie still for a few moments while we get a reading. The nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable right now?
PATIENT: Just hurry. Seriously. This is already taking too long. And don’t stick me too many times with those needles. I hate needles. Honestly, I can feel my blood pressure going up just thinking about it. Just…get it done.
DOCTOR: I understand, and I will do my best to be as quick and gentle as possible. The nurse is very skilled and will also be careful. I'm getting a good reading now…just a few more seconds. Okay, that looks good. The nurse should be right in to draw the blood. Just try to relax. Deep breaths. We're almost there.
