DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… well, I want to know more about where my family come from. Long time ago. I hear now you can… test things? With spit? To see who you are, inside? I want to do that test. For my ancestors.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Scobie. You’re interested in learning about your ancestry through genetic testing. That’s certainly something we can discuss. It's becoming increasingly popular. To clarify, are you primarily interested in this testing for personal curiosity, or are there specific health concerns you hope to address by understanding your family history?
PATIENT: No, no health. Just… who I am. My people, long time ago. I was born here, on this island, but my grandma, she come from… other islands. Far away. I want to know which islands. That's all. Just… where I really from. Is okay to just know that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, that is perfectly okay. Understanding your heritage is a very valid reason to pursue genetic ancestry testing. It sounds like a deeply personal matter, and I respect that. Before we proceed, it’s important to understand what these tests can and cannot tell you. They can provide information about your ethnic origins – which regions your ancestors likely came from – but they won't give you a complete picture of your family history, and the results aren’t always definitive. There's a margin of error, and they primarily trace maternal and paternal lines. Are you familiar with those concepts, or would you like me to explain them in more detail?
PATIENT: I… not so much. My grandma, she tell stories. About the ocean, and the stars. But not… lines. What are lines? Is like… a family tree? I know a little bit about trees. We have mango trees at my house. But lines… is different? I’m a little confused. Maybe you can explain slow?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Scobie. I’m happy to explain it slowly. You’re right to compare it to a family tree, but it’s a bit more specific than that. Think of it this way: we all inherit traits from our parents, and they inherit them from their parents, and so on. Within our cells, there's a part called DNA that carries these traits. We can analyze certain parts of your DNA to trace your ancestry. There are two main lines we typically look at: your maternal line – that's the DNA you inherit from your mother, and her mother, and so on – and your paternal line – the DNA you inherit from your father, and his father, and so on. These lines follow a direct path back through generations. The test will analyze these lines to estimate where your ancestors originated. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Hmmm… okay. So, my mother's mother, and her mother… that's one line. And my father's mother, and her mother… that's another line. Like two roads going back? Is that right? But… what if my grandma, she have many babies? Does that change the roads? I ask so many questions, sorry. It's just… old brain, you know?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Scobie, you’re not asking too many questions at all. That’s a very good question, and it’s important to understand. You're exactly right – two roads going back. And yes, if your grandma had many babies – meaning many children – those children all share the same maternal line. The test doesn't analyze every ancestor; it focuses on the direct line – your mother’s mother, her mother, and so on, and similarly for your father’s side. So, it's less about how many siblings your ancestors had, and more about the direct path of inheritance. Essentially, it’s tracing the specific DNA passed down through each generation. It won't tell you about cousins or distant relatives, just the main ancestral lines. Now, before we talk about the testing process itself, do you have any concerns about the privacy of your genetic information?
PATIENT: Privacy? Hmmm... I don't know much about that. Is it safe? I don't want everyone to know my secrets. My grandma, she teach me to keep things close. But I want to know about my ancestors, that's why I’m here. So... is it safe? Will other people see what I find out? I trust you, Doctor, but... the world is a big place, you know? Things go around fast.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Scobie, and I’m glad you brought it up. Privacy is extremely important. The companies that perform these tests have strict policies in place to protect your genetic information. Your results are typically anonymized and coded, and they require your explicit consent to share any information. They will not share your results with anyone without your permission. However, there are always potential risks with any data storage, and it's good to be aware of those. I can provide you with information about the specific company we use, including their privacy policy and security measures. We only work with reputable companies that adhere to strict ethical guidelines. Also, it's important to remember that these tests only provide an estimate of your ancestry. They are not definitive proof, and there's always a margin of error. Would you like me to go over the potential risks and benefits of the test in more detail before we proceed?
PATIENT: Hmmm… okay. Strict rules… that's good. I like rules. And you only work with good companies… that's important too. I think… I understand a little bit. But… what kind of information they can find out? What if they find out something… I don’t want to know? Something bad about my family? My grandma, she never talk about bad things. She only talk about stars and ocean. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful question, Mr. Scobie. You’re right to consider that possibility. These tests primarily focus on your ethnic origins, as we’ve discussed. However, they can also reveal information about your genetic predisposition to certain health conditions, although that's not the primary purpose of the ancestry tests we offer. The companies are required to provide you with a disclaimer about this possibility, and you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of receiving that information. We would never share that information with you without your explicit consent. If you choose to opt-in, you would receive a report detailing any potential health risks based on your genetic makeup. If you choose to opt-out, you would only receive information about your ethnic origins. Would you like me to explain the different opt-in/opt-out options in more detail?
PATIENT: No, no health information. I don't want to know. Stars and ocean is enough. I want to know where my grandma come from, that's all. No secrets about bad things. Just… where she walked. Where her mothers walked. So… we don’t do the health part? Is that right? Just… the islands? And the company, they keep it private? You promise? My grandma, she trust me to keep things safe. And I want to keep her stories safe too.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Scobie. We will only be doing the ancestry portion of the test – focusing on your ethnic origins and tracing your maternal and paternal lines. No health information will be requested or provided. And yes, I promise. The company we use has strict privacy policies in place, and your results will be kept confidential. Your genetic information will not be shared with anyone without your explicit consent. We will fill out a consent form together that outlines all of the privacy policies and your rights. I understand how important it is to you to protect your family’s stories, and I will do everything I can to ensure your privacy. Are you ready to proceed with the test?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. Let’s do it. I want to know where my grandma walked. And I want to tell her stories, knowing where she come from. Maybe… maybe I can even find some other family. So… what do we do now? Do we… spit in a cup? Is it a big cup? I don’t like big cups.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, you spit in a cup. And no, it's not a big cup! It's a small tube, quite manageable. The kit comes with very clear instructions, and we’ll go through them together. It’s a simple process, and the kit provides everything you need. First, I'll have you fill out a brief form with some basic demographic information and consent for the test. Then, I’ll give you the kit, explain the collection process, and answer any questions you may have. It’s important to avoid eating or drinking anything for about 30 minutes before collecting the sample, to ensure the best results. Once you’ve collected the sample, you’ll seal it in the prepaid envelope and mail it to the lab. It usually takes about 4-6 weeks to receive the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. No food for 30 minutes… I can do that. I like mangoes, but I can wait. Four to six weeks… that’s a long time! But… I can wait. I waited a long time to find out about this. So… what kind of information will the results show? Will it have maps? I like maps. My grandma, she used to draw maps in the sand, showing the stars and the islands. Will it be like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, the results will have maps! They typically provide a breakdown of your ethnic origins, showing the regions your ancestors likely came from. It's often presented as percentages – for example, 60% from Island A, 30% from Island B, and so on. The report also includes information about your maternal and paternal lines, tracing your ancestors back through generations. It may include information about historical migration patterns and cultural groups associated with your ethnic origins. They do a very good job of making the information easy to understand, and they provide resources for further research. It won't be exactly like your grandma's maps in the sand, but it will give you a visual representation of your ancestral journey. Let's start with the consent form, and then I’ll explain the collection process in more detail. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. Let's do the form. I want to know where my grandma walked. And I want to see the maps. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It’s my pleasure. Here's the consent form. It’s a bit lengthy, but it's important to read it carefully. Just let me know if you have any questions as you go through it. We’ll take our time. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: “Informed Consent… Genetic Testing…” Hmm… This is a lot of words. What does “specimen” mean? Is that the spit?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, “specimen” is just a fancy word for the sample we collect – the spit, in this case. It's a standard term used in medical testing. Don't worry about all the technical jargon. We can go through each section together, if you'd like. We're just making sure you understand what the test involves and what your rights are. Would you like me to read the first paragraph aloud for you, and we can take it from there?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. My grandma, she always read to me. I like when people read to me. Slow is good.
DOCTOR: “Informed Consent for Genetic Testing: This document outlines the purpose, benefits, risks, and limitations of genetic testing. By signing this form, you acknowledge that you have been fully informed about the testing process and voluntarily agree to participate. You understand that the results of this test may reveal information about your ethnic origins and potential genetic predispositions.” Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Hmmm… “potential genetic predispositions”… is that the bad things? The things we don’t want to know? But you said we don’t have to know those things. Is that right? Is it okay to just skip that part? I don’t want to worry about bad things. Just the islands. Just where my grandma walked.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, you are exactly right. “Potential genetic predispositions” refers to the possibility of learning about your risk for certain health conditions. And yes, it is absolutely okay to skip that part! You have complete control over what information you receive. The form will have a section where you can specifically opt-in or opt-out of receiving that health information. If you choose to opt-out, you will only receive the results about your ethnic origins – just where your grandma walked, as you say. We won't share that health information with you without your explicit consent. So, you don't need to worry about receiving information you don't want. Does that make you feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes me feel much better. Just the islands. That's all I want. My grandma, she would be happy to know I'm finding out about the islands. Okay… what do I have to do on the form? Do I just… check some boxes? Or do I have to write things? My hands get tired sometimes.
DOCTOR: You mostly just need to check some boxes, Mr. Scobie. There are a few places where you'll need to write your name and today's date, but it's all very straightforward. I can help you fill it out, if you’d like. We can take it one section at a time. First, let's just confirm your name and date of birth. And then we’ll move on to the section about your consent for the test. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Laury Scobie… August 12th, 1938. Is that right? My grandma always said I was born on a very lucky day.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, that looks perfect! August 12th, 1938. And your grandma was right – that is a very lucky day. Now, let's move on to the next section, which is about your consent for the genetic testing. It asks if you understand the purpose of the test, the potential risks and benefits, and your right to privacy. It’s mostly just a series of “yes” or “no” boxes to check. Would you like me to read each statement aloud for you as you go through it?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Reading is good. Slow is good. My eyes get tired sometimes. And… what if I don’t understand a question? Is it okay to ask? I don’t want to check the wrong box.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Scobie. It’s perfectly okay to ask! That’s what I’m here for. We can go through each question together, and I’ll explain anything you don’t understand. Don’t worry about checking the wrong box – we’ll take our time and make sure you’re comfortable with each answer. Let’s start with the first statement: “I understand that this genetic test is designed to provide information about my ethnic origins.” Do you understand what that means?
PATIENT: Hmm… ethnic origins… is that where my grandma came from? The islands? Is that what it means? Is it like… a family tree, but for islands? Is that right? If so… yes. I think I understand. Yes. So I check the “yes” box?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, you are exactly right! “Ethnic origins” refers to where your ancestors came from – the islands, in your case. It’s like a family tree, but for islands. And yes, you should check the "yes" box. Okay, let's move on to the next statement: "I understand that the results of this test may reveal information about potential genetic predispositions to certain health conditions." Do you remember what that means?
PATIENT: No. I don’t remember. You said something about bad things? Things I don’t want to know? Is that what it means? I think… I think I want to skip this one. Is that okay? I don't want to check any boxes on this one. Just leave it blank?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, that is perfectly okay. You are absolutely right to skip it. You do not need to check any boxes on that one. This section is where you would specifically opt-in or opt-out of receiving that health information. Since you’d prefer not to receive it, we can just leave this section completely blank. It won’t affect your results in any way. Would you like me to show you where to sign and date the form?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Where to sign and date… that's the last part, right? Then it's all finished? I’m getting a little tired. But… excited too. I can't wait to see where my grandma walked.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, that's the last part! Just sign your name and write today's date right here. Take your time. And yes, I understand – you must be very excited! It’s wonderful to finally be learning about your heritage. Once you’ve signed the form, it will be all finished.
PATIENT: Here you go. Is that okay? Is it all finished now? I feel… relieved. And… excited! Where my grandma walked… I can’t wait.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, that is perfect! Everything is all finished now. You’ve done a wonderful job. Now, I’ll give you instructions on how to collect the sample. It's very simple, and I’ll be right here if you have any questions. The kit comes with a small tube, and you just need to spit in it a few times. Here you go. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: Hmm… spit in a tube… a few times? Is it a big tube? I don’t want to have to spit too much. My grandma, she always said not to waste anything. What if I can’t spit enough? What if it's not enough spit? Will it still work?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Scobie, it’s not a big tube! You don’t need to spit a lot. Just a few teaspoons is enough. The kit comes with a line to show you how much you need. And yes, it will still work! As long as you reach the line, the lab will be able to analyze the sample. They’re very good at extracting the DNA, even from a small amount of spit. Don’t worry about it. It's a simple process, and I’m confident you’ll be able to collect enough sample. Do you want me to show you exactly how to do it?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Show me. I’m a little nervous. I haven’t spit in a tube before. My grandma, she always said spitting was rude. But… this is important. This is about where I come from. Where my grandma walked. So… show me how to do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Scobie. First, you’ll open the tube and remove the cap. Then, you just need to spit into the tube until the liquid reaches this line. It doesn’t need to be all at once – you can take your time and spit in it a few times. Once the liquid reaches the line, you’ll screw the cap back on tightly to prevent any spills. Then, you’ll place the tube in the prepaid envelope and mail it to the lab. It’s very simple, and the instructions in the kit explain everything in detail. Do you feel comfortable trying it now?
PATIENT: Okay… I think so. It's a little scary, but… I have to do it. This is about my grandma. It's a little… wet. And… cold. But… I'm getting there. Almost… almost… There! Is that enough? I think that's enough. It's a little messy, but… it's done.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, that is perfect! You did a wonderful job. That’s more than enough sample. Now, all you need to do is place this bag in the prepaid envelope and mail it to the lab. It usually takes about 4-6 weeks to receive the results. Here’s a brochure with information about the lab and how to track the progress of your sample. You’ll receive an email notification when the results are ready. I’m very excited for you, Mr. Scobie. I hope you learn a lot about your heritage. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You were very kind. And patient. I was a little nervous. But… I feel good now. I feel like I'm one step closer to my grandma. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the lab if you have any questions. And… enjoy learning about your heritage! I hope you find everything you’re looking for. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Scobie. And thank you again for coming in.
