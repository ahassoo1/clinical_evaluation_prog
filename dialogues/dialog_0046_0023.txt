DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well… my chest hurts. Not all the time, but… sometimes. It's like a… ache, I guess. It’s a little strange, because… I’m a man. I don’t think men are supposed to have chest pain like this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bulaong. Chest pain can be concerning, regardless of gender. It’s good you're getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about this ache?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it's not a sharp pain, like if I got hit or something. More… dull. And it's not always in the same place. Sometimes it's more on the left side, sometimes on the right. It doesn't hurt to touch it, not really. It just… feels uncomfortable. It's been happening for maybe… a month now? I don’t really keep track of dates very well.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Bulaong. So, it's a dull ache, variable in location – sometimes left, sometimes right – and not consistently related to touch. It’s been occurring for about a month. Does anything trigger the pain – does it happen when you’re exerting yourself, or after eating, or at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? I don’t think so. I do a lot of work on roofs, so I’m always moving. It doesn't seem to get worse when I’m working hard. I don’t think what I eat makes it worse either. Maybe… maybe a little more when I lie down? Not always, but sometimes when I’m trying to sleep, I notice it more.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be directly related to exertion or food intake. It may be slightly worse when you’re lying down. And you mentioned you work on roofs – that’s quite physical. Do you ever experience any shortness of breath, palpitations – that's a feeling of your heart racing or fluttering – or dizziness along with this chest discomfort?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not really. I get tired, of course, from the work. But not like… can’t breathe tired. Palpitations… what does that mean? Like my heart… beating fast? No, I don’t think so. My heart feels normal. And no dizziness. I stand on roofs all day, so if I was dizzy, I'd know!
DOCTOR: Good, that’s helpful to know. Palpitations just means feeling your heart beat faster or irregularly. Okay, so no shortness of breath, no palpitations, and no dizziness. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms at all—perhaps sweating, nausea, or pain in your arms, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: No sweating, no feeling sick to my stomach. And no pain anywhere else. Just the chest. I thought maybe I pulled a muscle, but it doesn't feel like a muscle pain. It’s… different. My wife told me to come see a doctor, because she said it wasn’t normal for men to have chest pain, even if it doesn't feel like a heart thing.
DOCTOR: Your wife is very wise to encourage you to come in, Mr. Bulaong. Chest pain is always something we want to investigate thoroughly, regardless of gender. To get a better understanding, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I don't really go to the doctor much. I’m usually okay. I’ve had the flu a few times, and I broke my arm when I was a kid. But no… no special things the doctor told me I have. I don't take any pills, either. And I don't have insurance, so I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Bulaong. It’s good to know you haven't been diagnosed with any chronic conditions and aren’t currently taking any medications. And I understand the concern about insurance. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. And no, I haven't been to the hospital. Like I said, I mostly just stay healthy. I eat okay, I try to get enough sleep when I can, and I work hard. My wife worries a lot, but I'm usually fine. She makes me take vitamins, though.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, and it sounds like you have a very caring wife. Now, briefly, could you tell me if anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any heart problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… my dad, he had… something with his heart, I think. He got really sick when I was young, and he had to go to the hospital. He didn’t live very long after that. My mom, she had high blood pressure, I think. She took pills for it. And my brother, he’s a little heavy, and he worries about his cholesterol, but he hasn’t been told he has anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bulaong. That’s helpful information. To complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work on roofs, like I said. I go home, I eat dinner with my wife, I watch TV. Sometimes I help her with the garden. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much. Just a beer sometimes with dinner. Nothing crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you don't smoke, you drink alcohol only occasionally, and you have a relatively active job. Now, one final question: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. My wife tries to give me all kinds of things, but I don't react to anything. She's always worried I'm not getting enough vitamins, so she makes me take a bunch of pills, but they don't bother me. I think she just likes taking care of me.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re very well cared for. Alright, Mr. Bulaong, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be causing your chest pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit up on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, and I’ll also feel your chest to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable. I’m listening to your heart now. Take some deep breaths for me… Everything sounds normal so far. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your chest. I’m feeling around your chest now. Do you feel any pain in any specific areas when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. It doesn't really hurt when you touch it. It just feels… uncomfortable, like a dull ache. But not when you push on it. It's more like… inside. Hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand, it’s hard to pinpoint. That’s helpful to know. Now, let me check your pulse and blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. Both are within normal limits. I’m also going to check your reflexes. Everything seems normal so far, Mr. Bulaong. Given your symptoms and the results of the physical exam, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of your chest pain without further investigation. Because you mentioned a family history of heart problems, and even though your blood pressure and pulse are normal, I would like to order an EKG – that’s an electrocardiogram – to check the electrical activity of your heart. I would also recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any problems with your lungs or surrounding structures. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An EKG and an X-ray… okay. If you think it’s best, Doctor, then yes. I just want to know what's going on, so… whatever you think will help. But… how much will that cost? I don't have insurance, remember?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Bulaong. That’s a very valid question. Let me check with the billing department to get an estimate for you. Okay, it looks like an EKG will cost approximately $150, and a chest X-ray will be around $200. We do have a payment plan available, and we can also discuss options for lower-cost facilities if needed. Now, regarding those tests, an EKG is a quick, painless procedure where we place electrodes on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. The chest X-ray is also non-invasive and will help us visualize your lungs and heart. Do you have any questions about either of those tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: $350… okay. That’s… a lot. But I guess if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then it's worth it. No, I don’t think I have any questions about the tests. Just… how long will it take? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: The tests shouldn't take long at all. The EKG will only take about 5-10 minutes, and the chest X-ray will be similar. Neither procedure should cause any pain. The technician will explain everything to you before starting, and you can ask any questions you have at that time. We can schedule those tests for you today, or we can try to find a lower-cost facility if you’d prefer. There are some community clinics that offer reduced rates for patients without insurance. Would you like me to look into those options for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be great. If you can find a cheaper place, that would really help. I don’t want to get too far in debt trying to figure this out. My wife would kill me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bulaong. Let me see what I can find. Okay, there’s a community clinic about 20 minutes from here that offers an EKG for $80 and a chest X-ray for $120. That would bring the total cost down to $200. They do require appointments, and there may be a waiting list, but it’s a significant savings. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you there?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds much better. $200 is… doable. My wife will be happy. Can you schedule me an appointment for… soon as possible? I’m working on roofs, so I can usually get time off if I need to.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me see… They have an opening next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10:00 AM… yes, that should be okay. I’ll have to ask my boss, but I think I can make that work. Okay, Tuesday at 10:00 AM it is. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been a big help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. Here's a confirmation slip with all the details. They will call to confirm the appointment closer to the date. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Once you have the results from the EKG and chest X-ray, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you finding a cheaper place, and for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll let you know when I have the results. Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your appointment. And remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you next week. Have a good day, Mr. Bulaong.
