DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you. Honcoop is fine, Doctor. No need for formalities. I got a… a thing I wanna get done. A clearance, you said? Look, I ain’t got all day. Just tell me what paperwork needs fillin’ and let’s get this over with. It’s a… a little somethin’ for my appearance. That's all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. A physical clearance, understood. To ensure I can complete the necessary paperwork accurately, I’ll need to gather some information from you. It will involve a review of your medical history and a brief physical examination. To begin, could you tell me a little bit more about this “appearance”?
PATIENT: Appearance… look, it’s… personal. Not somethin’ I’m keen on discussin’ with strangers. Just need a doctor to say I'm fit enough. That’s it. I ain't lookin' for a life story session. Now, what questions you gotta ask? Let's hurry it up.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for privacy, Mr. Honcoop. However, to provide appropriate medical clearance, I do need some basic information to ensure your safety. It’s a matter of professional responsibility, and I assure you, everything discussed is confidential. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood… somethin’? Diabetes? Look, I ain’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Probably since… well, it don’t matter. I feel fine. Always have. I work with towers, you know. Climb 'em. Heavy work. You think a man can climb towers if he’s sick? No. Now, are we gettin’ anywhere, or are you just gonna keep askin’ pointless questions?
DOCTOR: I understand you feel well, Mr. Honcoop, and that’s excellent. However, even individuals who feel healthy can have underlying conditions. Since you haven’t seen a doctor in some time, it's important to gather a more complete picture. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Now, let me think. There was… somethin’ when I was young. A fall, maybe? I was workin’ up north, I think. A long time ago. Broke somethin’, I reckon. An arm, or a leg. It healed, though. Perfectly fine now. Don't ask me for details. My memory ain't what it used to be. Everything’s just… a blur. Now, can we please get on with it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. We can certainly proceed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had ‘em. I eat anything. Dust, dirt, whatever. Builds character. Seriously, I ain’t delicate. Now, is this clearance gonna happen today, or am I wastin’ my time? I got things to do. Important things.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Honcoop. Just a few more questions, and then we can proceed with the physical examination. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… supplements… Look, I might take somethin’ for my joints now and then. An old workin’ man gets aches, you know? But I ain’t got a regular prescription, or nothin’. Just whatever I can pick up at the… the store. Can’t even recall the name of it right now. It's a little blue pill, I think? Or maybe white?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Thank you for sharing that. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Now there's a long story. Look, my folks are… were… gone a long time. Didn’t see much of ‘em. And I don’t keep up with relatives. Too much drama. Honestly, Doctor, I got no idea if anyone in my family had heart trouble, or… or whatever else you're lookin’ for. It’s irrelevant. I'm the one climbin' towers, remember? I’m built different. Now, can we get this over with?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Honcoop. We can move on. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What kind of question is that? I work. I climb towers. I eat when I’m hungry. I sleep when I’m tired. That is my lifestyle. It’s simple. Look, I don’t sit around drinkin’ or smokin’, if that’s what you’re askin’. I'm a practical man. Now, are we gettin’ any closer to this clearance, or am I bein’ interrogated?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I assure you, I’m not trying to interrogate you. These questions simply help me ensure your safety. Now, one final question before we move on to the physical exam. How would you describe your overall energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Look, I get up every mornin' and climb a tower. You think a man can do that if he's tired? I'm fine. Perfectly fine. Now, let's get this over with. I got things to do. And frankly, Doctor, I'm startin' to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Honcoop. Let’s proceed with the physical examination then. I’ll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. If you don’t mind, please have a seat on the examination table. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Finally. About time. Just get it over with. Don't go pokin' around too much, though. I ain't got time for a full-blown examination. Just tell me if I’m clear, and let me be on my way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated at 162 over 98. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. I’m hearing slightly diminished breath sounds on both sides. Do you experience any shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Wheezing? Look, I climb towers, remember? It's a little hard to breathe up there sometimes. That don't mean nothin'. Always been a little… tight in the chest when I’m pushin' myself. It's from the work. Perfectly normal. Are you gonna tell me I'm sick now? This is ridiculous. Just tell me if I’m clear, or not. I don’t need a diagnosis. I need a clearance.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand your concerns. Given your elevated blood pressure and slightly diminished breath sounds, I’m not comfortable providing a clearance at this time. It's my professional responsibility to ensure your safety, and these findings require further investigation. I recommend a more comprehensive evaluation, including an EKG to assess your heart function, and a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. Would you be open to scheduling those tests?
PATIENT: What?! You're tellin' me I gotta come back? After all this? Absolutely not! I ain't got time for tests. I got work to do! Look, Doctor, I've been climbin' towers for decades. I'm perfectly healthy. This is a waste of my time. I’m not payin’ for tests. Just sign the paper, and let me go. This is… preposterous!
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I cannot in good conscience provide medical clearance without addressing these concerning findings. Providing clearance when I have reason to believe you may have an underlying medical condition would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. Given your refusal of further evaluation, I am unfortunately unable to provide the clearance you are requesting. I would be happy to provide you with referrals to specialists who can further assess your concerns. I strongly urge you to reconsider getting these tests done for your own well-being. Are you at least willing to take this list of referrals?
PATIENT: Fine! Whatever. Just… just forget it. I’ll find someone else who’ll sign the paper. I don’t need your opinion. I’m perfectly capable of climbin’ towers, with or without your clearance. Preposterous… Waste of time… .
