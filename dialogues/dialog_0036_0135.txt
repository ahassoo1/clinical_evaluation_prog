DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's August 2nd, and I see you're 60 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bacy. Thank you for seeing me. I am here because of… a problem with my ear. It is… leaking something. A discharge, yes? It started maybe one week ago. Not very painful, just… wet.
DOCTOR: Okay, a discharge from your ear for about a week, not particularly painful, just a wet sensation. Can you tell me a little more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit… yellow. Not a lot, but enough I notice it on my pillow. And when I clean my ear… it is there. I have not… fever, or… dizziness. Just the wetness and… a little bit of… stuff in my ear.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear discharge, sometimes a little yellow, noticing it on your pillow and when cleaning your ear. No fever or dizziness, which is good. You mentioned “stuff” in your ear – could you describe that?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… hard to explain. Like… small pieces. Not big. Maybe… like sand? Very tiny sand. And… a little bit of smell. Not bad smell, but… something there. I try to not put anything in my ear to clean it, just… wipe the outside.
DOCTOR: Okay, small pieces, like tiny sand, and a slight odor. And you've been good about not inserting anything into the ear canal, just wiping the outside. That's helpful to know. Do you have any pain with wiping, or any itching, fullness, or ringing in your ear?
PATIENT: No pain when I wipe. Sometimes… a little bit of itch, yes. But not all the time. Fullness… no, I don’t think so. Ringing… sometimes, yes. Very quiet ringing. I hear it mostly when it is… very quiet in the room. Not loud, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent itching, and quiet ringing that's more noticeable in quiet environments. Have you had any ear problems before – infections, injury, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was… younger, maybe 20 years ago, I had very bad ear pain. The doctor… he put something in my ear, and it hurt very much. He said it was… infection. But I have not had problems since. No injury, no. Just that one time, long ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of an ear infection about 20 years ago that required treatment, and nothing since. Do you have any trouble hearing?
PATIENT: No, I hear… okay. Maybe a little bit harder to hear when people speak quiet, yes. But not very bad. I ask people to repeat sometimes, but… I think it is just because of my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, some difficulty hearing quiet sounds, which you attribute to age, which is understandable. Let's take a look at your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope to examine your ear canal and eardrum. I see some cerumen – that's earwax – and some debris within the ear canal. The eardrum appears slightly inflamed and there is a small amount of discharge present. I don't see any signs of a perforation, but it's difficult to get a perfect view with the debris present.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Inflamed… that is not good, yes? What does the debris… mean? Is it… dangerous? I am not wanting a big problem.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions, Mr. Radillo. Inflammation means there's some irritation or infection present. The debris is likely a combination of earwax and dried discharge. It's not necessarily dangerous right now, but it’s preventing us from clearly seeing your eardrum and could be contributing to the irritation. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, it sounds like you likely have an outer ear infection, possibly with a bit of wax buildup. However, to be certain, I'd like to collect a sample of the discharge to send to the lab for analysis. This will help us rule out other possibilities and ensure we get the right treatment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… alright. If it helps to know exactly what is happening, then yes. A sample… you will take something from my ear? Will it hurt? I do not want a lot of pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll take a small sample of the discharge using a sterile swab. It shouldn't hurt much, Mr. Radillo. You might feel a slight pressure or a quick tickle, but it's generally very well-tolerated. We'll send it to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. Alright, that's done. While we wait for the lab results, I recommend keeping your ear dry. Avoid swimming, showers, and using cotton swabs in your ear. We can also use some ear drops to help soothe the inflammation and loosen up any wax. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, keeping it dry… I can do that. No swimming, yes. And drops… that sounds good. Soothing… is good. What kind of drops? Will they… make me dizzy?
DOCTOR: Good. The drops I'm thinking of are called ototolyl, they are typically used for outer ear infections and to help dry out the ear canal. They contain a small amount of alcohol and glycerin, so rarely, some people might experience a brief sensation of dizziness. However, it's uncommon, and it usually passes quickly. I’ll write you a prescription for them. I'm also going to prescribe a short course of oral antibiotics as a precaution, given the inflammation and the possibility of a bacterial infection. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I do not take any… regular medicines. Just sometimes… when my back hurts, I take something for the pain. But no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies and no regular medications, just something for back pain when needed. Perfect. I'm writing you a prescription for Amoxicillin 500mg three times a day for seven days, and the ototolyl ear drops. You can pick them up at your usual pharmacy. I want to see you back in one week to check on your progress and review the lab results. If your symptoms worsen before then—increased pain, fever, or hearing loss—please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: One week… yes, I can remember that. Amoxicillin… is that… hard on the stomach? I sometimes have… problems with my stomach. And what if the drops… do not help? Is there something else?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. Amoxicillin can sometimes cause stomach upset, but usually mild. Taking it with food can help minimize that. If you experience significant nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, please stop taking it and contact us. We can discuss alternatives if needed. And if the drops don’t help, we'll need to investigate further. It's possible there’s a more significant infection or another underlying cause. In that case, we might refer you to an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist for a more detailed evaluation. But let’s start with these medications and see how you respond. I'll also print out a sheet with instructions on how to use the ear drops and information about the Amoxicillin. Do you have any work or school restrictions we need to document?
PATIENT: No restrictions, Doctor. I am retired. I used to be a teacher, but… many years ago. Just need to remember to keep my ear dry and take the medicine. Thank you for… explaining everything. You are very… thorough.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could explain things clearly. It’s important to understand what's going on and how to manage it. Here are those instructions. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. We want to make sure you’re feeling better as quickly as possible. Have a good day, and we'll see you back in one week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Bacy. You too. Goodbye.
