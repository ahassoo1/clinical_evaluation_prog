DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… my legs, mostly. They’ve been getting weaker, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. It makes walking… difficult. It’s been going on for a while now, I think. Hard to say exactly how long.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness in your legs… and you say it’s been gradual?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, gradual. Like the tide coming in, slow and steady. Not a sudden thing. It's more… tiring to walk now than it used to be. Even just around the house. And sometimes… sometimes my feet feel a little numb. Not always, but sometimes. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a tricky word, Mr. Astore. Numbness with weakness… that’s something we need to explore. When you say tiring, can you describe that?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a muscle ache, Doctor. It's more… like my legs just give out after a little while. Like they don't have the strength to keep going. And it’s not just walking. Standing for too long is hard too. I used to be able to stand all day at the market, helping my wife. Now, I need to sit down pretty quickly. It worries me, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Astore. It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. So, it's fatigue with standing and walking, and this has impacted your ability to do things you used to manage easily. Have you noticed any pain accompanying this weakness or numbness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really pain. Maybe a little… stiffness sometimes, in the mornings. But not sharp pain, no. Mostly just… heavy. Like carrying weights on my legs. And the numbness… it’s more like pins and needles, sometimes. Not all the time, but when it happens, that’s what it feels like. It usually goes away after a little bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. No sharp pain, some morning stiffness, and intermittent pins and needles sensation… that’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: Hmm… balance… That’s a good question, Doctor. I think… maybe a little. I haven’t fallen, thankfully. But I do feel… unsteady sometimes. Like I need to hold onto something. Especially when I turn quickly. Or if the floor is a little slippery. It’s not a big problem yet, but I’ve noticed it. My wife has been noticing it too, she tells me to be careful.
DOCTOR: Good, that you and your wife are aware of this. Alright, we're getting a clearer picture. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… I have what the other doctors call… Multiple Sclerosis. They told me years ago. I mostly just try to keep active, you know? But lately… well, that’s why I’m here. It feels like… it’s getting worse. I take some medicine for it, but I don’t always remember the name. Something… starts with a ‘D’? I'm sorry, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Multiple Sclerosis… alright. And you mentioned medication starting with a ‘D’… We'll look that up in your records. Do you know when you were first diagnosed with MS?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time ago, Doctor. Maybe… twenty years ago? Or more? It was after my wife and I moved here. I remember being very tired all the time, and blurry vision. They did some tests, and that's what they told me. It feels like a lifetime ago, honestly. I’ve been seeing doctors regularly since then, but… things have been changing lately. That’s why I wanted to come see you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. Your records indicate a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis in 2003, and you're currently prescribed Dalfampridine, which is used to improve walking. You’ve also had some routine checkups with Dr. Lei over the years. Now, have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations since your MS diagnosis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Just… regular checkups with Dr. Lei. He mostly just monitored things, made sure I was taking my medicine. He moved away last year, that’s why I needed to find a new doctor. I've been very lucky, I think. Mostly just been trying to manage things on my own. Until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with MS or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a hard one, Doctor. My family is… far away, mostly back in Samoa. I haven’t seen them in many years. I don’t think so, but I don’t really know. We didn’t talk much about illnesses. My mother… she had some trouble with her hands when she got older. But I don’t know if that was anything like this. It was just… old age, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known family history of MS or neurological conditions. Now, let's talk about your daily life. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no smoking. Never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. My wife likes it, and I don’t mind a glass with her. But not every day, no. I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the Dalfampridine?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a good question, Doctor. Let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And… sometimes I take something for my knees, when they bother me. It’s an over-the-counter thing, not a prescription. It’s hard to keep track, you know? My wife mostly handles the pills. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so Dalfampridine, a blood pressure medication, and occasional over-the-counter medication for your knees. We'll verify all of that with the pharmacy records. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. My wife will tell me if I'm allergic to something, I'm sure. She's very careful. I've been very lucky to have her.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, Mr. Astore, I’m going to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll take a look at your reflexes, coordination, and strength in your legs. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not terribly concerning at the moment. Reflexes are present, but a little weaker than expected, particularly at the ankles. A little bit of tremor when testing coordination, nothing too significant. Strength is 4 out of 5 in both legs, but you do seem to fatigue quickly. Sensation to light touch is intact, but you report a mild decrease in sensation to vibration. Your gait is slightly unsteady, with a wider base and a bit of shuffling. Alright, Mr. Astore. The exam shows some weakness in your legs, slightly diminished reflexes, mild decreased sensation, and an unsteady gait. This, combined with your symptoms, does suggest an exacerbation of your Multiple Sclerosis. We'll need to confirm this with some imaging, specifically an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best. An MRI… that's the picture machine, right? I’ve had one before, I think. I trust your judgment. If this is a… a worsening of the MS, I want to know. I just want to understand what's happening, and what we can do about it. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Doctor. It’s… reassuring.
DOCTOR: Yes, an MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain and spinal cord. We'll be able to see if there are any new or worsening lesions associated with your MS. I agree, it’s important to understand what’s happening, and we’ll work together to manage this. Based on your symptoms and the exam, I am concerned about a possible MS exacerbation. We need to rule out other causes as well, but the MRI will be crucial. I'm going to order the MRI, and I’ll also order some blood work to check for any other contributing factors. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your medications as prescribed, and avoiding any strenuous activity that worsens your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor… I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Blood work and the picture machine… I understand. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… will this mean I need to change my medicine? I just want to know what to expect, you see.
DOCTOR: The MRI results usually take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. As for your medication, it's too early to say whether or not you'll need a change. It depends on what the MRI shows. If there are new lesions, we may consider increasing your current dosage or adding a different medication to help control the inflammation. But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. In the meantime, it’s important to monitor your symptoms. If you notice any new or worsening problems – such as difficulty with vision, bladder control, or balance – please call me immediately. Do you have any other questions, or concerns, that I can address right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor… I think that covers everything. You’ve been very patient with me. Thank you. I appreciate your help. I’ll wait for the call about the picture machine. And I'll let you know if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astore. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Here is a summary of our plan: 1. MRI of brain and spinal cord - will schedule this for you today. 2. Blood work - orders placed. 3. Monitor symptoms - contact office if new or worsening issues arise. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, Mr. Astore.
