DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking about… well, stress, mostly. And I’ve heard good things about mindfulness and meditation helping with that. I was hoping to talk about whether it might be a good fit for me. I’m Liza, by the way, if that wasn’t clear.
DOCTOR: Yes, Liza, thank you. It's good to meet you as well. Stress is certainly something many people deal with. And mindfulness can be helpful. Before we focus specifically on that, though, I like to get a good overall picture of what's going on. Just to be thorough. Could you tell me a little more about what this stress feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s fair. Overall picture… okay. Well, it’s not like a constant, overwhelming thing, if that makes sense. It comes and goes. Mostly with work, I think. It’s a pretty demanding job – signal and track switches, you know? Lots of responsibility. It’s more… a tightening in my chest sometimes, and trouble sleeping when I’m worrying about things. And I find myself getting a bit… short with people, which I don’t like. Not yelling, exactly, but… not as patient as I usually am. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes quite a bit of sense, Liza. A tightening in the chest and trouble sleeping are certainly things we want to explore. And changes in your temperament can be a sign something’s up, too. When you say “trouble sleeping,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not that I can’t fall asleep, usually. It’s more… waking up in the middle of the night, and then my mind just races. Thinking about things that happened at work, things that could happen, you know? And then I can’t really get back to sleep, or I wake up feeling like I haven’t rested at all. It's probably happened… oh, at least three or four times a month for the last few months, maybe more. It's not every night, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, waking up frequently and racing thoughts... that points to a few possibilities. And you mentioned this has been going on for a few months now. Has anything specific triggered this, or did it just gradually start?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. There wasn't one big event. It’s been a busier time at work, for sure. We’ve had some staffing changes, so everyone is picking up the slack. And there was that… oh, a signal malfunction a couple of months ago. It was fixed quickly, thankfully, but it felt… unsettling. It wasn't my fault, but I kept replaying it in my head, wondering if I could have noticed something earlier. Just… a lot of little things adding up, I suppose. It’s hard to pinpoint one specific thing.
DOCTOR: It sounds like a build-up of stress from work, with that incident contributing. We’ll explore that further. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest tightening and sleep issues?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh, yes. Actually, my appetite hasn’t been great lately. Not that I’m not eating, but I don't really feel hungry. And sometimes I get… just a bit irritable. Not snapping at people, but… less tolerant, I guess. And maybe a little more tired during the day, even when I think I’ve slept okay. It's subtle, though. I’m not completely exhausted, just… not as energetic as usual. Oh, and sometimes my stomach feels a little… off. Not painful, just… unsettled. Does that sound like a lot? I’m probably just rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Liza. That’s all very helpful information. It sounds like the stress is affecting you physically, which isn't uncommon. Appetite changes, irritability, fatigue, and stomach upset can all be signs of stress. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about your past medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Let’s see… nothing major. I had pneumonia when I was a child, but I recovered fully. And I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I do have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups, but they haven’t found anything concerning. I don’t take any medications regularly. Oh, and I’m single, if that’s relevant. No family relying on me, which is good, I suppose. Though sometimes it’s nice to have someone to talk things over with. But no, nothing significant medically.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Liza. Pneumonia as a child, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, otherwise healthy. No current medications, single, Medicare. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Let me think… on my mother’s side, my grandfather had high blood pressure. And my aunt had diabetes, but she wasn’t very good about taking care of herself. My father’s side… I didn’t know my grandparents very well, and my father passed away a few years ago. He had some heart problems in his later years, but I don’t know the specifics. Nothing… nothing really dramatic, if that makes sense. No history of mental illness or anything like that. It's a pretty healthy family, overall. Does that help? I’m not sure how important family history is.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Knowing there’s a history of hypertension and diabetes is good to note, and heart problems with your father. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, lifestyle. Alright. Well, I live alone in a small house, pretty quiet neighborhood. I’ve been working for the railway for… oh, about twenty-five years now. It's a good job, steady pay. I don't have a lot of hobbies, to be honest. I like to read sometimes, mostly historical novels. And I try to go for a walk a few times a week, when the weather is nice. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I eat reasonably well, I think. Not a lot of fast food. And I sleep… well, we’ve already talked about the sleep. I don’t really have a lot of social commitments. Just a few friends I see from time to time. Pretty simple life, really. Nothing too exciting.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture, Liza. Twenty-five years with the railway, enjoy reading, try to walk, no smoking or excessive alcohol, and a pretty quiet social life. It sounds like you are generally taking care of yourself, despite the stress. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m probably not in the best shape, if I’m honest. All that sitting at work… but I’m happy to cooperate. Where would you like me to start?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Liza. We’re not judging fitness here, just gathering information. We'll start with your vitals – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 78, regular. Temperature is 98.6, and respiration rate is 16. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’d like to take a look at your throat, ears and eyes, and palpate your thyroid. Do you have any sensitivities to bright lights?
PATIENT: No, no sensitivities to bright lights. Just go ahead. I haven't had any problems with my vision or anything like that. I get my eyes checked annually with the Medicare coverage. But feel free to take a look. I can handle a little brightness. I’m not one of those people who gets easily bothered. It’s probably a good idea to check everything, just to be thorough, right? I appreciate you being so careful.
DOCTOR: Eyes appear normal, no evidence of retinopathy. Ears are clear, tympanic membranes normal. Thyroid is normal in size and consistency, no nodules palpated. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Bowel sounds are normal. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your extremities. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and muscle strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears normal, no obvious physical abnormalities. Now, based on everything you’ve told me and the physical exam findings, I’m thinking this is likely stress-related. However, it’s always good to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test just to be sure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. I appreciate you being so thorough. A complete blood count and a thyroid test, right? I trust your judgment. And if it is just stress, what do you suggest? I’m really hoping to find something that can help me relax a bit. That’s why I was thinking about mindfulness and meditation in the first place.
