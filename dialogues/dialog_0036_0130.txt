DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… family. Lots of heart trouble on my mother’s side. And her brothers. I just want to… make sure I’m okay, you know? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. It's very proactive of you to want to get a baseline and address any concerns, especially with a family history of heart trouble. That's a smart move. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about the heart trouble in your family?
PATIENT: Sure. My mother… she had a bad heart for a long time. Lots of chest pain. Then she had a stroke, maybe ten years ago. That’s what got her in the end. Her brother, Uncle Leo, he had something… a blockage, I think. They had to put a… a little tube in him. And another uncle, he just… his heart got weak. He couldn't walk anymore. It was sad. I don’t know all the names of the problems, I just know it runs in the family. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Schwer. Thank you for sharing that with me. Knowing the history, even without all the specific medical terms, is very helpful. It sounds like there’s a significant family history of both coronary artery disease – that’s the blockage you mentioned – and heart failure, which is what happened with your uncle who had trouble walking. Let’s talk about you. Have you ever experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations – that's a feeling like your heart is racing or fluttering?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little winded sometimes when I climb the stairs, but I’m… not a young man anymore, you know? And I smoke… well, I used to smoke. Quit about five years ago. But no chest pain or anything like that. I get tired easier now than I used to, but I thought that was just… getting older. Is that bad? I don’t want to worry my daughter. She’s the one who told me to come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. It's excellent that you quit smoking five years ago – that's a huge benefit to your heart health. And it's completely understandable to feel more tired as we age. However, given your family history, we want to make sure that fatigue isn't a sign of something else going on. Let's do a quick review of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Let me think… The doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high a few years back. He put me on a pill for it. I take it every day. I think that’s it. Nothing else. I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Oh, and my knees bother me. Arthritis, the doctor said. But mostly just the blood pressure pills. Do you need to know what kind of pill it is? I don't remember the name. It's little and white.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you could tell me the name of the blood pressure medication, that would be very helpful. Even "little and white" is a start, but knowing the name will let me check for any potential interactions or side effects. Don't worry if you don't remember exactly, we can look it up in your records if you've had prescriptions filled here. And yes, the gallbladder removal and arthritis are good to know as well. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the blood pressure pill. I used to take something for my knees, but it didn't really help, so I stopped. My daughter gives me some vitamins sometimes, but I don't take them every day. She worries about me. She means well. I think they’re just… general ones. Like, for old people. I don’t know. I mostly eat okay, I guess. Not much fast food. Mostly just… regular food. Does that make sense? I'm trying to think of everything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly clear, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like you're doing a good job taking care of yourself, and it's wonderful that your daughter is looking out for you. Just a couple more questions before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies. I eat everything. My mother was allergic to shellfish, but I love shrimp! Never had any trouble with anything. I get mosquito bites, but that’s just… mosquitoes. Nothing serious. I don't wear any fancy perfumes or anything like that. Pretty simple life, really.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's good to know. And no, mosquito bites don't count! Okay, Mr. Schwer, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just let me know if anything is wrong. I'm a little nervous, to be honest. But I want to make sure I’m okay. My daughter would be very upset if something happened to me. She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mr. Schwer, and it’s perfectly okay to feel that way. We're just going to gather some information, and I'll explain everything as we go. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. 148 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart. I hear a normal S1 and S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Do you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes they feel a little tired at the end of the day, but not swollen. I wear comfortable shoes. My daughter bought them for me. She said they were good for my feet. I used to have problems with my feet when I was younger, but not anymore. Just a little tired sometimes. That's all. Is that bad? I don't want to worry her. She worries enough already.
DOCTOR: A little tiredness at the end of the day is common, Mr. Schwer, and doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. We’re just gathering information. Now, let me just take a quick look at your extremities. Capillary refill is good in both hands and feet. No cyanosis or clubbing noted. Pulses are palpable in all extremities. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, everything seems relatively stable at the moment. However, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and given your family history of heart trouble, I would like to run a few tests to get a better understanding of your overall cardiovascular health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I don’t like needles. And I don’t want to spend a lot of money. My retirement isn't very big. Is it going to be expensive? What are you looking for? I just want to know if I’m going to… you know… be okay. I just want peace of mind. My daughter says I worry too much. But it's hard not to, with everything that happened to my family.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Schwer. It's perfectly reasonable to be worried about tests, especially with concerns about cost and discomfort. The tests I'm recommending are pretty standard. We'll start with a complete blood count to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. And most importantly, I'd like to order a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels – that's a key factor in heart health. We'll also do an EKG – that's the heart tracing – to look at the electrical activity of your heart. It's quick and painless. The blood draw will be the only part with a needle, and it's usually very quick. We can minimize discomfort with proper technique. And regarding cost, Medicare usually covers these tests, and we'll check your coverage beforehand to give you an estimate of any out-of-pocket expenses. We wouldn't order anything unnecessary. The purpose of these tests is to get a baseline of your heart health and identify any potential risk factors that need to be addressed. We'll use the results to determine if you need any further evaluation or treatment. It’s about being proactive and giving you peace of mind, just like you said. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… better. If Medicare covers it, then I guess it’s okay. I don’t want to be a burden on my daughter. She’s already helped me so much. A heart tracing… that doesn’t sound too bad. And the other stuff… if it’s just blood work, I guess I can handle that. So, it’s just to… check things? To see if I’m going to… be okay? Not to find anything bad? I’m just scared, Doctor. I don’t want to end up like my mother. She suffered a lot. If you think it’s best, I’ll do the tests. But please, let me know if you find anything. I need to know. And please, keep it simple. I don’t understand all the medical stuff.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to be scared, Mr. Schwer, and it’s perfectly okay to feel that way. We’re going to take things one step at a time, and I promise to keep you informed every step of the way. And you're right, I will keep it simple. Yes, the purpose of these tests is to get a better understanding of your heart health and to ensure you’re as healthy as possible. They're not necessarily looking for anything bad, but it’s better to be proactive and identify any potential risk factors early on. I’m going to write up the orders for the lab work and the EKG now. The lab will draw your blood, and the technician will perform the EKG. It usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour for the results to come back. We can review them together once they’re available. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a low-dose aspirin. It can help prevent blood clots and reduce your risk of heart attack or stroke. It's generally very well-tolerated, but please let me know if you experience any side effects. I’ll also give you some information about a heart-healthy diet and exercise. Making small changes to your lifestyle can have a big impact on your overall health. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Aspirin? I thought aspirin was bad for your stomach. My mother had a stomach ulcer. And… what about the results? How long will it take? And if they find something… what happens then? Will I have to have surgery? I don’t want surgery. I’m too old for surgery. I guess… no. I don’t have any other questions right now. I’m just… nervous. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very patient with me. My daughter said you were a good doctor. I hope she’s right. Just… please, be careful. And please, tell me everything. Don’t leave anything out. I need to know.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned about the aspirin, Mr. Schwer. It can cause stomach upset in some people, especially those with a history of ulcers. However, the dose I'm prescribing is very low, and we can also prescribe a medication to protect your stomach if needed. We’ll monitor you closely for any side effects. As for the results, the lab usually takes about 30-60 minutes to process the blood work and send the results. The EKG results are usually available immediately. Once I have the results, I’ll review them with you in detail. And you're right to ask about what happens if we find something. If the results are abnormal, we’ll discuss your options. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need surgery. We might recommend lifestyle changes, medication, or further testing to get a better understanding of the problem. Surgery is always a last resort, and we would only consider it if absolutely necessary. I promise to keep you informed every step of the way and to answer all of your questions honestly and clearly. We’ll make decisions together, and I’ll never push you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. Let’s focus on getting these tests done first. I’m going to have the nurse come in and draw your blood and perform the EKG. She’s very gentle and experienced. I’ll be right here if you need anything.
