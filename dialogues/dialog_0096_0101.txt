DOCTOR: Alright then, Mr. Popova. Good morning to you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right at the back of my head, you know? It's been bothering me for a little while now. Not constant, but it comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a headache, you say. At the back of the head. And how long exactly is “a little while now,” Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started, oh, maybe three weeks ago? Just a little niggle at first, then it got a bit stronger. Not debilitating, mind you, but enough to notice. Especially when I’m bending over doing someone’s toes, you know? Being a manicurist, I'm bent over a lot.
DOCTOR: Right, I see you’re a manicurist. Good to know. And it’s worse when bending over?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It feels… like pressure, almost. When I'm leaning forward, it kinda feels like it's squeezing the back of my head. It eases up when I sit up straight, or lie down. But it always comes back, eventually. It’s just… annoying, more than anything. I can still work, thankfully. But I don’t like having it there, nagging at me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And would you say anything else brings it on?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can tell, really. I haven't noticed anything specific. Bright lights don’t bother it, loud noises don’t bother it… I eat pretty much the same as always, sleep is alright… I even checked if I was drinking enough water, because my wife said maybe that’s it. But no change. It just… happens. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon. No real pattern to it. It’s funny, isn’t it? Something just being there without a reason.
DOCTOR: Well, things usually have a reason, Mr. Popova, even if we haven’t found it yet. Have you had any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… No fever, no dizziness… no blurry vision, thankfully. I haven't felt sick to my stomach, and no trouble with my memory, which is a blessing at my age! No, just the headache, really. That's all. I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but I put that down to… well, being 87! And working, of course. Being on my feet all day takes it out of you, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a thing. I don’t believe in loading up on pills if I can avoid it. I have my wife's home remedies, of course – ginger tea for everything! But no prescriptions, no over-the-counter stuff, nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy, you see. Knock on wood! This headache is the first real bother I’ve had in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Bless my soul, I haven’t got a single allergy. My wife says it’s a miracle! I can eat anything, touch anything, breathe anything. She’s always teased me about it. Said I was too tough for anything to bother. So, no, no allergies whatsoever. Just this headache, stubbornly refusing to go away.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. Well, given your age and the fact you haven't been taking any medication, and you have no allergies, we'll do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I'm happy to have a look-see, if that will put my mind at ease. Just let me know if anything feels… strange, alright? I'm a bit of an old man, so don't mind if I grumble a little if you poke me too hard!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. Not terrible for your age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing is a little wheezy, but nothing alarming. Lungs are clear enough. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength. This might involve me asking you to squeeze my hand, move your arms and legs, and follow my finger with your eyes. Just do your best. Strength seems a bit diminished in your left arm, and your reflexes are a little slow, but again, not drastically so for someone your age. Now, I want to check your cranial nerves. This will involve following my finger with your eyes, and I'll check your facial movements. Hmm. Everything seems intact, but a bit sluggish. Now, I’m going to feel around your head and neck for any tenderness or lumps. No obvious tenderness or masses. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it could be tension headache, possibly related to the strain from your work. However, the slight weakness in your left arm and the sluggish reflexes are concerning enough that I'd like to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Weakness in my left arm? I hadn't noticed that… I just thought I was getting old and creaky! And sluggish reflexes… well, I haven’t been doing much exercise lately, to be honest. But it’s good you’re checking everything, Doctor. I appreciate that. What other possibilities are you thinking of? And what do we do about it? I don’t want to go running for a scan if it’s just an old man’s aches and pains!
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Popova, we don’t jump to conclusions, of course. But given your age and these minor findings, we need to rule out things like a possible transient ischemic attack, or TIA – a small stroke. It’s unlikely, but we can't ignore it. Also, cervical spondylosis – arthritis in your neck – could be contributing to the weakness and headache. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to order a complete blood count to rule out any infection, and a sedimentation rate to see if there's inflammation. I’d also like to get an MRI of your brain and cervical spine to rule out anything serious. It's the best way to see what’s going on. I understand your reluctance to have a scan, and it’s not something I take lightly. But it's better to be safe than sorry, especially with these neurological symptoms. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An MRI… That sounds… serious, Doctor. And expensive, I imagine? I haven’t got insurance, you know. I was hoping for a simple cure, like a good ginger tea! But… you’re right, I suppose. Better to know what’s going on, even if it’s bad news. So, a blood test and a scan… What does the scan involve? And how long will it take? And… what if it is something serious? What then? I’m just… a bit overwhelmed, you know? At my age, you start thinking about… well, never mind. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll do it. I trust you, Doctor. But please, explain everything clearly, alright? Don’t use any fancy medical words.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova, I understand your concerns. Let me explain it as simply as possible. The blood test is straightforward. We’ll just take a sample from your arm. It will tell us if you have any infection or inflammation in your body. The MRI is a bit more involved. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain and spine. It’s painless, but you have to lie very still for about 30 to 45 minutes. It can be a bit noisy, so we'll give you earplugs. As for what if it is something serious… Well, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. If we find anything concerning, we’ll discuss your options, which could include medication, physical therapy, or, in some cases, other interventions. The cost… yes, that is a concern. I’ll have my staff look into financial assistance programs for uninsured patients. There may be options available. I'll write you a referral for the MRI and a lab slip for the blood test. The staff will help you schedule the MRI appointment. Please come back to see me as soon as you have the results, so we can discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… manageable. Financial assistance would be a blessing, truly. And I’ll try not to worry too much before I see the results. Though it's hard, you know? An old man’s mind tends to wander. So, get the blood test, schedule the scan, and come back when it’s done. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And please, tell your staff I appreciate their help with the scheduling and the insurance. I think… I think that’s everything for now. I'll see you when I have the results. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. You take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your appointment. My staff will be in touch to schedule everything. And don't worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
