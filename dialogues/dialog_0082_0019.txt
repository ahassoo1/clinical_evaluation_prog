DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me? My wife… she wants… babies. We want babies, yes. But… we old. I think. She says we need to talk to someone… about… making sure everything okay. I forget things… so she make me come.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you and your wife are thinking about starting a family, and she’d like to make sure everything is healthy before you proceed. That’s very responsible of both of you. And it's perfectly alright to forget things, that happens to the best of us. Just to clarify, are you and your wife currently trying to have a baby, or are you just beginning to discuss the possibility?
PATIENT: No, no trying yet. Just… talking. She worry. I worry a little too… about… everything. We been married long time… and… not so young anymore. She say maybe… harder now. I not know. Just want to be safe.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Mr. Carlotta. It’s good to be proactive and think things through. And you're right, things can be a little different as we get older. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you seen a doctor regularly over the years?
PATIENT: Hmm… doctor… yes. Not… so much lately. I have Medicare… they pay the doctor. But… I not feel sick. So… not go. I see doctor… long time ago. For… little things. Nothing… big. I work with my hands… make things. Metal and plastic. Keep me busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And it’s good you’ve been generally healthy. Just so I have a complete picture, do you remember what those “little things” were that you saw the doctor for?
PATIENT: Little things… hmm… maybe… back pain? From the work. Lifting things. And… I think… high blood pressure? The doctor say… watch the salt. I forget what else. It was… a long time ago. So many years. I remember… a needle. And… a man in white coat.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Carlotta. Many years is a long time. Back pain and high blood pressure… those are good things to know. We'll check your blood pressure today, just to see where things stand. Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure, or for anything else?
PATIENT: No… no medicine. Doctor… long time ago… say watch the salt. I try. My wife… she cook very healthy. Not much salt. And… I not feel sick. So… no medicine. I think. Maybe I take… something for the back? A little pill? I forget. She keep the pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And it sounds like your wife is very supportive of your health, which is wonderful. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental things like pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm… no. I think. I eat… many things. My wife cook many things. No problems. Maybe… dust? I sneeze sometimes. But… everyone sneeze. I not think… allergy. Serious allergy. No. I not think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known serious allergies. That’s good. Now, Mr. Carlotta, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, other than maybe a minor childhood illness?
PATIENT: Hospital… hmm… yes. One time. Long, long time ago. When I was… young man. I work with metal… cut my hand. Very bad cut. Need… stitches. And… they keep me for a few days. Make sure… no infection. That’s it. Only… the hand. No other hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, a hand injury requiring hospitalization. That’s good to know. Do you remember approximately when that happened, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? Long, long time ago… before I come to America. Maybe… fifty years ago? More? I not remember exactly. I was… young man. Working in… Somalia. Before… everything. Very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately fifty years ago. That was a long time ago, indeed. Now, Mr. Carlotta, I'm going to ask about your family history, if you don't mind. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No… my parents… long gone. Both gone. Long, long time ago. I… I have brothers and sisters. Some still alive. But… I not see them for many years. We… far away.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… I not know. My family… we not talk much about… sickness. We… strong people. Work hard. Not much time for… talking about sickness. Maybe… heart trouble? My uncle… he had heart trouble. But… that was long ago. I not know much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No… no smoke. Never smoke. My wife… she not like smoke. And… I not like smoke. Bad for… everything. No. Never smoke.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… hmm… sometimes. Very little. My wife… she like wine. A little wine with dinner. I drink a little too. But… not much. Not every day. Just… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional alcohol. That’s good to know. Now, Mr. Carlotta, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that is good. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever you need to… check things. I just want to… make sure everything okay. For the baby.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. That’s very kind of you. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 85. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are a little quiet, but regular. Your lungs sound clear. I’m going to check your abdomen now. Your abdomen is soft, and doesn't seem to be any pain when I press on it. It’s a little full, though. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little slow. Everything seems generally okay, but your blood pressure, the slight fullness in your abdomen, and slower reflexes are things we'll want to investigate further. I think it’s best we order some blood work and a urine sample, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Blood work… urine sample… I can do that. I just want to… make sure everything okay. For the baby. Is it… bad? The blood pressure? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Mr. Carlotta, but it's elevated, and we want to understand why. High blood pressure can be managed, and we'll work together to figure out the best course of action. The other things I noticed are relatively minor, but it's best to check them out to be thorough. The blood work will give us a lot of information about your overall health, including your kidney function, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. The urine sample will help us check for any signs of infection or kidney problems. I'm going to have the nurse draw the blood and collect a urine sample now. It’s a standard procedure, and it shouldn’t take long. While we’re waiting for the results, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No… no questions right now, Doctor. Just… thank you. Thank you for… checking me. And… for listening. My wife… she worry a lot. I hope… everything okay. For the baby. And… for her. She very happy to… maybe have a baby.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. It's my job to listen and help in any way I can. And it’s wonderful your wife is happy. I understand her excitement. Let’s get those tests done, and we’ll go from there. I’ll explain everything clearly once we have the results. The nurse will be in shortly to get started. Is there anything else I can help you with right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all, Doctor. Thank you again.
