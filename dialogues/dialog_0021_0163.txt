DOCTOR: Right. Jarvis Vantine, 85 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Havird. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Though I confess, “brings me in” sounds rather dramatic. It’s simply… a diet. A rather foolish one, now that I think about it, but my grandson was quite insistent. He’s a bright lad, but prone to enthusiasm, you see. I'm hoping you can tell me just how misguided I’ve been.
DOCTOR: Enthusiasm. Yes, well. Grandchildren. Always a source of… complications. So, you started a new diet. Tell me about it. What exactly did this bright lad suggest you eat?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s quite the thing, really. He called it… the “Moon Phase Diet”. Apparently, the phases of the moon dictate what one should consume. New moon – only liquids, full moon – raw vegetables, and so on. It’s all terribly specific, and involves a rather alarming amount of kale. I've been keeping a meticulous record, of course – one doesn't embark on such an endeavour without proper documentation. Though I must say, the lack of a proper cooked meal is beginning to wear on one’s sensibilities.
DOCTOR: The moon phases?
PATIENT: Indeed. Utterly preposterous when you consider it logically, isn’t it? But young Timothy assured me it’s based on… ancient lunar cycles and the gravitational pull affecting bodily fluids. He sent me links, charts, the whole shebang. I indulged him, you see. He’s been rather down lately, with his studies, and I thought, well, a little harmless dietary eccentricity wouldn’t hurt. Though I am beginning to suspect “harmless” was a rather optimistic assessment. I’ve lost a bit of weight, yes, but I feel… remarkably weak. And the kale… oh, the kale is a constant companion.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long have you been… following this lunar regimen?
PATIENT: Approximately six weeks, Doctor. Started on the new moon of… let me see… July 15th, I believe. Yes, July 15th. I have it all noted in my journal, with the corresponding lunar phase and precise caloric intake – or rather, lack thereof. It’s rather rigorous, you see. I pride myself on thoroughness, even when pursuing… questionable courses of action.
DOCTOR: And before this diet… what was your typical eating pattern like?
PATIENT: Oh, perfectly normal, Doctor. A hearty breakfast, usually porridge with a bit of fruit. A sensible lunch – a sandwich, perhaps a small salad. And a proper dinner – roast chicken, fish and vegetables, things of that nature. Nothing overly extravagant, but certainly nourishing. I enjoy a glass of sherry with my dinner, mind you, and a biscuit or two afterward. A little indulgence is vital, wouldn’t you agree? I’ve always maintained a reasonably active lifestyle, too – gardening, walking, the occasional trip to the theatre. No restrictive diets, no fad eating. Just… sensible living.
DOCTOR: So, you’ve drastically altered your routine in the last six weeks, based on… planetary alignment. And you’re surprised you feel weak?
PATIENT: Well, when you put it quite like that, Doctor, it does sound rather foolish, doesn’t it? Timothy presented it with such… conviction. He’s a budding scientist, you see, and assured me it was all perfectly sound. I suppose I allowed myself to be swayed by his enthusiasm and a desire to… be supportive. It’s rather humiliating to admit, but I felt a bit… pressured, perhaps. And truthfully, the initial weight loss was… encouraging. But now… now I simply feel depleted. And the kale is relentless.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's do a quick physical exam. I want to check your weight, blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just to get a baseline. Then we can talk about getting you back on a normal diet. It’s really quite simple.
PATIENT: Excellent, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. I quite agree – a return to normalcy is paramount. And please, do feel free to be frank. I’m not easily offended. Though I must confess, the prospect of a thorough examination is slightly… unsettling. But I trust your professional judgment implicitly. Lead on, as they say.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just step onto the scale for me, please. And then we’ll take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I do hope I haven’t upset the delicate machinery.
DOCTOR: Right. And now your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Do let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m perfectly compliant, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is a little on the low side, which isn’t surprising given your recent… dietary habits. Now, if you could just lie down on the examination table, please. I want to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Do let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds fine, and your lungs are clear, though a little quiet. It’s likely that's from the lack of proper nutrition. This diet… it’s not doing you any favours, Mr. Vantine. It’s depleted your reserves. We need to get you back to a normal eating pattern immediately. No more moon phases.
PATIENT: Quite right, Doctor. I concede. Utterly foolish. The moon phases have been a grave error in judgment. I’m profoundly relieved to hear a professional opinion confirming my growing suspicions. Please, tell me precisely what I need to do. A sensible breakfast, you say? Roast chicken? I’m prepared to embrace normalcy with enthusiasm. Though perhaps a gradual reintroduction of kale might be wise… just to avoid any… digestive upsets.
DOCTOR: No more kale. Not for a while, at least. We're going to start with small, frequent meals. Protein is key – eggs, chicken, fish. Complex carbohydrates, like potatoes and rice. And plenty of fruits and vegetables – the normal kind. Nothing restrictive, but balanced and nutritious. And definitely no crash dieting. We need to rebuild your strength. I'm also going to order some basic blood work to check your electrolyte levels and make sure there's no further damage. It’s just a precaution, but it’s important.
PATIENT: Excellent, Doctor. A sensible plan indeed. Protein, complex carbohydrates, the avoidance of all lunar-influenced greenery. I shall embrace it wholeheartedly. And the blood work… perfectly reasonable. Precaution is always wise. May I ask… will the results be sent to me directly, or will I be contacted? Also, might I inquire about a suitable sherry to accompany the roast chicken? A dry amontillado, perhaps?
DOCTOR: The results will be sent to my office, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. As for the sherry… I’m a doctor, not a sommelier. I recommend moderation. One glass with dinner is acceptable, but don't overdo it. It won't help your recovery. Now, I’m going to print out a list of recommended foods and a brief overview of the dietary changes we discussed. It's all quite straightforward. And please, Mr. Vantine… no more moon phases.
PATIENT: Perfectly understandable, Doctor. Moderation, of course. And a firm commitment to abandoning all lunar-influenced culinary practices. I assure you, the moon phases are banished from my thoughts – and my diet – forevermore. I shall await my nurse’s call with anticipation. And thank you, Doctor Havird. You’ve been… remarkably thorough. I daresay, a roast chicken is sounding exceptionally appealing at this moment. Perhaps with a light gravy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Light gravy is acceptable. Just remember, small portions. And if you experience any weakness or dizziness, contact my office immediately. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. You’ve taken up quite a bit of my time with this… lunar adventure.
PATIENT: Quite right, Doctor. Small portions, a firm commitment to moderation, and an immediate cessation of all lunar-influenced dietary practices. I understand perfectly. And I apologize for the… extended consultation. My grandson's enthusiasm proved… rather persuasive. Thank you again, Doctor Havird. You’ve been most helpful. I shall endeavour to follow your instructions to the letter. Goodbye, Doctor. .
