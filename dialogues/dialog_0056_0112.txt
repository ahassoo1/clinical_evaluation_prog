DOCTOR: Hi Keoni, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be frank. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom quite often lately. More often than usual, certainly. I apologize for being so vague, it’s just… the details are a little hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to apologize at all, it's perfectly normal to feel a little embarrassed talking about this. We're here to figure things out, and I appreciate you coming in. “Quite often” – can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Certainly. Hmm… let me think. Usually, I go perhaps… three or four times a day, give or take. But recently, it feels like almost every hour or two. Perhaps even more frequently than that at times. I haven't been drinking any more water than usual, and I haven't changed my diet. It just… started, I suppose. A few weeks ago, maybe? It’s difficult to pinpoint precisely. I apologize again for the lack of specificity.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Keoni. It's helpful to have even a rough timeframe. So, increased frequency over the past few weeks, no changes to fluid intake or diet. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, not pain, exactly. There's… a slight discomfort sometimes, a bit of stinging, perhaps. But it’s not severe. It's more of an… irritation, really. It doesn't happen every time, just occasionally. And it doesn’t last long. Is that… important, Doctor? I’m sorry if I'm not being very clear.
DOCTOR: It is important, thank you for telling me. The stinging is good to know. And it's perfectly alright, you're being very clear. Okay, besides the frequency and occasional stinging, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I think… I've been feeling a little more tired than usual, but honestly, with everything going on, that could be anything. I suppose I haven’t been sleeping particularly well, either. Though I wouldn't necessarily attribute that to… this. Is there anything specific I should be looking for, Doctor? I’m worried I'm forgetting something important. It’s just… everything feels a bit muddled at the moment.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Keoni, we'll get to the bottom of this. Fatigue and disrupted sleep can definitely be related to a lot of things, so we'll factor that in. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any changes to the color or smell?
PATIENT: No, no blood, thankfully. And I haven’t noticed any… unusual smells, no. The color seems… normal, as far as I can tell. Honestly, I don’t typically pay much attention to those sorts of things, if I’m being frank. I really apologize for my… lack of observation skills, Doctor. I'm not very good at noticing these details. I do recall feeling a little… shaky sometimes, though that could be the coffee, perhaps? I have a rather strong fondness for it.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Keoni. It’s perfectly normal not to be constantly monitoring everything! And coffee can certainly cause shakiness. Okay. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… that’s a bit difficult. I had a rather… complicated divorce a few years ago, and honestly, everything felt a bit chaotic at the time. I saw a doctor occasionally for check-ups, but I don't recall any… significant illnesses or conditions. I've always been fairly healthy, I believe. I haven’t had any surgeries, and I don't take any regular medications, apart from the occasional pain reliever for a headache. I’m not sure if that’s helpful, Doctor. I apologize again for the vagueness. My memory… isn’t what it once was. I did have a bout of… something, years ago, perhaps a bad flu? But I don't recall the specifics.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. It's helpful to know you haven't had any major surgeries or ongoing medical conditions. And occasional pain relievers is good to know. Any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. I think… I had a mild reaction to penicillin when I was a child, a rash, I believe. Nothing serious, just a bit uncomfortable. And I tend to get itchy when I'm around certain flowers, but that’s more of an annoyance than an actual allergy, I suppose. I don’t recall anything else. Honestly, I’m quite fortunate in that regard. I rarely get sick, and I've always been able to tolerate most things. Is that… relevant, Doctor? I apologize if I'm rambling. I tend to do that when I'm nervous.
DOCTOR: No, not rambling at all, Keoni. That’s good to know about the penicillin allergy and the flower sensitivity. Okay, just a few more questions. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… complicated. My mother passed away a few years ago, and she… wasn’t particularly forthcoming about medical matters. I know she had high blood pressure, I believe, and she struggled with arthritis in her later years. My father is still alive, but we’re not very close, and I haven’t spoken to him in some time. I don’t recall any… major illnesses on his side of the family, but honestly, I wouldn’t know where to begin. I apologize for the lack of information, Doctor. It’s just… I don’t have a lot of details. My family… wasn’t very open about these sorts of things. And I wasn’t particularly interested in medical matters until recently, I suppose. I really apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all, Keoni. It’s perfectly alright. High blood pressure in your mother is good to know. And it’s perfectly common not to have a full family medical history. Last few questions, I promise. Can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I'm a concierge, so I spend a lot of time on my feet, running errands and assisting guests. It’s a fairly active job, physically speaking. I live alone, and I don’t have any… significant hobbies, if I’m being honest. I enjoy reading occasionally, and I like to go for walks when the weather is nice. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I suppose I eat a fairly healthy diet, though I do have a weakness for pastries. I try to maintain a reasonable level of fitness, but it’s difficult with my schedule. I'm divorced, as I mentioned before, and I don’t have any children. I don’t have any pets. Is there anything specific you’re looking for, Doctor? I apologize for the… rather mundane details. It’s not a very exciting life, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: No, that's helpful, Keoni. It sounds like you're quite active, which is good. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to hop up on the examination table when you're ready. We'll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, and then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. I apologize if I seem… nervous. I don’t typically spend much time in doctor’s offices. I suppose I’m a bit out of practice. Please, proceed when you're ready.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Keoni. Completely understandable. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 78, temperature is 98.6. Normal. Now, if you could lie back for me, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: That… that’s a little tender, Doctor. Right… about here. Not particularly painful, just… uncomfortable. It’s a dull ache, really. And it's only when you press on it. It doesn’t hurt otherwise. I apologize if I'm being difficult. I’m not very good at describing these things. It's just a… general feeling of pressure, I suppose. It's been a little… bothersome lately. It's not constant, though. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know, Keoni. Tenderness in the lower abdomen is helpful information. No noticeable masses or rebound tenderness. Now, I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds. Bowel sounds are normal. Alright, Keoni, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like we need to rule out a few possibilities. The increased frequency of urination, the stinging, and the tenderness in your lower abdomen could be a sign of a urinary tract infection, or a bladder irritation. It’s also possible it’s a muscle strain, but the urinary symptoms are more concerning. The first step is to get a urine sample to check for infection. Do you think you can provide that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. A urine sample… I can certainly do that. I apologize for any inconvenience. Is there anything specific I need to do? I don’t want to do anything wrong. I… I'm not very familiar with these procedures, as you can probably tell. I appreciate your patience. It's… comforting to finally have a plan.
DOCTOR: No inconvenience at all, Keoni. It's perfectly alright to be unfamiliar with these things. You're doing great. I'll give you a cup and instructions. It’s important to try to get a “clean catch” - that means cleaning the area first and then collecting a mid-stream sample. Here’s a pamphlet with detailed instructions, and the nurse will walk you through it as well. Once we have the results, we’ll be able to determine the best course of action. If it is a UTI, we’ll start you on antibiotics. If it’s not, we’ll explore other possibilities, potentially including imaging to rule out other causes of abdominal pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. A clean catch… antibiotics… imaging… It all sounds a little… daunting, to be honest. But I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. And I'm grateful for your help. I suppose… I’ll go and see the nurse now? Please, let me know if I’ve misunderstood anything. I don’t want to do anything incorrectly.
DOCTOR: You haven’t misunderstood a thing, Keoni. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little apprehensive. The nurse will be very helpful, and she can answer any questions you have about the sample collection. We’ll take it one step at a time. Once you’ve provided the sample, just let me know and I'll get the lab to analyze it. Don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. You're doing great. Go ahead and see the nurse – she’s just down the hall. And I'll be here when you're ready. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I truly appreciate your patience and kindness. I… I’ll see you soon. .
