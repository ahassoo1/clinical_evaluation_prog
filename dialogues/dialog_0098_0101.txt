DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Bombara. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been havin’. Right at the back of me head. Been botherin’ me for… oh, let me see… about a week now, I’d say. Not constant, mind you, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head for about a week, coming and going. Can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like a migrain’ me daughter used to get. It’s more… a dull ache. Like a tightness, really. Sometimes it feels like pressure, buildin’ up. And it can spread a little, down me neck sometimes. Not always, though. It’s just… uncomfortable, you know? Makes it hard to concentrate on me work.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A dull ache, tightness, pressure… sometimes spreading to your neck. And it's interfering with your work. Is anything in particular making it worse, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… bendin’ over for a long time, that’s definitely a trigger. When I’m doin’ a pedicure, gotta be down there a while, and that’s when it really starts. Bright lights don’t help neither, but I can usually manage with me shades. And stress… well, who doesn’t get headaches when they stressed? But the bendin’ over is the worst of it, I think. Definitely the worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, bending over, bright lights, and stress seem to be contributing factors, with bending over being the most significant. Have you noticed anything that relieves the pain, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Well, nothin’ really relieves it right away. I find layin’ down, nice and quiet, helps a bit. And a cool cloth on me forehead sometimes. But it takes a good while for it to ease up, and it always comes back when I get back to workin’. I haven’t tried anythin’ special, to be honest. Just tryin’ to tough it out, really. But it’s startin’ to get a bit much, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. You’ve tried resting and a cool compress, but it doesn’t provide lasting relief. And it's impacting your work. Now, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you been experiencing any changes in your vision, like blurry sight or seeing spots?
PATIENT: No, me vision’s been alright. Never had problems with it. No blurry sight, no spots, no nothin’. Everything looks clear as a bell, thankfully. Used to be able to thread a needle without me glasses, even! Though that was years ago, mind you. But no, no changes to me sight at all. I do get a little tired sometimes, workin' long hours, but that's just old age creepin' in, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s helpful to know. No changes in vision. And you attribute the fatigue to age. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting with these headaches, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: No, thankfully nothin’ like that. No nausea, no vomiting, no dizziness neither. Just the headache and a little bit of neck stiffness sometimes. It's mostly the headache, really. It just makes me feel… drained, you know? Like I got no energy. But no, no sickness or anything like that. I eat alright, sleep alright… just this headache. A pesky headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. No nausea, vomiting or dizziness. Just the headache and occasional neck stiffness. Now, let's go over some medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Years ago, the doctor said me pressure was a little high, but he put me on some pills for a while, and it came down. Haven’t taken them in years, though. He said it was alright. Other than that… nothin’ really. I’ve been pretty healthy, all me life. A few aches and pains, as you get older, but nothin’ serious. I used to be a strong man, workin’ on the farm, but that was a long time ago. No, nothin’ diagnosed, nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, you had a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication in the past, but currently off medication. Good to know. And you haven't had any surgeries or been hospitalized before?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Never been in the hospital, not for anything serious. Broke me arm once when I was a boy, climbin’ a mango tree, but that was it. Just a simple break, they set it and that was that. No, no surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Kept me strong, workin’ hard all me life. Though these headaches are startin’ to make me wonder about that luck.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood broken arm, but no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… me mother, she had diabetes, later in life. And me father… he had heart problems. I think it was somethin’ to do with his pressure, always worryin’ too much. But other than that… nothin’ much. Me brother was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. Me sister… she lived a long life, but she didn’t talk about her health much. So, diabetes and heart problems on me parents’ side, I’d say. But nothin’ definite, nothin’ I’m really worried about.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes and heart problems in your family history. And you said you work as a… a pedicure technician, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Manicurist and Pedicurist. Been doin’ it for years, now. It's good work, keeps me busy. Met a lot of nice people, you know? But all the bendin' over is takin' its toll, I think. That’s why I came to see you, really. It’s startin' to affect me work, and I need to keep workin'. Can’t afford to stop, you know? So, yes, manicurist and pedicurist. And the bendin' is the problem, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, the bending. And I understand your concern about being able to continue working. Now, before we do a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ at all. Haven’t taken anythin’ since the doctor took me off the blood pressure pills years ago. No vitamins, no supplements, no nothin’. Just plain water and a little bit of tea, that’s all. Always been a simple man, never really believed in all those fancy things. Just tryin’ to live a healthy life, the best I can. But these headaches… they got me thinkin’ maybe I need some help.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Thank you, Mr. Popova, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your blood pressure, reflexes, and range of motion in your neck. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go right ahead. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to get rid of this headache. Hopefully, it's nothin’ too serious. Just gettin’ old, probably, but better to be safe than sorry, you know? So, yes, go ahead with the exam. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is 145/90. That's a little elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, could you please turn your head slowly to the left and then to the right?
PATIENT: Alright, slow and easy. There you go. Feels a little stiff, to be honest. Not pain, just a little… tight. I haven’t been stretchin’ like I used to, I suppose. Gettin’ old, you know? Everything starts to creak a bit. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do notice some tightness in your neck muscles, and you’re right, there is a little tenderness when I palpate here. Your reflexes are normal. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion a little further. Could you please look down and try to touch your chin to your chest?
PATIENT: Alright, here we go. There. A little tight, but I can do it. Not pain, just… a stretch. Feels like somethin' needs loosenin’ up, you know? Like I’ve been holdin’ me shoulders too high. Been worryin’ too much lately, I suppose. Is that what you're lookin' for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. I am seeing some limitation in your neck's range of motion. It seems there's some muscle tension contributing to that. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it appears you’re experiencing a tension headache, likely exacerbated by the repetitive bending over in your work and some muscle strain in your neck. It’s good that there are no other neurological symptoms. However, because your blood pressure is slightly elevated, I do want to monitor that.
PATIENT: A tension headache, you say? That doesn’t sound too serious, thankfully. And the blood pressure… I should probably be eatin’ better, I suppose. Less salt, more vegetables. My wife's always tellin' me that. So, what do you recommend, Doctor? What can I do to get rid of this headache and keep it from comin’ back? Hopefully, it’s not somethin’ I need to stop workin’ for. Can’t afford to stop workin’, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. A tension headache isn't typically serious, and we can manage it well. Stopping work isn’t necessarily the answer. I recommend a few things. First, let's focus on improving your neck posture and reducing muscle tension. I'm going to show you some simple stretches you can do throughout the day. Also, consider using a warm compress or taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed. Regarding your blood pressure, I’d like you to monitor it at home for a week, twice a day. We can discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. I also recommend trying to reduce your salt intake and increase your vegetable consumption, as your wife suggests! I'm going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, which can help ease the tension in your neck. I will also give you a handout with the stretches and instructions on how to monitor your blood pressure. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect, Doctor. Muscle relaxant, stretches, watchin’ the blood pressure… it’s a plan. My wife will be happy to hear I’m finally listenin’ to her about the salt! And you’re right, that stretching sounds like a good idea. I probably haven't stretched properly in years. So, yes, that all sounds very good. A handout would be great, just so I don’t forget what you told me. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. Hopefully, this will get me back to normal soon. Just gotta keep workin', you know?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. I'm glad I could help. Remember to follow the instructions on the handout and take the muscle relaxant as directed. If the headache doesn't improve after a week, or if it gets worse, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. Also, if you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, vision changes, or numbness, seek medical attention immediately. I’ll see you back here in two weeks to review your blood pressure readings and see how you’re doing. In the meantime, take care of yourself and try to manage your stress levels. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just gotta stretch and watch the blood pressure, right? And listen to me wife. That’s the most important part. Thank you again, Doctor Bombara. You’re a good doctor. A very good doctor. I appreciate your help. Have a good day now. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. You take care now, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day to you as well. .
