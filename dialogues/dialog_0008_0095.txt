DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’d rather not be here, wasting my time. But here I am. I woke up this morning and…well, I can’t hear out of my left ear. And my face feels… droopy on that side. It’s quite bothersome, really. I suppose that’s what you need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Not being able to hear and noticing facial drooping – that is concerning, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out, even if it’s not ideal timing for you. It's good you didn't delay. Let’s try to get some more information. When exactly did you first notice this happening this morning?
PATIENT: This morning. I just told you that. Around…let me think… seven-ish? When I went to turn on the news. It was… quite a shock. I don't usually pay much attention to the time, if that matters. Honestly, I expect you’ll need to ask a lot of pointless questions.
DOCTOR: Yes, I apologize, I am trying to be thorough. Every detail can matter. Okay, seven this morning. And has anything like this ever happened before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've always had excellent hearing. And my face… well, it’s always been perfectly symmetrical, thank you very much. This is…new. And inconvenient. I have a luncheon to attend next week, you know. I simply must be presentable.
DOCTOR: Right, perfectly symmetrical. I understand your concern about the luncheon. Okay. And besides the hearing loss and facial drooping, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see... my head feels a bit…fuzzy. Not a headache, exactly, just… not quite right. And I nearly spilled my coffee this morning, which is unusual. I'm normally very coordinated. Is that what you mean by symptoms? Honestly, I haven't been meticulously cataloging every little sensation since waking up.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fuzzy” and trouble with coordination. Thank you. And have you had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting this morning?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I’m a busy woman. I don't have time to list every minor discomfort I’ve experienced since dawn. It's a deaf ear and a droopy face. Surely that's enough to… diagnose something?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane. It’s important to gather a complete picture, though, to ensure the most accurate assessment. Just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Now, regarding your medical history – do you have any existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Honestly. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I eat well, I exercise… well, I used to exercise more, before this happened. I've never been diagnosed with anything. A touch of arthritis in my hands, perhaps, but nothing serious. My husband… my late husband… always said I was remarkably robust. I suppose that's what you want to know. Do you need a list of everything he ever said about me?
DOCTOR: No, that won’t be necessary. So, no major medical conditions. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just a routine hysterectomy many years ago. And my cataracts removed, of course. One in each eye, separate procedures. Nothing else. Honestly, I find all these questions rather invasive. Are you a detective now, or a doctor?
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels invasive, Stephane. I assure you, it's all part of getting a clear understanding of your health. I just need to rule out anything that might be contributing to your current symptoms. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Ugh. My mother had… something. A heart condition, I believe. She was never very forthcoming about it. And my father… he died suddenly. A stroke, they said. It was all rather unpleasant. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to family illnesses. What good does it do? It doesn't change anything. Are we still on this? I have a luncheon to prepare for, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’re almost done with the questions, Stephane. Just a few more about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Disgusting habit. And I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. A very small glass. I’m not a… a lush, if that’s what you’re implying. Honestly, I find this line of questioning quite judgmental. Are you assessing my character now, or trying to figure out what’s wrong with my ear?
DOCTOR: No judgment, Stephane, I assure you. Just gathering information. One small glass of wine. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I believe. Nothing regularly. Honestly, I barely take anything. I prefer to rely on my own strength and willpower. Is that sufficient? Can we please move on to actually fixing my ear? This has been an exceptionally tedious morning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Stephane. Thank you for your patience. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart, and examine your ears, nose, and throat. We’ll also do a quick neurological exam to assess your facial muscles and reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. Just… try to be gentle. And don’t poke too hard. I’m a delicate flower, despite appearances. Honestly, I can't believe the indignity of it all. This luncheon won't plan itself.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Stephane. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not critically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and another… Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Okay, now let’s examine your ears. Hmm. I see some mild redness in your left ear canal, but nothing significant. The tympanic membrane appears intact. Right ear looks normal. Now, I’m going to check your facial muscles. Could you please smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? Honestly, it feels… stiff. I told you my face was droopy. It's not exactly cooperating. This is ridiculous. I feel like a performing monkey. Do you always treat your patients like this? Perhaps I should find another doctor. A more… respectful doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the asymmetry. Now, can you please close your eyes tightly and try to wrinkle your forehead?
PATIENT: There! Is that satisfactory? It’s…difficult. The left side simply won’t cooperate. Honestly, I feel quite foolish. This is humiliating. I have a luncheon to attend, not a neurology exam. What are you even looking for? Are you going to declare me brain-damaged?
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you stick your tongue out?
PATIENT: There. Perfectly adequate tongue. Though, I suspect it's a little crooked. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite self-conscious. This is an utter disaster. Are you finished poking and prodding yet? I have an appointment to keep with my hairdresser, you know. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Stephane. Thank you. I've completed the physical exam. Based on your symptoms – sudden hearing loss in one ear, facial drooping, difficulty with coordination, and the findings of the exam, I'm concerned about the possibility of a stroke. However, it’s too early to say definitively. We need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a STAT CT scan of your brain to assess for any bleeding or blockage. We’ll also need blood tests to check for infection and other causes. Because stroke requires immediate treatment, I recommend going to the Emergency Room right away. We'll need to act quickly to minimize potential damage. I’ll have the scan results faxed to their office, so they're prepared when you arrive. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Stroke?! Good heavens! Stroke?! I just have a deaf ear and a droopy face! You're telling me this is a… a stroke?! Honestly, this is outrageous! You’re sending me to the Emergency Room based on… a few wobbly muscles?! I refuse. Absolutely refuse. I have a luncheon! And my hairdresser! This is preposterous. You’ve clearly made a mistake. I demand a second opinion. I will be speaking to the hospital administrator. This is… this is simply unacceptable. Emergency Room! The very idea. I'm perfectly fine, thank you very much. A little inconvenience, that's all. I think I need a glass of wine. A large glass of wine. And perhaps a lawyer.
DOCTOR: Stephane, I understand your shock and disbelief. I assure you, I am not making a light decision. While a stroke might not be the cause, we must rule it out quickly due to the time-sensitive nature of treatment. Delaying evaluation could have serious consequences. I’m not saying you’re definitely having a stroke, but the symptoms you’re experiencing are consistent with it, and it’s my professional responsibility to investigate this thoroughly. I would be neglecting my duty if I didn’t recommend immediate evaluation. I can call the Emergency Room ahead of time and explain the situation, ensuring you are seen promptly. They’ll be able to perform the necessary scans and provide a definitive diagnosis. You do not need to worry about being kept waiting, or being subjected to unnecessary procedures. I'll remain on call to discuss the results with the ER physician. Please, Stephane. For your own peace of mind, let’s get this checked out. Ignoring these symptoms could be a serious mistake. Would you like me to call for an ambulance, or would you prefer to have a family member drive you?
PATIENT: An ambulance?! Absolutely not! The very idea is… undignified. I am perfectly capable of arranging my own transportation. Though, frankly, I don’t see why I need to go at all. I'm sure it's just a pinched nerve. Or stress. I have a very demanding social calendar, you know. Fine. I will… I will consider going. But only to appease you. And if it turns out to be nothing, I expect a full apology. And a refund. Honestly, this has been the most dreadful morning of my life. Call my driver, then. His number is… Here. Just tell him to come quickly. And tell him to be discreet. I will not be seen arriving at the Emergency Room looking like a… a patient. This is a disaster. A complete and utter disaster. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Stephane. I've contacted your driver, and he's on his way. While you wait, I’ll prepare a summary of your symptoms and medical history to send to the Emergency Room. Please, try to remain calm. And remember, we’re simply ruling things out. It’s always best to be cautious when it comes to your health. I’ll also write a note with the results of the exam as well. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
