DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Ardelle. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… hello. It’s… nice to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, I don't even remember making an appointment. My husband, Dorjee, he probably did. Something about being… tired. Just awfully tired, all the time. And the young man at the lab kept saying something about numbers… numbers being high. It’s all a bit of a blur, really. I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle, that’s perfectly alright. It’s very common to feel a little overwhelmed with appointments and lab results. We’ll take things slowly. So, you’re feeling tired all the time – has this been a recent change, or has it been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, a while. Honestly, it’s hard to say how long. Things just… fade, you know? But I’d say… months, at least. Maybe longer. I used to be able to get everything done, you see. Keep the house spotless, help Dorjee with his garden… now… I mostly just sit. It’s… frustrating. And frankly, I don’t appreciate having to explain this. It should be obvious!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ardelle. It is frustrating when you're not feeling yourself and having to explain it. It sounds like this tiredness is really impacting your daily life. And it's good you're able to articulate that. Let's try to get a clearer picture. When you say 'tired,' is it more of a physical tiredness, like your muscles ache, or more of a mental tiredness, like difficulty concentrating or feeling foggy?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… both, I think. But mostly… physical. My arms and legs just feel like lead weights. Even getting up from the chair is an effort. And my muscles… they ache, constantly. It's not a sharp pain, just… a dull, heavy ache. Honestly, it's embarrassing. A strong woman like me shouldn't be feeling like this. I used to be a commercial diver, you know! Strong as an ox. Though that was… a long time ago now. Dorjee doesn't understand, always telling me to just “rest more.” As if I haven’t tried that!
DOCTOR: Wow, a commercial diver! That is impressive, Ardelle. You certainly don’t sound like someone who should be feeling this way. It sounds like this muscle weakness and aching is significant. Okay, let’s talk about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well… not really. I eat. Dorjee cooks, he makes lovely curries, very spicy. I try to eat a good portion, don’t want to waste food. But… it doesn’t give me energy. It just… sits there. And sometimes… sometimes my stomach feels a little upset afterward. Not every time, mind you. But enough to be… bothersome. Honestly, everything feels bothersome lately. It’s just… a general unwellness. And I really don't appreciate having to discuss my digestion with a doctor. It's quite personal, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand that it's personal, Ardelle, and I apologize if I'm making you uncomfortable. I’m just trying to get a complete picture of what’s going on to help figure out what’s causing you to feel this way. The stomach upset is good to know. Have you noticed any changes in how often you're going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Now you’re just asking about… everything. Honestly! Well… it's a little irregular, I suppose. Sometimes… more often. Sometimes… less. It’s hard to say. And the color isn’t quite right either. A bit… pale. But frankly, I haven't paid much attention. It’s just another thing to worry about, and I have enough worries as it is. And I really don’t see what any of this has to do with being tired! I came here because I feel weak, not to discuss… bodily functions.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to question what I’m asking, Ardelle. I apologize for being so intrusive, and I understand your frustration. These questions can help me understand the overall picture, but it's perfectly alright if you don't want to answer them. Let’s go back to the tiredness then. Aside from the muscle weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms – maybe dizziness, shortness of breath, headaches, or any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Oh, now… dizziness, yes. Sometimes when I stand up too quickly. Dorjee says I’m getting old, but I’ve always had good balance. And my skin… well, it’s dry, I suppose. Very dry. I use a lot of lotion. And… sometimes I feel a little cold, even when it’s warm. But that could just be the house being drafty. Honestly, I don't see what all these questions are achieving. I just want to feel better! I feel like I’m being interrogated. A strong woman doesn't need to be poked and prodded and questioned like this. It's… undignified.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ardelle, and I sincerely apologize if I'm making you feel uncomfortable or undignified. That is the last thing I want to do. You're right to be frustrated, and I will try to be more respectful of your time and feelings. Let’s take a step back. Would you mind if I quickly review your lab results from the computer here?
PATIENT: Oh… well, alright. If you must. But don't expect me to understand all those… numbers and letters. Dorjee tried to explain them to me once, but it was all just… gibberish. I just want this to be over with, honestly. I have a lovely garden I'd like to get back to, if I had the energy. And Dorjee’s been making a new curry I’ve been meaning to try. Hopefully, these numbers will tell you something.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm pulling up your results now... Alright, it looks like you had some blood work done on July 26th. I see here your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are quite low. Your vitamin D is also very low. And your thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH, is a little elevated. These results could explain some of the tiredness, muscle weakness, dizziness and even the dry skin you’ve been experiencing. It appears you are anemic, Vitamin D deficient and possibly developing hypothyroidism. Now, I want to be clear, these are just initial findings and we need to investigate further. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh… lots of numbers again. Honestly, it’s just… overwhelming. Anemic? Hypo… what did you say? It sounds… serious. And all I did was say I was tired! Allergies? Hmm… let me think. I had a reaction to some cream once, a long time ago. Made my skin all itchy and red. But other than that… no, I don't think so. Dorjee always makes sure I check the labels carefully. He's very cautious. Honestly, I'm starting to feel a little frightened. Is this… bad? I just wanted a simple explanation for why I feel weak, not a whole list of… ailments. I really don't appreciate all this fuss. A strong woman shouldn’t need all this… attention. And I still haven’t tried that new curry!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle, let’s take a deep breath. I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed and frightened, and I apologize for presenting this information in a way that’s causing you distress. It doesn’t mean it’s “bad,” but it does mean we need to figure out what’s going on to help you feel better. Anemia means you have a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells, which can cause tiredness and weakness. Hypothyroidism means your thyroid gland isn’t producing enough thyroid hormone, which can also cause similar symptoms. And it's good you have no known allergies. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and maybe take your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam now? Honestly, it’s one thing after another. Honestly, it sounds… invasive. I don’t like being poked and prodded. A strong woman doesn’t need to be… examined! I’ve always been perfectly healthy. Well, mostly. But a little tired now and then isn’t a reason to… strip me bare! Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here at all. Dorjee insisted, said I should get it “checked out”. Now look at me, being interrogated and examined and… labeled with all sorts of… conditions! I just want to feel like myself again, not become a list of ailments. Honestly, I think I need to sit down. This is too much. And I still haven't tried that new curry. This is… unbearable. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle. You are absolutely right to express your concerns. We can absolutely slow down and stop at any time. I completely understand that this is overwhelming, and I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable. I will not proceed with a physical exam at this time. Let's focus on what you want. You want to feel like yourself again, and you want to try that new curry. I can definitely help you with that. To do that, I recommend a referral to a hematologist for further evaluation of the anemia and to an endocrinologist for the thyroid issue. They are specialists who can provide more tailored care. I will also write you a prescription for a vitamin D supplement. Would that be acceptable to you?
