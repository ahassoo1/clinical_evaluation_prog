DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Antonis Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s about my skin. It’s rather embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed these… patches. Discoloration, you might call it. Not a nice color, really. I thought I’d come in to get it checked, before it gets…worse.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Bartock. It’s good you came in to get it checked. Many skin conditions are best addressed early. There’s no need to be embarrassed; we see a lot of skin issues here. Could you describe these patches a bit more for me?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… uneven. Not all the same shade, you see. Some are lighter than my usual skin tone, almost a pale…cream, I suppose. Others are a bit…muddy. A sort of brownish tinge. They aren’t raised, thankfully, just…different. And they’ve appeared over the last few months, slowly, you understand? Not all at once. It's not a sunburn, I assure you. I'm very careful about the sun.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Ms. Bartock. That's very helpful. And good on you for being mindful of sun exposure. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me where these patches are located on your body, besides your arms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… well, there are a few on my chest, just a little bit. Not many, thankfully. And……some on my legs, mostly on the backs of them. A couple on my stomach, too. Though, honestly, I didn't really look closely on my stomach until recently. It’s… not a place I usually inspect, you understand. It’s just that I was putting lotion on and noticed them. They aren’t… large. Smallish, really. It’s probably nothing, honestly. Just…old age creeping up.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Bartock. It’s good you’re noticing these changes, and there’s no shame in checking your skin. While it might be something minor, it's important to investigate to be sure. Have you noticed any itching, pain, or any other symptoms associated with these patches?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Absolutely no itching, thankfully. That would be dreadful. And no pain whatsoever. They aren’t… uncomfortable. They’re just… there. It's more of an aesthetic concern, to be perfectly frank. I rather pride myself on my appearance, you understand. And these… blemishes… aren’t helping. They’re not noticeable under clothing, thankfully, but still. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Bartock. It’s perfectly reasonable to be bothered by changes in your skin, even if they aren't physically uncomfortable. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me see… Not that I know of. I've never had a serious reaction to anything, thankfully. A little bit of a runny nose sometimes in the spring, but that's just pollen, I assume. Nothing medicinal, though. And no food allergies. I eat everything, more or less. My husband always says I have an iron stomach. Though, I do prefer Ukrainian cuisine, you understand. Perhaps that has something to do with it – good, hearty food. But no allergies, no. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Bartock. And I'm glad to hear you have a hearty appetite! Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t believe in all those… pills. My grandmother always said fresh air and good food are the best medicine, you understand? Besides, I haven’t really needed anything. A little bit of chamomile tea now and then to help me sleep, but that’s hardly a medication. And no vitamins, no supplements. Just… normal, healthy living. My husband tries to get me to take a multivitamin, but I always refuse. I tell him I get everything I need from my borscht and varenyky.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for natural remedies, Ms. Bartock. That's admirable. Now, have you had any significant medical illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Nothing major, thankfully. When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils taken out, but that was… decades ago. And I broke my wrist once, when I was about ten, but that healed perfectly. Besides that, nothing. Just the usual childhood illnesses, you understand – colds, flu, measles… all the things you get when you’re a child. Nothing serious, nothing that required a hospital stay or anything like that. My mother always took very good care of me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Bartock. And it sounds like you had a wonderful mother. Now, is there a family history of skin conditions, like eczema, psoriasis, or skin cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… That’s a difficult question. My family… we didn't really talk about these things, you understand? It wasn’t considered polite, I suppose. My grandmother, she had… some sort of rash sometimes, on her hands, I think. But she always blamed it on the washing powder. And my aunt… she had a mole that they removed, but I don’t know anything about it. Skin cancer… I don’t think so, not that I know of. We weren't a family that went to doctors very often, you understand. We preferred home remedies and… strong willpower. So, I honestly couldn't tell you. I wish I knew more, but… this is all very vague.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Bartock. It's common for medical history to be unclear, especially across generations. It's good you're thinking about it now, though. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, what would you like to know? I’m married, as you know. My husband, Bohdan, is a retired engineer. We live in a quiet rural area, mostly keep to ourselves. I enjoy gardening – it’s very relaxing. I make all our meals from scratch, you understand. I don’t really… go out much. I don’t care for crowds. I spend most of my time at home, tending to the garden, cooking, reading……and keeping things tidy. A clean house is a happy house, you understand. And I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of horilka at Christmas, but that’s about it. A very quiet, simple life.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Bartock. It sounds like you live a very healthy and peaceful life. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at these patches. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I suppose I should have expected that. Just please be gentle. I have sensitive skin, you understand. And… try not to take too much time. I have a pot roast in the oven, and I don’t want it to burn. Bohdan loves my pot roast.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. And we’ll make sure your pot roast doesn't suffer. If you could just loosen your sleeves a little bit for me, please. Hmm… the patches are generally flat, slightly hypopigmented—meaning lighter than your normal skin tone—and irregularly shaped. There’s no tenderness to palpation, and I don’t feel any unusual lumps. The borders aren't sharply defined. The patches on your chest and legs are similar in appearance to those on your arms. I also notice some mild dryness on the backs of your hands, but nothing particularly concerning.
PATIENT: Oh. Is it… serious, Doctor? I mean, is it something I should be worried about? You know, I’ve never been one for doctors, so I tend to get… agitated easily. Bohdan says I worry too much. It's probably just old age, isn't it? Or perhaps the weather. We’ve had some very strange weather lately, you understand. Very humid. It’s bad for the skin. Very bad.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, it’s understandable to be anxious, especially when you're not accustomed to frequent medical visits. Based on my exam, the patches don't appear to be anything immediately alarming. However, the irregular pigmentation and location raise a few possibilities, and it’s important to rule things out definitively. One possibility is tinea versicolor, a common fungal infection that can cause patches of discolored skin. Another possibility, though less likely based on my initial assessment, is vitiligo, a condition where the skin loses pigmentation. It's also important to rule out other causes. To get a more accurate diagnosis, I’d like to order a simple skin scraping and a microscopic examination to check for fungal spores. This is a quick and painless procedure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A scraping? Is it… painful? I really don't like anything that involves… instruments. Bohdan says I have a low pain tolerance. Fungal… spores? Goodness, that sounds dreadful. Are you saying I have some sort of… infection? I keep a very clean house, you understand. Everything is sanitized. I use only natural cleaning products. How could I possibly have an infection? Is there… anything else we can do? Perhaps just… a cream? Or some sort of… lotion? I really would prefer to avoid anything invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Bartock. You're right to ask questions and express your concerns. The scraping is very mild—it’s a gentle collection of skin cells from the affected area, and it causes minimal discomfort, if any. Think of it like gently exfoliating the skin. It's not invasive at all. And no, it doesn't necessarily mean you have an infection in the traditional sense. Tinea versicolor is a very common condition caused by a naturally occurring fungus that lives on everyone's skin. Sometimes, it overgrows, causing the discolored patches. It’s not related to cleanliness, and it’s not contagious. A cream or lotion might help alleviate the symptoms if it is tinea versicolor, but we need to confirm the diagnosis first with the scraping. Otherwise, we'd be treating something we're not even sure is there. I can certainly explain the procedure in more detail if you'd like. It takes just a few minutes, and the results will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. We can then tailor a treatment plan specifically for you. Would you be willing to give it a try?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I suppose… if you really think it’s necessary. But please, be gentle. And quick. And explain everything before you do it. I really don't like surprises. Bohdan will be very upset if I come home with a rash from the doctor. He always says I need to be careful. So, yes. But please, be gentle. What exactly does this… scraping… involve? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bartock. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain everything step-by-step. Here's what's involved: I’ll simply use a small, sterile instrument – it looks like a tiny spoon – to gently collect a few flakes of skin from the affected area. It's completely painless, or at most, you might feel a very slight tickle. It takes less than a minute. Then, I'll place the sample on a slide and examine it under a microscope to look for fungal spores. The results should be available within a few minutes. I'll do it slowly, and I'll stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. And I promise to minimize any disruption to your schedule. Would you like me to proceed?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. But just… be quick about it. And tell me everything you're doing as you do it. Don't just… poke at me without warning. Bohdan will be very displeased if I come home looking any worse than I already do. He worries so much. Just… get it over with. Quickly. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. I will explain everything as I go. “I’m just cleansing the skin now to ensure we get a clean sample. This might feel a little cool.” “Now I’m just gently collecting a few flakes of skin. You might feel a very slight tickle, but it shouldn’t be painful.” “Now I’m examining the sample under the microscope to look for any fungal spores. This will take just a minute or two.” “Okay, Ms. Bartock, I see some fungal spores present under the microscope. This confirms a diagnosis of tinea versicolor.”
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That wasn’t… as bad as I thought it would be. But still, fungal… spores. So, it is something? Not just… my imagination? And what does that mean? What do we do about these… spores? Will I have to… quarantine myself? Bohdan will be very upset if I give him something. He’s not a strong man, you understand. Is it contagious? Tell me everything. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be concerned, Ms. Bartock. It's good we were able to confirm what's going on. And no, it’s not just your imagination, and no, you absolutely do not need to quarantine yourself! Tinea versicolor is not contagious. It's simply an overgrowth of a fungus that naturally lives on everyone's skin. You haven’t given it to anyone, and you won’t give it to anyone. The good news is, it's very easily treated with a topical antifungal cream or shampoo. I’m going to prescribe you ketoconazole cream. You’ll apply a thin layer to the affected areas once a day for two weeks. It may take a few weeks for the discoloration to completely fade, but the cream will prevent the fungus from overgrowing and spreading. It's also important to avoid wearing tight clothing and excessive sweating, as that can worsen the condition. Do you have any questions about the cream or the treatment plan?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… good. Very good. Not contagious. That's a relief, truly. Bohdan would be very upset. He worries so much. Ketoconazole… cream. Once a day for two weeks. And avoid tight clothing. And… excessive sweating. Is it… expensive? Bohdan is retired, you understand. He doesn't like spending money unnecessarily. And will it… stain my clothing? I have a very nice silk blouse I wouldn’t want to ruin. What about side effects? Do I need to be careful about anything else?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Bartock. The ketoconazole cream is relatively inexpensive—I can write you a prescription for the generic version, which will help keep costs down. I will also send it electronically to your pharmacy, so they can check your insurance coverage for you. It’s unlikely to stain your clothing, but it’s always best to be cautious. I recommend wearing loose-fitting clothing over the treated areas for the first few days, just in case. As for side effects, they are rare, but some people may experience mild skin irritation, redness, or itching. If you notice any of these symptoms, simply discontinue use and let me know. It's also important to avoid direct sunlight on the treated areas during treatment, as it can worsen the discoloration. Wear protective clothing or apply sunscreen if you need to be outdoors. Is there anything else I can clarify for you?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That doesn't sound too bad. Generics are good. Bohdan will be pleased. No direct sunlight. I can do that. Protective clothing. Sunscreen. Mild irritation. I suppose I can handle that. No. I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. And patient. I do tend to worry, you understand. It’s a family trait. Thank you. Very much. I think I’ll just… go home now and put on some cream. And avoid the sun. And perhaps make Bohdan a cup of tea. He worries, too. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure to meet you, Ms. Bartock. Remember, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’m glad we were able to get this sorted out. Have a wonderful day, and give Bohdan my best. And enjoy your tea! Goodbye, Ms. Bartock.
