DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Belan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I booked an appointment for… an HIV test. Just wanted to get it checked, really. Preventative, you know? I like to be on top of these things. My wife thinks it’s a bit much, honestly, but better safe than sorry, I always say.
DOCTOR: That’s very responsible of you, Mr. Belan. Preventative care is always a good idea, and it's good that you’re thinking ahead. Your wife’s concern is understandable, but being proactive about your health is excellent. To proceed with the HIV test, and to ensure we have a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your risk factors?
PATIENT: Risk factors? Honestly, that’s a bit… presumptuous, isn't it? I'm married. Very happily married. Been with my wife for ten years. What kind of risks are you implying? I just want a test, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask, Mr. Belan, and I apologize if my question came across as presumptuous. It wasn’t my intention to imply anything at all about your relationship. The reason I ask about risk factors is simply because understanding them helps us interpret the test results accurately and provide the most appropriate follow-up care, if needed. It’s standard medical practice to gather this information, even for a routine test. It’s not about judgment; it’s about providing the best possible care. For example, even with a committed relationship, we consider factors like any previous exposure to blood transfusions, or if either of you have ever shared needles, though I understand those are unlikely scenarios. Or if you’ve ever had any sexually transmitted infections in the past. Would you be comfortable answering a few brief questions about that, or would you prefer to simply proceed with the test?
PATIENT: Look, I understand it's "standard practice," but honestly, it feels a bit… insulting. My wife and I are very careful. And I find the implication that we would engage in risky behavior quite offensive. I'm here for a test, not a lecture on safe practices or a character assessment. Just… do the test. I'll fill out whatever forms you need about my medical history, but I'm not going to detail my personal life.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to set those boundaries, Mr. Belan, and I apologize again if I’ve made you uncomfortable. I respect your privacy and will absolutely proceed with the test without delving further into your personal history. My intention was not to offend, and I understand your frustration. I will have the nurse bring in the necessary forms for your medical history. We'll need that information for our records and to ensure there aren’t any contraindications to the test. Before we get to that, are you aware of any allergies to latex or any other medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. None at all. And please, just the test. I really don't have time for this. Is it just a blood test? Because honestly, I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is just a blood test, Mr. Belan. And I understand your aversion to needles – many people feel the same way. We can try to make it as quick and painless as possible. The nurse is very skilled, and we can use a smaller gauge needle if that would help. She’ll also explain the procedure to you in detail before drawing the blood. It’s a standard venipuncture – a simple blood draw from your arm. The results typically take about 20-30 minutes to come back, and we’ll discuss them with you as soon as they’re available. Let me just quickly confirm your date of birth and insurance information to ensure we have everything correct before the nurse comes in. Could you please verify that for me?
PATIENT: Fine. August 14th, 1993. And I have Medicare. Number… uh… Here. Don't lose it. And really, please hurry. I have appointments to get to.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Belan. August 14th, 1993, and Medicare confirmed. I appreciate your patience. I'll let the nurse know you’re ready, and she’ll be in shortly with the necessary supplies. She’ll also review the consent form with you. While we wait, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing at all. Just the test, please. I’m wasting my time here as it is.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. I understand. I'll notify the nurse immediately. She will be with you as quickly as possible. Thank you for choosing our clinic today. "Nurse Patel, could you please come to exam room three when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Finally.
DOCTOR: "Good afternoon, Mr. Belan. Dr. Solero has explained you're here for an HIV test. I’m Nurse Patel, and I’ll be assisting you today. Before we proceed, I just need to review this consent form with you and confirm a few details. Are you ready to begin?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. I've read consent forms before. It’s all just legal jargon, isn't it? Just tell me where to sign.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Belan. It is a lot of medical and legal terminology. However, it's important to ensure you understand the procedure, potential risks and benefits, and your rights as a patient. I'm happy to briefly explain the key points, if you'd like. It outlines the confidentiality of your results, the testing process itself, and what follow-up care would entail should the results be positive. If you're truly comfortable, we can proceed without a detailed explanation, but I do need to witness your signature to confirm you've acknowledged the form. Would you prefer I quickly highlight the most important sections for you?
PATIENT: Look, I'm a busy man. I trust Dr. Solero, and I trust this clinic. Just… give me the pen. I’ll sign it. Just don't expect me to read every single line. There. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Mr. Belan. I appreciate your trust. Okay. If you could just roll up your sleeve, please. I’m going to clean the area with an alcohol swab first. It will feel a little cold. Just try to relax your arm, and I’ll get this done as quickly and painlessly as possible. It shouldn't take more than a few seconds. Do you have a preference for which arm?
PATIENT: Left arm is fine. Honestly, the less talking, the better. Just get it over with. I really don't like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just a quick pinch… Just breathe deeply… almost done… There you go. All finished. Just keep pressure on that for a few minutes, and avoid heavy lifting with that arm for a bit. The results should be available in about 20-30 minutes. Dr. Solero will come in and discuss them with you as soon as they're ready. Is there anything else I can get for you while you wait?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just let me know when the doctor is ready. And honestly, try to find me a magazine or something. Anything to distract me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Belan. I'll see what magazines we have available. I understand your discomfort, and I'll let Dr. Solero know you're waiting. Here you are. Hopefully, these will help pass the time. Just let me know if you need anything at all.
