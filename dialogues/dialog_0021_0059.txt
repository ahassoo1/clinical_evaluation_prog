DOCTOR: Alright, Adyn, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Adyn Swaby. It's… nice to meet you, Doctor. Though, I confess, I don't quite recall how I arrived here today. It all feels a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Not a sharp memory, you understand. Just… a general awareness of being here. And that I’m supposed to discuss… my speech, I believe? It feels a bit strange, trying to explain something I can’t properly remember experiencing, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. Your chart does mention some concerns about your speech. And a… vague history. Honestly, these records aren’t always the most helpful. So, let's start with what is bothering you now. What specifically makes you think there’s something wrong with your speech?
PATIENT: Well, it's difficult to say precisely. My husband… he mentioned it. He said I wasn’t speaking as clearly as usual. Something about… slurring words, I think? I haven’t really noticed it myself, to be honest. Everything feels normal to me, but I trust his judgement. He has a very good ear. It just… started happening recently, I suppose. Within the last week or so.
DOCTOR: Within the last week. Alright. And has this been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, I believe it’s more noticeable when I’m tired. Or… stressed, perhaps? It’s hard to pinpoint. There have been times when I feel perfectly fine, and then other times… like earlier today, I felt a little… clumsy with my words. It doesn’t happen all the time, certainly. I wish I could be more specific, Doctor. It’s frustrating not being able to remember clearly.
DOCTOR: Right, well, these things happen. It's not uncommon for symptoms to fluctuate. Let's try to rule out some simple causes. Are you getting enough sleep?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. Honestly, probably not as much as I should. Work has been quite demanding lately. Construction management… it’s a lot of early mornings and long days. My husband tries to encourage me to rest, but there's always something that needs attention. I suppose I prioritize everything else before myself, if I'm being truthful.
DOCTOR: Construction work… stressful. Alright. And what about caffeine intake?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, quite a bit, I suppose. Coffee, mostly. It’s practically a requirement on the job site, if you know what I mean. Keeps me alert, helps me focus. Maybe two or three cups a day, sometimes more when I’m particularly busy. Though, I haven’t changed my routine recently, so I don't think that's the cause. It's been pretty consistent for a while now.
DOCTOR: Consistent. Okay. Now, let's move on. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness…? No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any trouble lifting things at work, or walking around. Everything feels… normal in that regard. Though, like I said, my memory isn't the best. Perhaps I've overlooked something? It's possible, I suppose. It's just… I haven’t consciously noticed any weakness.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have felt a bit lightheaded a few times recently. Not constantly, but… a fleeting sensation, like I might stumble. It usually passes quickly, but it’s… unsettling. It usually happens when I stand up too quickly, I think. Is that… significant, Doctor? I apologize for being so vague. It's difficult to recall specific details.
DOCTOR: Dizziness upon standing. Okay. And have you had any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, occasionally. Not severe ones, usually more of a dull ache. They come and go, and I usually just take some over-the-counter pain relief, and they disappear. I wouldn't say they're frequent or debilitating. They haven't been particularly bothersome, to be honest. Just… a minor inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of… minor issues. Fatigue, dizziness, occasional headaches… It could be a number of things, honestly. Probably just stress. But we should rule out anything serious. I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, just to be safe. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. That sounds… sensible. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, go ahead. I’ll do my best to follow your finger. Is there anything else I should be aware of before we begin?
DOCTOR: Just relax and follow the pen. Don’t worry if it feels a bit strange. Follow the pen… keep your head still…
PATIENT: Yes, I’m following it. It’s… a bit difficult to focus, perhaps? My eyes feel slightly tired. But I’m trying my best. Is this alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that… alright? It feels a little… strained, perhaps? I apologize if it doesn’t look quite right.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Both hands, one at a time.
PATIENT: I’m trying to squeeze as tightly as I can. Is something… wrong? It feels like I’m not applying as much pressure as I should be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it’s difficult to say for certain, but these symptoms… weakness, slurred speech, dizziness… they could indicate a neurological issue. It's not necessarily anything serious, but we need to investigate further. I'm going to order a CT scan of your brain to rule out anything structural. And I want you to see a neurologist as soon as possible. Do you have a primary care physician I can contact?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? That sounds… rather serious. A neurologist…? Yes, I do. Dr. Ainsworth. He’s… very good. His number is… I believe it’s 555-1234. Is… is there anything I should be particularly worried about? I confess, I'm feeling rather unsettled now. It’s all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Dr. Ainsworth, alright. It's good you have a PCP. And no, don't panic. A CT scan is simply a precautionary measure. We're just trying to rule things out. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. I'm going to write you a referral to Dr. Ainsworth, and a requisition for the CT scan. Please schedule both appointments as soon as possible. And, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms—severe headache, weakness, difficulty speaking—go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. A referral to Dr. Ainsworth… and the CT scan. Schedule them as soon as possible… and go to the emergency room if things worsen. Thank you, Doctor. It’s… a lot to take in. But I appreciate you taking the time to examine me and explain everything. I will schedule the appointments right away. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave?
