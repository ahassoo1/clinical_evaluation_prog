DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you too. I requested a general wellness panel, if you recall. Just wanting to get a good look at how things are holding up, you understand. At my age, one likes to be… thorough.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Mombrun. I do recall. A wellness panel is an excellent idea. It’s very proactive of you to want to stay on top of your health. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, truthfully, I’ve been quite fortunate. I’ve always been a strong man, worked construction my whole life – keeps you moving, you know? No major illnesses to speak of. A few aches and pains here and there, as one would expect, but nothing that slows me down too much. I’m married, happily so, and we try to eat well. Mostly home cooking. Is there anything in particular you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. Staying active certainly makes a difference. And a strong marriage and good diet are excellent foundations for good health. Let's delve a little deeper. Have you had any significant medical issues in the past – anything that required hospitalization or a long course of treatment?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No hospitalizations, no. Not for anything significant. Years ago, maybe forty years back now, I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia. Spent a week in bed with it, but recovered fully. Aside from that… a broken wrist when I was a young man, working on a roofing job. But that healed cleanly, and I don’t recall any lasting effects. Does that cover what you're asking, Doctor? I have a rather good memory for these things, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Mombrun. Pneumonia is serious, but it sounds like you recovered well. And a broken wrist is not usually a major long-term concern. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Never needed any. I’ve always prided myself on taking care of myself, avoiding unnecessary risks. Knock on wood, I’ve managed to avoid the operating table all these years. I'm a bit old-fashioned, you see. I believe the body is quite resilient, and sometimes, time and rest are the best medicine.
DOCTOR: I agree, Mr. Mombrun, preventative care and allowing the body to heal naturally are very important. Let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that your relatives have been affected by?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the family history. My mother, God rest her soul, she suffered from high blood pressure towards the end of her life. And my father… he had some issues with his heart, I believe. Nothing diagnosed specifically as a disease, but he tired easily and couldn’t do much walking in his later years. On my wife’s side, her grandfather had diabetes, I recall. That's about all the serious illnesses I can think of, truthfully. We weren't a family that talked a great deal about these things, you understand. More focused on living each day.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mr. Mombrun. High blood pressure and a family history of heart issues are things we'll definitely keep in mind. Diabetes as well. Now, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As I mentioned, I'm retired from construction now, but I keep myself busy. I enjoy gardening – tomatoes, peppers, a little bit of everything. My wife and I take a walk most mornings, weather permitting, usually about a mile. We eat a fairly balanced diet, mostly home-cooked meals. I enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning, and perhaps a glass of wine with dinner. Nothing excessive, you understand. I don’t smoke, never have, and I rarely drink hard liquor. I’d say I live a fairly active and healthy life for a man of my age. Are there any specific habits you’d like to know about?
DOCTOR: That sounds very good, Mr. Mombrun. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and moderate alcohol consumption – those are all excellent habits. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. Never had any allergic reactions to anything, as far as I’m aware. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times over the years for minor infections, but never had any trouble with them. And my wife is a very careful cook – she always makes sure to check ingredients and avoid anything that might cause a problem. I suppose you could say I’m a fairly sturdy constitution.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news, Mr. Mombrun. No known allergies simplifies things considerably. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just one thing, Doctor. I take a daily multivitamin – nothing fancy, just something to supplement my diet. And occasionally, when my joints are feeling a bit stiff, I’ll take an over-the-counter pain reliever, ibuprofen, I believe. But that’s only when needed, perhaps a couple of times a month. Otherwise, no, nothing else at all. I prefer to rely on a good night’s sleep and a bit of gentle exercise to keep me going.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Mombrun, that gives me a very good overview of your health history. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly alright. Proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment implicitly. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I'm accustomed to a bit of poking and prodding, you see, with annual check-ups and such.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the table, and we’ll get started. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82, which is slightly elevated, but not critically high. We'll keep an eye on that. Your pulse is 76 beats per minute, regular and strong. Your lungs sound clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Your ears are clear. Your nose looks good. Your throat is clear as well. No signs of infection. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits for a man of your age, with the slightly elevated blood pressure being the only notable finding. It's something we can monitor and discuss further. Now, I'd like to order a comprehensive wellness panel, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. This will give us a more detailed picture of your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds very sensible, Doctor. A more detailed picture is always a good idea. The slightly elevated blood pressure doesn’t particularly worry me, but it’s wise to keep an eye on it, as you say. Yes, please, proceed with the comprehensive panel. I trust your judgment entirely. Just let me know what I need to do next – fasting required, perhaps? Or any other preparations?
DOCTOR: Yes, a 12-hour fast is required before the blood draw. Please don’t eat or drink anything other than water for 12 hours before your appointment. You can continue to take your multivitamin as usual. I’m sending the lab order to the front desk now. They’ll schedule a blood draw for you. We'll receive the results in about a week. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s very clear. Twelve-hour fast, no problem. I can certainly manage that. I don't foresee any difficulties. And no, I don’t believe I have any questions at the moment. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything quite clearly. I appreciate your attention to detail and your patient manner. It puts me at ease, you understand. Just let me know if anything unexpected comes up.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. That’s my job. I’m glad I could put you at ease. If anything does come up, or if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’ll see you in about a week to discuss the results. Until then, take care of yourself, and continue to enjoy your gardening!
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you, Doctor. And thank you again for your excellent care. I certainly will, and I shall look forward to our follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and goodbye.
