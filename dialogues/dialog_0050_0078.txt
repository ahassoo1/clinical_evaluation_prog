DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a reset, or a jumpstart, as I was saying on the phone. I just don’t have the energy I used to, and it’s been going on for a while now. I’m not sure where to even begin, really.
DOCTOR: “Stuck,” you say. I understand. It’s good you’re acknowledging it, many patients delay seeking help. A “jumpstart” is an interesting way to put it. Let's try to unpack this a bit, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It's...difficult to explain. It’s not a specific illness, I don't feel sick, necessarily. Just…low. And everything feels harder than it should. I suppose I'm just hoping you can help me figure out what’s going on and how to feel like myself again. Is that…clear? I sometimes struggle to put things into words.
DOCTOR: It is clear, Ms. Pitzel, though a bit vague, naturally. It’s quite common for these things to be difficult to articulate. We'll get there. To help me understand a bit better, let's begin with the duration of this “low” feeling. Approximately how long have you been experiencing this lack of energy and increased difficulty with daily tasks?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Let me think. It hasn’t been sudden. It’s been…gradual. I would say, at least six months, maybe even longer. Possibly closer to a year, if I’m being honest. It started subtly, and I just…adjusted, I suppose. Now it’s just…noticeable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Pitzel. A gradual onset is quite common. And often, we do adjust and minimize things before realizing the extent of the problem. Now, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I am married, and my husband and I both work. I’m a…a molder, shaper, and caster. Not metal, though. Mostly ceramics, decorative things. I work from home, thankfully, so that’s a little easier. A typical day involves getting up, breakfast, working in my studio…it's a lot of standing, and using my hands, which is…tiring now. Then dinner, maybe some television, and bed. Weekends are similar, usually more studio work, sometimes a little gardening if the weather is good. Honestly, it’s not a bad life. Just…exhausting. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is quite helpful, thank you. Ceramics, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Mostly decorative pieces, vases, figurines, that sort of thing. I enjoy the creativity, but…the physical aspect is becoming difficult. It requires a lot of…fine motor skills, and stamina, and…well, frankly, I’m just not as strong as I used to be. It worries me, because it’s my livelihood.
DOCTOR: I see. Stamina and fine motor skills are important considerations. Let’s move on to other areas. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I haven’t been sleeping as well lately. It’s not that I can’t fall asleep, but I wake up frequently during the night. And I don’t always feel rested when I get up, even if I’ve been in bed for eight hours. It's…frustrating. My husband doesn't seem to notice anything, which is…odd. He’s a very sound sleeper.
DOCTOR: Frequent awakenings, despite adequate sleep duration. And your husband is oblivious, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, oblivious is probably the right word. He snores, you see. Quite loudly. He claims he sleeps like a log, and I’m hesitant to wake him to complain. It wouldn’t be fair. But it does mean I’m often…disturbed during the night. It’s not a major issue, but it’s contributing to the tiredness, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: I understand. A husband's snoring can certainly disrupt sleep architecture. Let’s broaden our scope slightly. Have you experienced any recent changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My appetite…hasn’t been great, to be honest. I don’t feel hungry as often as I used to. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, though I haven’t weighed myself recently. Probably five or ten pounds, if I had to guess. It’s not intentional, I assure you. I enjoy food, I just…don’t have the same enthusiasm for it. It’s difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss. Now, Ms. Pitzel, are you experiencing any difficulties with your mood?
PATIENT: That’s…a complicated question. I wouldn’t say I’m sad, not exactly. Just…less interested in things. Things that used to bring me joy, like my ceramics, don’t feel as rewarding anymore. And I find myself…irritable, I suppose. Easily frustrated. It's not a constant thing, but it's definitely noticeable. I don't enjoy socializing as much either, which is unusual for me. I feel…disconnected, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A loss of interest, increased irritability, and social withdrawal. These are all important observations. Now, to get a more complete picture, let's review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing major. I had a bout of bronchitis a few years ago, but I recovered fully. And I had a fairly standard pregnancy and delivery with my daughter, many years ago. Otherwise, I’ve been relatively healthy, thankfully. I do take a daily vitamin, and sometimes ibuprofen for aches and pains, but that’s about it. My Medicare covers my regular check-ups, so I try to stay on top of things.
DOCTOR: No significant medical history, just a vitamin supplement and occasional ibuprofen. Good. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I've always been lucky, in that regard. My husband, on the other hand…but that's a different story. He had his knee replaced a few years ago, but I’m not the one with the medical problems! Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pitzel, it does. And while your husband’s medical history is not directly relevant to your current complaint, thank you for clarifying. Now, let's move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or mental illness?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a difficult one. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandmother suffered from arthritis, quite badly. My father was healthy, as far as I know, but I didn’t know him well. On my husband’s side, there's a history of heart disease. His father died of a heart attack at a relatively young age. As for mental illness…not that I’m aware of. It wasn’t something we talked about much in my family. Does that help? It's a bit…sparse, honestly. We didn’t keep very good records.
DOCTOR: I understand. High blood pressure and a family history of heart disease. Finally, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. I’ll occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, but very rarely. And I’ve never been interested in recreational drugs. I’m a fairly…straightforward person, I suppose. I prefer a quiet evening at home with my husband to…anything else. Does that answer your question? I've always believed in moderation.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Pitzel. That provides a comprehensive overview. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination to gather some additional information. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly acceptable. I was expecting as much. Please, proceed when you're ready. I’ll do whatever I can to help.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, respiration rate is 16, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Finally, I’ll assess your thyroid gland. Thyroid is normal in size and consistency, no nodules. Physically, everything appears within normal limits. However, your symptoms are concerning enough to warrant some further investigation.
PATIENT: I see. That’s…reassuring, in a way, to hear that everything appears normal. But also…disappointing, I suppose, that there’s no obvious cause for how I’m feeling. What kind of investigation are you thinking of, Doctor? Do you think it could be something serious? I’m trying not to worry, but it’s difficult.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re not immediately alarmed, Ms. Pitzel. While a physical exam hasn’t revealed any glaring issues, that doesn’t necessarily rule out an underlying cause. Given your fatigue, decreased appetite, weight loss, and mood changes, I’d like to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, vitamin D level, and a sedimentation rate. These tests will help us assess your overall health, rule out any deficiencies, check your thyroid function, and screen for inflammation. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no objections at all. If it will help figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to have them done. What exactly does each test look for? I always like to understand things as much as possible. And where will I have these tests done? Will Medicare cover them? I have my card with me, if needed.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A complete blood count will assess your red and white blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit to rule out anemia or infection. A comprehensive metabolic panel will check your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. Thyroid stimulating hormone, as we discussed, will assess your thyroid function. Vitamin D level will determine if you have a deficiency, as low levels can cause fatigue and mood changes. And finally, a sedimentation rate will help us screen for inflammation in the body. These tests should provide a good baseline assessment. As for location, you can have these tests done at any LabCorp facility. Medicare should cover these tests, provided they are deemed medically necessary. I will include the appropriate codes on the order. Here is the lab order. Once you have had the tests done, the results will be sent to me, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds very thorough, and your explanations were very helpful. I think I understand everything perfectly. I’ll go to LabCorp as soon as possible and schedule the tests. How long does it usually take to get the results back? And is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any lifestyle changes you recommend? I just want to be proactive, if possible.
DOCTOR: Typically, the results should be available within 3-5 business days. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and prioritizing sleep. Avoid excessive stress, and make sure you’re staying hydrated. Perhaps you could also try keeping a daily journal to track your symptoms and identify any potential triggers. However, I don't want you to self-treat or make any drastic changes to your routine without discussing them with me first. We will review the results together, and then we can formulate a treatment plan based on your individual needs. Do you have any further questions, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you so much for your time and thoroughness. I feel much better knowing we have a plan in place. I’ll schedule the tests immediately. You’ve been very reassuring. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re most welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, we will work diligently to determine the cause of your symptoms. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
