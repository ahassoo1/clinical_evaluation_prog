DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Billman, it’s… a little thing. Not a real sickness, you understand. Just… I was hoping you could write me a card. A “Get Well” card, maybe? Or something… encouraging. My daughter, she… doesn’t always understand when I'm not feeling my best. She thinks I’m just… lazy. It’s very disrespectful. A card from you might help.
DOCTOR: A card, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A proper card. With a nice message. Something official. From a doctor. It carries weight, you see. She respects people with… qualifications. I’m a stationary engineer, a boilerman, a very important job, but she doesn’t seem to… appreciate it. It's always been like this, even before… well, never mind. A card would be good. Very good.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I’m a physician. I treat illnesses, injuries… medical conditions. I don’t typically write… motivational correspondence. Perhaps we could discuss why you’re not feeling your best?
PATIENT: Now, Doctor, with all due respect, you misunderstand. It is a medical condition! It’s… a lack of appreciation! It causes… stress! And stress, I assure you, is very bad for a man my age. A card isn’t about… feelings, it's about validation. It’s a… a doctor’s note for the soul. Don’t you see? It’s very simple. A few kind words… on official letterhead. It will fix everything.
DOCTOR: Let's take a look at your chart here… I see you had a check-up last year. Everything was… within normal limits then. But let's go through a quick review of systems, just to be thorough. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, the usual aches and pains of getting older, Doctor. Nothing a good card can’t fix. My knee bothers me sometimes, and my back… well, I work with boilers, you know? It’s a physical job. But that’s not the problem! The problem is… she doesn't believe me when I say I'm not feeling up to things. She thinks I’m exaggerating. A card… it would show her I’m not just making it up. A professional opinion. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, your weight is listed as 64 kilograms. Given your height of 187 centimeters, that puts you significantly underweight. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Underweight? Doctor, are you suggesting something is wrong with me? I eat perfectly well. Rice and beans, you know? Puerto Rican food! Very nutritious. It's just… she makes me nervous. When she starts questioning everything, I lose my appetite. It’s not a medical problem, it’s a… a daughter problem! The card would help me relax. Then I'd eat better. It’s all connected, you see? A simple card... can solve everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you're frustrated with your daughter, but attributing your lack of appetite and weight loss to a “daughter problem” isn't a medical diagnosis. Unexplained weight loss can be a symptom of many underlying conditions. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Doctor, you’re making a big deal out of nothing. I just want a card! A small kindness. I don’t want a… a battery of tests or whatever it is doctors do. I’m a perfectly healthy man! I work hard, I eat my rice and beans… it’s just… I need her to respect me. She thinks I’m… frail. Old. A card… it would prove her wrong. It would prove to her I'm still capable. That’s all I ask. Are you going to write the card, or do I need to find another doctor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I'm going to be direct with you. I am not going to write you a "get well" card. It’s not within the scope of medical practice, and frankly, it sounds like you might benefit from addressing some underlying emotional concerns. However, given your reported weight loss, I strongly recommend we run some basic blood tests to rule out any potential medical issues. Will you allow me to do that?
PATIENT: Blood tests?! You think I'm sick?! After all I've told you? It’s disrespectful, Doctor. Truly disrespectful. I came to you for a simple kindness, and you’re treating me like… like a hypochondriac! I've wasted my time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I am offering you legitimate medical care. Dismissing your concerns isn't my intent; it's my job to investigate potential health risks. If you decline, that is your right. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider, and I would be happy to provide you with a referral to a therapist if you would like to discuss your concerns with someone else.
