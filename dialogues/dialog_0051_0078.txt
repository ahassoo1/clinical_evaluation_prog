DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I feel…stuck. Like I need a little push to get back to feeling like myself again. I’m hoping you can help me with a sort of “reset,” if that makes sense. A jumpstart, perhaps? I’m not quite sure how to explain it, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling “stuck” is a very common complaint, actually. It can be frustrating when you don't quite feel like yourself. Let’s try to unpack that a bit. When did you start feeling this way, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It didn’t happen overnight, certainly. If I had to pinpoint… maybe the last six months or so? Things just seem to have… dulled. I used to have so much more energy, and I enjoyed my work so much more. Now… it feels like a chore, sometimes. It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Six months… okay. And can you tell me a little more about how things have dulled?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… a lot of things, I suppose. I’m tired, even when I’ve had enough sleep. I don't have the same interest in my crafting, you know, the molders and shaping work. It feels…pointless, even though I used to love it. And I find myself…irritated more easily. Small things bother me that wouldn't have before. My husband, Ricardo, says I haven’t been myself, and he’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, loss of interest in hobbies, and increased irritability… Those are all important things to note. And it's good you have Ricardo to share this with. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns, other than just feeling tired?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I eat normally, others I barely feel hungry. And my sleep… well, I can sleep, thankfully. But it’s not restful, you know? I wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluctuating appetite and non-restorative sleep… Thank you for sharing that. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms along with this, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. No aches or pains, no digestive issues, nothing like that. It’s mostly just… how I feel. Kind of a general… blah-ness, I suppose. I wouldn't say I’m sick, exactly, just… not right.
DOCTOR: “Blah-ness” is a perfectly good description, actually. It’s helpful to know. Now, just to get a more complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m on Medicare, as you can see from my paperwork. I don’t have any major health problems, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, and I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but nothing chronic. I don't take any regular medications, and I haven't had any surgeries. Ricardo worries about my blood pressure sometimes, but it's usually fine when the doctor checks it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic medical conditions, no current medications, no surgeries. And a history of childhood illnesses and a previous bout of pneumonia. Ricardo’s concern about your blood pressure is noted. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had… diabetes, I believe. And my father… he had heart problems, later in life. And, oh, my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had something with her nerves, I think. She was always forgetting things, and shaking. It wasn't Alzheimer’s, but something similar. It’s hard to say for sure, because we didn’t see them very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes, heart problems, and a possible neurological condition. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not at all. I don’t smoke, and I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any… recreational drugs. Ricardo and I both prefer a quiet evening at home.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And what do you do for work, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: As I mentioned earlier, I’m a molder, shaper, and caster. I mostly work with clay and stone, creating decorative items and sculptures. It keeps me busy, usually. Although, like I said, it hasn't been as enjoyable lately. It’s a trade I learned from my grandmother in Colombia, and it’s been in my family for generations.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a beautiful and meaningful profession. Okay, Ms. Pitzel, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a baseline and see if anything stands out. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 76 and regular. That's slightly elevated, but not terribly concerning given your recent stress. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiratory rate is 16, which is normal. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears appear normal, no signs of infection. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. No obvious neurological deficits noted. Thyroid is normal in size and consistency, no nodules felt. All right, Ms. Pitzel, everything seems physically normal at this point. Now, based on what you've told me and this initial exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, we need to rule out other potential causes first.
PATIENT: Depression? Well… that’s… concerning. I hadn’t really thought of it that way. I just thought I was… tired, and stressed. It's been a difficult year, with… things happening back home. But… I don’t feel sad, exactly. Just… empty. And unmotivated. What sort of things would we need to rule out, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid reaction, Ms. Pitzel. It’s common for depression to manifest differently in different people. It doesn’t always involve feeling profoundly sad. The emptiness and lack of motivation you’re describing are very common symptoms. To rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some basic blood work. This will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels—specifically Vitamin D and B12—and a complete blood count to look for any underlying infections or deficiencies. We should also check your glucose levels to rule out diabetes. It’s just a precaution, to make sure everything is as it should be. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any problems with blood draws?
PATIENT: No, no allergies, and I’m usually fine with blood draws. I’ve had them before, of course. It’s just… It’s just a bit unnerving, thinking something might actually be wrong. I always thought I was just… strong. And resilient. But if that’s what we need to do, then let’s do it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. It takes courage to acknowledge that you might need some help. And it’s important to remember that needing help doesn’t mean you’re weak. It means you’re taking care of yourself. Okay, I’ll have the nurse draw the blood samples now. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I’d like to ask you a few questions from a standardized questionnaire, if you’re willing. It’s called the PHQ-9, and it’s a quick way to assess the severity of your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. A questionnaire sounds… reasonable. Anything that might help, Doctor. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. This is just a series of questions about how you’ve been feeling over the past two weeks. There are no right or wrong answers, just be honest. It's confidential, of course. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Here you are. It’s… not a cheerful read, I must say.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Pitzel. This is very helpful. Based on your responses, it does appear that you are experiencing moderate symptoms of depression. It's not a diagnosis on its own, but it provides further evidence for what we've already discussed. Now, I want to be clear. Depression is a treatable condition. There are several options available, including therapy, medication, or a combination of both. We can discuss what might be the best fit for you. Before we go into those options, do you have any questions about depression itself, or anything we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: Therapy… I’ve never really considered therapy before. It feels…private. And a little embarrassing, to talk about my feelings with a stranger. What kind of therapy are you thinking? And what about medication? I’ve heard…stories. About side effects, and… becoming dependent. I’m not sure I want to take pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid questions and concerns, Ms. Pitzel. It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about therapy and medication. Let's address them one by one. There are many different types of therapy, but the most common and effective for depression is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT. It focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It’s a very practical approach, and it’s typically time-limited, meaning it doesn't go on indefinitely. You wouldn’t be sharing deeply personal secrets with a stranger, but rather working collaboratively to develop coping strategies. As for medication, the medications we use for depression, called antidepressants, are not like addictive substances. They work by balancing chemicals in the brain, and they’re not intended to be a lifelong solution. There are potential side effects, as with any medication, but they’re often mild and manageable. We would start with a low dose and monitor you closely to ensure it’s the right fit. We wouldn't rush into anything. We can explore therapy first, if that's what you prefer. Or we can discuss medication further and weigh the risks and benefits. The goal is to find a solution that works for you. Do either of those options sound more appealing at this point?
PATIENT: Therapy… I suppose it sounds less frightening than medication. But I’m not sure where to even start looking for a therapist. And I worry about… it not working. Wasting my time and money, and still feeling the same way. Is there anything else we could try? Before resorting to those things? Perhaps… some kind of lifestyle change? I’ve heard exercise can help.
DOCTOR: Those are very reasonable concerns, Ms. Pitzel. It’s perfectly valid to want to try less invasive approaches first, and you're right, exercise can be very helpful. In fact, it's often recommended as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. We can absolutely start with lifestyle changes. I recommend incorporating at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. It could be something you enjoy – walking, swimming, dancing, gardening… anything that gets your heart rate up. We can also focus on improving your sleep hygiene – establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed. And paying attention to your diet – eating a healthy, balanced diet can also have a positive impact on your mood. I can provide you with some resources on those things. We'll check in in a few weeks to see how you're doing. If you don't see any improvement, we can revisit the options of therapy and medication. And, if you do decide you want to explore therapy, I can give you a list of qualified therapists in the area. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better. Less overwhelming, certainly. I can try that. I used to enjoy gardening, actually. Perhaps I’ll start with that. And I’ll try to get more sleep. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you not pushing me into anything I’m not comfortable with. I think I can manage that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad we could come up with a plan you feel comfortable with. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood work, just to rule out any underlying medical causes. And I’ll give you some resources on gardening, sleep hygiene, and local therapists. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Glazewski. I feel much better just having talked about it. I’ll see you in a few weeks, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad you feel a little better. Remember to be kind to yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before our next appointment. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day, Ms. Pitzel. .
