DOCTOR: Right, Kahrin Kovtun. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Results discussion, right? I’m pretty sure that’s all I need to go over. I don’t have a lot of time, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, the results. Though, a proper consultation requires a bit more than just the numbers, you understand. But, alright. We can be efficient. I have them here... now, you’re aware these were comprehensive blood tests, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, I remember. Everything felt pretty standard when the nurse took them. Honestly, I just want to know if anything’s…wrong. Is there anything I need to worry about? And if so, what exactly?
DOCTOR: Well, “wrong” is a rather broad term. Your complete blood count was within normal limits, which is good. However, your vitamin D level is quite low – significantly below the optimal range. And your TSH… well, that’s a bit elevated. It’s not drastically so, but it warrants further discussion. Do you have any family history of thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Thyroid… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, I think. She was always cold, and tired. She had a doctor, but I never really knew what was wrong with her, specifically. Does that matter? And what does low vitamin D even mean? I spend a fair amount of time outside, so that’s surprising.
DOCTOR: It matters, yes. Family history is relevant. Low vitamin D… it’s surprisingly common, even with sun exposure. Factors like skin pigmentation, sunscreen use, and even the time of day can affect your body's ability to synthesize it. Symptoms can be vague – fatigue, muscle weakness, even mood changes. But more concerningly, prolonged deficiency can contribute to bone health issues. As for the TSH…that's a thyroid stimulating hormone. An elevated level suggests your thyroid gland might be underperforming. It's not a definitive diagnosis, mind you, but it certainly warrants investigation. Have you been experiencing any unexplained weight gain, dry skin, constipation, or feeling particularly cold, even when others aren’t?
PATIENT: Hmm. Weight… maybe a little, but I haven’t been tracking. Constipation, sometimes, yeah, that’s pretty normal for me, actually. And I am always cold. Even in Tahiti, sometimes! Everyone makes fun of me for wearing a sweater. But… is that enough to be worried about? It just sounds like…me.
DOCTOR: It could be nothing, of course. But those symptoms, combined with the family history and the elevated TSH, raise a flag. We can't dismiss it out of hand. Now, before we jump to any conclusions – and frankly, a full diagnosis requires more than just a conversation – I'd like to order some additional thyroid antibody tests. These will help us determine if there's an autoimmune component at play – Hashimoto's thyroiditis, for instance. I'll also repeat the vitamin D test, just to confirm the initial results. Would you be willing to allow me to order those tests?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, sure. Whatever you think is best. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… commitments. And I guess finding out is better than just… ignoring it. What does all that cost, though? I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: Right. The cost… that is a valid concern. The thyroid antibody panel will be approximately £120, and the repeat vitamin D test is around £30. That's a total of £150. Unfortunately, lab costs are fixed. We do offer a limited payment plan, if that would be helpful. We can discuss that with the front office staff. Now, if you approve the tests, we'll need to draw another blood sample. Are you able to do that today, or would you prefer to schedule an appointment?
PATIENT: £150… okay. That’s… a lot. I can probably manage it, I guess. Let’s just get the blood drawn now, if possible. The quicker, the better. Do I need to fast or anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, you do need to fast for at least eight hours prior to the blood draw. No food or sugary drinks, water is fine. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the right. The nurse will explain the procedure. Once the results are back – usually within three to five business days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Eight hours. Got it. Thanks. I'll go get that done. .
DOCTOR: Right. Have a good day. .
