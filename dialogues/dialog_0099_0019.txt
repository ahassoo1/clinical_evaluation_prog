DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah… yes. My wife… she want… baby. We old now, you know? She think… maybe need help? I not so sure what help is, but she say… come see doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. Your wife is hoping to become pregnant. And you're here because… she suggested it?
PATIENT: Yes. She very… strong woman. She say… time running out. I… I happy for baby, of course. But… is good idea? We… both a little tired these days. Maybe too old. I don't know much about… making babies at our age.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Carlotta, it is unusual for a couple your age to be considering starting a family. Let’s start with some basics. How old are you and your wife, exactly?
PATIENT: Let me see… I am… seventy. Yes, seventy this year. And my wife… she is sixty-five, I think. Maybe sixty-six? She remember better than me, honestly. She always does.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you two had children previously?
PATIENT: No. Never. We… we were busy. With work, and… life. We always say… later. But… later become now. And now… maybe too late.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are either of you currently experiencing any health problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… I have the… aches. Old man aches, you know? Back and knees. And sometimes… forget things. Like… what I was saying. My wife… she has a little trouble with her heart. But she take the pills. Doctor say… keep it under control. She very strong, like I said.
DOCTOR: And what medications is your wife currently taking for her heart condition?
PATIENT: Ah… that’s a good question. She has many pills. Little white ones, and… blue ones, I think. She take them every morning. I not so good with the names. She handle all of that. She know the doctor very well. Maybe… ask her? I don't want to say the wrong thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s important for me to know exactly what medications she’s on, Mr. Carlotta. Can you perhaps describe the bottles?
PATIENT: They are… small bottles. White plastic. One is… round, and one is… square. The white one has a… blue cap, I think. And the square one... maybe red. They are in a little bag in the kitchen. She keeps them all organized. I really don't pay much attention. I am sorry.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, with all due respect, it’s crucial that I have accurate information about your wife’s medical history and medications. It is simply not sufficient to say "many pills" and describe the bottles vaguely. This is particularly important given your wife’s age and the potential complications associated with pregnancy. Do you recall the name of her cardiologist?
PATIENT: Oh dear. You are right. I am sorry. I should know these things. Her doctor… hmm… Dr. Ramirez, I think? Yes, Dr. Ramirez. She is very nice. But… I only see her when my wife takes me with her. I don’t really… talk to her. My wife does all the talking. She is very organized, like I said. I… I don’t want to cause trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mr. Carlotta, I understand your wife is very capable. However, to even begin to discuss the possibility of pregnancy, I need to have a complete understanding of her medical history. I am going to need you to obtain a detailed list of all of her medications, including dosages, and the name and contact information for her cardiologist, Dr. Ramirez. I also need to review her medical records. Without that information, I cannot provide any meaningful guidance. Do you think you can do that?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I can try. It will be difficult. She doesn't like me messing with her things. But… for the baby… I will try. I promise. I will ask her very nicely. And I will write everything down. Very carefully.
DOCTOR: Good. In the meantime, I’m going to conduct a brief physical exam to get a baseline assessment of your health. Please lie down on the examination table. And, Mr. Carlotta… please understand that given your ages, attempting to conceive naturally may not be advisable. We’ll need to explore all options, and proceed with extreme caution. Let's start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. I will do my best. I understand. Old man… need to be careful. Please… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Blood pressure is a little high, but not unexpected given your age. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds… a mild murmur present. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Alright. Everything seems relatively normal, but these findings don’t negate the need for a thorough review of your wife’s medical history and records. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Not that I know of. My wife always makes sure I don't take anything I shouldn't. She's very careful. But… sometimes, when I eat… shellfish, maybe? I get a little… itchy. But it’s not very bad. I just don’t eat much shellfish anymore. It's safer that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a little pill for my… water. You know? For the prostate. Old man problem. My wife gets it for me. I don't remember the name. It’s small, blue. I take it every night. That’s all. Just the blue pill and the water pill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. We’ve covered a lot of ground, but it’s still not enough. Before we can even begin to discuss the feasibility of your wife becoming pregnant, I need those medical records and a detailed list of her medications. And you need to clarify the name of your prostate medication. I’m going to give you a referral slip to Dr. Ramirez’s office and a form to sign for medical records release. Please bring those back to me as soon as possible. Until then, I cannot offer any further advice. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh dear. So many papers. I will try my best. My wife… she will not be happy about me messing with her things. But… for the baby… I will try. No… I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… I hope it’s not too late. Thank you, doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. As I said, bring those records back as soon as possible. And Mr. Carlotta… please understand that at your ages, there are significant risks involved with pregnancy. We need to be realistic. You can go now.
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I understand. Realistic. Thank you, doctor. I will try my best.
