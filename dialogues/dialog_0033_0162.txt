DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Kristofik, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I don’t have a lot of time. My gut’s been… puffy. Bloated. It’s uncomfortable, alright? I just want to know what’s causing it and how to fix it. Don't need a whole song and dance, just the facts.
DOCTOR: “Puffy” and “bloated.” Right. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Kristofik?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't keep good track of dates. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. It’s just… annoying, you know? Like I ate too much, even when I haven’t. Is that making sense? I don’t even know why I’m here wasting time explaining this. I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: So, intermittent bloating for a few weeks. And you haven’t noticed anything specific that triggers it, or makes it worse?
PATIENT: Specific? Look, I eat…food. Sometimes it’s good, sometimes it’s not. I work construction, I don’t sit around analyzing every bean I put in my mouth. No, I haven’t noticed anything specific. Maybe…stress? It's been a rough year, if you must know. Lost my wife last year. But I'm a grown man, doc. I handle it. It shouldn’t be messing with my stomach.
DOCTOR: Right. Stress can certainly…manifest. And any changes in your bowel habits alongside this bloating?
PATIENT: Habits? What do you mean, “habits”? I go to the bathroom when I need to, alright? Is this a trick question? Look, I'm not gonna sit here and… detail my bathroom routine to you. It's been normal, as normal as it can be, considering. Just get to the point, doc. What’s causing the puffiness and what can I do about it? I've got a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try to be systematic. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation with this…puffiness?
PATIENT: Nausea? No. Vomiting? Absolutely not. Diarrhea… sometimes. Constipation… also sometimes. It goes back and forth, okay? It's a mess, that's the point! Look, I’m telling you, it’s just…my stomach feels wrong. It's bloated and sometimes runny, sometimes stuck. Is that enough detail for you? Honestly, I don’t even know why I bother. I just need something to make it stop. I don't need a PhD in digestion, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. And any fever, chills, weight loss, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Look, doc, are you just trying to get a list of every possible illness? No fever, no chills. Weight loss? Maybe a little, but I'm a hard worker, I burn calories. And no, no blood in… anything. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m a pile driver operator, not a… a patient in a soap opera. Just tell me what you think is wrong and what I can take for it. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history, it could be a number of things. Irritable bowel syndrome is a possibility, or it could be related to dietary factors, stress, or even a mild infection. Let's do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Examine? Look, I already told you everything I know. What’s poking and prodding gonna do? I’m a perfectly healthy man, just with a sensitive stomach. I really don't have time for this, doc. But fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m listening and feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. You're a little tender in the lower abdomen, which isn't surprising given your symptoms. I don’t feel anything concerningly large, but it is difficult to assess fully without further testing. No rebound tenderness or guarding. I'm going to order some basic blood work to rule out any infection or inflammation and a stool sample to check for parasites or bacteria.
PATIENT: Tests? You're gonna stick needles in me and I gotta… collect a sample? Seriously? Look, I really don't like this. Is this absolutely necessary? Can’t you just give me something to calm my stomach down? I’ve got a job to do, doc. A family to support. These tests sound like a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration. However, I can’t simply prescribe medication without knowing what we're treating. These tests are necessary to rule out anything serious and get an accurate diagnosis. It’s standard procedure. A blood draw and stool sample are relatively quick and painless. The lab results will help me determine the best course of action. I can write you a prescription for an antacid for symptomatic relief in the meantime, but that won’t address the underlying issue. Would you like that?
