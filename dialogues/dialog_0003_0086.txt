DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Kovtun. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s try to be efficient, shall we?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. Results, right? Let’s just get to it, if you don’t mind. I’ve got a pretty tight schedule today.
DOCTOR: Quite alright. Though, a proper consultation does require some information from you initially. But, very well. You’re here regarding the results… from what testing, precisely?
PATIENT: The blood work. You know, the usual stuff? Cholesterol, vitamins… everything they took at the clinic last week. I remember filling out a very long form. Is there a specific one you need me to recall?
DOCTOR: “The usual stuff” isn’t particularly helpful, Ms. Kovtun. While I appreciate your… brevity, my recollection isn’t what it once was. Let’s focus. Do you recall why you requested those tests?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Fine. I was feeling really tired all the time, and kinda weak. My aunt suggested getting checked for vitamin deficiencies. And I guess cholesterol just seemed like a good idea while they were already poking around with a needle. Does that help? I really don’t remember all the little boxes on that form.
DOCTOR: Yes, that narrows it down marginally. Fatigue and weakness… quite common complaints. The results are here. Your cholesterol is… acceptable. Borderline elevated, but not alarming. Your vitamin D is low, as is B12. Frankly, not surprising given your… location. Rural areas often see these deficiencies.
PATIENT: Okay, so…low vitamins. What does that mean exactly? Do I need…shots or something? I’m really not a fan of needles, if you haven’t guessed.
DOCTOR: It means your body isn't receiving adequate nutrients, Ms. Kovtun. Which contributes to the fatigue, naturally. As for “shots,” that is one option. B12 can be administered that way, yes, if absorption is an issue. However, we can also explore oral supplementation. We’ll start with a high-dose oral B12 and a Vitamin D supplement. But frankly, I suspect a poor diet is the core issue. Do you maintain a… sensible dietary regimen?
PATIENT: Sensible? Look, I eat. I work long hours, logistics isn't exactly a nine-to-five, so I grab whatever’s quick. Canned tuna, sometimes frozen meals… I don’t have time to be a chef. I'm not exactly a nutrition expert, if that’s what you’re asking. Is this going to be a lecture? Because I really don't have time for that.
DOCTOR: A lecture is unnecessary, Ms. Kovtun. Though, a degree of lifestyle modification is often required to address these deficiencies. Very well. I’ll write you a prescription for a combined Vitamin B12 and D supplement. High dose. Take one daily with food. We'll recheck your levels in three months. If there’s no improvement, then we discuss other avenues. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. Just… a busy schedule. So, I take these pills for three months, then come back? Is that it? And they don’t need a special diet or anything? I really need to get back to work, I have shipments to track.
DOCTOR: The pills alone are unlikely to solve the problem entirely, Ms. Kovtun. But yes, take one daily, as directed. And try to incorporate more nutrient-rich foods into your diet. Leafy greens, fish… items that aren't exclusively sourced from a can. Here is your prescription. Three months. We'll see if there’s any measurable improvement. Do you have any further questions, or can we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just the pills. Okay, great. Three months. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you not keeping me all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. And Ms. Kovtun, a final piece of advice – prioritize preventative care. A proactive approach is infinitely more efficient than reactive treatment. Good day. .
