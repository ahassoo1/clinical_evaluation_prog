DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you. Well, it’s about a… rather enthusiastic dietary experiment I’ve been undertaking. Perhaps “experiment” is too kind a word. My daughter suggested I come speak with someone before I… well, before things go any further. It’s all rather silly, really, but she worries.
DOCTOR: An enthusiastic dietary experiment?
PATIENT: Indeed. A friend – a rather young, energetic fellow, always chasing the latest trends – convinced me to try what he calls a “moon water cleanse.” It involves… well, quite a lot of water charged under the full moon, and very little else for three days. I’m on day two, and frankly, I feel… remarkably depleted. And slightly ridiculous. I confess, I haven’t felt this lightheaded since university. Though that was due to different circumstances entirely, naturally.
DOCTOR: A moon water cleanse… right. And you've been consuming only this moon water for the past two days?
PATIENT: Precisely. Well, not only… I allowed myself a single grape yesterday. My daughter would have been most displeased had I gone entirely without sustenance. A small concession to common sense, you understand. But yes, predominantly moon water. He assures me it’s incredibly detoxifying, aligning one with lunar energies and all that. I’m a special effects artist, Doctor, not a mystic. I deal with practical illusions, not… this. It seemed a harmless bit of fun at the time. Though now, I’m not so certain.
DOCTOR: I see. And you’ve noticed… what specific symptoms, besides the lightheadedness?
PATIENT: Well, the lightheadedness is the most prominent, naturally. And a rather persistent headache, a dull throb behind the eyes. I’ve also found myself… unusually irritable. My housekeeper nearly received a dressing-down over the placement of a rather insignificant vase this morning. I apologized immediately, of course, but it wasn’t my finest moment. And, if I’m being entirely honest, I'm terribly cold. Not shivering, just… perpetually chilled. I’ve had to resort to a cardigan indoors, and it’s August! A most unusual occurrence.
DOCTOR: Headache, irritability, chills… Alright. Have you had any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in your urination?
PATIENT: No, thankfully nothing quite so… dramatic. No nausea, no vomiting. My digestive system remains, shall we say, stubbornly functional, though somewhat… empty. And my urination is, well, perfectly normal, albeit frequent. One does drink a great deal of water, you see. It's the one aspect of this cleanse that actually feels… sensible. Although, as I said, the rest of it feels entirely unfounded. I feel rather foolish admitting all this to a doctor, I must say. A grown man, worried about the effects of… moon water.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, while I appreciate your… candor, it's my job to assess your health, regardless of the source of your discomfort. Let’s move on to some basics. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor, quite right. No complaints at all. As for medical conditions… let me see. I had a rather nasty bout of influenza some twenty years ago, but made a full recovery. And my knees occasionally complain, a common ailment for someone of my… vintage, I suspect. I’ve been told I have slightly elevated cholesterol, but it's never required any intervention. Otherwise, remarkably healthy for my age, I believe. I’ve always been careful with my diet, until this… recent lapse, naturally. I do enjoy a good brandy now and then, but moderation is key, you understand.
DOCTOR: Influenza twenty years ago, slightly elevated cholesterol, occasional knee pain… Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never required one, thankfully. I've always been rather fortunate in that regard. I broke my arm as a boy – fell from a rather ambitious tree – but it healed perfectly well without any intervention. A simple plaster cast, that was all. I’ve always prided myself on my physical resilience, despite my… somewhat eccentric habits. Although, this moon water cleanse is certainly testing that resilience. I daresay my daughter will be most smug when she hears how this has transpired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Not a single pill. I’ve always been a firm believer in natural remedies, a good night’s sleep, and a healthy constitution. Though, admittedly, those principles are somewhat undermined by my current… dietary predicament. I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for my knees, if they're particularly troublesome, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. Just a small indulgence when necessary. I find a warm bath is often just as effective, to be honest. Much kinder to the system.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Remarkably free of them, I believe. I’ve been stung by a bee once or twice, but suffered no ill effects beyond the usual discomfort. I enjoy a wide variety of foods, though admittedly my current selection is rather limited. I used to be quite fond of shellfish, but haven’t indulged in a while. My daughter frowns upon it, something about mercury levels, I believe. Perfectly sensible, of course, but one misses a good lobster now and then. It’s a small price to pay for maintaining domestic harmony, I suppose. Although, at this point, I’m beginning to suspect I'd trade a lifetime of lobster for a simple sandwich.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. I’m going to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just to get a baseline. After that, we can discuss what’s going on and formulate a plan. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Quite sensible, indeed. I confess, I’m rather relieved to be taking a practical step. This whole situation feels… rather unscientific, and I’m a man who appreciates a good, solid diagnosis. Please proceed. I assure you, I’m quite accustomed to having my vital signs monitored, though usually in the context of special effects work, not… lunar detoxifications. But, as you say, a practical step is most welcome. Do let me know if I need to remove my jacket.
DOCTOR: No, your jacket is fine for now. Alright, just relax your arm for me… Blood pressure is a little low, 108/65. Pulse is 72, a bit on the slower side, but not concerning. Temperature is normal, 98.6. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but breathing seems a little shallow… You do seem slightly dehydrated, as expected. Overall, you appear generally healthy, but your vital signs suggest you’re not tolerating this… cleanse very well.
PATIENT: Indeed, Doctor, I daresay that's a rather generous assessment. "Not tolerating" is a remarkably diplomatic way of putting it. I feel remarkably… depleted, as I mentioned. Depleted and rather foolish. It seems my daughter’s concerns were… well-founded. So, what, in your professional opinion, would you recommend? A sensible meal, perhaps? And a stern lecture on the perils of extreme diets? I confess, I'm rather receptive to both at this point.
DOCTOR: Yes, a sensible meal is precisely what I was going to recommend. And perhaps we can avoid future "cleanses." Your body is clearly reacting negatively to this lack of nutrients and fluids. We need to rehydrate you and replenish your electrolytes. I’m going to order a basic blood panel to check your potassium and sodium levels, just to be safe. It's likely nothing serious, but it’s best to be thorough. Do you have anyone who can bring you a meal, or would you like me to write you a prescription for a nutrient shake?
PATIENT: That's remarkably sensible, Doctor, I appreciate your thoroughness. A blood panel sounds perfectly reasonable. And a meal would be most welcome. My housekeeper, Mrs. Higgins, is an excellent cook, and perfectly capable of preparing something nutritious. She’d likely take great delight in knowing I’ve abandoned this… folly. A nutrient shake, while practical, lacks the restorative power of a home-cooked meal, I believe. And Mrs. Higgins does make a rather splendid chicken soup. Perhaps you could suggest something specific? Something that would be particularly beneficial after… this ordeal? I confess, I’m rather looking forward to a simple roast chicken with potatoes. A traditional remedy, perhaps?
DOCTOR: A roast chicken with potatoes sounds excellent, Mr. Vantine. Focus on getting plenty of fluids with it – broth-based soups are ideal, as you mentioned. And potassium-rich vegetables like sweet potatoes and spinach would be beneficial. Avoid any strenuous activity for the next 24 hours, and just rest. I'll send the blood test orders to the lab now. And I’ll write a brief note to Mrs. Higgins with some suggestions, just to ensure you get a balanced meal. We can review the results in a few days and make sure everything is back on track. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Remarkably sensible, as always. I confess, I'm already feeling slightly more optimistic. The prospect of a roast chicken and a comfortable rest is remarkably restorative in itself. And I assure you, I will avoid any further "cleanses" or lunar-aligned dietary experiments. My daughter will be most relieved, and I daresay, smugly vindicated. Thank you for your professionalism, Doctor. You've rescued me from a rather foolish predicament. Please, let me know if there’s anything else I need to do. And do convey my gratitude to Mrs. Higgins for her forthcoming culinary intervention. It appears I owe her a rather substantial apology for my recent… eccentricity.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. And don’t worry about the apology to Mrs. Higgins – she seems like a very capable woman. Focus on getting some rest and rehydrating. I’ll have the lab results sent to me as soon as they’re available. And if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe weakness, dizziness, or chest pain – please don’t hesitate to call my office immediately. Otherwise, I think you’re well on your way to recovery. I’ll see you in a few days. Have a pleasant day, and enjoy that roast chicken.
PATIENT: .
