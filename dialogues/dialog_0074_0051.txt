DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It's… lovely in here. Hmm. What brings me in? Let me see… my memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. Something about… blood. Yes, that's it! I need to know my… what do you call it… blood type? My son, he said it was important to know, just in case. Though, honestly, I can't recall why he said that. Old age, I suppose!
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s very wise of your son to encourage you to find that out. Knowing your blood type is definitely important for several reasons, especially as we get older. It’s good to be prepared. So, you’re primarily concerned with getting your blood type checked today?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Just… the type. I don’t… feel unwell, not really. Just a little tired, but who isn’t at my age? It’s more for… peace of mind, I think. And to stop my son from worrying! He’s a good boy, always fussing over me. Is it a painful thing, finding out? I don't like needles much.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It’s a very simple blood draw, just like when you get routine lab work done. There will be a quick pinch, but it's usually very well-tolerated. We can even use a smaller needle if that would make you more comfortable. It’s a standard procedure, and we take every precaution to make it as painless as possible. Before we proceed with that, though, could I ask you a few quick questions, just to get a better overall picture of your health?
PATIENT: Oh, a small needle, you say? That’s… reassuring. Alright, questions are fine. Though, don’t expect too much! My mind wanders easily these days. I used to be so sharp, you know. Working as a rigger, you had to be. Cables, and heights… it keeps you on your toes. But that was a long time ago. Go ahead, dear.
DOCTOR: Of course. No worries at all. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Medical conditions… Let me see. I had something with my… joints, years ago. Arthritis, I think? It flared up sometimes, made walking difficult. But it’s been quiet for a while now, thankfully. The doctor gave me some pills, but I don’t really remember taking them regularly. And… oh! I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder. But that was ages ago, and it healed well. Did that answer your question, dear? It's hard to keep track, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. So, arthritis and a past wrist fracture. And you said the arthritis has been quiet for a while now?
PATIENT: Yes, quiet! Very quiet. No aches, no swelling. Just… old age creaks, you know? Nothing to bother the doctor about. I mostly just try to stay active, do a little gardening when the weather is nice. Keeps me busy, and out of trouble! Though my son says I overdo it sometimes. He worries too much, that boy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, staying active is wonderful. And it sounds like you’re managing well. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Now that’s a good question. Let me think… Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder out, a long, long time ago. Must have been… forty years ago? More? It was a simple thing, the doctor said. I don't remember much discomfort afterwards. And… I think that was it? Honestly, my memory is like a sieve. It’s frustrating, but what can one do? It’s just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Having your gallbladder removed is good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Hmm. I take something for my… blood pressure, I think? A little white pill. But honestly, I don’t even know the name of it. My son refills it for me, bless his heart. He puts them in a little box every week. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up, but that’s not very often. Just… whatever’s in the cabinet, really. I don’t pay much attention to the names. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. We can certainly look into getting a clear list of your medications. It's important to keep track of those things, especially when starting new treatments. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Oh dear. Now, that's a tricky one. I don't think so. Nothing comes to mind, anyway. I used to get a bit of a rash sometimes, when I was a girl, from… well, I don't even remember what from. But it was a long time ago, and it didn't bother me much. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything, thank goodness. My son always asks me about allergies, but I always tell him I don't have any. He worries so much!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And we appreciate you letting us know you don't recall any allergies. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, that’s another long story! My mother, she had something with her heart, I think. She was always tired, and she passed away when I was quite young. And my father, he had… diabetes, I believe? He was always thirsty, and he had trouble with his feet. But that was a long, long time ago. I don’t really remember much else. We didn’t talk about these things much back then. It wasn't considered polite, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Heart disease and diabetes in the family. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean, dear? I'm not very good with these… fancy terms. I used to work as a rigger, on the docks. Very physical work, lots of lifting and climbing. But I retired years ago, when my knees started to give out. Now, I mostly stay at home, do a little gardening, read a bit. I don't really go out much anymore. I used to have a lot of friends, but most of them have… passed away, you know. I'm widowed, you see. My husband, bless his soul, passed away twenty years ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Nini. It sounds like you’ve had a full life, and it’s completely understandable that things have changed over time. So, to recap: no known allergies, a history of arthritis and gallbladder removal, family history of heart disease and diabetes, and you’re currently retired, widowed, and generally stay at home. Now, before we proceed with the blood draw, I’d like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s fine, dear. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. My blood pressure… is it usually alright? I don’t really pay attention to these things. I just let the doctors worry about it. And my heart… well, it still beats, doesn't it? A little slower these days, I suppose. Go ahead, dear. I'll just sit here and try to remember what I had for breakfast. It's always a struggle these days!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That's a little bit elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart rate is 76 and regular. Lungs sound clear on both sides. No wheezing or crackles noted. Now, are you currently experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Oh, elevated, you say? What does that mean, dear? I don't feel any different. No chest pain, no, thankfully. And no shortness of breath, not unless I try to climb too many stairs! And my ankles… I think they're a little swollen sometimes, but I just assumed it was the heat. We’ve had such warm weather lately. I wear comfortable shoes, that’s all. And I elevate them when I sit down. No, I don't think it’s anything to worry about. Just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. A little swelling in the ankles, and you’ve been taking steps to manage that. Now, to proceed with the blood draw, would you prefer I use a smaller needle?
PATIENT: Oh, a smaller needle, you said before? Yes, please, dear. That would be lovely. I really don't like needles, you know. It's silly, I suppose, but I always get a bit nervous. And my veins aren't very good, I'm afraid. The nurses always have trouble finding them. Maybe a smaller needle will help. Just be gentle with me, dear. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini. Just a quick pinch. Try to relax your arm for me. All done. That wasn’t so bad, was it?
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn't too bad, you're right, dear. A little prick, but nothing terrible. My arm feels a bit… funny, but I'm sure that will pass. You were very gentle. Thank you. So, what happens now? Do you send the blood off to a laboratory? And how long does it take to get the results? I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a friend coming over for tea tomorrow, and I'd like to know before then.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll send the blood off to the laboratory right away. They’ll analyze it to determine your blood type and a few other basic things, like your complete blood count and some metabolic panels – just to get a general picture of your health. The results usually take about 24 to 48 hours. We'll give you a call as soon as we have them. I’ll also have a copy sent to your primary care physician. In the meantime, just keep the bandage on for a few hours, and avoid strenuous activity with that arm. If you notice any excessive bleeding, swelling, or redness, please call the office right away. Do you have any questions for me right now, Ms. Nini?
PATIENT: Oh, 24 to 48 hours… That's not too bad. I’ll try to remember not to lift anything heavy with this arm. And I will keep an eye out for bleeding, of course. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now, dear. You’ve been very patient with me and my… forgetfulness. Thank you for taking such good care of me. Do I need to pay anything now? And will this be covered by my insurance? I always get so confused with these things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Nini. It's my pleasure. We’ll take care of the billing here. Our office will submit the claim to your insurance company. Your insurance should cover the majority of the cost, but there may be a copay or deductible depending on your plan. Our billing department will contact you if there are any issues. We will have you sign a consent form for release of information to your insurance provider. For today, you do not need to pay anything. Is there anything else I can help you with before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, dear. I’m glad to hear that my insurance should cover it. I always worry about these things. No, I don’t think that’s all, thank you. I think I'll just go home and rest now. And hopefully, I'll remember where I put my handbag! Thank you again for everything. You’re a very nice doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Nini. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take it easy, and don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s a card with our office number. And don’t worry about your handbag – I’m sure it will turn up. Have a lovely day, Ms. Nini. .
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You have a lovely day too. .
