DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s…well, my skin. It's gotten quite yellow, you see. It’s rather alarming, and my niece insisted I come in. She said something about my liver…but I don’t recall all the details. It’s been a bit of a blur, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Your niece is wise to suggest you come in. Yellowing of the skin – what we call jaundice – can be a sign of liver issues, though there are other possibilities. A “bit of a blur,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a blur. The doctors…there have been several, over the years…they spoke of hepatitis, I think. And something about the liver not…functioning properly. But I’m an old woman, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s difficult to keep track of everything. Do you…need me to recall specifics? Perhaps a date, or the name of the other doctors? I’m afraid I won’t be much help there.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can try to pull records, though being in a rural clinic, that isn’t always reliable. Let’s focus on now. Besides the yellowing, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…let me think. Oh, dear. I do feel rather tired lately. More so than usual, and that’s saying something! And my appetite…it’s been…small. Not gone, but just…not very good. Everything tastes a bit…off, if that makes sense. And I’ve had some…discomfort, in my belly, on the right side, I believe. It's not a sharp pain, more of a…fullness. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. The fatigue, loss of appetite, and discomfort on the right side…those all fit a potential pattern. Now, have you noticed any changes in your…stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor, I… I don't particularly enjoy discussing such things. But…yes, it’s been paler than usual. A sort of…clay color, my niece remarked. She’s very observant, that girl. It’s rather unpleasant to think about, truly. I do apologize for the bluntness.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Durig. These things are important, and I appreciate your honesty. Clay-colored stools are concerning. Now, any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Not recently, at least. A little queasy sometimes, especially in the mornings, but nothing… forceful. I haven’t even had a proper appetite to vomit, if you understand. It's just…a general feeling of unwellness. I hope that’s clear enough. This is all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your abdomen, check for any tenderness, and palpate your liver to see if it’s enlarged. It won't be pleasant, but it's necessary. Then, we'll need to get some blood work done, to get a clearer picture. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you deem it necessary, then I suppose I have no objections. I trust your judgment. Just…please be gentle. And perhaps explain what you’re doing as you go? It’s…easier that way. I don't enjoy surprises, you see. Let's get this over with, if we may.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll explain as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with this. This tells me if there are any unusual sounds, like fluid or blockages. Just breathe normally. Okay. Normal bowel sounds, though slightly diminished. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. And finally, I’m going to feel for your liver. It should be just under your rib cage on the right side. Hmm. It is slightly enlarged and tender to the touch. Not dramatically, but enough to be noted. It is also somewhat firm. Now, let’s get those blood tests ordered. We need to check your liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and a complete blood count. That will give us a much better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s…uncomfortable. As you said. It feels…full, there. I hadn't noticed it myself, but now that you press…yes. Blood tests, you say? Very well. Do you have a form I need to fill out? I do hope it won't take too long. I have a…commitment later this afternoon, and I wouldn't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a standard requisition form. It asks for your insurance information, though you mentioned you weren’t insured…so you can just leave that blank. And your current medications, if any. It's mostly just formalities. The lab is down the hall, second door on the left. They’re used to dealing with patients from the clinic. Once they have the results – and it usually takes a couple of days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’d advise you to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid any strenuous activity. And…avoid alcohol, naturally. Now, is there anything else I can address before you go?
PATIENT: Very well. No insurance to list, thankfully. And as for medications…just a little something for my arthritis, occasionally. Nothing that should interfere, I assume? I’ll be sure to follow your advice about rest and fluids. And, no, Doctor, I don't believe that is all. Just…will you tell me, honestly, what you suspect? Is it…serious? I’m an old woman, I understand. I’m not afraid of bad news, but I would like to be prepared. If you could give me a general idea…that would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll be frank. Based on your symptoms – the jaundice, fatigue, loss of appetite, clay-colored stools, and the enlarged, tender liver – it could be a number of things. But the most concerning possibility is a blockage of the bile duct, which could be caused by gallstones, a tumor, or, less likely, inflammation. This prevents the liver from properly processing bilirubin, which is what causes the yellowing. It is serious, Ms. Durig, and requires further investigation. The blood tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. We may also need to order an imaging scan – an ultrasound or a CT scan – to get a better look at your liver and bile ducts. I don't want to alarm you unnecessarily, but it's important to be realistic. If it is a blockage, we'll need to determine the cause and the best course of action, which could involve medication or, in some cases, surgery. Does that…make sense?
PATIENT: Surgery… Oh dear. That’s…not what I wanted to hear. A blockage, you say? And it requires…intervention? I see. Well. I suppose I should have expected as much. My niece always said I should have taken better care of myself. She’s a practical girl. Very practical. So, blood tests first. And then…this scan. I’ll…I’ll do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just…please keep me informed. I don’t like surprises, you know. And…thank you for being honest with me. It’s…reassuring, in a way. I think I’ll go now and try to…digest this. .
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. The lab will send them directly to the clinic, and my nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you. And yes, I will keep you informed. Try not to worry too much, Ms. Durig. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And…don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. .
