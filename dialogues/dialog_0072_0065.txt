DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be quite frank, I’ve been gaining weight, and I can’t seem to figure out why. It’s… disconcerting, to say the least. I haven’t changed my eating habits, and I’m as active as I usually am.
DOCTOR: I see. Weight gain, despite no changes in diet or activity level. That is concerning, and we’ll certainly investigate. To start, can you tell me approximately how much weight have you gained, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Approximately… let me think. It’s been about six months, I’d say. And perhaps… fifteen pounds? Maybe a little more. It’s difficult to be precise, but that feels about right. It’s not a dramatic change week to week, but it adds up, you understand. And my clothes are… tighter. It’s quite bothersome, honestly.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds over six months, noted. And you say your eating habits haven’t changed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, they haven’t. I prepare most of my meals at home, usually simple things. Soups, salads, occasionally some roasted chicken with vegetables. Nothing excessive, certainly. My husband and I, we both watch what we eat, more or less. We aren’t strict, but we avoid processed foods and sweets as much as possible. It’s quite… puzzling.
DOCTOR: "More or less," is somewhat vague, Ms. Selbitschka. Could you give me a typical day's worth of meals and snacks?
PATIENT: Oh, I apologize. Yes, you are right to ask for specifics. Let me see… A typical day… Breakfast is usually a small bowl of oatmeal with a few berries. Lunch is often a salad with grilled chicken or a piece of fish, and perhaps a slice of whole-wheat bread. Dinner… well, tonight we had roasted chicken, as I mentioned, with steamed green beans and a small potato. We sometimes have a small piece of dark chocolate after dinner, but only one or two squares. I do drink tea throughout the day, and water, of course. Nothing… unusual, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how much water would you say you drink in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, perhaps… six or eight glasses? It varies. I try to stay hydrated, you understand, but I don’t meticulously measure. I have a large water bottle that I refill throughout the day. It’s not a precise amount, I’m afraid. Is that… insufficient? I hadn’t considered that might be relevant.
DOCTOR: Ms. Selbitschka, while I appreciate you attempting to provide details, it's difficult to assess potential causes without a more concrete understanding of your intake. "A few berries," "a small potato," "one or two squares" – these are subjective measurements. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I apologize for my imprecision. I hadn’t realized it was so crucial. It’s… I simply don’t keep a food diary, you see. Other changes… hmm. Let me think. I’ve been feeling… rather tired lately, more so than usual. And perhaps a little colder than my husband, even when the temperature is comfortable. Nothing drastic, but noticeable. My hair… it seems to be falling out a bit more than it used to, as well. Is that… related, do you think?
DOCTOR: Fatigue, feeling colder than usual, and increased hair loss… those are certainly things we need to explore. Do you have any family history of thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Thyroid problems… hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she had some issues, I believe, later in life. Something about being… sluggish, and gaining weight, actually. She saw a doctor, and they put her on some medication. I’m not entirely certain of the details, I was quite young then. My father… he was generally healthy, as far as I know. He did have some heart trouble towards the end, but nothing like that. Does that information… help? I wish I knew more about my mother’s condition.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s quite relevant, Ms. Selbitschka. Given your family history, and your symptoms, we need to investigate the possibility of hypothyroidism. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a complete blood count. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Anything that might help determine the cause of this… situation, I am happy to do. Blood tests are… acceptable. I trust your judgment. When would those be scheduled? And… will they be painful? I’m not terribly fond of needles, you understand.
DOCTOR: The blood draw is routine, Ms. Selbitschka. A minor discomfort, at most. It will take only a few minutes. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood this morning. They’ll send the results to me, and I’ll contact you as soon as they’re available, typically within a week. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity, and let me know if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials we should be aware of before the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any allergies. None at all. Latex, or anything else, I am perfectly fine. I’m relieved it will be quick. A week… alright. I shall try to remain calm and avoid strenuous activity. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I appreciate your attention to this matter. Hopefully, we can discover the cause soon. It is… unsettling, not knowing.
DOCTOR: Very well. The technician will call you back shortly. We’ll proceed from there. I'll see you again when the results are in. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before then. .
PATIENT: .
