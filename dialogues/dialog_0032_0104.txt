DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly? I don't have much time for this. My throat… it hurts. Has been for a bit, now. Not sure why it hurts, and frankly, I haven’t the energy to figure it out. Just… needs fixing, if possible.
DOCTOR: "Fixing," you say. Well, we shall see. A sore throat can be many things, Ms. Ottaviani. “A bit, now” is rather vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, goodness. It’s… scratchy. Like sand. And it hurts when I swallow. Been maybe… a week? Or longer. I don’t keep track of these things. It’s just… annoying, is all. I need to get back to work, you see. Important things to do. Not much time for illnesses.
DOCTOR: "Important things," yes. I understand. A week or longer… and is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s pretty much always there, Doctor. Maybe a little worse in the mornings. But mostly just… a dull ache. Like someone left sandpaper in my throat. Honestly, I just don't understand why I’m even explaining this. It hurts. Isn’t that enough?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know it’s constant, Ms. Ottaviani, even if you find it… tedious to detail. Constant sore throat for a week or longer… Are you experiencing any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose?
PATIENT: Fever? I haven’t taken my temperature. Chills? It’s August, Doctor. It’s hot. And no, I haven't been coughing. A runny nose… maybe a little, but it's just allergies, probably. I always get allergies this time of year. It’s nothing serious. Just… this throat. Honestly, are you a doctor or a detective?
DOCTOR: I am a doctor, Ms. Ottaviani, and a thorough assessment is necessary, even for what seems straightforward. Allergies can certainly contribute, but we must rule out other possibilities. Now, have you noticed any difficulty breathing or swallowing, besides the pain?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? No. I haven’t collapsed or anything. Swallowing… it’s just painful, as I’ve said repeatedly. It’s… difficult because it hurts. That’s the difficulty! Look, I’m a busy woman. If you can’t just fix it, I don’t know why I’m here. I suppose I should have just stayed home and taken some tea.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief examination, then. I’d like to take a look at your throat, listen to your lungs, and perhaps check your lymph nodes. It will only take a few moments. If you would please open your mouth and say "ah…"
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Honestly, the things one has to do…
DOCTOR: Alright. Your throat is visibly inflamed, and I can feel some swelling in your lymph nodes. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. It appears you have pharyngitis, which is inflammation of the throat, most likely viral. However, given the persistent nature of your symptoms, and the slight swelling, I would like to perform a rapid strep test to rule out a bacterial infection. It's a quick swab, and we’ll have results shortly. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Strep test? Swab? Honestly, Doctor, I really don’t have time for all these… procedures. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t you just give me something for the pain? A pill? A shot? Something quick and easy. I have work to do, you know. This is just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, while I understand your desire for a quick solution, it is crucial to determine the cause of your sore throat before prescribing treatment. If it is bacterial, we need to treat it with antibiotics. Treating a viral infection with antibiotics is ineffective and contributes to antibiotic resistance. The swab is a necessary step for proper medical care, and it takes only a moment. I strongly advise proceeding with it. It's the responsible course of action.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Quickly, please. I have a schedule to keep. Honestly, this is such a waste of my time. Just hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a moment. The results should be available in a few minutes. In the meantime, I’m going to document my findings and discuss potential symptomatic relief options while we wait. It’s important to stay hydrated and rest your voice, even if we determine it’s viral. While we wait, do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, I don’t know. Probably. I take so many things over the years. Something for the pressure, something for the aches… I can’t recall specifically. Anything… red dye, maybe? Or… something with codeine? It makes me sleepy. Honestly, Doctor, I really don't keep track of these things. It’s just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your uncertainty, we will proceed with caution. I will avoid prescribing anything with codeine until we have a clearer understanding of your allergy history. The rapid strep test is now complete… and it is negative. That means your sore throat is likely viral. While there is no cure for a viral sore throat, we can focus on managing your symptoms. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, throat lozenges, and plenty of fluids. A warm salt water gargle can also provide some relief. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?
PATIENT: So… pills and lozenges? That’s it? Honestly, I was hoping for something more… substantial. Fine. I can manage. Acetaminophen… is that Tylenol? And ibuprofen is… Advil? I suppose. Just… make sure they don't have any of those… red dyes. Honestly, this has been quite a process. Thank you, Doctor. I believe that is all I needed. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ottaviani, that is correct. Acetaminophen is Tylenol, and ibuprofen is Advil. I have documented your potential allergy to red dye, and I will ensure any prescriptions I provide are dye-free. I will also provide a printed list of the recommendations we discussed today, including dosage instructions. Given your lack of insurance, I suggest purchasing the over-the-counter medications at the lowest cost pharmacy available. It’s important to monitor your symptoms. If they worsen, or you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or difficulty swallowing, please seek immediate medical attention. Here is your information sheet. Yes, you may go now. And please, prioritize rest and hydration. It is crucial for recovery. Thank you for your patience. .
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I have more important things to attend to. Goodbye. .
