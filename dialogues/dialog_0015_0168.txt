DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… delicate, actually. I’m starting to date someone, and I just want to be absolutely certain everything is… as it should be, you understand. A woman of my age needs to be proactive about these things. I wouldn't want any… surprises.
DOCTOR: I see. Proactive is always a good approach. So, you’re looking for a general check-up, specifically related to resuming sexual activity?
PATIENT: Well, “resuming” is a rather… blunt way to put it. I’ve been… exploring companionship. And yes, a check-up is precisely what I require. I want to be certain I’m not… vulnerable to anything. It's a matter of discretion, you see. And frankly, peace of mind. It’s not something one discusses lightly.
DOCTOR: Of course. Discretion is paramount. Let’s start with a thorough history. Have you had any recent changes in your health?
PATIENT: Recent changes? Hmm. Let me think. No, nothing significant. My weight has fluctuated a little – the usual, really. And my knees ache when it rains, but that’s hardly a change. It’s just… rain. Honestly, Doctor, I take very good care of myself. I eat reasonably well, and I don't go out much. It's not as if I'm leading a… wild life.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let’s quantify that weight fluctuation. Approximately how much weight have you gained or lost, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Quantify. Really? Well, perhaps… five or six pounds over the last year. It comes and goes, you know? It's not as if I'm obsessing over it. A few extra treats here and there, a slightly less active summer… It's hardly a cause for alarm. I simply wish to be thorough, as you suggested. I assure you, Doctor, I maintain a respectable figure for my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Changes? Doctor, with all due respect, I am 44 years old. My menstrual cycle has been… absent for quite some time. Years, actually. I daresay that’s a rather… obvious question, isn't it? One would think a thorough review of my file would have revealed that. Honestly.
DOCTOR: You are correct to point that out, Ms. Pandolfi. My apologies. Let’s move on then. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications, thankfully. I pride myself on avoiding them. And allergies… well, I dislike pollen, if that counts. But I wouldn’t say I’m allergic to it. It just makes my eyes water a bit. Nothing a good tissue can’t handle. Really, Doctor, I'm a very healthy woman. This whole… inquiry is starting to feel rather unnecessary, if I may be frank.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Pandolfi. Even healthy individuals benefit from preventative care. Now, to be comprehensive, I need to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Doctor, are you implying something? I assure you, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything of the sort. My family has excellent genetics, and I’ve always led a… sensible lifestyle. I do get a bit breathless climbing stairs, but that’s simply because I don't exercise excessively. It’s not a condition. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather… demeaning. I came here for a simple check-up, not a… character assessment.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I am asking these questions to ensure I have a complete picture of your health. It’s standard procedure, and it’s not meant to be demeaning. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Goodness, no. I’ve never seen the need for such… drastic measures. A bit of discomfort is a small price to pay for avoiding the risks associated with going under the knife. My mother always said, "Leave well enough alone," and I've always lived by that motto. Really, Doctor, are you quite certain you’re the right physician for me? I feel as if I'm being interrogated, not examined. This is all rather… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Perhaps a second opinion would be beneficial, Ms. Pandolfi. I believe we’ve established you’re in good health, and if that’s the case, further investigation may be unnecessary. Here are the numbers for a colleague who specializes in preventative women’s health. I wish you well.
