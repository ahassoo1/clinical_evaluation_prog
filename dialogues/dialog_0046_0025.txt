DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… I want to know more about where my family come from. My people, long time ago. I hear you can do tests… DNA tests, to find out? I want to know my roots, you know? I make things with wood, pretty things, but I want to know who made things before me.
DOCTOR: That’s a very interesting question, Mr. Scobie, and a perfectly valid reason to seek medical information, though it falls a bit outside of the typical medical consultation. It's wonderful that you're interested in learning about your ancestry! While we don’t routinely offer DNA testing here at the clinic, I can certainly discuss the options available. There are several reputable companies that provide ancestry DNA testing services. Before we go down that road, though, could you tell me a bit more about what you already know about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… what I know? Well, I grew up on Majuro, that’s where my people are from. Marshall Islands. My grandfather… he told stories. Stories about the ocean, about canoes, about… gods, maybe? Old stories. But he didn’t say where they come from before the islands. Just always been there, he said. My mother, she didn’t talk much about it. Just fishing and family. I don’t have… papers or anything. No family tree. Just stories. Mostly stories. Is this enough? I don’t know what you need to know.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Scobie. Stories are a wonderful starting point. It sounds like your heritage is deeply connected to the Marshall Islands, which is beautiful. It’s common for oral histories to be the primary way of preserving ancestry, especially when written records aren’t available. The DNA tests can sometimes provide clues about your origins before settling in the Marshall Islands, but it’s important to remember they aren't always definitive. They can offer probabilities and connections to broader populations, but they can’t replace the value of your family's stories. Before recommending a specific test, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: My health? I’m… okay. Old, of course. Eighty-five years, you know. Some aches and pains, mostly in my hands from the wood work. Doctor says my blood pressure is a little high, but I take the pills he gives me. No big problems. I eat fish mostly, and taro. Simple food. I don’t drink much, maybe a little beer sometimes with friends. Medicare pays for everything, thank goodness. Is that what you need to know? Just old man stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Mr. Scobie. Knowing about your overall health is important, even when exploring ancestry testing. It helps us understand any potential risks or limitations with certain tests, and ensures we're considering your well-being first. It sounds like you're generally quite healthy for your age, which is wonderful! High blood pressure is common, and it's good you're managing it with medication. Now, regarding the ancestry tests themselves, there are a few popular companies like 23andMe, AncestryDNA, and MyHeritage. They all involve providing a saliva sample and then they analyze your DNA and provide a report on your ethnic origins and potential relatives. Do you have any preference or have you heard of any of these companies in particular?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think I saw something on the television about… AncestryDNA? Maybe? The commercials showed people finding long-lost cousins. That sounded interesting. I don't really understand all the science stuff, you know. Just want to find out where my family come from, before the islands. I don't need cousins, just… the roots. Is AncestryDNA a good one? Is it expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you know. Medicare doesn't pay for… finding roots, I guess.
DOCTOR: AncestryDNA is a very popular choice, and you’re right, they do focus a lot on connecting people with relatives. However, they also provide detailed reports on ethnic origins, which sounds like what you’re most interested in. Let’s take a look at their website together. As you can see, their basic ancestry report costs around $99, but they often have sales. It doesn’t include information about health risks, which is good since that’s not what we’re focused on today. They also have more expensive packages that offer more detailed reports and access to historical records, but for your purposes, the basic package might be sufficient. It's important to remember that these tests are estimates based on comparing your DNA to a database, and the accuracy can vary. Do you feel comfortable with the idea of sending a saliva sample to them?
PATIENT: Hmm… ninety-nine dollars… that’s… okay, I think. I can probably manage that. As long as they don’t want more money later. I don't like surprises. Sending spit… yes, that’s okay. Easy enough. And it just tells me where my people come from? Before the islands? It won’t tell me everything about them? I don’t want to know about… bad things. Just where they lived, you know? And are they… safe people? I don't want to find out my ancestors were… pirates or something.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Mr. Scobie. You’re right to ask about hidden fees and the type of information provided. AncestryDNA is upfront about their costs, and the basic package should be $99 with no additional charges unless you choose to upgrade. Regarding the information, it focuses on where your ancestors likely lived based on DNA similarities to current populations. It won’t provide a detailed biography of each ancestor, and it’s unlikely to reveal information about specific events or their character. It will give you a percentage breakdown of your ethnic origins—for example, you might find you have a certain percentage of Polynesian ancestry, or traces of ancestry from other regions. It’s important to remember that history is complex, and every population has had individuals who engaged in various activities. The test is unlikely to reveal if your ancestors were pirates, and even if it did, it’s important to view that information in context. Would you like me to print out some information about AncestryDNA for you to review at home?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I like to read things slowly, when I have time. And maybe I can ask my friend, he’s good with computers, to look at it too. He might understand the science stuff better than me. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man and his… roots. I appreciate it. I think… I think I’m ready to try this. Hopefully, I'll find out something interesting about my family. Or at least, not too much bad stuff.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was my pleasure to help. It's never too late to explore your heritage, and I hope you find the information you're looking for. And yes, having a friend look it over is a great idea! If you have any questions after reviewing the information, or if you decide to proceed with the test and have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
