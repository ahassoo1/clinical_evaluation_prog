DOCTOR: Alright, Jahaad. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you as well, Doctor Overgaard. Um, it’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, actually. I’ve noticed some swelling, and I was hoping you could take a look. I don’t… I don’t quite recall when it started, to be honest. It feels like it’s been a little while, though.
DOCTOR: "A little while," is… not terribly helpful, unfortunately. We need some timeframe to work with. Was it days, weeks, months?
PATIENT: You’re right, of course. Apologies. Hmm… I’d say… maybe a few weeks? Possibly closer to a month, but I truly can’t be certain. It didn’t happen suddenly, that much I remember. It was… gradual. I wish I could be more precise. It’s just… things haven’t been very clear lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few weeks to a month. Gradual onset. And where, specifically, is this swelling you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Mostly… here, on my neck. And a little bit around my jawline, I think. It’s not terribly painful, just… noticeable. And a bit uncomfortable sometimes when I swallow. It doesn't always bother me, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's have a feel… Alright, there is some mild tenderness here on the left side of your neck. And I can feel a… small nodule, about the size of a pea. Does this area feel particularly sensitive when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. That’s… a little uncomfortable. Not excruciating, but I can definitely feel it. It’s… a dull ache, more than anything. I hadn’t really pinpointed it before, but you’re right, it is tender there. Is that… normal? I don’t mean to ask so many questions, I just… I get worried.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly reasonable to ask questions, Jahaad. Worry is a natural response. The tenderness is what I’m noting. And the nodule itself. We need to figure out what's causing this. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the swelling and tenderness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No fever, I don’t think. And no… cough, or sore throat. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, perhaps, but I attributed that to just… life, really. I haven’t been sleeping particularly well. No weight loss, or night sweats, as far as I know. Does that help? I’m sorry, I feel like I’m not being very useful.
DOCTOR: You’re being perfectly useful, Jahaad. It's important to rule things out, and you're helping me do that. No fever, cough, sore throat, weight loss, or night sweats is good. Fatigue could be related, or it could be something else entirely. Now, let’s go through some general health questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I… I don’t take any regular medication, either. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that’s it. And I’m not allergic to any foods, as far as I know. I eat pretty much everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies or regular medications. Good. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t the best. I had… something as a child, a bad infection, I think? But I don’t recall the details. And I broke my arm once, when I was younger. But nothing major recently. I haven’t been hospitalized, or had any surgeries. I truly wish I could be more specific. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. A childhood infection and a broken arm. We'll work with what we have. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… Let me see. My mother is healthy, as far as I know. She lives in Morocco. My father… he passed away a few years ago. He had… heart problems, I believe. And my sister is also healthy, living in France. No history of… anything like this, as far as I know. No cancer, or thyroid issues, or anything related to swelling. I wish I knew more details, but I wasn’t particularly close to my father when he was ill. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. Father with heart problems, mother and sister healthy. That's noted. Now, a few lifestyle questions, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have. I find it… quite unpleasant, actually. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. I try to stay healthy, Doctor. I eat a balanced diet and I walk whenever I can. I know it doesn’t explain what’s happening, but I do try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, what do you do for work, Jahaad?
PATIENT: I’m a Speech-Language Pathologist. I work with patients who have communication and swallowing difficulties. It’s… a very rewarding job, actually. I help people regain their ability to speak and eat, which is… quite important. I suppose it’s a little ironic, given my current situation. But I enjoy it. I work at a clinic downtown, a few days a week. I’ve been doing it for about five years now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's get back to this swelling. Given that it's been gradual, and you haven’t had any other concerning symptoms, it could be a benign lymph node. But, given your profession and the location, we need to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order a blood test to check your thyroid function, and a complete blood count. We’ll also need to do an ultrasound of your neck to get a better look at the nodule. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An ultrasound and blood tests. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just… I want to know what’s going on. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. When can we schedule those? And… will it be painful? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… get worried easily, I suppose.
DOCTOR: The blood test is routine, a quick prick of the finger. The ultrasound is painless, just a gel applied to your neck and a probe moved across the skin. We can schedule both for tomorrow morning, first thing. The lab is just down the hall, and the radiology technician is very good. I'll have my nurse schedule that for you as we speak. In the meantime, if the swelling increases significantly, or you develop any fever, difficulty breathing, or difficulty swallowing, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Tomorrow morning for the blood test and ultrasound. And to go to the emergency room if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, and for not dismissing my concerns. I feel… a little better now, knowing what’s next. I'll see you tomorrow, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be in shortly. I expect you to follow up promptly.
