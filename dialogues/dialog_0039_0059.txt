DOCTOR: Hi Adyn, welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, honestly, it’s my speech. It’s been… a bit off lately. Sort of slurred, you see. I’m not entirely sure when it started, to be frank. It just… happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, slurred speech… I see. And it just started happening recently, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, recently… or, it feels recent. It’s difficult to pinpoint. Weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month or so? Everything feels a bit… hazy, if I'm being truthful. I don’t remember any specific event that triggered it, either. It wasn’t after a fall or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month or so… that's helpful. And no injury or particular event you can recall that might have started it. Okay. Has the slurring been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and others… well, others like today, it’s quite pronounced. It seems to be worse when I’m tired, perhaps? Though, to be honest, I’m often rather tired. It’s difficult to say for certain what makes it worse, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse when you're tired… That's good to know. And you mentioned your memory isn't what it used to be. Has that been a recent change as well, or has that been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: That’s… a tricky question. It's been gradually worsening, I suppose. Years, really. But it feels… more noticeable lately. Along with the speech, it’s… concerning. I just wish I could recall things more clearly. It makes everyday tasks… difficult, at times. I apologise for being so vague, Doctor. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: No apologies at all, Adyn. It's perfectly alright. These things happen, and it's helpful to get a sense of the timeline even if it's a bit hazy. Okay. Let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the slurred speech and memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me see. I have been feeling rather weak, I suppose. Not constantly, but… a general lack of energy. And sometimes… a bit dizzy. Nothing severe, just… off balance. Oh, and my hands… they’ve been trembling a little, occasionally. Is that… relevant, Doctor? I’m not sure if that’s connected.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all very relevant, Adyn. Weakness, dizziness, and trembling hands… Okay. Are you experiencing any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… That’s a good question. Now that you mention it… things do seem a little blurry sometimes. Not all the time, and I thought it was just needing new glasses, honestly. It's not a drastic change, but… perhaps it's more than that? I haven’t been to the optician in a while. I just assumed it was age-related, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision. We'll definitely want to look into that. Now, let's go over some of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. I’ve been to doctors, of course, but… I don’t really remember any specific diagnoses. I know I have high blood pressure, I think. My husband reminds me to take my medication for it. And… I had a bad bout of the flu a few years ago, but I don’t know if that’s relevant. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is so unreliable, I’m afraid I can’t be of much help. I apologize again.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Adyn. It’s perfectly alright. High blood pressure is good to know. Do you know what medication you take for it?
PATIENT: Um… Let me think. It’s a small, white pill… and… I believe it starts with an ‘A’? Or perhaps a ‘B’? My husband handles the medication mostly, so I don’t pay close attention to the names. He just tells me to take one every morning. I’m terribly sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… everything feels so muddled sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small white pill, possibly starting with an A or B. That’s helpful. We can look that up later. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Nothing like that. Just… the usual check-ups and vaccinations. I’ve always been quite healthy, generally. Until recently, of course. It’s all rather unsettling, to be honest. I'm not used to feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And to continue, what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother… she had some issues with her heart, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. But beyond that… I’m not entirely sure. My family isn’t very forthcoming with medical information, unfortunately. It’s a bit… private, you see. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I truly wish I could remember more details. It’s frustrating for both of us, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Adyn. It's okay. We can work with what we have. Now, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… um. Well, I'm married, as you know. And I work in construction management. It’s a demanding job, but I enjoy it. I don't drink alcohol, and I don’t smoke. I used to be very active, but… lately I haven’t had much energy. I mostly spend my evenings at home with my husband. It’s a quiet life. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Adyn. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t believe so. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken various medications over the years, and never had any issues. But I could be wrong, of course. My memory is… unreliable, as we’ve established. Perhaps my husband would know better? He’s usually the one who keeps track of these things. But I don't recall any specific allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’d like to check your reflexes and balance. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, proceed. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I'm just hoping we can figure out what's going on. It’s rather unsettling to feel so… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 90. And your heart sounds… regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. Your reflexes are a little diminished on your left side, and your balance seems slightly off. It’s subtle, but I’m noting it. Given your symptoms – the slurred speech, memory issues, weakness, dizziness, blurry vision, and these exam findings – I think we need to do some further investigation. I'd like to order some blood tests to check for any underlying issues, and also an MRI of your brain to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: An MRI…? Oh dear. Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? I was hoping it wasn’t anything too concerning. I must admit, I’m rather anxious about all of this. I don't like the sound of an MRI at all. What exactly are we looking for? And will it be… painful? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m quite worried now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Adyn. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious. An MRI is a very safe and effective way to get a detailed look at your brain. We’re looking for anything that might be causing your symptoms – things like small strokes, inflammation, or other structural issues. It’s important to rule these things out. It’s not painful at all. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it makes a loud knocking noise. It’s a bit claustrophobic for some people, but we can give you something to help you relax if you’re concerned about that. We'll also have a technician monitoring you the entire time. I'm not trying to scare you, but it's better to be thorough and get a clear picture of what's going on. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available, and then we can develop a treatment plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: That… that makes a little more sense, I suppose. Loud noises and… claustrophobic… It doesn’t sound pleasant, but I understand you’re trying to be thorough. Something about inflammation… is that… serious? And what kind of treatment plan are we talking about? Medication? Therapy? I’m just… trying to prepare myself, you see. It’s all rather overwhelming. And when… when will I get the results? Will it take long? I apologize for being so… difficult. I’m just very worried.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Adyn. It's completely natural to be worried, and it’s good that you’re asking questions. Inflammation can be caused by many things, some of which are easily treatable, and some which require more extensive treatment. Depending on the cause, treatment could involve medication, therapy, or lifestyle changes. We won’t know until we have the MRI results. As for the timeline, the MRI should be scheduled within the next few days, and the results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a referral to a neurologist for a consultation. They’re the specialists in brain and nerve disorders, and they’ll be able to help us interpret the results and develop the best treatment plan for you. Do you have any questions about the neurologist?
PATIENT: A neurologist… no, I don’t think so. If you recommend it, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I’m just… trying to stay calm. It’s all happening so quickly. Will the MRI tell us definitively what’s wrong? Or will we need more tests after that? And… will I be able to drive myself home after the MRI? I’m a bit worried about that, too. I’m terribly sorry to keep asking questions, but I feel quite… helpless. And perhaps a little frightened.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, Adyn. Asking questions is important, and it’s okay to feel frightened. The MRI should give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on, but sometimes we need additional tests to confirm a diagnosis. As for driving, it’s usually safe to drive yourself home after an MRI, unless you’re given any sedation. The technician will advise you beforehand. But if you’re feeling anxious or uncomfortable, it’s always best to have someone drive you, or take a taxi or ride-sharing service. Here's the neurologist’s information. I'll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us once we have the MRI results. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any immediate concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Thank you… thank you so much for your patience and kindness. It’s… it’s a relief to have a plan, even if it’s a little frightening. I’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible and contact the neurologist. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I think I’ll just… go home and try to relax, if that’s possible. Thank you again, Doctor. And thank you to your nurse as well. I appreciate everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. Remember, we're here to support you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
