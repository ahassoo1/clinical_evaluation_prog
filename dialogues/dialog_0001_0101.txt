DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Name and… why are you here today?
PATIENT: Well now, good afternoon to you, Doctor… Pehrson, is it? My name is Aldine Popova. And I’ve been having a bit of a headache, right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a few days now. Not the worst thing ever, but enough to make me wanna get it checked, you know?
DOCTOR: Popova… 87… Right. A headache, you say. “A bit of a headache.” How long exactly has this “bit” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… properly started about four days ago, maybe five. It comes and goes, really. Not constant, thank goodness. More like… waves. Some hours I barely notice it, others it’s a dull ache that just won’t quit. I can still do things, mind you. Still do my nails, still cook for my wife… but it’s there, you know? A nagging sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really, no. No blurry vision, no dizziness. No fever or anything like that. I haven’t been sick to my stomach or anything. Just the headache, mostly. Though… now that you mention it, I have been a little more tired than usual. But I'm 87, Doctor! A little tired is kinda my default setting these days.
DOCTOR: “A little tired.” Right. And any changes in your… eating habits?
PATIENT: No, not really. My wife does most of the cooking, bless her heart, and she keeps me well-fed. I eat what she puts in front of me - mostly fish and veggies, she's very health-conscious. I might not have as much appetite some days, when the headache's bad, but I still eat. Nothing drastic, you understand. Just… a bit less. I still enjoy a good mango now and then!
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of… headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… That’s a hard one. My mother… she used to get terrible migraines, yes. Real bad ones that would keep her in bed for days. And my sister, she had them too, though not as bad. But it was a long time ago, Doctor. I was just a young boy then, and I don’t rightly remember all the details. It wasn't something we talked about much. But yes, there were headaches in the family, if that’s what you’re askin’.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not a single one. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. Always believed in letting nature take its course, you see. My wife, she keeps offering me some of her herbal teas when I complain, but I usually just take a nap instead. Seems to work just as well, most times. Never really needed to go to doctors much 'til now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look. Lie down for me. I’m just going to check your reflexes and… basic stuff. Don’t make a fuss.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. No problem. Just a bit stiff these days, you understand. Be gentle now, Doctor. Don’t want to pull anything. What exactly are we lookin’ for, if you don’t mind me askin’? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Reflexes… normal. A little slow, what do you expect at your age?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a bit startling, Doctor! But alright, alright. Normal, you say? Good. Glad to hear it. Slow, well, that's just the years catchin' up, I reckon. What next? Are you gonna shine a light in my eyes or something? I always feel a bit silly when they do that.
DOCTOR: Pupils react… sluggishly. No obvious abnormalities. Any history of falls or head injuries?
PATIENT: No, sir, none at all. I’ve always been quite careful, you see. A bit clumsy sometimes, maybe, but never a serious fall. No bumps to the head, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty steady on my feet, despite my age. My wife always tells me I’m a stubborn old goat, but I think that just means I’m careful! I'm a professional, you know. Steady hands are important for my work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sounds like… tension headache, probably. Old age. Stress. I'll write you a prescription for some over-the-counter pain reliever. Take as needed. If it doesn’t improve, or gets worse… come back. Any other complaints?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter, eh? Alright. That sounds reasonable enough. I can manage that. Hmm… well, actually, now that you mention it, my knees have been a bit creaky lately. Not terribly bad, but they ache a little when I get up from a chair. My wife keeps tellin' me to see someone about it, but I've always just put it down to old age too, like you said. Is that somethin' you can take a look at, Doctor? Or is that a separate issue altogether?
DOCTOR: Look, I'm a family doctor. I can't be specializing in knees. I’ll write a referral to an orthopedist. They can deal with that. That’s all I can do for you today. Next!
PATIENT: Oh. An orthopedist, eh? Alright then. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose that’s… something. I appreciate you takin' the time, even if it wasn’t much. It’s just… gets a little lonely, gettin' old, you know? Sometimes you just want someone to look at you, not just write you a referral. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
