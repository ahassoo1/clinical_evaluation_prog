DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Schwer is fine. My… family. Lots of heart trouble. My mom, my brother… both gone too young. I just want to make sure I’m okay. I don’t want any surprises, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. A family history of cardiac issues is certainly something we need to take seriously. "Gone too young"… could you elaborate on their ages when they passed, if you are comfortable sharing?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Mom was… 62. And my brother, he was only 55. It was quick. Very quick. They said heart… something. I don't really remember the big words, just… gone. I'm 73 now. I feel okay, mostly. But it makes me worry. Especially when I get… breathless sometimes. Just walking up the stairs.
DOCTOR: Sixty-two and fifty-five… alright. And you've noticed breathlessness with exertion – specifically climbing stairs. How long has this been occurring, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: Oh, maybe… six months? It comes and goes. Sometimes the stairs are fine, other times… whoof. It’s not every time. And it goes away when I rest. It just… makes me think. Makes me think about them. I don’t want to end up like them. I’m divorced, no kids, you see. I don’t have anyone to… look out for me.
DOCTOR: I see. So, intermittent breathlessness for approximately six months. It's good that it resolves with rest, but it is still prudent to investigate. Now, aside from the breathlessness, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… my ankles. They get a little swollen sometimes, at the end of the day. Not bad, just… puffy. And maybe a little tired, but who isn't, right? I sell things… wholesale, mostly. Lots of driving. So, tired could be the driving. I don’t really know. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Ankle swelling, and fatigue. Yes, those are potentially relevant, Mr. Schwer. Puffy ankles, particularly if they worsen towards the end of the day, can be indicative of fluid retention. And fatigue, while common, can be a symptom of several underlying conditions. Let's move on to your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. High blood pressure, years ago. But the doctor gave me a pill, and it went away. At least, he said it did. Stopped taking the pill after a while. He said… something about not needing it anymore. I don't remember exactly. And… I had my knee replaced, maybe ten years ago. But that’s it, I think. Oh! And I got the flu shot every year. Is that important?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in the past, managed with medication, then discontinued. Knee replacement ten years ago. And annual flu vaccinations. Thank you. Now, Mr. Schwer, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little… something for my joints. Arthritis, you know? It's called… glucosamine? Something like that. I get it at the drugstore. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take one of those… sleep aids. Just the nighttime kind. Not every night, though. Only when I really need it. You know, when my mind is racing.
DOCTOR: Glucosamine and an occasional sleep aid. Alright. Now, let’s discuss allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean… I get itchy sometimes in the spring. Pollen, I guess? But not like a bad allergy. Just a little sniffle. Never had trouble with medicine. Never been sick enough to take much, really. I try to stay healthy. You know, eat right, get some exercise… even if it’s just walking up the stairs.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: We talked about that already… Mom and my brother, heart trouble. Both gone too young. My dad, he had… diabetes, I think. Kept to himself a lot. Never talked about his health. And my sister… she’s still alive, thankfully. But she has… arthritis, bad arthritis. In her hands. That's all I really know. We don't see each other much. Family isn’t… close. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that will suffice for now. We’ve established a family history of cardiac issues, diabetes, and arthritis. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the table. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay. Heart and lungs, huh? That sounds… serious. I hope everything is okay. Just let me know if you see anything bad, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. I’m simply assessing your baseline. It is a standard procedure. Your heart rate is a bit rapid, but not excessively so. I detect some mild wheezing in your lower lungs. And your blood pressure is slightly elevated… 140 over 90. There is mild pitting edema in both ankles. Now, please sit up. I would like to examine your hands and wrists. As expected, some evidence of arthritis. Now, if you’ll permit me, I’ll check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just… don't find anything too bad, please. My hands do ache sometimes, especially in the mornings. Arthritis, you said? My sister has it bad. Is it going to get worse? What does the wheezing mean? Is that bad? I don’t want to end up like my mom and brother, you know? They were both… strong people.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal. The wheezing suggests some narrowing of the airways, potentially due to mild asthma or chronic bronchitis. It’s not necessarily severe at this stage, but it warrants further investigation. As for your arthritis, it’s likely to be a progressive condition, meaning it may worsen over time. However, there are various treatment options available to manage the symptoms and slow its progression. Based on your family history, current symptoms, and the findings from my examination, I recommend a few further tests. We'll need an EKG to assess your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs, and a complete blood panel to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and inflammatory markers. We will also need to test for BNP to assess heart failure. These tests will provide a more comprehensive picture of your overall health and allow us to determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: EKG… chest X-ray… blood panel… That’s a lot of tests. What will all those tests show? Will it show… something bad? Like my mom and brother? What about the BNP test? What is that even for? I don’t like this, Doctor. I just wanted to make sure I was okay. And… how much will all this cost? Medicare… will it cover it? I don't have much money, you see. It's just me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, I understand your anxiety. These tests are standard procedures to rule out potential underlying issues and ensure we have a complete understanding of your condition. The EKG will assess your heart rhythm for any abnormalities. The chest X-ray will check your lungs for signs of fluid retention or inflammation. The blood panel will evaluate various aspects of your health, including cholesterol levels and kidney function. The BNP test is a blood test to help rule out heart failure. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, but there may be some co-pays or deductibles depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can provide you with a detailed estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. I will order these tests now. The lab technician will draw your blood, and you will schedule the EKG and chest X-ray with the radiology department. Once we have the results, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you maintain a healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid smoking. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Smoking? I never smoked! I eat okay, I guess. Lots of fish. My sister told me it was good for the arthritis. And I walk when I can, but it’s hard sometimes with the stairs and… everything. So… what if the tests are bad? What if I do have something like my mom and brother? Will you… will you be able to fix it? I just… I don't want to die, Doctor. I just want to be okay.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, I did not imply that you smoke. It was a general recommendation. Regarding your concerns about the test results, it is premature to speculate. We will address any potential issues as they arise. However, if you do have an underlying condition, there are various treatment options available, including medication, lifestyle modifications, and, in some cases, surgical interventions. I have completed the test orders. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. A member of our staff will schedule your EKG and chest X-ray. I will review the results as soon as they become available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
