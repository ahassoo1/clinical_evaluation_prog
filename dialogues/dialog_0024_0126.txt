DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste any time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, to put it simply, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, even after I’ve eaten a good meal. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s… inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: “Inconvenient.” Right. And how much fluid would you estimate you are consuming daily?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. More than usual, certainly. Probably… at least three, maybe four litres of water a day? And I find myself reaching for juice, things I wouldn't normally drink. It’s hard to say precisely, I don't measure it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Four litres. And you state this is a change from your usual intake?
PATIENT: Yes, a definite change. I usually have… maybe two pints of water with meals, a cup of tea in the afternoon. Nothing like this. And it’s not just water, like I said, I'm craving sugary drinks too, which is unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Sugary drinks. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this increased thirst and appetite?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I suppose I have been going to the bathroom a bit more often. Especially at night. It's not terrible, but noticeable. And… I've been a bit tired, generally. Just… a bit run down, I suppose. It could just be the summer heat, though.
DOCTOR: Nocturia and fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? No, not that I’ve noticed. Everything seems… normal. I haven’t needed to change my glasses prescription, if that's what you mean. Is this going to take long, Doctor? I have a delivery schedule to manage.
DOCTOR: We are proceeding as efficiently as possible, Mr. Erxleben. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… the usual things. A bad back now and then, but nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, but that was decades ago. My ex-wife always said I had a touch of the sniffles too often, but she said a lot of things. I don't take any regular medication, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Any family history of diabetes, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Hmm. My mother’s side… my aunt, I think. Aunt Margaret. She was always a bit unwell, and I seem to remember something about sugar… but it was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to her. I believe she needed insulin, yes. That’s all I really know, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical assessment. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I will need a urine sample. A cup will be provided.
PATIENT: Right. As quickly as possible, I presume? I have a tight schedule today, Doctor. Let's get on with it, shall we?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 145 over 90. Pulse is 88, regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds normal, though slightly rapid. Now, regarding the urine sample… please provide that when you are able. I will also need to briefly examine your feet. Any sores or wounds?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just… a bit dry, perhaps. I work on my feet all day, you see. It’s a physical job. No cuts, no blisters, nothing unusual. Is this all? I really need to get back to the depot.
DOCTOR: Skin is indeed dry, with some decreased sensation in the extremities. I’ll require a blood glucose test, Mr. Erxleben. It’s a simple procedure. And frankly, given your symptoms and family history, it’s necessary. Do not attempt to leave until I have reviewed the results and provided further instructions.
PATIENT: Fine. A blood test. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite inconvenient. But if you insist. Just… please be quick about it? The delivery schedule won't manage itself. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Hold still. 285 milligrams per deciliter. Mr. Erxleben, this is significantly elevated. You have hyperglycemia. I am diagnosing you with Type 2 Diabetes. We will need to discuss medication and lifestyle changes. Immediately.
PATIENT: Two… two hundred and eighty-five? Diabetes? But… I just have a bit of thirst! And hunger! This can't be right. This is… this is ridiculous! What does this mean? What do I have to do? .
DOCTOR: It means your body is not properly regulating blood sugar. The medication I am prescribing will help with that. Lifestyle changes are critical – diet, exercise, regular monitoring. I will schedule a follow-up appointment with you for a more detailed discussion. And I strongly recommend consulting a nutritionist. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Please schedule the appointment with the receptionist on your way out.
