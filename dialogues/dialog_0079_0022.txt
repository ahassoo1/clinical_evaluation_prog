DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're ninety years of age. Remarkable. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Ninety, yes… feels like a long time! Well, my tummy… it feels big. Bigger than usual, you know? And I don't want to eat much these days. Not like I used to. Everything just… doesn't taste the same. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: “Feels big,” you say. And a diminished appetite… and altered taste. Hmm. Could be a number of things, Ms. McConnon. When did you first notice this… “bigness,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… It’s hard to say exactly. A little bit at a time, I think. Maybe a month or so? I don't really keep track anymore. It just… grew, slowly. Does that make sense? I’m not good with dates, you see. Never was.
DOCTOR: A month… gradual onset. Yes, that’s… something. And you mentioned not wanting to eat. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea… Oh, dear. Let me see… No, I don’t think so. Not really sick to my stomach, no. Just… not hungry. And tired. Very tired, even if I sleep a good long time. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Fatigue… coupled with the loss of appetite and abdominal distension… Yes, these things are relevant. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh, goodness me. You mean… going to the bathroom? Well, it’s not as often as it used to be, I can tell you that. And… harder, sometimes. But I suppose that's just getting old, isn't it? Everything slows down. I don't pay much attention to those things these days.
DOCTOR: Less frequent, more difficult… Yes, that is… noteworthy. Now, Ms. McConnon, I’m going to need to ask some rather personal questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh… personal questions? Well… I haven't been trying to lose weight! But my clothes… they feel a little looser, I guess. Not a lot, but… a little. I used to weigh more, I think. But I don't really stand on the scale anymore. It's… discouraging. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Looser clothing, unintentional weight loss… These symptoms, combined with the distension and fatigue, are concerning, Ms. McConnon. I'm going to perform a physical examination, if you'll allow me. Please lie back on the examination table. We'll start with auscultation of your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh… a physical examination? Well, alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. It’s been a long time since anyone looked me over like that… Is it going to hurt? I have… sensitive skin, you see. Very old skin.
DOCTOR: It will be as gentle as possible, Ms. McConnon. I merely need to listen to your abdomen with this instrument. Please lie flat if you are able. …Hmm. Bowel sounds are… diminished. And somewhat… high-pitched. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please inform me if you feel any discomfort. …Tenderness upon deep palpation in the left upper quadrant. And… a palpable mass. Approximately… six centimeters in diameter. Firm, non-tender to light touch, but… slightly mobile.
PATIENT: Oh… a mass? A mass? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? It doesn't hurt now, but… I get scared easily these days. Is it something serious? You can tell me, you know. I’m an old woman. I’ve lived a long life… But… I still want to know what’s happening to me.
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, the presence of a palpable mass requires further investigation. It’s too early to determine the exact nature of the mass at this time. We need to rule out several possibilities. Given your age and symptoms – diminished appetite, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and the abdominal distension – a malignancy is a concern, but we cannot definitively say that is the case without further testing. I am ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal CT scan. The CT scan will provide a detailed image of your abdomen and help us determine the size, location, and characteristics of the mass. I'm also going to order a fecal occult blood test, just to be thorough. We'll schedule these tests as quickly as possible. I recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. They will be able to perform a colonoscopy to assess the colon. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… a colonoscopy? And a CT scan… and blood tests… It’s… a lot, Doctor. Too much, maybe. A malignancy… is that… cancer? I… I don't know if I can… I'm an old woman. What good would… all that do? Do I have to have all those tests? It sounds… frightening. And a gastroenterologist… is that a different doctor? I barely remember my own doctor's name anymore…
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, it is standard procedure to investigate these symptoms thoroughly. While the possibility of malignancy exists, we must rule out other causes first. I understand your apprehension, but these tests are necessary for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. A gastroenterologist is a specialist who focuses on the digestive system. They are best equipped to evaluate your condition. I will arrange the tests for you and provide the necessary referrals. We’ll take it one step at a time. I will provide you with a list of the specialists and the instructions for each test. It is your choice, of course, whether or not to proceed with these tests. However, I strongly advise it. Early detection is crucial. I recommend you schedule these appointments as soon as possible. Do you have any family who can help you with transportation and assistance?
PATIENT: Family… No. Not anymore. My husband passed years ago. And my son… he moved to California a long time ago. Doesn't come to visit. We don't talk much. I… I don’t have anyone to help me. I live alone. I don't even know how to make these appointments… I barely know how to use the telephone anymore. It’s just… too much. Everything is too much. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. McConnon. My staff will assist you with scheduling these appointments. They are trained to help patients with transportation and other logistical issues. I will inform them of your situation. I understand this is overwhelming, but we will do everything we can to make it easier for you. We'll start with the CT scan. It requires minimal preparation. Please contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. It is important to remember that early detection is crucial. .
