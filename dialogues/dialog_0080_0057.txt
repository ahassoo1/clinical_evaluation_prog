DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… about the cancer. I was told to come speak with someone.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for letting me know, Chellsea. That's… a lot to process, I understand. Can you tell me a little more about what was said?
PATIENT: Um… well, it was the other doctor, back at the hospital. He said the tests showed… something wasn’t right. He used big words, I didn’t understand most of it. He said I needed to see someone for… treatment, I guess. And follow-up. I’m… still a little confused, to be honest. It happened fast.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, and it's completely understandable to be confused when things move quickly. "Big words" are unfortunately common in medicine. Do you remember anything specific he said about where the tests were looking, or what kind of tests they were?
PATIENT: He said… it was in my chest. Something about my lungs. And there was a scan… a picture of everything. He pointed to a spot… a dark spot. I think it was a CT scan. That’s what he called it. It all happened so quickly after that. He just said I needed to come see someone right away. I don't recall exactly what kind of cancer he mentioned, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. A spot in the chest, seen on a CT scan… that's a good starting point. I'm looking at the report here now. It does show an area of concern in the lungs. It’s good you came in quickly. Do you have any other symptoms you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Not really. I’ve been feeling… tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. But I thought that was just… everything. And I’ve had a little cough, but I get those sometimes. Nothing major. I haven’t lost weight or anything like that. I just… haven't been feeling myself, I guess. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and a mild cough… that's helpful to know. And no weight loss, which is good. When did you first start noticing the fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh… maybe a month or so ago? It started gradually. I just thought I was stressed. My… my husband passed away last year, and things have been… difficult. I just figured it was that. It’s been hard getting used to everything on my own. So I didn’t really pay much attention to the tiredness. It just… got worse slowly, you know?
DOCTOR: I’m so sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. That’s a huge loss, and it's completely understandable that you'd be feeling overwhelmed and fatigued. It's very common to experience those feelings after such a significant loss. Let's focus on the medical side of things for a moment, but please know I acknowledge what you’re going through. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Um… well, I don’t really have much of one. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries. I get regular checkups, but everything is always fine. I do have… asthma, but it’s mild. I only need an inhaler sometimes, when I’m… exercising or if the air is bad. That’s about it. I don't have any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the asthma. And no major illnesses or surgeries – that’s helpful. Do you have any family history of cancer, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My grandmother on my mother’s side… she had something. I think it was… lung cancer. But she smoked her whole life, so… I always assumed it was from that. And my uncle… he had skin cancer, but it was caught early and they removed it. Other than that… I don’t really know. No one really talks about it much in my family. It’s… not something we discuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of lung cancer with a smoking history and skin cancer – that’s good information to have. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband… he smoked for a long time, but I never did. I always hated it. I always told him to quit, and he tried a few times… but he couldn't. I’ve always been very careful about staying away from smoke. I don’t drink alcohol either, very rarely. I mostly just… keep to myself, you know? I don’t go out much.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that, Chellsea. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and I appreciate you being so open with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your lungs, check your lymph nodes, and just get a general sense of how you're doing. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I want to know what’s going on. I’m a little scared, to be honest. But I’ll do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, and that’s perfectly understandable. We'll take things one step at a time. First, I'm going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Okay… I'm hearing some mild wheezing, which could be related to your asthma. I'm also going to palpate your lymph nodes to check for any swelling. Your lymph nodes feel… slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. It’s difficult to say right now without further testing.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… concerning. Is that bad? I’m sorry, I’m probably asking silly questions. I just… I don’t know what any of this means. What kind of tests are you thinking about?
DOCTOR: You’re not asking silly questions at all, Chellsea. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned and to want to understand what's going on. The mild wheezing isn't immediately alarming, given your asthma history. The slightly enlarged lymph nodes could be a sign of infection or inflammation, but we need to investigate further to be sure. I think the next step is a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs. I'd also like to order a CT scan with contrast, if possible, to get a more detailed look and see if we can determine the exact cause of the spot we saw on the previous scan. A biopsy will likely be necessary to determine exactly what the spot is composed of. It’s the only way to get a definitive diagnosis. And a blood test will help rule out any infections or other underlying conditions. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot. A biopsy? That sounds scary. What does that involve? And… what if it is cancer? I… I don’t know if I’m strong enough to go through all of that. I just lost my husband… I don’t know…
DOCTOR: It is a lot, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed and scared. A biopsy does sound frightening, but it’s the most reliable way to determine what we’re dealing with. There are different types of biopsies; for a lung spot, it's often done with a needle guided by a CT scan, meaning it’s minimally invasive. You’d be awake but receive local anesthesia to numb the area. We’ll discuss all the risks and benefits thoroughly before proceeding. And you are absolutely strong enough to handle whatever comes next, Chellsea. Losing your husband is a monumental loss, and it’s understandable to feel like you don’t have the energy for anything else. But we’ll face this together, one step at a time. We have a wonderful oncology team here, and we'll provide all the support you need – emotionally, physically, and spiritually. If it is cancer, there are many treatment options available, and we'll work together to find the best plan for you. Right now, let's focus on getting the necessary tests done and gathering information. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Okay… yes. That… that sounds better. Knowing that there are people who will help… that makes a difference. And… a less invasive biopsy. That’s good. I guess… I guess we can do the tests. But… what about the cost? I’m on Medicare, but… I don’t want to end up with a huge bill I can’t pay. My husband… he handled all the finances. I don’t know how any of this works.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Chellsea, and you're right to ask. Medicare should cover the majority of the costs for these tests, but there may be some out-of-pocket expenses depending on your plan. I can have our billing department contact you directly to go over the specifics and explain your coverage in detail. They can also help you explore any financial assistance programs that you may be eligible for. We have a dedicated financial counselor who specializes in helping patients navigate these kinds of issues. It's their job to ensure you receive the care you need without facing a financial burden. We'll work with you every step of the way to ensure transparency and affordability. So, let’s schedule those tests. I'll get the orders sent to the radiology department, and I’ll have our scheduler contact you to set up appointments. We can also arrange a consultation with the oncology team so they can answer any questions you may have about treatment options, if necessary. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I… I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And for being so patient with me. It’s just… a lot to take in. Yes, please have the scheduler call me. And… the oncology team. I guess I should prepare myself for that possibility. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. It is a lot, and you're handling it remarkably well. Please remember, I'm here for you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. We'll face this together. I'll get the orders sent to radiology and have the scheduler reach out to you. In the meantime, try to focus on taking care of yourself and lean on your support system. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as we have the test results. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Rosanova. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out. We’ll be in touch soon. .
