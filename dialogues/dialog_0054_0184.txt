DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day. It’s about… well, it’s about this. It just… ain’t right no more. Sagging and all. Used to be hard as a rock, you know? Now… not so much. Want it fixed. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing a change in your abdominal area and would like to discuss it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Noticed it? Doctor, I been noticing it for… oh, must be five, six years now. Gradual, you see? Not like it just happened overnight. Started after my wife… well, never you mind about that. Point is, it got worse and worse. Used to have a proper six-pack, back in my pile drivin’ days. Strongest man on the site, they said. Now? Just… flabby. Is that what you need to know? When it started being embarrassing?
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's been a gradual change over the past five or six years. And it’s become more noticeable and concerning for you recently. That's helpful to know. To clarify, when you say "flabby," are you referring to a change in muscle tone, or a general increase in the size of your abdomen?
PATIENT: Size, mostly. Though the muscle… well, it ain’t what it used to be, of course. Always strong, always working. But now... soft. It's mostly the size though, Doctor. I ain't looking to be a bodybuilder again, just... less of it. I used to have proper clothes. Now everything feels tight. It’s a nuisance, that’s what it is. A pure, unadulterated nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an increase in abdominal size and a decrease in muscle tone. And it’s affecting your clothing. Do you notice any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think. Not really… well, sometimes I get a little… wind. More than usual, you know? And… Sometimes I feel a bit… bloated. Like I ate too much, even when I haven't. That bother me sometimes, especially when I'm out. Don’t want to be… uncomfortable. Other than that, nothing much. Just… this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased abdominal size, decreased muscle tone, some bloating, and increased gas. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits—like constipation, diarrhea, or changes in the color or consistency of your stool?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Doctor, you askin' a lot of personal questions now. Look, I came here 'bout my stomach lookin' bad, not… that. It’s normal, mostly. Go to the bathroom when I need to. No different than before, really. Maybe a little… slower, sometimes. But that could just be gettin' old. I ain't a young man anymore, you know. Don’t need to hear about my… what you call it? Stool. Let's get back to fixin' this.
DOCTOR: You're right to set boundaries, Mr. Trendler, and I apologize if my questions felt too personal. I was just trying to get a complete picture. So, to recap, you’ve noticed a gradual increase in abdominal size over the past five or six years, some bloating and gas, and a slightly slower bowel movement. You haven’t noticed any changes in the color or consistency of your stool. Now, before we discuss potential options, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: History? Hmph. What for? I ain't been sick much in my life. Pile drivin' builds a man strong. Had the usual childhood things, measles and all that. Got a touch of the arthritis in me knees now, but that's just from the work. Had me blood pressure checked a few times, always a little high, doctor said watch the salt. That’s about it. Never been in the hospital, never had surgery. Strong constitution, you see? Now, can we talk about fixin’ this, or are you going to keep askin’ questions all day?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of childhood illnesses, some arthritis in your knees, and slightly elevated blood pressure that you’re monitoring with salt intake. No prior hospitalizations or surgeries. That's good to know. To be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Just the usual. A little ibuprofen for the knees when they act up, that’s all. Sometimes a little something for the blood pressure when it gets too high, doctor gave me a small blue pill for that. Can’t remember the name, something… hydro something? And I take a multivitamin every morning, just to keep things regular, you know? Not much else. I don't believe in fillin’ me body with pills if I can help it. Simple life, simple needs. Now, about this stomach... are we gettin' anywhere?
DOCTOR: Alright, so ibuprofen as needed for your knees, a small blue pill for your blood pressure – sounds like hydrochlorothiazide – and a daily multivitamin. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam? You mean… poke and prod? Look, I ain't shy, but I didn’t come here for a full inspection. Just want to know what can be done about it, not have you pokein' around. But… alright. If you have to. Just… be gentle, eh? And don’t take too long. I got things to do. Get on with it then. Quickly now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This will help me assess the sounds within your abdomen. Okay, the sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen – that means I’m going to feel it to check for any tenderness or masses. I’ll start gently and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m noticing some mild softness to the abdomen, and it feels a bit fuller than usual, but no sharp pain when I press. It doesn’t seem to be anything acutely concerning. Now, I'll just check your weight and height. Your weight is 122 pounds, and your height is 178 centimeters. That puts your BMI at… 20.5. That's within the normal range, but on the lower end.
PATIENT: Normal range, you say? Lower end? Hmph. Always been a lean man, even when I was swingin’ the hammer all day. So, what does it mean? Is it somethin’ serious? Are you gonna send me for tests and scans and whatnot? I ain’t got time for that. Just tell me what’s wrong and what can be done to fix it. Is it the food? Is it somethin’ I ate? Or… is it just old age? Don’t beat around the bush, Doctor. I need a straight answer.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, I understand your concern and I’ll be as direct as possible. Based on the exam and what you’ve told me, it doesn’t seem like there’s anything acutely serious going on. The mild fullness and softness of your abdomen, combined with the bloating and changes you’ve described, could be a few things. It’s possible this is related to diet and lifestyle. Things like increased gas-producing foods, changes in your gut bacteria, or even just a slower metabolism as you get older can contribute to this. The slight fullness could also be due to some visceral fat accumulation, which is normal as we age, even in lean individuals. Given your age and medical history, I don't think extensive testing is necessary at this stage. However, to rule out anything more significant and to get a clearer picture, I would recommend a simple blood test. It would check your basic metabolic panel, which includes kidney and liver function, and also look at your inflammatory markers. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Inflammatory markers? Look, I ain't got no inflammation, just a stomach that ain't what it used to be. And I don’t like the sound of blood tests. Always somethin’ with the doctors and their tests. But… if it gets you off me back, alright. Fine. But only the basic one. And no fancy stuff, understand? I want the quickest, simplest test you got. And I want to know the results right away. No waitin’ a week for a phone call. Now, what about fixin’ it? Can you prescribe somethin’ to tighten things up? A pill or somethin’? Or maybe a special diet? Anything to get me lookin’ a little more like me old self?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler, just the basic metabolic panel, and I’ll make sure you get the results as quickly as possible—within a few business days. As for fixing it, there isn’t a single pill that will magically tighten things up. However, we can definitely explore some strategies to help. The most effective approach would involve a combination of diet and exercise. Diet: I recommend focusing on a diet rich in fiber—fruits, vegetables, whole grains—to promote healthy digestion. Reducing your intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and gas-producing foods like beans and carbonated beverages can also help. We can provide you with a handout outlining a gut-friendly diet. Exercise: Regular physical activity, especially core strengthening exercises, can help strengthen your abdominal muscles and improve your overall tone. Regarding supplements, some people find relief with probiotics, which can help balance the gut bacteria. However, the evidence is mixed, and it’s always best to discuss with a doctor before starting any new supplement. We can also discuss options for a referral to a registered dietitian to help you create a personalized meal plan. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: A registered dietitian? More people to poke and prod? Look, I can read a label, I don’t need someone holdin' me hand through the grocery store. Fiber, you say? I eat me vegetables, don’t worry 'bout that. And I already cut out the sugary drinks. Too sweet. So, no magic pill. I figured as much. Alright. I'll try the fiber and keep movin'. And I guess I can do a few exercises. But don't expect miracles, eh? This old body ain't what it used to be. Now, about that blood test… how long will it take, and where do I go? Let’s get it over with. And then I’m outta here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you being willing to try. The blood test will take about 15-20 minutes. You can go to the lab just down the street at 123 Main Street. They’re open Monday through Friday from 8 am to 5 pm. You don’t need an appointment, but it’s always a good idea to call ahead and confirm. The lab tech will give you a requisition form – I'll print that out for you now. Once the results are back, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and how you’re doing with the diet and exercise plan. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: 123 Main Street, eh? Alright, I can find that. And my nurse will call, you say? Make sure she knows I don't want to be kept waitin'. No, I think that's all. I said what I needed to say. Just gettin' too old for all this fuss. Alright then. I'm off. Try not to send me for any more tests, eh? And tell your nurse to call promptly. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand your concerns, and I’ll make sure my nurse is aware of your preference for a prompt call. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you all the best, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
