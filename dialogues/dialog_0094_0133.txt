DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, I just need some papers signed and… verified, I guess you'd say. Some health forms. It's a bit of a hassle, really. I just want to get it over with if we could, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Forms can definitely be a hassle. Melvenia Tippens… Yes, I see them here. Are these forms related to any specific program or assistance you’re applying for?
PATIENT: No, not really applying for anything. It's… for a program my niece is running. She helps folks get settled when they first come to the country. She needs these forms to, well, to prove I'm healthy enough to, uh, sponsor someone. It's complicated. Honestly, I don't understand all the paperwork myself. Just need it signed and official, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I see. So this is for sponsorship paperwork, to demonstrate your good health for immigration purposes. That clarifies things. Alright. Before I sign anything officially, I do want to briefly review some basic medical information, just to ensure the forms are accurate and I'm comfortable attesting to your health status. It’s standard procedure, even if it seems like a simple request. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Standard procedure. That makes sense. Just… try to keep it brief, please? I have a bit of an appointment later this afternoon. Nothing major, but… I'd like to get there on time. What kind of things are you looking at?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand about your appointment. We’ll keep it concise. I'll mainly be asking about any current medical conditions you have, any medications you’re taking, past surgeries or hospitalizations, and any allergies. We’ll also do a quick physical assessment – just checking your blood pressure, heart rate, and listening to your lungs – just to get a baseline. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Blood pressure, heart rate, fine. I don't take any medications, and I haven't been hospitalized in… oh, goodness, decades. Surgeries… let me think. Just my tonsils, when I was a little girl. And… I think that's it. I think. Allergies… not really. Maybe a little sensitive to dust, but who isn't? Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s a very helpful start, Melvenia. No medications, tonsillectomy as a child, and mild dust sensitivity noted. And no other surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. I eat okay, try to get a little walk in when the weather’s nice. My mother always said fresh air was the best medicine, and I suppose she was right. Can we just get this over with, please? I’m starting to get a little anxious just thinking about being late.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. I apologize if I’m making you anxious. We're nearly through the basic questions, and then we can proceed with the physical assessment. Just a couple more quick questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any changes in your weight recently – unintentional weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, now that you mention it… I think I have lost a few pounds. Not on purpose, though. I just haven't been eating as much lately. It’s been hot, you know? Don’t have much of an appetite when it’s a hundred degrees outside. It's probably nothing, really. Just summer. Is that important? I really don’t want to have to go to a specialist or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss noted. It's good you mentioned it, Melvenia. It's good to be aware of any changes, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, especially with the heat affecting your appetite. However, since you have experienced some weight loss, and to ensure the accuracy of this form for sponsorship purposes, I would like to take a quick look at your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and perhaps just listen to your lungs and heart. It will only take a few minutes. Then, based on those findings, we can determine if any further investigation is needed. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… quickly, please. Honestly, this is more trouble than it’s worth. My niece is a lovely girl, but… she does have a tendency to overcomplicate things. Do you need me to… roll up my sleeve or anything?
DOCTOR: No need to unbutton anything just yet. Let’s just start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably and relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Relax. Easier said than done when you're worried about being late, but… I’ll try. Hurry up, please. I think I feel a bit faint. It’s probably just the heat.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 108/65. Your pulse is 72, regular. Your lungs sound clear. Melvenia, have you been feeling any shortness of breath, dizziness, or fatigue lately, beyond what you’ve already mentioned regarding the heat?
PATIENT: Well… maybe a little tired. It's been so hot, and I’m an older woman, you know? Everything takes more effort these days. And… I have been getting a little dizzy when I stand up quickly. But that's just my age, I always assumed. Probably just need to drink more water. Please, can we just sign the papers now? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Melvenia, given the recent unintentional weight loss, the lower blood pressure, and the dizziness you’ve experienced when standing, I’m a bit concerned about possible dehydration or orthostatic hypotension – a drop in blood pressure when you stand. While it could be simply due to the heat, it's important to rule out other potential causes, especially given the requirements for this sponsorship form. To be thorough, I'd like to order a basic blood test – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – to check your hydration levels, electrolytes, and overall health. It's a simple blood draw, and the results will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A blood test? Oh, goodness. No, no, no. I don't want a blood test. I just need the forms signed. It's just for my niece's program, not… not a full medical examination. This is ridiculous. I'm perfectly healthy enough to sponsor someone. Honestly, I think you're overreacting. Can't you just sign the papers? I'll drink more water. I promise. Just… please. .
DOCTOR: Melvenia, I understand your frustration and your desire to simply have these forms completed. However, I have an ethical obligation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of any medical documentation I provide. Signing off on this form without addressing these concerns would be irresponsible, especially given the potential implications for both you and the person you are sponsoring. I'm not trying to overcomplicate things, but I'm simply prioritizing your health and well-being. Given your strong objections to the blood test, and with the understanding that I cannot ethically fulfill this request without addressing these concerns, I am unable to sign these forms at this time. However, I can provide you with a referral to another physician who may be willing to sign off on the forms without performing additional testing. Would you like me to provide you with a list of doctors in the area?
