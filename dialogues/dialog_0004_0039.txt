DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet ya. The nurse told me somethin’ about my cholesterol bein’ high? That’s what all this is about, I reckon. I don’t rightly know what that means, to be honest. Never had much trouble with numbers before.
DOCTOR: Yes, your preliminary blood work did show elevated cholesterol. It is a number, and frankly, one we need to address. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. “High” is relative. Can you tell me, in your own words, has anyone told you about this before, or are you experiencing any symptoms – like perhaps chest pain, shortness of breath, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No, nobody’s ever mentioned it before. Not a soul. And no, thankfully, I ain’t feelin’ none of those things you said. Chest pain, shortness of breath… sounds awful. I feel… well, for eighty-eight years old, I feel pretty good, all things considered. A little stiff in the mornin’, but that’s just age, I suppose. I still get out and do a bit of gardenin’, you know. Mostly just weeds these days, though.
DOCTOR: Gardening, that’s good. Keeps you active. “Stiff in the morning” – is that localized to your back, or more all-over body stiffness?
PATIENT: Mostly my back, Doctor. Lower back, really. And my hips, a little. Been that way for… oh, goodness, probably twenty years now. I just figured it was part of gettin’ old. Never really bothered me enough to see a doctor about it, truth be told. Always been one to tough things out, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think now… Oh, years ago, when I was maybe sixty, the doctor said I had a touch of high blood pressure. Put me on a little pill for it. Took that for… oh, maybe ten years? Stopped takin’ it eventually. Doc said I was doin’ alright without it. Other than that… nothin’ serious. Just the usual aches and pains that come with livin’ a long life, I suppose.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Well, that's a good question. Let me see... Just these two little fellas. The white one’s for my arthritis, helps with the joints a bit, and the yellow one… oh, that’s a vitamin. Can’t remember which one, exactly. My daughter, Elsie, keeps track of that sort of thing. She’s good with the details, always has been.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Elsie’s always askin’ me that, too, whenever I go to a new doctor. “Any allergies, Dad?” she says. And I always tell her, “Nope, I eat just about anything.” She worries somethin’ awful, that girl. Bless her heart. She means well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. They’ve both been gone a long, long time. Pa went first, when I was maybe thirty. Heart trouble, I think. And Ma followed a few years after that. She had… well, I think it was diabetes. She was always tired, and she had to watch what she ate, you know. She wasn’t a strong woman, never really was. My brother, Harold, he’s gone too now. He smoked somethin’ fierce. It's just me and Elsie left, really.
DOCTOR: And did Harold’s smoking cause any specific health issues that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Poor Harold. He got lung cancer, awful bad. Spent months in the hospital. It was… well, it wasn’t a pretty sight. He tried to quit, bless his heart, but he was hooked, you know? Smoked since he was a teenager. And after he passed, Elsie always made sure I never even thought about pickin’ up a cigarette. She said I was too stubborn to let somethin’ like that get a hold of me, though. She’s a smart girl, that Elsie.
DOCTOR: And do you drink alcohol, or use tobacco products yourself?
PATIENT: Nope, never touched the stuff. Not a drop. And tobacco? Lord, no. Not after seein' what it did to Harold. Elsie would have my hide if I even thought about it. She’s very particular about my health, you see. A good girl, that Elsie. Always lookin' out for me. Mostly water for me, Doctor. And maybe a bit of apple juice now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Sure thing, Doctor. There we go. A little creaky, but still goin’ strong. Mostly. You just let me know if you need me to do anything special. Old bones ain’t as nimble as they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: If you could step onto the table, please. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Breathe deeply for me, Mr. Bohnett. Normal breaths… good. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. A bit elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Pulse is regular, 78. Throat looks clear. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Slight edema bilaterally. Do you notice any swelling in your legs or feet at the end of the day?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… yes, a little bit, maybe. Elsie’s been tellin’ me my shoes feel a bit tighter lately. I just figured it was my feet spreadin’ out with age. It don’t bother me none, really. Just a little uncomfortable after bein’ on ‘em all day in the garden. It ain't like I’m runnin’ marathons or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to discuss this further. Given your age, history of hypertension, and slightly elevated blood pressure and edema, I'm concerned about potential heart failure, even though your lungs are currently clear. This does not mean you definitely have it, but we need to investigate. I'm going to order some blood work, including a BNP level – that’s a hormone that can indicate strain on the heart – and an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Well, now you’re usin’ words I don’t rightly understand. BNP level… EKG… sounds serious. Is somethin’ wrong with my heart? You said… heart failure? That sounds awful. I’m just an old man, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life. I don’t want no big, scary procedures or nothin’. I just want to keep gardenin’ and spend time with Elsie. Is there somethin’ I can do to make it better? Just… tell me straight, Doctor. What’s goin’ on?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, please don’t panic. These tests are routine. They will help us understand what’s going on and determine the best course of action. A slightly elevated blood pressure and some mild swelling don't automatically mean heart failure. It could be a number of things. However, given your age and history, we need to be thorough. The BNP level is a simple blood test. An EKG is a painless recording of your heart’s electrical activity. I'm ordering these tests to rule things out, not to scare you. And frankly, at your age, proactive investigation is far more sensible than ignoring potential issues. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Rule things out… that sounds better. Not findin' things, just… lookin'. Elsie always says I worry too much, but it's hard not to when folks start talkin' about hearts and… and all that. So, just some blood work and a… what did you call it? An EKG? No scary procedures? And you’ll tell me what it means when you get the results? Will it take long? I promised Elsie I’d help her with the rhubarb pie this week. She makes the best rhubarb pie in the county, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, just blood work and an EKG. The lab is right down the hall, and the EKG technician is available this afternoon. The results usually take 24-48 hours. We can discuss them at your follow-up appointment. And while we’re waiting for those results, I recommend reducing your salt intake and ensuring you get regular, moderate exercise – like walking, if you’re able. And frankly, Elsie sounds like a very sensible woman. Perhaps she can assist you with tracking your diet and ensuring you follow these recommendations. I’ll also send a referral to a cardiologist for a consultation. It’s better to be cautious. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. I was hopin' to avoid seein' any specialists. But I reckon you know best, Doctor. What kind of exercise is okay? I don’t want to overdo it and… and have a heart attack or nothin’. Elsie’s always tellin’ me I push myself too hard in the garden. And what about the salt? I like a little salt on my tomatoes, you know. Is a little bit okay? I don’t want to change my whole life just yet. I just want to feel good and keep gardenin’ with Elsie.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, a cardiology consultation is precautionary. It doesn't mean you are immediately in danger. It simply means we’re consulting a specialist to get a more comprehensive assessment of your heart health. As for exercise, start with short walks – ten to fifteen minutes at a moderate pace. Do not push yourself to the point of shortness of breath or chest pain. And yes, a little salt on your tomatoes is acceptable, in moderation. We’re not asking you to completely overhaul your lifestyle overnight. However, reducing your overall sodium intake is crucial. I understand your concerns, and I want to reassure you that we’re doing everything we can to ensure your well-being. But frankly, at your age and with your history, ignoring potential issues is far more dangerous than being proactive. I’ll have the nurse provide you with a handout on low-sodium diets and safe exercise guidelines. And I’ll schedule your follow-up appointment for next week. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Handout, low sodium… short walks… I can do that. Elsie will be glad to hear it. She’s always naggin’ me about my diet, bless her heart. Will these tests… will they hurt? I don't like needles, never have. And what if the cardiologist says… says somethin' bad? I just want to keep gardenin’ with Elsie, Doctor. That’s all I ask. Is that too much to ask? I reckon an old man deserves a little bit of gardenin’.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, the blood draw will be a brief pinch – no more than a mosquito bite. And the EKG is completely painless – it involves placing small stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. As for the cardiologist, we will discuss the results together. Let’s not borrow trouble before it arrives. We’re simply gathering information to ensure your continued well-being. I'm going to order the tests now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. I strongly advise you to limit strenuous activity until we have the results. And please, try to relax. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I reckon that’s all for now. Pinch… stickers… no strenuous activity… Elsie will be glad to hear it. She's always worryin' about me. You really think I can still keep gardenin' with her? Even if the tests… even if they find somethin'? That’s all I really care about, Doctor. Just keepin' gardenin' with Elsie. She makes the best rhubarb pie in the county, you know. I wouldn’t want to miss that for the world.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, let’s focus on getting the tests done first. We will address any concerns once we have the results. And yes, I expect you will still be able to enjoy gardening with Elsie. But frankly, you need to be realistic about potential limitations. I’ll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood. Please let me know if you have any questions.
