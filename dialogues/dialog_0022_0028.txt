DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, this cough… it just won’t quit. It’s been going on for a while now, and honestly, it’s tiring me out. Especially with my heart not being what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that’s been lingering and is making you tired, especially given your heart condition. I understand. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… mostly dry, I think. Not much phlegm comes up, if that makes sense. And it happens mostly when I lie down, or when I’ve been… well, doing anything, really. Even just talking sometimes sets it off. It’s just… there. It’s not a bad cough, not painful, but it’s constant. It keeps me up at night, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly dry, happens with exertion and lying down, and is keeping you up at night. That’s helpful. And you said it's not painful, just…constant. Does anything seem to trigger it specifically, besides lying down and talking?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Dust, maybe? If I’m doing a bit of cleaning and stir up some dust, it gets worse. And cold air. If I go outside when it’s chilly, it always seems to start up again. Not immediately, but within a bit. Oh! And sometimes after I eat, if I eat too fast. It's silly, I know. But that seems to do it sometimes too.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound silly at all. Those are all very good observations. Dust, cold air, and eating quickly. Okay. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Well… I do get a little more short of breath than usual, maybe. I always have to stop and rest a bit when I walk to the mailbox now, which I didn’t used to. And sometimes my ankles swell up at the end of the day. I thought that was just the heat, to be honest. But it’s been happening a lot lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased shortness of breath and ankle swelling. That’s important to know, especially with your heart history. Just to clarify, when you say shortness of breath, is it a sudden, sharp feeling, or more of a gradual tiredness when you’re active?
PATIENT: It's more gradual, Doctor. Not like I suddenly can’t breathe. It just… takes more effort. I have to stop and catch my breath. And it feels like I'm not getting enough air, even when I do stop. It's not a panic feeling, just… tired lungs, I guess. It's hard to explain. It’s definitely worse when I’ve been coughing a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand, that sounds quite tiring. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have a list of your current medications with you, or can you tell me what you're taking?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Let’s see… I take Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day for my blood pressure. And Furosemide, 40 milligrams, every morning for the swelling. And… that’s it, I think. Oh, and sometimes, if I’m really hurting, I take Tylenol, but not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, Furosemide for swelling, and Tylenol as needed. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Though, I don’t eat shellfish anymore. I just don’t like the taste, not an allergy. And I try to avoid peanuts, just because I’ve heard stories. But I haven’t ever had a problem with them myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, avoid shellfish and peanuts as a precaution. Good to know. Now, have you had any previous surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, probably… forty years ago? And I was in the hospital for a bit when my heart first started acting up, maybe fifteen years ago. That's when they diagnosed me with heart failure. Other than that… no, I don't think so. Just the usual bumps and bruises.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal forty years ago, and hospitalization for heart failure fifteen years ago. And now, just to get a complete picture, is there a family history of heart problems, lung disease, or anything else significant that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My father had a weak heart, too. He passed away when he was fairly young, maybe in his sixties. And my brother, he had emphysema. He smoked, though, so… that probably didn’t help. My mother, she lived to be ninety, so she was pretty healthy. But my father’s heart… that’s what worries me, you know? It seems to run in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems on your father’s side and lung disease on your brother’s side. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure and oxygen levels, and feel your ankles to see if there’s any swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and I’m hearing some crackling in your lungs, which could indicate fluid buildup. Your heart rhythm is a bit irregular, and there’s a murmur, which we’ve noted before. And your ankles are slightly swollen. I’m also noting some mild shortness of breath just from talking. This information, combined with your history, suggests we need to investigate this a bit further. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to see if there is fluid in your lungs. We should also do an EKG to assess your heart rhythm and a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any infection. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then let’s do it. X-ray, EKG, and blood test. I trust your judgment. Are those things done here? Will I need to go somewhere else?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do all of those tests right here in the clinic. The X-ray technician will come in shortly to take the chest X-ray. Then, the nurse will draw some blood for the lab tests. And I'll perform the EKG in the exam room after that. It shouldn't take too long. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to increase your Furosemide dose to 60 milligrams daily to see if we can reduce some of the fluid buildup. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. More of the water pill, right? Okay. That makes sense. I just want to feel better, Doctor. It’s tiring being out of breath all the time. So whatever you think will help.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It is tiring. We'll do our best to get you feeling better. Okay, the nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to draw your blood and start the EKG. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Well… how long will it take to get the results? And… will I feel worse before I feel better with the extra water pill? I always get so thirsty with that stuff. And will I need to avoid salt? I try to eat healthy, but… sometimes a little bit of seasoning makes things taste better.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions. The results for the X-ray and blood tests usually take about an hour or two. The EKG results are available almost immediately. You're right to ask about the extra water pill. It can make you feel a little more thirsty and you may need to urinate more frequently. It's also possible you might feel a little weak initially as your body adjusts. We'll monitor you closely, and if you feel too weak or dizzy, let us know immediately. Regarding salt, yes, reducing your salt intake is important, especially with heart failure. It helps to prevent fluid retention. You don't need to eliminate it completely, but try to be mindful of your intake. Avoiding processed foods, fast food, and adding extra salt to your meals is a good start. We have some dietary guidelines we can provide if you'd like. We will review the results as soon as they are available and discuss the next steps. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I just want to breathe easier, that's all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. I understand, and we will do our best to help you breathe easier. Maria will be in shortly to start the tests. Please don't hesitate to call us if you experience any new or worsening symptoms while you're waiting. I'll be back as soon as the results are available.
