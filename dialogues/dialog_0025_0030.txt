DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in how I smell, my body odor. It’s…different. Not worse, exactly, just…not me. I noticed it maybe a week or so ago, and it’s been bothering me.
DOCTOR: Different how?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It’s hard to explain. I usually just smell…clean, you know? Like soap. Now it’s…sweeter, almost. And a little…pungent? Not like BO, but not fresh, either. I work hard all day, laying floors, so I do sweat, but this is different than just regular sweat smell. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re paying attention to changes in your body, Ms. Purtee. It can be concerning, and we need to figure out what’s going on. “Sweeter, almost pungent…” Okay. Now, have you started using any new soaps, deodorants, lotions, or detergents recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. I’ve been using the same things for years, practically. Dove soap, Secret deodorant… and Tide for the laundry. I did try a new fabric softener a couple months ago – the Downy one with the April fresh scent. But I stopped using that pretty quickly, it didn't seem to clean as well. I switched back to the regular Tide one. So, not new new, but I did try that for a little bit.
DOCTOR: Fabric softener... those things are just full of chemicals. Alright. Now, are you experiencing any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. I’ve been a little more tired lately, but that could just be the work, you know? It’s hot out, and laying floors is really physical. My appetite is normal, I haven't lost or gained any weight. No fever, no rashes… I can't think of anything else. Oh! My period was a little late this month, but that’s happened before. I’m 49, things are getting…irregular. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Everything is relevant, Ms. Purtee. Irregular cycles at your age are…common, but we still need to rule out other possibilities. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any conditions like diabetes or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Never been diagnosed with either one. I had high blood pressure for a little while, maybe ten years ago, but it went down with diet and exercise. My doctor took me off the medication. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, really. I mean, I ache after work, but that's just part of the job. I had a hysterectomy about five years ago, though. That’s probably important, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, the hysterectomy is important. What was the reason for that, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Not at all. It was fibroids. Really big ones. They were causing a lot of bleeding and pain, so my doctor said it was the best option. It was a pretty rough recovery, but I’m glad it’s over with. It was five years ago in June, 2020. I don't remember the exact date, but around then. I went to Dr. Abernathy for that, if that helps. He's since retired, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family. Any history of unusual body odor, or any significant medical conditions in your family – diabetes, thyroid issues, cancers?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tough one. My mother had diabetes, type 2, later in life. And my grandmother on my father’s side had thyroid problems, I think. She was always cold, even in the summer. As for unusual body odor...no, not that I remember. My family is pretty…normal, health-wise. Everyone smells like everyone else, you know? Nothing stands out. Oh, my uncle had skin cancer, but that was on his face, from being in the sun too much. Does that count?
DOCTOR: It's good to be thorough, Ms. Purtee. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if my knees are really aching, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s it. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I mostly just try to rest and ice my knees when they bother me. It’s just part of getting older, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and take a look at your skin. It's unlikely to find anything definitive right away, but it's best to rule things out. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: You can undress from the waist up and put on a gown. I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'll palpate your thyroid gland. Afterwards, I will quickly visually examine your skin, paying attention to any unusual areas. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the examination.
PATIENT: Okay. This is a little awkward, but I understand. I'll just get changed. I'm ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in…and out. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Thyroid is not enlarged, no nodules palpable. Skin is clear, no rashes or unusual lesions noted. No obvious abnormalities detected during the physical exam. However, the change in body odor is still concerning. I think we should order some bloodwork to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Bloodwork is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the bloodwork? Do I need to fast, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, just water. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid levels, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. It will give us a good overview of your overall health. I'll also order a urinalysis, just to be thorough. The lab is right down the hall. I’ll send the orders over electronically. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions about the tests or the fasting requirements?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Eight hours of fasting, and they’ll call me to schedule it. That’s pretty straightforward. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this for me. I was starting to worry it was something…serious.
DOCTOR: It's good you came in, Ms. Purtee. Most likely, it's nothing serious, but it's always best to rule things out. We’ll get these results back as quickly as possible. I’ll give you a call as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you notice any other symptoms – fever, weight loss, excessive fatigue – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. I really appreciate your help, Doctor Fourney. I'll keep an eye out for any other symptoms, and I’ll wait for the lab to call. Thank you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Purtee. Have a good day. .
