DOCTOR: Good morning, Criston. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my pee. It's orange. It started, maybe, two days ago? I don't know why. It's a little... scary looking.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine, starting two days ago. That is enough to be a bit concerning, so you’re right to get it checked out. Let's try to figure out what might be going on. First, can you describe the color a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm... like, not light orange. More... like, the color of carrot juice? A dark orange. Not red, definitely not yellow. Just... orange. Like when you make juice from carrots. Is that... helpful? I drink a lot of water, so it's usually very clear.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. Carrot-juice orange, and normally clear urine, that gives me a better picture. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at all. It feels normal when I go to the bathroom. Just... the color is different. A little strange. I don't feel sick, or anything. No fever, no stomach pain. Just orange pee.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no other symptoms... that's good. Now, have you made any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes to food? Hmm... Not really. I eat the same things, most days. Chicken, rice, vegetables... sometimes fish. My wife makes tagine, usually. Maybe a little more carrots in the tagine this week? But not a lot. I don't think so. Is it the carrots? Can carrots do that?
DOCTOR: It can be the carrots, though usually it takes a significant amount to turn your urine that color. Let’s explore some other possibilities. Do you take any vitamins or supplements at all?
PATIENT: Vitamins? Um... yes! I take a multivitamin. Every morning, with breakfast. It's... it's just a regular one, from the store. I think it has Vitamin C in it? I don't really look at the label. My wife buys it. Is that what's doing it?
DOCTOR: That's a strong possibility. Some vitamins, particularly those containing high doses of beta-carotene – often found in multivitamins – can cause your urine to appear orange. To be sure, let's do a quick urine test here in the office. It's a simple dipstick test that will check for several things, including blood, bilirubin, and other substances that could cause a change in color. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A test is good. I like to know what's going on. I'm happy to do whatever you need. Where do I... do I need to go somewhere?
DOCTOR: Perfect. No need to go anywhere special. We'll do it right here in the examination room. I’ll just have you collect a small sample in this cup. I'll give you a moment of privacy. There’s a bathroom just down the hall, and I’ve left the instructions on the counter. Just let me know when you're finished, and I’ll come take a look.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I'll go do that now. Just down the hall, you said? I'll try not to take too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, just down the hall on the left. Take your time, and don't hesitate to call out if you have any questions. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Okay, I think I did it right. Here you go. It was... not very much. Sorry. I didn't have much to give.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Criston. That’s perfectly fine – a small sample is all we need. Now, let me just run this through the analyzer. It will only take a moment. Okay… interesting. The test shows no blood, no bilirubin, and normal levels of everything else. However, it does show a slightly elevated urobilinogen level. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but it can sometimes contribute to darker urine and can be linked to mild dehydration, or even certain liver conditions. Since you said you drink plenty of water, let's lean towards mild dehydration, for now. To be more certain, and to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a basic metabolic panel – a blood test. It'll give us a more comprehensive look at your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A blood test? Okay... um... is it a lot of needles? I don't like needles very much. But if it's important, I can do it. What will it show? And... will it take long to get the results?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable – nobody likes needles! It’s just a standard blood draw, a small amount of blood from your arm. It’s a quick process, usually only a few seconds of discomfort. The basic metabolic panel will give us information about your kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. It will help us determine if the elevated urobilinogen is a one-time thing or if there's something else going on. Results typically take 24-48 hours, depending on the lab. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I'd recommend increasing your fluid intake slightly, just to be on the safe side. Aim for at least eight glasses of water per day. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Eight glasses... okay. I can do that. More water. And a blood test. Okay, yes. Let's do the blood test. If it makes you feel better, I want to know what's going on. Just... tell me when it's happening. And... where do I go for it? Is it here?
DOCTOR: That’s the best approach, Criston. I understand your apprehension, but it’s good to be proactive. The blood draw will be done right here in the clinic. I’ll have my nurse, Fatima, come in and draw it for you. She’s very skilled and gentle. She’ll be in shortly to get started. She'll explain the process and answer any questions you might have. In the meantime, do you have any other concerns or anything else you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just... the orange pee. I hope it's nothing serious. I'm mostly worried about it being something bad. But you seem to think it's probably okay, so... I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your trust, Criston. It’s good to be cautious, and I assure you, we're taking all the necessary steps to figure this out. It could be something simple, like dehydration, and we'll have a clearer picture once we get the blood test results. Fatima should be in any moment now. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns between now and then.
