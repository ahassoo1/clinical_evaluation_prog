DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe my insurance requires a check-up beforehand, a clearance, they called it? It’s all a little…fuzzy, to be honest. I’m Mackenzi Brightful, by the way. Though you likely already know that.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Brightful. Yes. Insurance. Always something. Look, I'm a busy man, so let's try to be concise. You said something about a surgery?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s…a cosmetic procedure. I’m hoping to get some things…adjusted. It's quite personal, really. I lost my husband a few years ago, and…well, things just haven't felt right since. I'm not very good at explaining, I apologize. It’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. Do you need to know what specifically I’m hoping to have done? I just assumed the clearance was the important part.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Brightful, I need something to work with here. “Adjusted” doesn't tell me anything medically relevant. Are we talking about…breast augmentation?
PATIENT: Oh…um. No, not…exactly. It’s my stomach, actually. After having children… and then, well, everything else… it just…changed. I’d like to have it…tighter, I suppose. A tummy tuck, is that what it’s called? I’m terribly sorry, I don’t know all the proper terms. I just know what I want it to look like. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Tummy tuck. Right. Okay. So, you’re requesting medical clearance for an abdominoplasty. Any previous surgeries?
PATIENT: Previous surgeries… hmm. That's a good question. I had… a C-section with both of my children, naturally. And… I think I had my appendix removed when I was younger? It was a very long time ago, and I wasn’t very involved in the details. My mother handled most of it. I’m afraid I don’t recall the year, or even the hospital. I apologize for being so vague. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: C-sections, appendix. Fine. Any medical problems?
PATIENT: Medical problems… let me see. I had… high blood pressure for a while, after my husband passed, the doctor said it was stress related. They put me on medication, but I haven’t taken it in… oh, it must be at least two years now. I felt much better once I started gardening, honestly. It keeps me busy. I also get… migraines sometimes, but they aren’t very frequent. And… I have allergies, mostly seasonal. Is that enough? Should I be thinking of anything else?
DOCTOR: Allergies and stress-related hypertension, off medication. Are you currently taking any medications, prescriptions or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not currently. Just… herbal teas, mostly. Chamomile for sleep, peppermint for my stomach. Nothing prescribed, or anything that would… interfere, I assume? I haven’t needed anything else. Though, I did take ibuprofen occasionally for the migraines, but that was very rare. Perhaps once or twice a year. I really try to avoid medication if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your weight has been…stable?
PATIENT: Stable… well, it fluctuates a little, of course. I’m around… 93 kilograms, I think? I haven’t weighed myself recently, to be honest. It's…difficult to talk about. After my husband… my appetite wasn't very good. I've been trying to eat better, though. Mostly salads and vegetables. I’m 155 centimeters tall, if that helps. Is that…a problem? Should I be a certain weight for the surgery?
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms… that's… significant. Look, Ms. Brightful, abdominoplasty carries risks. Especially with your weight. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could complicate things. Are you diabetic?
PATIENT: Diabetic? No, Doctor, I don’t think so. No one has ever told me that. I haven't been tested for that, as far as I know. My husband always handled the doctor's appointments… He said I worried too much. I…I don’t understand. Is my weight a problem for the surgery? I thought… I thought that’s what cosmetic procedures were for. To help with things like that? I'm so confused now.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Brightful, I'm just going through the motions here. It's standard procedure. Before we approve you for elective surgery, we need to ensure you're healthy enough to withstand it. Given your weight, we'll need to run some blood work. A full panel. And an EKG. Just to be safe. Can you schedule that with the lab downstairs?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Blood work and… an EKG. That sounds… sensible. If that's what you need. I just want to make sure everything is alright. Yes, I can schedule that downstairs. What name should I use? And… will that take very long? I have a few commitments this week.
DOCTOR: Schedule with the lab under your name, Mackenzi Brightful. Tell them it’s for pre-operative clearance. It shouldn't take more than an hour. I'll review the results when they come back. If everything checks out, we can discuss the surgery further. But frankly, Ms. Brightful, I'm not making any promises. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I don’t think so. Just the blood work and EKG. And schedule it under my name. Thank you. Do you think…do you think I should call if I remember anything else? Anything at all? I'm so sorry for being so… forgetful.
