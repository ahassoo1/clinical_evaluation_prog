DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit of an odd request, actually. I need a letter saying I’m able to fly. My husband… passed away last year, and I’m finally getting around to going to visit family in Mongolia. The airline needs a doctor’s note, just confirming I’m healthy enough for a long flight.
DOCTOR: A letter stating you're fit to fly… Right. Well, it's not exactly a standard medical complaint, but I suppose airlines have their procedures. So, just to be clear, you're saying you don't have any current medical problems that would prevent you from traveling?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I’m generally very healthy. I take good care of myself. Medicare keeps on top of things, you know? Regular check-ups and all that. It’s just… they want something on letterhead. And my regular doctor retired a few months ago, and I haven’t established care with anyone new yet. That's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see. It's… efficient, I suppose, to seek this out this way. Still, it’s a bit unusual. To properly complete this, I’m going to need some information, Ms. Sayar. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing chronic. I've never been diagnosed with anything like that. Honestly, I’m pretty lucky when it comes to health. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, but nothing serious. My husband… he had some issues with his heart, that's why I'm so mindful of staying healthy, but I’ve always been a picture of health, really. I can give you names and dates of doctors I’ve seen in the past if that helps?
DOCTOR: Past doctors aren’t terribly relevant if you’re currently healthy. Though, if you did have a significant illness, even in the past, it’s good to know. Let’s move on. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries at all. Never needed one. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, climbing a tree – that needed a cast, but no actual surgery. Otherwise, nothing. I’m… I’m sorry if this feels like a waste of your time, Doctor. It just seems like a simple letter, and I really need to get this sorted out quickly. My family is expecting me.
DOCTOR: It’s not a waste of my time, Ms. Sayar, though I do have other patients to see. I simply need to be thorough. You said your husband had heart issues?
PATIENT: Yes. He had… cardiomyopathy, I think it was called. It was quite serious. He needed a lot of medication and… well, he passed away from it. That was last October. It’s why I’m so careful now, I guess. Always thinking about being healthy, getting enough rest, eating right. I just want to make sure everything is okay before I travel, you know? A long flight... it worries me a little, just in case something were to happen.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no family history of any significant cardiac issues on your side?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. My parents were both very healthy. They lived to be quite old, actually. My mother passed away a few years ago, natural causes, and my father… he’s still living in Mongolia, that’s where I’m going to visit him. He's 85, and still quite active. Neither of them had any heart problems or anything like that. It was really just my husband. It was… unexpected, and quite frightening. That’s another reason why I’m being so cautious now. I just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None at all. I can eat anything, take any medication without a problem. I've never had a reaction to anything. I really am quite fortunate, Doctor. I just… I don’t want to cause any trouble, or take up too much of your time. If you think this is something you can’t help with, please just let me know. I can go somewhere else.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, I assure you, I am perfectly capable of writing a letter stating you are fit to fly. I simply need to complete a basic assessment. Have you been taking any medications currently, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, actually. I do take a multivitamin every day. Just a standard one, you know? For general health. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. But that’s it. Honestly, that’s it. Really. Just the multivitamin and the occasional ibuprofen. I'm sorry, I should have mentioned that earlier. It didn’t seem important.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how would you describe your current activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I try to stay active. I walk every day, usually for about thirty minutes. I also do some gardening. It’s not strenuous, but it keeps me moving. And I help my father with his farm when I visit Mongolia, that's more physical. So, I’m not completely sedentary, but I don’t go to the gym or anything like that. I'm not a marathon runner, if that’s what you’re asking! It's just… normal, everyday activity. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you’ve told me, you appear to be in generally good health. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs just to be thorough. Then I'll write you a note. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, that sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to do this. And… I’m sorry for being so… detailed. I just want to be absolutely certain everything is okay before I travel. It means a lot to me.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, please. And again. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… regular. A little rapid, but not concerning given your anxiety about the trip. Blood pressure is 128/78, pulse is 82. Weight is 131 pounds, height is 176 centimeters. Alright. Everything seems within normal limits. I'll write you a note stating you are medically fit to fly. It will be on official clinic letterhead.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor Kur. I really appreciate it. You’ve put my mind at ease. Is there anything I need to do, or any paperwork I need to fill out? And… how long will it take to get the note? I’m trying to finalize my travel arrangements as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Here you go. That confirms you are medically cleared for air travel. No restrictions. Just sign that release form to confirm I can share your medical information with the airline if needed. It’s standard procedure. Otherwise, you're all set. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Thank you so much again, Doctor. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to see me, and for writing the note so quickly. It means a lot to me. I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Kur. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Sayar. Safe travels. .
