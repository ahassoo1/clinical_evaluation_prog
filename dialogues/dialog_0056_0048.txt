DOCTOR: Hi Colt, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Amussen. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s these… spells, I suppose you could call them. My wife, she’s been after me to come in for a while now. I get confused, you see. Not all the time, but enough to worry her. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsettling is a good way to put it. And it’s smart of your wife to encourage you to get it checked out. So, these “spells” – can you tell me a little more about what happens when you get confused?
PATIENT: It’s hard to explain. Things… aren't right. Like I’ll be in the middle of something – fixing a tile, usually – and suddenly I don’t know where I am. Or what I was doing. Just… blank. It doesn't last long, maybe a few minutes. Long enough to make a mess of things, though. And it’s embarrassing, frankly. A man should know what he’s doing with his own hands.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frightening and frustrating when things don't feel quite right like that. A few minutes of confusion can definitely be concerning. Do these episodes happen when you're doing anything else besides fixing tiles, or is that a common trigger?
PATIENT: Mostly tiles. I’ve been setting stone and tile for… well, too long to count. But I think… maybe once or twice it happened when I was watching the television. Just… lost my train of thought. But usually, it’s when I’m working. It’s a precise job, you see. Requires focus. Not like these young folks, just slapping things down without a care.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be more associated with the focused work of tile setting. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms around the time these episodes happen?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I don't get sick, not usually. A little ache in my back, that's it. From bending over all day. But no fever, no… dizziness. Just the confusion. And a bit of a headache afterwards, maybe. It’s hard to say if that's from the confusion or from straining my eyes, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no dizziness. Just the confusion, and potentially a headache afterwards. Have these episodes been getting more frequent, or staying about the same?
PATIENT: More frequent, I think. My wife keeps a calendar, writes everything down. She says there were maybe one a month a few months back. Now… now it’s almost every other week. It’s starting to interfere with my work, you see. I can’t be relying on her to remind me what I’m doing all the time. A man has his pride.
DOCTOR: Okay, increasing frequency is definitely something we want to look into. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. The doctor – a young one, didn’t remember his name – put me on some pills for it. A little white one, I think. Take it every morning. Aside from that… no, nothing major. I eat alright, mostly. My wife makes sure of that. And I get by. I’ve always been a strong man. Never really needed much in the way of… coddling.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with a little white pill. Do you happen to know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I just take what she gives me. She handles all the… paperwork. Names and numbers, it all blurs together. It’s a small pill, that's all I know. She gets it filled at the pharmacy down the street, the one near the bakery. Honestly, I’m more concerned with getting back to my work. These episodes are costing me money.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's okay, we can try to track down the medication name later. I understand your frustration about getting back to work – it’s important. Now, have you ever had any head injuries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Head injuries? Not that I recall. A few scrapes when I was a boy, playing with the other kids, but nothing serious. Knocked my head a few times on low ceilings in older houses while I was working, but just a little bump. Nothing that knocked me out, or anything like that. I've always been careful. A man needs his wits about him in this trade.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant head injuries. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, etc. – had problems with memory loss or confusion?
PATIENT: My mother… she got a little forgetful towards the end. Old age, mostly, I think. She'd misplace things, ask the same questions. But she lived a long life, you see. Ninety-two years. And my father… he was a strong man, always sharp as a tack. Never a hint of confusion. My sister, she's still living in Cambodia. Don't hear from her much. No idea what she's up to.
DOCTOR: Okay, some forgetfulness in your mother, but no major memory issues in your father or as far as you know, your sister. Final few questions about your habits. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little beer sometimes. With dinner, usually. Not every night, mind you. Maybe three or four times a week. Nothing excessive. Helps me relax after a long day on my feet. And I certainly don't drink alone. My wife and I, we'll have one or two with our meal.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate alcohol consumption. And do you smoke?
PATIENT: Never have. Never will. My wife hates it, and frankly, I can't stand the smell. Always thought it was a foolish habit. A waste of money, and bad for your health. No, I’ve always been a healthy man. These episodes… they're just a nuisance. A frustrating nuisance, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for answering all my questions, Colt. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. The sooner I know what’s going on, the sooner I can get back to work. Just try to be quick about it, Doctor. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. That’s a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history of high blood pressure. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There. Done. Is that all? These tests aren't going to tell you anything I don't already know. I feel fine, mostly. Just a little… confused sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now, could you walk a straight line for me, heel-to-toe, like you're on a tightrope?
PATIENT: See? This is pointless! I’m a tile setter, not a circus performer! I’m perfectly steady on my feet when I’m working. This floor is uneven, that’s what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. The floor isn't perfectly level, you're right. But I'm noting some slight difficulty with balance and coordination. Now, I want to be thorough. I'm going to order some blood work to check your overall health, and I’d also like to get a brain scan – a CT scan – just to rule out any structural issues. It's a precaution, and it will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: A brain scan? Now you're talking nonsense, Doctor. I told you, I’m fine! It’s just a little confusion, a few spells. You want to poke around in my brain for that? I don’t like the sound of that at all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Colt. It sounds frightening, I agree. But a CT scan is a non-invasive imaging test – it uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of your brain. It won't involve any needles or surgery. It’s the best way to rule out anything serious, like a small stroke, a tumor, or other issues that could be causing these episodes. It’s important to be thorough, especially with the increasing frequency you’ve described. We need to understand what’s going on to get you back to work, and feeling like yourself again. Would you be willing to consider it?
PATIENT: Fine. But if it doesn't show anything, I don’t want any more poking and prodding. And you better explain everything to me, in plain English. No medical jargon. My wife will come with me, she can handle the paperwork. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Colt. That’s perfectly fair. We’ll explain everything in plain English, and your wife is welcome to come with you for support. We'll schedule the CT scan at the imaging center down the street. The results will take a day or two to come back. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a referral to a neurologist - a brain specialist. They can review the scan results with you and determine the best course of action. I’ll also give you a list of things to watch out for - any new symptoms, worsening confusion, weakness on one side of your body, or trouble speaking. It’s important to let us know right away if you experience any of those. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Neurologist… fine. But no more tests after that, understand? I need to get back to my work. These spells are costing me money, and I’m not getting any younger. Just… get me a report, and let me know when I can come pick it up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Colt. I understand. No unnecessary tests, we'll focus on getting you the answers you need. I'll have my assistant schedule the CT scan and the neurology appointment, and she’ll give you all the paperwork and instructions. We'll get you a copy of the report as soon as it's available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call us. Here’s a list of those symptoms. Is there anything I can answer for you before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that's all. Just… get it done. Thank you, Doctor.
