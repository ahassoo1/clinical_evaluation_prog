DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 76 years old. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that's right. Seventy-six, though I feel younger most days! I just need some papers signed, really. Some health forms that need verifying, you see. It’s for… well, it doesn’t matter what it’s for exactly, just need them notarized, I suppose. Is that what you do here?
DOCTOR: While I am a medical doctor, Ms. Tippens, and capable of notarizing documents, this clinic isn’t generally used for simple form verification. We address health concerns. However, given your age and that you’re presenting for medical attention—even if indirect—I do believe a brief consultation is prudent. It’s standard procedure. Now, let’s try to be efficient. Are you experiencing any health issues at all?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… considerate, I suppose. Efficient is good, yes. Health issues… hmm. Not anything major. My knees ache a bit when it rains, you know, like everyone else my age. And I get tired easier than I used to. But I wouldn’t say it’s a problem, exactly. It’s just… getting old. I just need the forms signed, honestly. Will this consultation take long?
DOCTOR: “Just getting old” can encompass a multitude of things, Ms. Tippens. And it’s precisely those ‘small’ things that can indicate underlying issues. It’s my responsibility to ascertain that. To be thorough, I'll need to ask a few questions. Let's start with your knees. You mentioned they ache with rain. Is it a constant ache, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly with the weather, like I said. Damp days are the worst. And if I’ve been on my feet too long. It’s not… sharp, you understand? More of a dull throbbing. It doesn’t swell or anything, just… uncomfortable. I get by with a little liniment and resting when I need to. Really, it’s nothing to worry about. Can we just get to the signing now? I have errands.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, with all due respect, dismissing symptoms as “just” something is not responsible healthcare. I understand you have errands, but I need to fulfill my duty of care. Let’s move on. You also mentioned fatigue. How long have you been feeling more tired than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Alright, alright. You're the doctor, I suppose. It’s been… a few months, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. I used to be able to garden all day, but now I have to take breaks. And I find myself napping in the afternoons, which I never used to do. It's just… getting older. You asked about the fatigue, right? I don’t get short of breath, and I haven’t lost any weight. I'm still eating alright. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is… marginally helpful, Ms. Tippens. But I still need a more complete picture. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. My eyesight’s not what it used to be, but that’s expected. And I forget things sometimes, little things, you know? Like where I put my glasses… which is ironic, isn’t it? But I wouldn’t say I’m losing my mind or anything. No dizziness, no headaches… honestly, Doctor, I'm a pretty healthy 76-year-old. Can we please get to the forms now? I really need to be going.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I understand your frustration, but I am obligated to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… let me see. Years ago, Dr. Ramirez said my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on a little pill, and I took it for a while. I don’t take it anymore, though. It made me feel funny. And… I think he mentioned something about my cholesterol being a bit high once, too? But honestly, I can't remember all the details. It was a long time ago. I don't have any current conditions, if that’s what you’re asking. Can we please just get this done? I’m starting to feel anxious. .
DOCTOR: “A little pill” and “a little high” are not sufficient information, Ms. Tippens. It's crucial to know what medication you were on, and what the readings were. This clinic takes patient care very seriously. Before I proceed further with the forms—which I assure you, I will get to—I need a complete medical history. I will access your EHR now. Please remain seated.
