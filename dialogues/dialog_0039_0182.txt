DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, let’s get this over with. I need a clearance for… a little something I’m having done. My daughter insisted on it. Says I need a doctor’s okay. Honestly, all this fuss… it’s just a bit of smoothing out, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a clearance for a procedure. Smoothing out… alright. And your daughter is quite right to encourage you to get checked out beforehand, that's very thoughtful of her. Just to be sure everything is alright. Could you tell me a little more about this "smoothing out"?
PATIENT: It's… on my face. You know, wrinkles. Getting old, what can you do? It's not like it's a big deal. Some injections, I think. She booked the appointment for me. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to these things. I just want it done quickly and efficiently. Don't need a lecture on vanity, you understand? I’ve lived a life.
DOCTOR: Oh, absolutely, Mr. Orwin. No lecture at all! It’s perfectly alright to want to feel your best, and there’s nothing wrong with a little cosmetic work. I understand. We just need to make sure you're a good candidate for it, and that there won’t be any problems. Now, have you had any procedures like this done before?
PATIENT: No. Never. This is a first. And frankly, I doubt it’ll be the last if it takes this much bother. My wife… well, she wouldn’t have bothered with any of this. Practical woman. I've always been a practical man myself, usually. But my daughter… she's got a different idea of things. All this… self-care. Bah.
DOCTOR: I see. And that’s perfectly fine, Mr. Orwin. It's good to have daughters who look out for us. Now, let's just go through a quick bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Just so I have a full picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, that’s about it. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Been on it for… oh, ten years maybe? Never had a reaction to it. Aside from that, I eat everything. Drink everything, mostly coffee. And smoked for a good many years, but gave it up when the wife… well, you understand. Don't see the point dwelling on it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Thank you for telling me. It's helpful to know these things. Lisinopril… alright. And do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just… old age. Aching joints. It's what happens when you spend sixty years working with stone, you know? Terrazzo. Tough work. Had a bad back for a while, but it's mostly manageable now. I’ve got a bit of arthritis in my hands, makes it hard to… well, do fine work, but I manage. Nothing a bit of coffee can’t fix. Honestly, doctor, is this really necessary? I’m a sturdy Norwegian, not some delicate flower.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. You’re right, a sturdy Norwegian! But even sturdy Norwegians need to be checked out before undergoing any procedure, just to be safe. It's a routine precaution. And it helps us to ensure the injections won't interact with anything, or cause any unforeseen problems with your arthritis or back. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses? Not that I recall. Had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. A broken arm once, falling off a roof when I was a young fool. Aside from that… nothing. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Tough as nails, my wife used to say. Now, are we nearly finished here? I've got a bit of a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. So, appendix removal as a boy, broken arm… very good. And your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother lived to a good old age, but she had… something with her heart, I think. My father was strong, worked with his hands his whole life, like me. He died in an accident, nothing to do with illness. My sister… she had high blood pressure, I think. It’s all a bit vague, to be honest. We weren't a family for talking about ailments. Just got on with things. Is this really important? I feel like I’m wasting my time here. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. It’s alright if it’s vague. We just try to cover all the bases. Now, before we finish, let's just do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at the areas where you’ll be getting the injections. Is that alright with you?
