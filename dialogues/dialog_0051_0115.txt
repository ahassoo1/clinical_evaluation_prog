DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s my skin. It’s… yellowing, you see. A bit frightening, really. My friend told me to come. Something about my liver? I don't recall the specifics, truthfully. It's all a bit of a blur these days. I hope it isn't too serious.
DOCTOR: I understand. Yellowing of the skin… that’s called jaundice, and it can be caused by a number of things. Your friend is right to be concerned, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. It can be related to the liver, yes, but there are other possibilities too. You mentioned it’s all a bit of a blur… that’s perfectly alright. We’ll take our time. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me when you first noticed the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. When did I first notice… Let me think. It’s been… a few weeks, I believe? Perhaps a month? It started gradually, and I didn’t pay much attention at first, thinking it was just the lighting. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you know. Everything looks a bit… washed out these days. I truly can’t pinpoint the exact date, I’m afraid. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Annelle. A general timeframe is very helpful. A few weeks to a month… that gives us a starting point. And it's perfectly normal for things to seem less clear as time goes on. Now, has the yellowing been getting worse over that time, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely gotten… more noticeable. I wouldn’t say rapidly, but… yes, more pronounced. My friend, she nearly jumped when she saw me last week! She’s very observant, that one. It's mostly in my skin, I think, and perhaps a little in my eyes? It’s hard to tell, honestly. I try not to look too closely. It upsets me, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's natural to be upset. And it's good your friend is observant; it's always helpful to have someone notice changes. Now, aside from the yellowing, have you been feeling any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me see. Oh, dear. I've been rather tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And… a bit of a loss of appetite, yes. Not that I eat a great deal anyway, but… less than usual. Sometimes my stomach feels… upset, but that happens often. I've always had a sensitive stomach, you see. It's difficult to say what's new and what's just… me. Is that… helpful? I truly apologize for being so vague. It’s just… everything feels a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Annelle. It's very helpful for me to understand how you’re feeling, even if it's difficult to pinpoint specific changes. Fatigue and loss of appetite are definitely things we need to explore. And a sensitive stomach can certainly complicate things. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Changes in… those? That’s a rather personal question, Doctor. I… I haven't paid much attention, truthfully. I'm not one to… inspect such things. I suppose everything looks normal? But I couldn't say for certain. I truly apologize. I wish I were more observant. It’s just… I try not to focus on unpleasant things, you see. Is that… alright? Perhaps we could move on to another question? I feel a bit flustered now.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Annelle. That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly move on. I understand your discomfort. Let's talk about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a good question. Let me think… I had a rather bad bout of pneumonia many years ago, when I was still living… oh, it must have been forty years ago now. And… I’ve always had high blood pressure, I believe. Though I don’t take any medication for it. The doctor said it wasn’t severe enough. As for anything else… I honestly can’t recall. My memory is… quite unreliable, you see. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? Perhaps if you mentioned a condition, I might recognize it? I truly apologize for being so unhelpful. It’s just… everything is a bit of a blur. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. Pneumonia many years ago and a history of high blood pressure. That's helpful to know. And it's perfectly understandable that you don't remember every detail. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh, yes! I had my gallbladder removed… a very long time ago. I believe it was in the 1980s, perhaps? I remember being quite ill afterward. And… I had a hysterectomy, also many years ago. That’s all I can recall, truthfully. I was quite young when I had those surgeries, and I’ve had so much… life happen since then. It’s difficult to remember specifics, you see. Is that… alright? Perhaps we could move on to another topic? I’m feeling rather tired now.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Annelle. That’s perfectly alright. Gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy – thank you for letting me know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… That’s a difficult one. My family… we don’t talk much about health. It’s considered… impolite, perhaps. My mother, she died of… something heart-related, I believe. But I don’t recall the specifics. And my father… he was always very healthy, as far as I know. As for my siblings… I have a brother, but we haven’t spoken in many years. I truly apologize, but I don’t have much information to share. It’s just… we weren’t a very close family, you see. Is that… alright? Perhaps we could move on? I'm feeling rather lightheaded now.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Annelle. It's common for families not to discuss health matters, and you've shared what you know. Now, just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I don’t take any medications. I try to avoid them if possible. I prefer natural remedies, you see. A bit of ginger tea, perhaps, for my stomach. Or a warm bath. I don’t believe in relying on pills unless absolutely necessary. I truly apologize for being so… unconventional. Is that… alright? I'm feeling quite fatigued now. I believe I'm ready to finish, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Annelle. No medications, and a preference for natural remedies – I respect that. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I don't have any allergies, as far as I know. I've never had a reaction to anything. I truly apologize for being so unhelpful, but my memory is just… quite unreliable. I believe that's all I can recall. May I be excused now? I'm feeling quite weak, and I would like to rest. I truly apologize for taking up your time. Is that… alright? I'm ready to finish now, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Annelle. You haven’t taken up my time at all. It sounds like you've provided all the information you have, and I appreciate you sharing it with me. Given your symptoms of jaundice, fatigue, and loss of appetite, and considering your history, I’d like to perform a physical examination. I'll also order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
