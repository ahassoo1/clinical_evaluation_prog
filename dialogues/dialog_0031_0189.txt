DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 88 years young. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Young? Eighty-eight is no spring chicken, Doctor. Though I suppose compared to some… Anyway. It’s my… well, it’s my stool. Been seeing blood in it, and frankly, at my age, one doesn’t need that worry. Not at all. It’s unsettling, you understand. Very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely, Mr. Rowbottom. Seeing blood in your stool is certainly concerning, and perfectly reasonable to want checked out, at any age. Thank you for coming in to discuss this with me. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It’s red, naturally. Blood is red. Are you a doctor or a poet? Honestly. It's not bright red, though. More…darker. Like old pennies. And there’s…well, it’s mixed in with everything, you see? Not just…drops. It's in it. Does that make sense? It’s not pleasant to discuss, I assure you. And I don’t appreciate being asked to…qualify its color. Really.
DOCTOR: You are right to find this unpleasant to discuss, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if my question was poorly phrased. “Darker, like old pennies” is very helpful, actually. That tells me quite a bit. And the fact that it’s mixed in with the stool, rather than separate, is also important. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me how often this has been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you want a timeline of my…bathroom habits? Look, I’m eighty-eight years old. I don't keep a logbook of my bowel movements. It's happened… a few times in the past week or so. Maybe three? Four? It’s hard to say precisely. I noticed it when I was cleaning up, naturally. One tends to notice these things when one has to do everything oneself these days. My daughter…well, she doesn’t come around much anymore. So, I wouldn’t ask her. She wouldn’t understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It's perfectly alright that you don’t have an exact count. “A few times in the past week” is sufficient. And I apologize for pressing you on the details. It sounds like you are very independent, and I appreciate you coming in to address this yourself. Now, have you noticed any other changes in your stool besides the blood?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… yes, actually. It’s… thinner. Not like…pencil thin, but not as… substantial as it used to be. And a bit… looser, perhaps? Though I haven't been eating anything particularly unusual, I assure you. Just my usual toast and tea. Maybe a biscuit if I’m feeling peckish. It’s not like I’m indulging in any spicy curries or anything drastic. Honestly, young people today with their exotic diets... I stick to what I know. It’s probably just… old age, if you ask me. Everything’s slowing down. That's all.
DOCTOR: It's good you've noticed these changes, Mr. Rowbottom. While some changes can be attributed to age, it's important to investigate, particularly with the blood you've observed. Now, I’m going to ask you some questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I had a touch of the arthritis, naturally. In my hands mostly. Makes it difficult to hold a teacup sometimes. And the doctor said my blood pressure was a bit high years ago, but he put me on a… a little white pill. Can’t remember the name of it now. Stopped taking it eventually. Didn't seem to be doing much good. And I had my appendix out when I was a lad, but that was… seventy years ago, at least. Does that count? Honestly, at my age, it's hard to remember everything. I flew planes for a good many years, you know. That took up most of my attention. It wasn’t like today, with all these computerized contraptions. It was real flying then. Skill. Judgment. Not just pushing buttons.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, high blood pressure, and an appendectomy – thank you, that's helpful. It sounds like you've led a very full life, flying planes, that must have been exciting. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones, besides the pill you mentioned for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my joints, when they’re acting up. It's… glucosamine, I think? Or something like that. Comes in a little bottle. My daughter brought it for me a while back. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take one of those… sleep aids. The ones you get at the drugstore. But not every night, mind you. Only when I’m really restless. And a bit of aspirin if I have a headache, but that’s rare. Honestly, I don’t take much. I’ve never been one for pills. Always preferred a good night’s rest and a cup of tea. Though the tea doesn't seem to be doing much good these days. Not with…all this. You understand.
DOCTOR: Glucosamine, sleep aids as needed, and aspirin occasionally – thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I've never been particularly sensitive to anything. I used to be stung by a bee once when I was a boy, but I didn't swell up or anything. Just a bit of a sting, that’s all. And I eat shellfish, no problem. My daughter always worries about that, but I've never had a reaction. Honestly, I think people today are too quick to claim allergies. It's become a bit of a…fashion, if you ask me. Back in my day, you just toughed it out. A bit of a sniffle, a bit of a rash… you got on with it. No need to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: No known allergies – good to know. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like colon cancer, stomach problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… that’s a difficult one. My mother died of… well, I think it was something to do with her heart. She wasn’t a robust woman, never had been. My father was a bit of a drinker, didn’t look after himself. I don’t think he had any particular ailments, just… wore himself out. And my sister… she had stomach trouble, I remember. But it was a long time ago, and I wasn't particularly close to her. Honestly, we didn’t talk much about health. It wasn't considered polite, you know. A bit of a morbid topic. We preferred to talk about the weather. Or politics. Though I don't trust politicians much these days. They’re all the same, if you ask me. A bit of…nonsense, really. Does that help? It’s hard to recall details from so long ago.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Rowbottom. Heart trouble in your mother, stomach problems in your sister – thank you. Finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, a bit of a pipe smoker, but I always thought it was a dreadful habit. Ruined his teeth, you know. And smelled terrible. No, I've always been a clean-living man. Good food, good air, and a bit of exercise when I could. Though my joints aren't what they used to be, so the exercise is limited these days. Mostly just a bit of walking around the house. And a bit of gardening, when the weather permits. But smoking? Never. A foolish habit, if you ask me. Absolutely foolish.
DOCTOR: Thank you for answering all of my questions, Mr. Rowbottom. That gives me a good understanding of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also need to do a rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. I understand this can be a bit uncomfortable, but it’s important for us to determine the cause of the bleeding you’re experiencing. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A... rectal exam? Good heavens. At my age? Really, Doctor? Must we? I mean, I appreciate your thoroughness, but... it seems a bit intrusive, doesn't it? I came to you because of a bit of blood, not because I enjoy being…prodded. And frankly, I’ve lived a long life. I think I’ve had enough prodding, if you want my honest opinion. Couldn't we just… try a pill? Or perhaps a different kind of tea? Honestly, at my age, one prefers a bit of dignity, if you understand. And I'm not entirely sure this is necessary. Is it absolutely essential? Couldn't we start with something less…invasive? Really.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel uneasy. You are right to question the necessity of any procedure. The reason I recommend the rectal exam is to help determine the source of the bleeding and to rule out any serious underlying causes. It’s a standard part of the evaluation process for this type of symptom. However, I would never force you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. We could start with a stool test to look for blood, which is less invasive. It won’t give us as much information as a physical exam, but it's a good first step. We would need a sample, of course. If the test comes back positive, or if your symptoms worsen, then we can discuss the possibility of further investigation, including the exam. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A stool test... yes, that sounds... considerably more palatable. Less…personal, if you understand. A sample, you say? Well, I suppose I can manage that. I’m not particularly thrilled about it, mind you, but it’s better than…the alternative. Yes, a stool test sounds quite reasonable. As long as we don’t go straight to…prodding. I'd like to hold off on that for as long as possible. Really. I think a bit of blood could simply be a sign of old age. It's not like I'm expecting a miracle cure, you know. Just a bit of reassurance, if possible. And a comfortable chair. Really. A bit of comfort is all one asks for at this stage of life.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. We will proceed at your pace, and I will explain every step of the process. A stool test it is. I will have the nurse bring you a collection kit and instructions. It's a fairly simple process, and you can do it in the privacy of your own home. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. We will aim for reassurance, and proceed cautiously. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just... thank you, Doctor. For being understanding. And for not immediately resorting to... unpleasantness. Honestly, some doctors these days... all rush and prodding and…well, you understand. It's good to find someone who listens. And who respects a bit of dignity. Yes. Thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll sit here for a moment and…gather myself. This has been a bit… taxing. Really. Just a bit of quiet, if possible.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. Please take all the time you need. I'll have the nurse bring you the kit and instructions shortly. She will also let me know when you’re ready for me to return. Don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions or concerns, even after you’ve received the kit. .
