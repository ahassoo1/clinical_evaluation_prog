DOCTOR: Right, Lacreasha Thut, age 40. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It's... my nails. They just look funny. Not right, you know? Been like this a little while now. I don't remember exactly how long, but a good bit. They're... different colors. And kinda thick. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Different colors and thick, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Not like, a pretty different. Like… dirty. And not smooth. Hard to explain. I just want them to look normal again, if that makes sense. I don't really do nails, if you know what I mean. No polish or anything. Just… regular nails.
DOCTOR: Right. And has this been associated with any pain, or changes to the skin around the nails?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm... not really. Not that I've noticed. Maybe a little, if I... bump them, I guess. But not like a constant thing. And the skin… I don't know. It looks like skin, doesn't it? I don’t really pay attention to that stuff. Is it supposed to look different?
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean? Like… big changes? No, not really. Everything’s pretty much the same. Same house, same… everything. I go to work, come home. Sometimes I see my sister. Oh, wait! I got new soap. Maybe… is that what you mean? A fancy kind. Smells nice. But I don't think that would do anything to my nails. Would it?
DOCTOR: New soap… alright. We'll come back to that. Now, do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Medical problems? Not that I know of. I have… you know, the usual things. Getting old. Back aches sometimes. But nothing a little rest doesn't fix. Oh! And I got Medicare, if that matters. I don’t really go to the doctor much, so… I don't really have problems. Do I?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your nails, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Finally. They're really bothering me. Be careful, they’re a bit… rough. Not my fault, of course. Just… how they are.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, I'm seeing some discoloration – a yellowish tinge, and some thickening of the nails, particularly on the… right index and middle fingers. There's also some…subungual hyperkeratosis – that’s the buildup under the nail. No obvious inflammation around the nail folds at this time. Any recent trauma to these nails?
PATIENT: Trauma? No! What would happen to my nails? I just… use them, you know? For working and stuff. I’m an audiologist. I use my hands all the time. But I don’t… hit them or anything. What is subungual hyper… whatever you said? Sounds scary. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It simply means a build-up of debris under the nail. It's not necessarily serious, but it can be indicative of a fungal infection. Given your occupation, constantly having your hands wet could be a contributing factor. Now, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I mean, I sneeze sometimes. Like everyone does. Dust, probably. I don’t go out of my way to avoid things. I don’t have time for all that. And… I just told you, I got new soap. Is that soap going to make me allergic? It smells like lavender. This all seems like a lot of trouble over some nails.
DOCTOR: Lavender is generally well-tolerated, but we’re trying to rule things out. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… Not really. Just… some vitamins. For my… bones, I think. And sometimes I take something for my back when it really hurts. But that’s it. Just the usual stuff. Not anything fancy. Do you need to know the names of them? I don’t really remember. I just take what the pharmacy gives me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, based on what you’ve told me, and my initial examination, it's most likely onychomycosis – a fungal infection of the nail. While not immediately dangerous, it can be persistent, and sometimes uncomfortable. We can do a nail clipping to confirm with a lab test, or we can start a topical antifungal treatment. However, given the thickness, a topical may not be enough.
PATIENT: Fungus? On my nails? That sounds… disgusting! And expensive. I don’t need no fancy tests. Can’t you just… give me something to make it go away? Like a cream? And what does “persistent” mean? Will I have this forever? This is ridiculous! I just want normal nails. I don’t want to spend a fortune on a bunch of tests and creams and… fungus!
DOCTOR: Well, it is often stubborn, which is why a lab test is helpful. It allows us to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. Without confirmation, we’re just guessing. Topical treatments have limited efficacy with thicker nails, and oral medications are often required. Those do require monitoring, given potential side effects. I’m happy to send you to a dermatologist; they are specialists in this field. It's a rather common condition, I assure you. We don’t want it spreading to other nails.
PATIENT: Spreading? Oh, no. No spreading. That's awful. I don't want it on my other nails. Okay, okay. A test. Fine. But not a big test. And I don’t want to spend a fortune. And don’t talk to me about specialists! I just want this fixed. Is it going to hurt? Do I have to go somewhere special? This is all so much trouble over… fungus. .
DOCTOR: The nurse will take a small nail clipping for the lab. It doesn’t hurt, it’s a quick procedure. And the lab is right here in the building. We'll discuss treatment options once the results come back. Don't worry, we'll get this sorted. In the meantime, keep your nails dry and trimmed.
