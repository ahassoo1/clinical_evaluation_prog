DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, that’s all. Medicare sent me over, said I needed to update some things.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly reasonable. We can certainly get that taken care of. I do want to quickly confirm a few things for my records, even with the forms. It helps me understand your overall health picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I don’t mind at all. It’s just… sometimes these things feel like a lot, you know? But I understand it helps.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Fabing. It can be a lot. We'll try to keep it as streamlined as possible. Let's start with a quick review of your current medications and any allergies you might have. Could you tell me about those first?
PATIENT: Hmm… let’s see. I don’t really take anything regularly, to be honest. Just some ibuprofen now and then for my back, when it’s acting up. And no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Oh! Except mosquitos. They love me, but that’s not a medical allergy, right? Just really itchy.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Fabing, mosquito bites don’t count as a medical allergy! We're looking for things like reactions to medications, foods, or environmental factors. So, ibuprofen as needed for back pain, and no other medications or known allergies. Good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your back pain?
PATIENT: Well, it comes and goes. I work with pipes and valves, so I'm bending and lifting a lot. It usually flares up after a long day on the job. It’s mostly just a dull ache, sometimes a little stiff. Nothing too terrible, I can usually manage with ibuprofen and stretching. I've had it for years, I guess. Never really bothered going to the doctor for it specifically, just dealt with it. It’s just… part of the job, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s a mechanical type of back pain, related to your work, and generally manageable with over-the-counter pain relief and stretching. Has it been getting worse lately, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, it has been a little worse this past month, maybe? Not drastically, but I've had to take ibuprofen more often, and it takes a little longer to feel better after a long day. It's probably just the summer heat, making everything ache a bit more. I'm not sure. Could be anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased frequency of ibuprofen use and a longer recovery time are good things to note. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions about where exactly you feel the pain, and if it radiates anywhere. Also, do you experience any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Let me think… The pain is mostly right across my lower back, kind of in the middle. Sometimes it goes down my hips a little, but not past my knees. No numbness or tingling, thankfully. And no weakness in my legs. It’s just… sore. Really, really sore sometimes. I try to stretch every night, helps a little, but… it’s there.
DOCTOR: Alright, localized to the lower back with some occasional hip discomfort, no radiating pain past the knees, and no neurological symptoms like numbness or weakness. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam to assess your range of motion and check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. I don’t mind. I’ve got a pretty high pain tolerance, so don’t worry about hurting my feelings. Just let me know if you see anything weird, okay?
DOCTOR: Perfectly. I will. First, I’m just going to have you stand up and I’ll observe your posture and how you move. Then, I’ll ask you to bend forward, backward, and to each side. Please stop if you feel any sharp pain, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Here goes nothing. Just let me know if I’m doing anything wrong. I’m not very flexible, just a warning!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I see some mild forward flexion limitation, and a bit of discomfort with palpation over the lumbar spine, right here and here. No obvious signs of neurological deficits. Muscle tone seems normal. You’re right, flexibility is a bit limited, but nothing alarming. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, just as a standard part of the assessment.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I figured it was probably just my back, but I appreciate you checking everything. Go ahead. It’s all good. I’m pretty healthy otherwise, I think. Just old from working too hard.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Alright, Ms. Fabing. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it does sound like you’re experiencing mechanical lower back pain, likely related to your occupation. There are no immediate red flags that suggest anything more serious. However, the recent increase in pain frequency warrants a bit more attention.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. So, not something I need to worry about too much right now? That’s good to hear. But what do I do about it getting worse? Ibuprofen isn’t really cutting it like it used to. I don’t want to end up completely useless at work, you know? That’s not an option.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It’s good that you're proactively addressing it. While it doesn’t sound like an emergency, ignoring it could lead to further discomfort and potentially limit your ability to work. Ibuprofen is a good first step, but we can explore some other options. I recommend a course of physical therapy to strengthen your core muscles and improve your flexibility and posture. Also, I'm going to order some X-rays of your lower back to rule out any underlying structural issues, just to be safe. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Physical therapy makes sense, I’ve heard good things about that. And the X-rays… well, better safe than sorry, right? I don’t mind getting those done. So, how do we go about doing all of that? Do you have a place you recommend for physical therapy? And what do I need to do about the X-rays? Do I schedule those here?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you agree. Yes, we can schedule the X-rays right here in the clinic. The order will be sent to the radiology department, and they will call you to schedule an appointment. As for physical therapy, I have a list of highly-rated providers in the area, and I can provide you with their contact information. I recommend "Active Motion Physical Therapy" - they have experience with patients who have similar occupations and are known for their personalized treatment plans. I’ll print out the list and the X-ray order for you now. In the meantime, continue taking ibuprofen as needed, but try to avoid prolonged sitting or heavy lifting when possible. And please, if you experience any numbness, tingling, weakness, or bowel or bladder changes, contact the clinic immediately.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s perfect. Active Motion sounds good, I’ll give them a call. And I will definitely watch out for those symptoms, thank you. So, just the list and the order, and I’m good to go? That sounds pretty straightforward. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. Makes me feel a lot better already.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here’s the list of physical therapy providers and the X-ray order. The order includes the clinic’s contact information should they have any questions. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. It’s important to address these issues proactively. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Fabing, or are we all set?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been really helpful, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I’ll go ahead and call Active Motion and schedule something. And I’ll get the X-rays done as soon as possible. .
DOCTOR: Wonderful! That's exactly what I recommend. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns or questions as you go through the process. We're here to support you. Have a great day, Ms. Fabing, and take care of yourself. .
