DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Mirriam. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Bula vinaka to you too, Dr. Kimm! It's nice to meet you as well. Oh, goodness, it's these hiccups. They just won't stop. Been going on for… well, a good few days now, I reckon. Not painful, just… annoying, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, hiccups! Annoying is a good word for it – they can really wear you down. A few days is a bit longer than usual. Can you tell me a little more about when they started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It was Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday. I was having lunch with my friend, Lisi, down at the bakery. Lovely little place, they make a mean coconut cream pie. Anyway, we were laughing about something silly – old Mr. Sharma trying to teach his parrot to sing – and then hic… there they started. They went away for a bit after lunch, but they came back that evening and they’ve been with me ever since. There! See?
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear that. And it sounds like they started with a bit of a good laugh, which is often how these things begin. Have you tried anything to get rid of them so far?
PATIENT: Oh, plenty! Lisi told me to hold my breath, you know, the old trick. Didn’t do a thing. Then I tried drinking water upside down, that was a mess! Nearly choked! My grandson, Jone, he suggested a spoonful of sugar, but that just made my teeth feel sticky. Honestly, Dr. Kimm, I’m at my wit’s end. I’ve even tried scaring myself, but I’m too old to be easily spooked these days!
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve covered all the usual home remedies! That’s good to know. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really, no. I've been eating normally, sleeping alright, maybe a bit tired, but that's just old age catching up, I reckon. No heartburn, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. Just… these persistent hiccups. It's just a bit bothersome, you know? Makes it hard to enjoy a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No other symptoms are helpful to know. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever had any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? I had my appendix out when I was a young woman, a long time ago now. And I had a hip replacement about ten years back, that went alright, thankfully. Apart from that… just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old, I suppose. I used to get terrible migraines when I was younger, but they haven’t bothered me for years. I had pneumonia once, a bad bout of it, but that was years and years ago. I've always been pretty healthy, really. Oh, and I had a touch of the flu last winter, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good start. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think... I take a little pill for my blood pressure, losartan, I think it’s called. Just one a day. And that's it, really. No, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. I love my seafood, you know? And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication before. I’m a pretty simple woman, Dr. Kimm. Don't need much to keep me going!
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Losartan for blood pressure, and no known allergies. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family had a history of… say, heart problems, or lung issues, or anything like persistent hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… That’s a bit of a tricky one. My mother, she had a weak heart towards the end of her life, but she lived a long life, so it wasn't too bad. My father, he was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. As for lung problems… not that I recall. No one ever smoked, thankfully. And persistent hiccups… No, never heard of anyone in the family having that particular trouble! We’re a pretty stoic bunch, mostly. Don’t complain much. My auntie, she had terrible indigestion, but that’s about as close as it gets, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, before we move on, just one last quick thing. Do you drink alcohol, or do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Not a drop of alcohol, and never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he used to enjoy a beer now and then, but I never cared for it. Always preferred a nice cup of herbal tea. Much better for you, you know! And much more soothing when you've got the hiccups, although it doesn’t seem to be helping much this time!
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. That gives me a really good picture of your overall health. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and just have a quick look in your throat, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that’s perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment, Dr. Kimm. I’ve always said a good doctor is worth their weight in gold. And I’m hoping you can help me get rid of these pesky hiccups!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mirriam. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear – no wheezing or crackling sounds. Your throat looks a little red, but nothing too concerning – could just be a bit of normal irritation. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. And your pulse is 78, steady. Everything sounds pretty good, honestly. There’s no obvious sign of anything causing the hiccups.
PATIENT: Well, that's good to hear, even if it means I'm no closer to getting rid of them! So, what does that mean, Dr. Kimm? Is it just one of those things? Will they eventually go away on their own? Or is there something you can give me to help? I’m just getting so tired of them! It's distracting, you know? Makes it hard to concentrate and enjoy my stories.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be frustrated, Mirriam. Prolonged hiccups can be really disruptive. The good news is that most hiccups are benign and resolve on their own. The fact that you've tried so many remedies without success and they’ve lasted for a few days does warrant a little further investigation, just to be sure we're not missing anything. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but let's do a quick blood test to check your electrolytes, and just rule out any underlying imbalances. It's a simple test, and it'll give us a bit more information. Also, I’m going to prescribe you a medication called baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant sometimes used for hiccups. We’ll start with a low dose and see if that helps.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, dear. A blood test and some medication… I’m happy to try anything at this point! Baclofen, you say? Is it anything I should be worried about? Any side effects I need to look out for? I always worry about taking new things, you know. Old woman’s caution, I suppose. And where will I get it, Dr. Kimm? Is it something I can pick up at the pharmacy down the road?
DOCTOR: That’s very wise to ask, Mirriam. Baclofen can sometimes cause drowsiness, dizziness, or muscle weakness, but these side effects are usually mild and go away as your body adjusts to the medication. It’s important not to drive or operate heavy machinery if you feel drowsy. And, rarely, some people experience confusion or nausea. If you experience any of those symptoms, stop taking the medication and contact me immediately. Yes, you can pick it up at the pharmacy down the road. I’ll send the prescription electronically right now, so it should be ready for you within the hour. The dosage is 5mg three times a day for a week. If it’s not helping after a week, we can increase the dose or explore other options. I'll also give you a handout with more information about baclofen and what to expect. We'll get the blood test done here in the clinic before you leave. It's just a standard test and shouldn’t take long. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds very thorough, Dr. Kimm. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. A handout is a good idea, my memory isn’t what it used to be! And yes, let’s get the blood test done. The sooner this is all over, the better. I’m starting to feel like a broken record with these hiccups! See? There they are again! Alright, let's get to it. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s get that blood test done. The phlebotomist, Sereana, is just down the hall. She’ll take care of you. It's just a small sample, and it won't take long. Afterwards, I'll review the results with you and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to relax and drink plenty of fluids. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Sereana will be expecting you. We'll hopefully have some good news soon, Mirriam. And we'll get those pesky hiccups sorted out!
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Dr. Kimm. I feel much better already, just knowing we’re doing something about it. Alright, let’s go find Sereana. Vinaka vakalevu!
DOCTOR: Vinaka vakalevu to you too, Mirriam! And don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all.
