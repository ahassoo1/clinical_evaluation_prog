DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I am Dr. Blim. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my back. It’s been…painful, yeah, that’s the word. Not like a sudden thing, it’s just been getting worse over, oh, a few weeks now, I guess.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Hmm. And where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: It's mostly…lower back, right around here. Sometimes it feels like it goes down my leg a little, but mostly just in my back. It's a dull ache most of the time, but if I move wrong, it can really shoot.
DOCTOR: "Shoot," you say. Can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Yeah, sorry, “shoot” isn’t very…scientific, is it? It’s not a constant sharp pain, more like…a really quick, intense ache that travels down my leg for a second, then it's gone. Like a jolt. It doesn't happen with every move, just some of them. Lifting things, usually. Or bending over.
DOCTOR: Lifting and bending. Alright. And how would you rate this pain on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Hmm…on a good day, it's maybe a 3 or 4. But when I really strain it, or try to do too much…it gets up to a 7, maybe even an 8. It hasn't been that bad for a while now, thankfully. But it's worrying me because it’s slowly getting worse overall, you know?
DOCTOR: Slowly getting worse. Right. Have you tried anything to alleviate the pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. My wife, she's always telling me to use heat, so I’ve been trying that. And I got some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, the ibuprofen stuff. They help a bit, but not really for long, and I don’t like taking too many of them. It just feels…like I'm masking the problem, you know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Masking the problem. Understandable. Now, let's get some background. Any prior injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Nothing major, not that I remember. I used to do a lot of gardening, years ago, and maybe I pulled something a few times bending over in the garden. But nothing I ever really had to go to the doctor for. Nothing broken or anything like that. Just aches and pains you’d expect, I guess.
DOCTOR: Gardening… Alright. And what about your medical history in general?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got that under control with medication. Other than that…nothing much. I haven’t been sick with anything serious in years, thankfully. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat right, try to get some exercise when I can. It’s just this back…
DOCTOR: Do you currently take any medications, besides what you mentioned for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for the blood pressure, yeah. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small dose, but I take it every day. And the occasional ibuprofen when my back really flares up, like I said. But not regularly.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril. And no allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything the doctor has given me. My wife always asks, she's very good about that sort of thing, but no, no allergies. She keeps me in line, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. If you could just lie down on your stomach on the examination table, please.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just let me get myself over there… careful now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way. I’m going to press here and here. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. And can you point to the area where you feel the pain the most?
PATIENT: Okay. Ooh, yeah, right there! That's definitely it. And…a little bit to the side here, too. It's not sharp pain, more like a deep ache when you press on it.
DOCTOR: Alright, and can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Whoa… easy there. Not as far as I used to be able to go, Doctor. It feels…tight. And it makes the ache worse in my back. It's getting harder to do the simple things, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, and I’m going to lift your leg straight up. Tell me if that causes any pain down your leg. Any radiating pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Not a sharp pain, more like…that shooting ache I was talking about. Down the back of my leg. Not too bad, but definitely noticeable. When you lift it this high… That’s about when it starts. Left leg feels okay though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this examination, it appears you have a likely muscle strain with some possible nerve irritation. However, to rule out anything more serious, such as a disc issue, I recommend we get an X-ray. I'll have my assistant schedule that for you.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. A disc issue sounds scary. I just want to feel better, you know? When can we do the X-ray? And…will it hurt?
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself is painless, Mr. Way. It’s a quick procedure. My assistant can get you scheduled for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I suggest continuing with the heat and avoiding any heavy lifting. Over-the-counter pain relievers are fine, if you need them, but do not exceed the recommended dosage. I’ll also prescribe a mild muscle relaxant. It may help with the discomfort. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant sounds good, yeah. Okay, tomorrow morning for the X-ray. And…no, I don’t think so, Doctor. That sounds like a good plan. Just…thank you for taking the time to listen to me. It’s good to know what’s going on, even if it’s not great news. Do I need to do anything to prepare for the X-ray?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just wear comfortable clothing. My assistant will give you specific instructions. Here is the referral for the X-ray. And here is a prescription for the muscle relaxant. Follow the dosage instructions precisely. I’ll review the results of the X-ray when they come in and we can discuss the next steps. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’ll see you when the X-ray results are back. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Way. .
