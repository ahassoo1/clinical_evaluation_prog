DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Giganti. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m not entirely certain why I scheduled this appointment. Something about… planning for the future, I believe? I was advised to inquire about a form, an Advance Directive or POLST form, perhaps? My memory isn’t what it used to be, I’m afraid. I just want to be… prepared, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s very responsible of you to think ahead and plan for the future. Both Advance Directives and POLST forms are excellent tools for ensuring your wishes are respected should you become unable to communicate them yourself. Before we delve into those specifically, could you tell me a little bit more about what prompted this appointment?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to say. A friend, I think? She mentioned something about a difficult situation her mother had, and how these forms would have made things so much simpler. I recall feeling quite shaken after our conversation and immediately looked into it. It all feels rather… hazy. I apologize for my lack of clarity. It’s not that I’m deliberately being obtuse, I simply don’t recall the specific details that spurred this action. Perhaps it was a pamphlet I read? Or a news story? Truly, I couldn’t say.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s perfectly common for details to be a bit fuzzy, especially when dealing with potentially sensitive topics. The important thing is you're here, and you're thinking about this now. Let’s focus on what you do know. You’re interested in learning more about Advance Directives and POLST forms to ensure your wishes are respected in the future. To best guide you, could you tell me a little bit about your current health status?
PATIENT: My current health… Well, I believe I’m generally in good health. I don’t have any major diagnosed conditions, as far as I am aware. I try to maintain a reasonably active lifestyle – walks in the park when the weather permits. I do experience occasional fatigue, but I attribute that to… well, simply getting older, I suppose. And the stress of… everything. I see a nutritionist occasionally for diet guidance, but that’s more preventative than anything else. I haven’t been hospitalized in recent memory. Does that answer your question, Doctor? I hope I’m not rambling.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Buoniconti, and you're not rambling at all. It sounds like you're proactive about your health, which is excellent. The occasional fatigue is good to note. Are there any specific activities that seem to worsen it, or is it just a general feeling throughout the day?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It isn’t consistently linked to any particular activity, I don’t believe. Sometimes it’s worse after a particularly long day, but other times it’s present even after a full night’s rest. I've noticed it’s… exacerbated by stress, certainly. If I’m feeling overwhelmed or anxious, the fatigue becomes significantly more pronounced. It's rarely debilitating, but it's… unsettling. It feels as though I’m carrying a weight, even when I haven’t exerted myself physically. I apologize, I'm probably not being very precise. Describing these sensations is proving more difficult than I anticipated.
DOCTOR: You're describing it perfectly well, Ms. Buoniconti. It's often difficult to articulate these kinds of feelings. The connection to stress is particularly relevant. To get a better overall picture, could you briefly tell me about any past medical history – any significant illnesses, surgeries, or injuries you've had?
PATIENT: Past medical history… That is a challenge. I had my tonsils removed as a child, a fairly standard procedure, I believe. And I broke my arm once, falling from a tree – a rather foolish endeavor, in retrospect. Apart from those minor incidents, I don’t recall any significant illnesses or surgeries. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I did have a bout of severe influenza several years ago, but I recovered fully. I’ve had the usual vaccinations, of course. I believe I was a generally healthy child and adult, until… well, until recently, perhaps. This fatigue… it feels like a change, something new. I truly apologize for my vagueness. It’s infuriating to feel as though my mind is… clouded.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. Buoniconti. You’re providing me with valuable information. It's good to know about the tonsillectomy and the broken arm. And it's helpful that you’re noticing a change with this fatigue. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s another area where my recollections are… incomplete. My mother suffered from high blood pressure in her later years, and my father had some issues with arthritis. My paternal grandmother, I believe, had diabetes, though it was never explicitly discussed. Beyond that, I don’t recall any widespread, significant medical conditions within my family. There were… early deaths, yes, but not necessarily linked to any particular illness. More accidents, unfortunate circumstances. It wasn’t a particularly health-conscious family, if I’m being honest. We didn't discuss these matters openly. Does that provide any useful information, Doctor? I feel as though I’m offering a rather fragmented picture.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. You're providing what you know, and that's what's important. High blood pressure in your mother, arthritis in your father, and diabetes in your grandmother – that’s helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner – a small glass, mind you – but I wouldn’t consider myself a drinker. And recreational drugs? Certainly not. I’ve always been rather… cautious, I suppose. I prioritize my health and well-being, and those substances simply don’t align with my values. My husband… he had a different perspective. But that is… beside the point.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Buoniconti. It's good to know about your lifestyle choices. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s infrequent. And I take a multivitamin, a standard daily dose. Oh, and I've been taking a Vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as advised by the nutritionist. Apart from those, no. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in a holistic approach to health, focusing on diet and exercise rather than relying on pills. Is there anything else you require, Doctor? I fear I am beginning to ramble again.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all. That's very helpful information, Ms. Buoniconti. Thank you for being so forthcoming. So, to summarize, you’re a generally healthy 35-year-old female experiencing occasional fatigue, which you attribute to stress. You have a history of tonsillectomy and a broken arm, and a family history of high blood pressure, arthritis, and diabetes. You don’t smoke, drink alcohol in moderation, and take a multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, and a Vitamin D supplement. Now, before we discuss Advance Directives and POLST forms, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. A physical exam sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment. I confess, I'm rather apprehensive about what it might reveal, but I understand it's a necessary step. Please proceed at your own pace. I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It will be a standard exam – checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, examining your abdomen, and a neurological assessment. Nothing to be worried about. Your blood pressure is 128/82, which is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Cranial nerves are intact. Everything appears to be within normal limits, Ms. Buoniconti. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we can monitor. The fatigue remains the primary concern. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I recommend a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying causes for the fatigue, such as anemia, thyroid issues, or vitamin deficiencies. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: That is… reassuring to hear, Doctor. I confess, I was bracing myself for something more concerning. Yes, absolutely. Blood tests sound sensible. I’m happy to undergo whatever investigations you deem necessary to ascertain the cause of this fatigue. The sooner we identify the problem, the sooner I can begin to address it. I trust your expertise, Doctor Giganti. What sort of tests are you proposing? And will they require a lengthy appointment? I have… commitments.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The tests I'm proposing are a complete blood count , a thyroid stimulating hormone test, a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a Vitamin D level. These will give us a good overview of your general health and identify any potential imbalances. The blood draw itself will only take about 10-15 minutes. We can do it here in the clinic. The results will typically be available in a few days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Does that sound acceptable, Ms. Buoniconti?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. A few days is… manageable. And 10-15 minutes is hardly an imposition. Please proceed when you’re ready. Regarding the Advance Directive and POLST forms… perhaps we can revisit those after we’ve received the results of these tests? I feel as though it would be prudent to address this fatigue first. It’s rather difficult to contemplate end-of-life planning when I’m still trying to understand what's causing me to feel unwell. I apologize for changing the subject, but my mind feels… scattered.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible suggestion, Ms. Buoniconti. Absolutely, let’s focus on addressing the fatigue first. There’s no rush with the Advance Directive and POLST forms. We can certainly revisit them once we have a better understanding of your overall health. Alright, let’s get those blood tests ordered. The nurse will come in shortly to draw them. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve answered all my questions. I appreciate your patience and understanding. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. It's… reassuring to be taken seriously. I’ve had… experiences to the contrary. I’ll simply wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again, Doctor Giganti.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. It's my pleasure. I understand how frustrating it can be when concerns aren't taken seriously, and I want you to know I’m here to listen and help in any way I can. I’ll leave you to wait for the nurse. She’ll be in shortly. Don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.
PATIENT: .
