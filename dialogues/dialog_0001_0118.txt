DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor… Pehrson, is it? Yes, well. It's this… certification. One must keep up appearances, you understand. Though, frankly, I’ve been doing this long enough that I should be the one administering the tests. Still, rules are rules, I suppose. It's the… hearing, primarily. Though my vision isn't what it once was either.
DOCTOR: Right. A certification renewal. Look, I'm a family doctor, not an optometrist or audiologist. We can do a basic check, but if you need a real evaluation, you’ll need to see a specialist. Tell me more about this hearing issue. When did it start?
PATIENT: A specialist, you say? Hmm. Well, I assure you, Doctor, my hearing is perfectly adequate for… most things. It’s just… people don’t articulate these days. Mumble, mumble, mumble. It’s a disgrace. As for when it started… oh, goodness. Years ago, I should imagine. Perhaps five? Ten? Time does rather slip away, you know. It’s not a sudden thing. More… gradual. A lessening of clarity, shall we say? Especially with the younger generation.
DOCTOR: Gradual loss over five to ten years… alright. And is this affecting your daily life?
PATIENT: Affecting my daily life? Doctor, I am a highly functioning professional. It doesn’t prevent me from doing anything, naturally. It simply requires… a certain level of patience. And, occasionally, asking people to repeat themselves. Which, as I mentioned, is usually due to their lack of proper enunciation. I have no need for… coddling, you understand. However, this certification… it requires a pass, doesn’t it? And I haven’t the time to spend chasing down specialists and… well, frankly, it seems rather excessive.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you're a busy man. But this certification is important, and we need to make sure you can safely perform your duties. Let's do a quick screening test, okay?
PATIENT: "Safely perform my duties," you say? Really. I've been practicing for decades, Doctor. Decades. But… very well. A quick screening test. If you insist. Though I highly doubt it will reveal anything of consequence. Do try to speak clearly, though. It would be most appreciated. What exactly does this "test" entail? Will it be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It’s a simple ear exam, just to check for any blockages or obvious issues. Then I’ll do a basic whisper test. It won’t be uncomfortable at all. Just listen for me to say some numbers and repeat them back. Sound good?
PATIENT: Numbers, you say? A rather… rudimentary assessment, wouldn’t you agree? Still, if that’s what’s required… very well. As long as it doesn’t involve anything… invasive. And do please ensure the room is quiet. I have no desire to strain my ears unnecessarily. Though, frankly, I suspect I’ll be able to pass with my eyes closed. Proceed, Doctor. But quickly, if you please. I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. External auditory canal appears clear bilaterally. Tympanic membranes are pearly gray, with visible cone of light. No signs of acute inflammation or perforation. Now, I'm going to stand behind you and whisper some numbers. Repeat them back to me as accurately as you can. Ready?
PATIENT: Very well. Proceed. Though I must say, the lighting in here isn't ideal. It’s rather… glaring. And do try to enunciate, Doctor. It’s truly astonishing how poorly some people speak these days. I’m ready. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: 739.
PATIENT: Seven… three… nine. Is that correct? It was rather… muffled. Perhaps you should speak up, Doctor. It’s difficult to discern anything clearly in this… environment. Though, yes, I believe I heard “seven, three, nine.” Though it’s hardly a conclusive test, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, 285.
PATIENT: Two… eight… five. Yes. Though I do detect a slight… distortion. Is there a draft in here? It’s interfering with the sound. Honestly, Doctor, I’m surprised you rely on such a primitive method of assessment. It's hardly scientific. Is this… sufficient? Can we conclude this charade now?
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, 416.
PATIENT: Four… one… seven? No… perhaps… four… two… six? Honestly, Doctor, this is preposterous. The acoustics in this room are dreadful. It’s impossible to be certain. I believe I heard a ‘six’, but the initial digit… it’s simply indistinct. Are you certain you’re speaking clearly? This is… frustrating. I'm quite sure I’m perfectly capable of fulfilling my duties, regardless of your… findings. Can we please conclude this now? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Based on this brief screening, your hearing does appear to be diminished, particularly with higher frequencies. You missed two out of three numbers, and reported some difficulty discerning the sounds. While I'm not qualified to diagnose the extent of the issue, I recommend a comprehensive audiological evaluation by an audiologist. It's important to rule out any underlying causes and ensure you're functioning at your best. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: An audiologist? Really, Doctor. I’ve been practicing for decades. Decades, I tell you. And you’re telling me I need to see an audiologist? It’s… insulting, frankly. A missed two numbers. Anyone can miss two numbers. The room, as I’ve pointed out, is hardly conducive to accurate hearing tests. And I assure you, my professional judgment is perfectly sound. A referral is… unnecessary. Absolutely unnecessary. I think I’ll manage. However… …if you insist on providing something, perhaps a list of reputable practices in the area? Just in case… a colleague were to express concern. But I assure you, this is purely for informational purposes. I highly doubt I'll be requiring their services. Let’s just conclude this now. I have appointments. And please, avoid suggesting I’m… deficient in any way. It’s… quite rude.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Oriley. Here's a list of audiology practices in the area. As you wish. I'll document our conversation in your chart. Do you have any other concerns today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No further concerns. I believe that concludes everything. Thank you for… your time. Though I must say, I remain unconvinced of the necessity of this entire exercise. A waste of time, frankly. Good day. .
