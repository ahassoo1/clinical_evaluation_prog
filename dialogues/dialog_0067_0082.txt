DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. It’s… travel stuff. I gotta go somewhere. My wife… she wanted to go. Now I gotta go. It’s… important, I guess. Don’t really remember where exactly, though. Something with mountains?
DOCTOR: Okay, travel-related, important trip with mountains involved. That gives me a little to work with. It sounds like you may need a travel consultation, to make sure you’re prepared and healthy for your trip. To help me understand what we need to cover, can you tell me a bit more about when you’re planning to travel?
PATIENT: When…? Uh… soon. Like… this month? Before it gets too cold, maybe? My wife… she liked warm places. I think. Honestly, dates… I don’t… keep track of that stuff. It’s all a bit of a blur. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay, Odell. We can work with “soon.” So, before we go any further, just to confirm – you’re traveling internationally, is that correct?
PATIENT: Internationally… uh… yes, I think so. She… she always liked going far away. Not just… around here. Somewhere with… different food. And people. Lots of people. She did all the planning, you see. I just… went. Is that a problem? Do I need to know where?
DOCTOR: It’s not a problem at all that you weren’t involved in the planning, Odell. It just helps me to figure out what vaccinations or preventative medications you might need. Do you happen to know anything about the country, or even the continent, you’ll be visiting?
PATIENT: Continent…? Ugh. Look, I work with airplane parts, okay? Not… maps. She said… Asia, maybe? Something with… tall mountains and… lots of temples? And tea. She loved tea. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m being tested or something. It’s frustrating, trying to remember things when… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being tested, Odell. It’s completely understandable to feel frustrated when trying to recall details, especially if you weren’t directly involved in the planning. “Asia, with tall mountains and temples” is actually quite helpful. Based on that, it sounds like Nepal is a strong possibility. Do you recall anything that would confirm or deny that?
PATIENT: Nepal…? Hmm… that sounds right. Yeah, I think she said something about… Everest. And… prayer flags. Lots of colorful flags. And… people carrying things on their heads. That… feels familiar. Is that Nepal? Finally. Good. Now can we just… get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Odell, that is Nepal! Okay, that's excellent. Knowing that allows me to get you the right information. So, we'll treat this as a travel consultation for Nepal. First, let's talk about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant…? I broke my arm when I was a kid. Climbing a tree. That’s it, really. Nothing… serious. And I get… colds sometimes. Like everyone. My wife… she always took care of me when I was sick. She knew all the doctors and… stuff. I just… took the medicine she gave me. Is there a list of medicines I’ve taken somewhere?
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child and occasional colds. That’s good to know. We can definitely look up any medications you’ve been prescribed in our system. Okay, I see here you did see a doctor a few years ago for… a respiratory infection. And you were prescribed an antibiotic, azithromycin. Do you remember that?
PATIENT: Azithro…? No. That sounds… complicated. I just remember being sick and… taking pills. She… she made sure I took them on time. She handled all that. I mostly just… slept. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Is it important what kind of pill it was? Does it… matter? I feel like she did everything.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Odell, don’t worry about remembering specific details. Knowing you were prescribed an antibiotic is helpful, just in case there are any allergies we need to be aware of. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… not really. I eat everything. She liked trying new foods, and I just… ate what she did. Sometimes my nose gets a little runny in the spring. That’s all. Just… pollen, I think. Nothing serious. She always had tissues for me. She thought of everything. Really. Everything. I’m… starting to get a headache. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Okay, just seasonal allergies – nothing major. We're almost done with the history part, Odell. Just a few more questions, then we'll talk about what you need for your trip. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. She… she managed all that, too. She made sure I took what I needed. She had a little… box with all the pills. Different colors and sizes. She kept it all organized. I didn’t even know what most of them were. Honestly, I just… trusted her. This is… frustrating. I can’t remember anything useful. It feels like my head is empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. It sounds like your wife was very diligent in managing your healthcare, and that’s wonderful. Now, let's talk about your physical health. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic…? No. Nothing like that. I work. I lift airplane parts. It’s… physical work. She always said I was strong. She worried about me getting hurt, though. She made me wear safety boots. And a helmet sometimes. She always looked out for me. I… I don’t think I’ve ever been to the hospital for anything serious. Just… colds. And a broken arm when I was a kid. This is… a waste of time, isn’t it? I just need a shot or something. Can we just get to that part?
DOCTOR: No, it's not a waste of time, Odell. It’s important to get a good understanding of your overall health before recommending any vaccinations or medications. You’ve mentioned you do physical work, which is good, and haven't had any major medical issues. Now, to get a better picture, let's do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. Honestly, I don’t see the point. She always knew if I was sick. She could just… tell. This feels… unnecessary. I just need to go to Nepal. That’s all. Is there anything I need to do before the shot? Or can we just… do it now? I have things to… sort out. Things my wife… arranged.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. No problem at all. Let's start with your vital signs. I'm just going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. It will just take a few minutes. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not significantly. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems within normal limits, Odell. Your blood pressure is slightly high, but that could be related to anxiety about your trip, or simply the stress of the situation. Now, let's discuss the necessary vaccinations and preventative medications for Nepal.
PATIENT: Vaccinations…? Preventative…? Ugh. Look, I just want to go. I don't want to hear about… things. Just tell me what shot I need. And how long it takes. That's it. Honestly, I'm getting a headache. This is… too much. She always took care of all this. She did everything. She always did. I just want to go to Nepal and… and… I don't even know what I want anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. It sounds like you’re going through a lot right now. It’s perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let’s take a deep breath. For Nepal, I recommend a few vaccinations: Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and a Tetanus booster. We also need to discuss malaria prevention. I understand you're not wanting a lot of details right now, so I'll keep it brief. The vaccinations require a series of shots over a few weeks, and the malaria medication is a daily pill you'll start taking before your trip and continue for a few weeks after you return. Before we proceed, I'm concerned about the level of stress you're experiencing and how much you're relying on your wife's past care. It’s important to make sure you’re emotionally prepared for this trip. Have you considered talking to someone about how you’re feeling?
