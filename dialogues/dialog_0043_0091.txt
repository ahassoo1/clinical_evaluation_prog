DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Ziccarelli. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Is good to meet you as well. Well, is like dis... I been feelin’ very, very thirsty lately. More so than usual. And I does be hungry all de time, even after I eat. Is just... a lot. I not sure what is happenin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. Increased thirst and hunger, even after eating… that’s certainly something we should investigate. Can you tell me a little more about how much more thirsty you are?
PATIENT: Well, before, I used to drink maybe... two glass of water a day? Maybe less. Now? Now I does be drinkin’ like... six, seven glass! And still feelin’ dry. I even keep a big bottle with me all de time, and I does be refillin’ it. Is not normal for me, Doctor. Is really botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Six to seven glasses a day is quite a significant increase, Ms. Ziccarelli. And you mentioned the hunger persists even after eating – has the type of food you’re craving changed at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, Doctor. I does be eatin’ what I always eat. Rice and beans, chicken, some vegetables... sometimes a little sweet treat, but not too much. I not eatin’ more of anythin’ special, just... more of everything, to try and feel full. But it don't last long, you know? I does be hungry again soon after.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other changes along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, I does be goin’ to de bathroom more often, I suppose. Peein’ a lot. And sometimes, I does feel a little tired, but I thought dat was just from workin’ so hard. I does be on my feet all day at de pump station, you know? Is hard work. I not sure if dat tiredness is somethin’ else.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Ziccarelli. Increased urination and fatigue are also important pieces of the puzzle. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Well, nothin’ really serious, Doctor. I had de flu a few years back, but everyone get de flu, right? And my knees does bother me sometimes, from standin’ so long at work. De doctor told me it was just arthritis, and gave me some cream. But dat’s about it. I not been sick with anythin’ bad. I does try and stay healthy, you know? I does eat my fruits and vegetables, and I does drink plenty of water... or I used to, before dis started.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries, Ms. Ziccarelli?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I never had no surgeries. Not one. Everything was always natural. I had all my babies de natural way, too! No need for cuttin’ and stitchin’ then, and never had need for it after dat either. Is good to know your body, you know? I always say dat.
DOCTOR: Indeed, Ms. Ziccarelli, that's a very wise perspective. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. My mother, she had de high blood pressure. She was always worryin’ too much, I think dat made it worse. And my grandfather, he had problems with his sugar, de doctor said it was somethin’ he ate. But I not sure what it was exactly. Is a long time ago now, and I was just a little girl then. Nobody else, not that I remember. My husband, he healthy as a horse! Always workin’ in de garden.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't take anythin’. Not a single pill. I try to avoid dem as much as possible. I does believe in lettin’ de body heal itself. I does use some cream for my knees sometimes, like I told you, but dat’s about it. Nothin’ I swallow, no. I does drink some bush tea sometimes, dat my grandmother taught me, but dat nothin’ fancy, just to calm my nerves.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, dat’s fine. You can do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to find out what is makin’ me so thirsty and hungry all de time. Is very botherin’, you know? And I want to feel better. So go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I'll palpate your abdomen. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That’s a little elevated, Ms. Ziccarelli. And your pulse is 88 beats per minute, regular. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears appear normal. No signs of infection. Throat is clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpable.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is not botherin’ me, you touchin’ me. Is just... is a lot of touchin’ all of a sudden! But I understand you need to check. Is everything alright so far? You see anythin’ bad? Is my belly okay? You said somethin’ about it bein’ soft... is dat good? I not sure what all dat mean.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Ms. Ziccarelli. It is a lot of touching, and I want to assure you I’m explaining everything as we go. “Soft” in this case is good – it means there’s no resistance or pain when I touch your abdomen. “Non-tender” means it doesn’t hurt when I press on it. Based on the physical exam, and what you’ve told me about your symptoms – the increased thirst, increased hunger, frequent urination, and fatigue – I’m concerned about the possibility of diabetes. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. To confirm this, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will measure your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and cholesterol. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. My grandfather, he had dat, didn't he? Is dat what you think I have, Doctor? Is dat bad? I don't want no needles if I have to get poked, you know? I not good with needles. And what about my pressure? You said dat was bad too? Is dat from worryin' too much? I been feelin' a little stressed lately, with all dat happenin'. Blood tests... alright, if you think it’s necessary. But no needles if you can help it! Can you do it without pokin’ me? What will happen if I have de diabetes? Will I have to change my whole life? Is dat what you mean?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Ziccarelli. It’s natural to be worried when you hear the word “diabetes.” Based on your symptoms, it's a possibility we need to investigate. The blood tests will give us a definitive answer. Unfortunately, blood tests do require a small blood sample, which means a needle stick. But it’s a very quick and relatively painless procedure. The phlebotomist is very skilled. We can minimize the discomfort. And yes, if you do have diabetes, there will be some lifestyle changes to manage it, but it is manageable. It doesn't mean your life will be drastically different, but it will involve watching your diet, exercising regularly, and potentially medication. Regarding your blood pressure, it can be related to stress, but it’s important to rule out other causes. We’ll need to monitor it closely. For now, let's focus on getting the blood tests done. Then, we’ll have a clearer picture and can discuss a plan moving forward. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you say I have to get poked, I suppose I have to get poked. But please tell de person pokin’ me to be gentle, alright? I not good with pain. And you promise you will explain everything to me if it is de diabetes? What kind of diet? What kind of exercise? I does walk to de pump station every day, is dat enough exercise? And what about my pressure? Will I have to take pills for dat too? Is de high blood pressure dangerous? Oh dear, dis is a lot to take in. Just... just promise me you won't let nothin' bad happen to me, Doctor. You a good doctor, right?
DOCTOR: I promise, Ms. Ziccarelli. I will personally ensure the phlebotomist is gentle. And yes, I absolutely promise I will explain everything to you in detail if the tests confirm a diagnosis of diabetes. We'll discuss a diet that’s both healthy and enjoyable, and we’ll find exercises that you can incorporate into your daily routine. Walking to the pump station is a great start – we can build on that. Regarding your blood pressure, if medication is necessary, it's to protect your heart and kidneys. High blood pressure can be dangerous if left untreated, but it is manageable with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. I understand this is a lot to take in, and you're right to be concerned. But I want you to know that I’m here for you every step of the way. I am a good doctor, and my priority is to ensure your health and well-being. Let's get those tests ordered, and then we'll take it one step at a time. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and send it to the lab. We should have the results back in a few days. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. A few days… I suppose dat’s alright. As long as you promise you won't forget about me. And you will explain everything, even if I ask you a lot of questions? I does worry a lot, you know. And you will be gentle, and de person pokin’ me will be gentle too? Yes, let’s do de tests. Get it over with. But promise me you will call me as soon as you have de results, alright? I don’t want to be waitin’ and worryin’ for too long. And maybe… maybe you can tell me some good stories while you’re pokin’ me? To distract me? Is dat too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise, Ms. Ziccarelli. I won't forget about you. I will explain everything in as much detail as you need, and I’m happy to answer all your questions, no matter how many. And yes, I will ensure the phlebotomist is gentle. And while I’m not known for my storytelling abilities, I can certainly try to distract you while the blood is drawn! We can talk about anything you like. I’ll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood. She’ll explain the procedure. And I will call you as soon as the results are available, I promise. We’ll take this one step at a time, Ms. Ziccarelli. You’re in good hands. .
