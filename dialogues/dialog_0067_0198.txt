DOCTOR: Good morning, Liza. My name is Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Pfennig, it’s lovely to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’m interested in learning more about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I keep hearing good things, and honestly, life feels a little… much sometimes, you know? I thought maybe you could point me in the right direction.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Liza. It's very common to feel overwhelmed, and exploring mindfulness or meditation is a wonderful step to take. It’s great that you’re being proactive about your well-being. To help me understand what might be most helpful for you, could you tell me a little more about what “much” feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? It’s not any one thing, really. It’s like… a lot of little things adding up. Work is pretty demanding – I repair signals and track switches for the railway, so it's important to get it right, you know? And I don’t have family nearby, so it can feel a bit isolating sometimes. It’s just… a constant hum of worry, I suppose. It doesn’t usually stop. I don’t have trouble sleeping, thankfully, but my mind… it races. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Liza. It sounds like you're carrying a lot – a demanding job, a sense of isolation, and a persistent worry. It's very common for those things to build up and create a feeling of being overwhelmed. You mentioned your mind races, even though you're sleeping okay. Is that racing thought focused on anything specific, or is it more general anxiety?
PATIENT: It's… mostly general, I think. Not like, worrying about a specific deadline or a particular problem at work. It’s more… “what ifs.” What if something goes wrong on the tracks? What if I get sick and can't work? What if something happens to a friend I haven't spoken to in a while? Silly things, really, when I say them out loud. But they just… keep going around and around in my head. And it makes it hard to relax, even when there's nothing to worry about. I find myself checking things repeatedly, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Those aren't silly things at all, Liza. It sounds like you have a very conscientious nature, and it’s natural to feel responsibility and care for others. It also sounds like the repetitive thoughts and checking are causing you some distress. Have you experienced anything like this before, or is this a relatively new feeling?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, honestly. I've always been a bit of a worrier, my mother used to say! But it feels… more intense lately. Maybe the last six months or so. Work has been busier, and I haven't been as good about taking care of myself – I used to go for walks more often, but I’ve been too tired. I think those things are probably connected. It's not debilitating, I still go to work and I still see my friends when I can, but… it’s definitely impacting my enjoyment of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know, Liza. So, a tendency towards worry, increased lately with work stress and less self-care, and it’s impacting your enjoyment of things. That sounds like a reasonable description. To get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Of course. Well, I’m generally quite healthy. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor for my regular check-ups. I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up quickly with antibiotics. I don’t have any chronic conditions – no high blood pressure or diabetes, nothing like that. I’ve never had any surgeries. Oh, and I’m single, so no family history to worry about on that front! I think that’s about it, really. I try to eat well and I don’t smoke. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Liza. A healthy lifestyle is a great foundation. No significant medical history or surgeries, which is excellent. And enjoying a glass of wine is perfectly fine in moderation. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I've taken antibiotics a few times for colds or infections, and I’ve had the flu shot every year, but never any problems. I'm pretty lucky that way, I suppose. My skin is a bit sensitive, so I use unscented soaps and lotions, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No allergies or sensitivities to report. It sounds like you're generally a very healthy individual, and that's wonderful. Given what you've described—increased stress, racing thoughts, and a bit of isolation—it sounds like exploring mindfulness or meditation could be very beneficial. Before we talk about specific resources, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to make sure there aren't any other underlying factors contributing to how you're feeling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds sensible. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I haven’t had a full check-up in a while, so it’s probably a good idea anyway. What will you be looking for, exactly? I don't mind, but I always get a little nervous around doctors!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Liza. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Just routine things to make sure everything is functioning normally. I'll also feel your lymph nodes. It's a quick exam, and I'll explain everything as I go. It's just to rule out any physical causes for the feelings you've been experiencing. Let's start with your blood pressure. Can you just relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Alright. Relax… easier said than done, I suppose! I hope it’s not too high, all this talking probably isn’t helping! I do get a bit anxious at the dentist too, it’s just… a thing, I guess.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel a little anxious, Liza. And it can raise your blood pressure, so don't worry about it. We'll take it again if needed. Okay, your blood pressure is 132/88. A little elevated, but not concerning given your recent anxiety. We'll keep an eye on it. Just breathe normally for me, Liza. Everything sounds clear and strong. No murmurs or wheezing. Okay, lungs sound good. Now, let me just take a quick look in your ears. Ears look clear, no sign of infection. And finally, let me just take a peek in your throat. Throat looks healthy too. No redness or swelling. Everything seems normal physically, which is good.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. I always worry about something being seriously wrong, so it’s reassuring to know everything sounds okay. Thank you for being so thorough, Dr. Pfennig. Now, about that mindfulness… where do we begin?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. It's always better to rule things out. So, mindfulness. There are a lot of different approaches. One of the simplest is mindful breathing—focusing on the sensation of your breath as it comes in and out. It sounds simple, but it takes practice. Your mind will wander, and that’s okay. The point isn’t to stop your thoughts, but to gently redirect your attention back to your breath. There are also guided meditations, which can be very helpful, especially when you're starting out. Apps like Headspace and Calm are popular, and many are free or have free trials. Would you be comfortable exploring those?
PATIENT: That sounds manageable, actually. I’ve heard of Headspace, I think my friend mentioned it. I'm a bit skeptical, to be honest – I’m not very good at “sitting still” and emptying my mind. But if it’s just about gently redirecting my attention, that sounds less daunting. Are there any in-person classes you’d recommend, or are the apps really a good place to start? I always feel like I learn better with someone guiding me, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Liza. Some people definitely prefer in-person guidance. It's great you’re aware of what works best for you. I do have a few recommendations locally. The Willow Creek Community Center offers a beginner’s mindfulness course on Tuesdays, and I believe there’s a yoga studio, Serenity Flow, that incorporates mindfulness into their classes. I can give you their contact information. However, the apps are a really good place to start, especially if you want to build a consistent practice. They have structured programs for beginners, and you can do them at your own pace, in the comfort of your own home. You could also try a combination – start with the apps to get a feel for it, and then consider an in-person class if you feel like you need more guidance. What do you think would be a good first step for you?
PATIENT: Hmm. You know what? I think the apps sound like the least intimidating option. I can try it at home, whenever I have a few minutes, and no pressure if I can’t “get it” right away. And then, if I find I’m enjoying it, maybe I’ll look into the classes. Could you send me the information for those, just in case? That would be wonderful. And thank you for not making me feel silly for even asking! I sometimes worry that these things are just… “fluff,” you know? But I’m willing to try anything to feel a little less overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Liza. It's wonderful that you're open to trying something new. And you're not silly at all. Mindfulness is a very evidence-based practice, and it's been shown to be helpful for a lot of different things—stress, anxiety, even chronic pain. It's not "fluff" at all. I'll email you the information for both Willow Creek and Serenity Flow. They both have websites with class schedules and contact information. So, to summarize, we've discussed your stress and racing thoughts, ruled out any obvious physical causes, and decided to start with mindfulness apps like Headspace. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you, Dr. Pfennig. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I feel a bit more hopeful already, just having a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. I’m glad I could help. Remember, it takes practice, so be patient with yourself. And don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I hope you find some peace and calm.
