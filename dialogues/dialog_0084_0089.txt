DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, it’s… it’s about my stomach, I believe. A pain, quite severe at times. It’s been… recurring, you see. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, so specifics… escape me. But it’s concerning, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Recurring stomach pain. That is concerning. Let's try to get a clearer picture of things. When did you first start noticing this pain?
PATIENT: Oh dear. When did I… Hmm. That’s a difficult question. It feels like… several months now? Perhaps longer. It comes and goes, you see. There was a period where it wasn’t so bad, and then… it flares up. I really wish I could be more precise. I do apologize. It's… frustrating for both of us, I imagine.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. Glymph. It’s perfectly alright. These things happen. Several months... okay. And can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Well… it's a deep ache, mostly. Lower down, in my abdomen. Sometimes it feels like cramping, very strong cramping. And other times… it’s just a dull, persistent pressure. It makes it difficult to… well, to do much at all, when it’s at its worst. It doesn't seem to be related to eating, not that I've noticed, anyway. Though, perhaps I haven’t been paying close enough attention. It’s all a bit… hazy, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a deep ache, cramping, sometimes just pressure… lower abdomen. Not consistently related to eating. I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… There’s been… fatigue, certainly. A lot of fatigue. More than usual, even for me. And… I’ve been feeling a bit… swollen, I suppose. Around my stomach, mostly. Not a dramatic amount, but noticeable. And… occasionally, a bit of nausea, but I rarely actually get sick. It’s just… a queasy feeling. Does that make sense? I hope I'm not rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. That's helpful information, Ms. Glymph. Fatigue, some swelling in your abdomen, and occasional nausea. Let’s go through a little bit more detail. Is the swelling constant, or does it come and go like the pain?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I believe it comes and goes… yes. It’s worse when the pain is at its worst, certainly. I hadn’t really connected the two before, you see. But thinking about it now… yes, the swelling seems to fluctuate with the pain. It’s not always dramatic, mind you. More of a… fullness, really. And it’s difficult to tell sometimes, because… well, I'm not as active as I used to be. So, noticing these things can be tricky.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling related to pain, and you've noticed it's harder to track because of decreased activity levels. I appreciate you sharing that. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're asking about… personal things. Let me see... I suppose they've been… irregular. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… not. It’s been rather unpredictable, truthfully. Nothing terribly alarming, I don’t think. Just… not my usual routine. I'm afraid I don't pay as much attention to those details as I probably should. It's a bit embarrassing to discuss, really.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. It's important information, and you're not at all embarrassing me. Irregular bowel movements – sometimes constipation, sometimes not. Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! No, I haven’t. Not that I recall, anyway. That would be… alarming. I’m quite certain I would remember something like that. No, no blood. Definitely not. I do try to stay on top of things, you see, but… sometimes my memory fails me. But I’m quite sure about that. No blood.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. There's… the lupus. Systemic lupus erythematosus, the doctors call it. It's been… well, a long time now. Decades. I take medication for it, of course. And… I've had some issues with my joints over the years. Arthritis, I believe. And… oh, there was something else… It's all a bit fuzzy. I apologize. I used to have all the details written down, but… I seem to have misplaced it.
DOCTOR: Okay, lupus and arthritis. And you take medication for those conditions. Do you recall what medications you are currently taking for those conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that is a difficult question. I believe… there’s something for the joint pain. A pill, small and white. And… something else for the lupus. It keeps flaring up, you see. I take several pills, truthfully. I have a little box at home, with all the medications. I just can’t recall the names. It’s terribly frustrating. My daughter usually helps me with that. She manages a lot of the paperwork. Perhaps she could tell you?
DOCTOR: Okay, several medications for lupus and arthritis, but you’re unsure of the specific names. We can certainly ask your daughter to provide that information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. I don't think so. I haven't had any reactions that I recall. I used to be allergic to… something as a child, but I believe I outgrew it. Nothing comes to mind at the moment. I'm fairly careful about what I take, you see. I always check with the pharmacist before starting anything new. But no, I don't believe I have any current allergies. It's all a bit… hazy, as usual. Apologies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and gently pressing on it to check for tenderness. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed. I understand it’s necessary. I may… flinch if it’s particularly painful, you see. My tolerance isn’t what it once was. But please, don’t hesitate. I want to get to the bottom of this, as much as I am able. It’s just… unsettling, this pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, sounds are… normal. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain. Okay, any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Just there. A little… sharp. Not excruciating, but… definitely noticeable. It’s… uncomfortable. It feels… deeper there, you see. Not just on the surface. It’s… worrying, truthfully. Is that… a bad sign?
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about here?
PATIENT: No, not so much there. A little… pressure, perhaps. But nothing like the right side. It’s… mostly localized to the right lower quadrant, you see. That’s where the discomfort is most pronounced. It feels… almost like a… throbbing, when you press there. A faint throbbing. It's unsettling, I must admit. Is that… what pain from lupus usually feels like? Or could it be something else?
DOCTOR: Okay. And when I let go, does the pain stay, or does it go away quickly?
PATIENT: Hmm… it lingers. It doesn’t vanish immediately. It… fades slowly, but it’s still present for a few moments. A dull ache, you see. It’s not as sharp as when you’re pressing, but it doesn’t disappear instantly. It's… persistent. It’s rather concerning, truthfully. I do hope it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on the physical exam and what you've told me, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Given the pain in your right lower quadrant, the tenderness, and the lingering pain after palpation, we need to rule out some potential causes. One possibility is a flare-up of your lupus affecting your abdominal area, but given the localized pain, we also need to consider other things like diverticulitis or even something like a kidney issue. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some lab work. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a urinalysis. We'll also order an abdominal CT scan to get a better view of your organs and rule out any structural problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan… that sounds… rather involved. But if it’s necessary to get to the bottom of this, then yes, please. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Lab work and a scan… it sounds… thorough. I do hope it’s not anything too serious. I’m not as strong as I used to be, you see. But yes, please proceed with the tests. I want to know what’s going on, as much as I’m able. When can we schedule these tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll have the lab order and CT scan order sent to the front desk. They'll schedule you for the lab work first, and then the CT scan. The lab usually doesn't require an appointment, but the CT scan will. They’ll call you to schedule that. It's best to do the lab work as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you something for the pain. It's a mild analgesic. It shouldn't interfere with any other medications you are taking, but please let me know if you experience any side effects. And, I’m going to send a message to your primary care physician, letting them know what’s going on. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. A mild analgesic sounds… very welcome. And letting my primary care physician know is… thoughtful. Let me see… Will the CT scan… involve radiation? I’ve heard… things. And will the results take long to come back? I do worry about… waiting. It’s the uncertainty, you see. And… is there anything I should avoid doing while we’re waiting for the results? Anything to watch out for?
DOCTOR: Yes, a CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation. However, the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks, especially in your case. The radiation dose is minimal, and we take every precaution to minimize your exposure. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back, but I'll have the radiology department prioritize them, given your concerns. We'll call you as soon as we have them. While we're waiting, I would advise you to avoid any strenuous activity. Stay hydrated, eat a light diet, and most importantly, if you experience a fever, severe abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Voytek. You’ve been very… thorough, and reassuring. I do appreciate your patience, especially with my… hazy recollections. I feel… a little less anxious now, knowing we’re taking steps to find out what’s going on. I'll schedule the lab work as soon as I can. Thank you again. Perhaps we can discuss the results next week?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I'm glad I could help ease your anxiety. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week, once we have the results. The front desk can help with that. In the meantime, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or questions. Take care, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I'll be in touch.
