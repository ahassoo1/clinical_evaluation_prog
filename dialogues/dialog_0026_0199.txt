DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Marquie. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Thanks. It’s…well, I’ve been getting really short of breath lately. Like, just…out of nowhere. It’s kinda scary, to be honest. I don’t…I don’t really know why it’s happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That is concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. “Short of breath” can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm…when did it start? That’s…tough. It feels like it’s been gradually getting worse, maybe over the last few months? I'm not good with dates, sorry. It wasn't sudden, if that makes sense. Just…more and more often I find myself having to catch my breath. I think it was worse a couple weeks ago, maybe? But honestly, everything’s kinda blurring together.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Marquie. It's perfectly alright. "Gradually worsening" is helpful information. And yes, a couple weeks ago being worse is good to know. Now, when you say “having to catch your breath,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s hard to explain. Like…like I’m not getting enough air. It’s not a pain, exactly, just…a tightness in my chest, and I feel like I have to work to breathe. I kinda gasp sometimes, even when I'm just sitting still. It makes me a little dizzy sometimes too. My wife keeps telling me I look really worried when it happens. I don't remember it feeling this bad before, but…like I said, my memory isn’t the best.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness in the chest, feeling like you’re working to breathe, and some dizziness with it. That gives me a bit more to work with. Is this happening at any particular time of day, or with any specific activities?
PATIENT: Not really, no. That’s the frustrating part! It seems to happen randomly. Sometimes when I’m just walking around the house, sometimes when I'm trying to relax and watch TV, even…well, it happened yesterday while I was working, just…out of nowhere. No heavy lifting or anything. It doesn't seem to be linked to anything specific, which is…worrisome. My job is pretty physical, but I've been doing it for years and haven’t had issues before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Random onset, regardless of activity. That does point us in a few different directions. Let’s talk about some other things, just to get a better picture. Do you have any cough with this?
PATIENT: A cough? Not really, no. Maybe a little, occasionally, but nothing major. It's not like a bad cough, or a cough that brings anything up. Just…a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but I wouldn’t say it’s related to the breathing stuff. It’s just…there. It's not constant. Does that make sense? I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes, living in the city and all, but…no real cough.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. No significant cough. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever…no, I don’t think so. Chills…not really. Night sweats? Hmm…maybe? My wife says I sometimes get a little warm at night, but I always just figured it was the blankets. I use a pretty heavy blanket, you know? It’s comfortable. I don't usually wake up drenched or anything. Honestly, I haven’t been keeping track of stuff like that. I just…feel tired a lot, but I work a lot. So I figured it was that.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, chills, or significant night sweats. Fatigue, but that's attributed to work. Let’s move on to your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like asthma, COPD, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh, let me think. I haven’t really been to the doctor much, if that makes sense. Back home, things were…different. Not a lot of access to good healthcare. I think…I think I had some high blood pressure once, a few years ago, but it went down with diet and exercise. Nothing serious. I don't think I've ever been diagnosed with anything else. I've always been pretty healthy, honestly. Just…this breathing thing is new. I'm starting to get really worried about it. Sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Marquie. It’s good you mentioned the high blood pressure; we’ll want to check that. And not having regular healthcare access is important information. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. Never been hospitalized. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but it healed up fine. Just the broken arm, that’s it. I avoid hospitals if I can. They…they aren’t fun places. And, like I said, back home, things were…complicated. It was better to just…deal with things on my own, if possible. I know that sounds silly, but…it’s true. So, just the broken arm, a long time ago. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay. No surgeries or hospitalizations, other than the broken arm as a child. Now, regarding family history – do your parents or siblings have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, lung problems, or asthma?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history... That's tough. My parents…they're both gone now, unfortunately. My dad died of…something heart-related, I think. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't really involved in the details. My mom…she had diabetes, I think. But honestly, I don’t remember a lot of specifics. I have a brother and a sister, but I haven’t seen them in years. We don’t really talk. I don’t know anything about their medical history. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory is just…fuzzy. I’m really starting to worry about this breathing. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Marquie. You've provided quite a bit of helpful information, even with the difficulty remembering. And it’s understandable about the family history. We’ll work with what we have. Now, just a few more questions before we do a quick physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No medications. Nothing. I don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Never been much of a medication person. Just…the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that’s it. I try to stay healthy through diet and exercise. My wife gets me to take some vitamins sometimes, but honestly, I forget to take them half the time. So, no regular medications at all. Just…the occasional headache pill.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I mean, I get itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but I don't think that's an allergy, exactly. Just…a little sniffly. So, no allergies that I'm aware of. Can we…can we get this figured out, Doctor? I’m really starting to get anxious. This breathing thing is scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, Marquie. No allergies. Thank you for answering all those questions so patiently. It's understandable you're anxious, and we'll do our best to figure this out. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen levels, and take your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Please. I just…I want to know what’s going on. Listening to my lungs and heart sounds good. I hope it’s nothing serious. My wife is really worried too. She made me promise to go to the doctor right away. So…let's get it over with. I'm ready, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit up on the examination table for me. I'm just going to listen to your breathing with this stethoscope. Try to take some nice, deep breaths in and out. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 145 over 90. Your pulse is 88 and regular. And your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is good. When I listen to your lungs…I do hear some mild wheezing, particularly on your right side. It's not significant, but it's something we need to investigate further. Is it harder to breath when you lay down?
PATIENT: Wheezing? What does that mean? Laying down...uh, sometimes it feels a little bit tighter when I lay down, yeah. Not every time, but sometimes. I usually just prop myself up with pillows. It’s easier that way. I didn't think that was anything important. Does that mean it’s something bad, Doctor? My heart is racing just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Wheezing is a whistling sound when you breathe, and it usually means there’s some narrowing of your airways. The fact that it’s worse when you lie down is also helpful information. It can be caused by a few different things. It doesn't automatically mean something is bad, but it does need to be investigated. I'm going to ask you to take a few deep breaths for me while I check your chest for any tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels painful. No tenderness when I press. It’s unlikely to be something immediately serious, but your elevated blood pressure combined with the wheezing makes me want to do some basic blood work to rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Ugh…I hate needles. But…okay, if it’ll help figure things out, then yeah, sure. I just…I’m really not good with needles. What kind of things are you looking for in the blood work, Doctor? Is it something really bad? I’m getting really anxious now. Maybe I should have just stayed home. My wife is gonna kill me if I faint.
DOCTOR: It's alright, many people don't like needles. It will just be a simple blood draw, and the nurse is very good at it. It will be over before you know it. We’re going to look at your complete blood count, your electrolytes, and some basic markers of inflammation. It will help us rule out things like infection, anemia, or other potential causes of your symptoms. We’re not necessarily looking for something bad, but we want to be thorough. It’s always best to have a clear picture of what's going on. Would you like me to explain the blood draw process a little more, and I can let the nurse know you're feeling anxious?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explaining it would be good. I'm just...it's just stupid, I know, but I get really worked up about these things. And yes, please tell the nurse I'm nervous. She probably deals with this all the time, right? I hope she's patient. My wife says I get a little…dramatic sometimes. I just…I don't like feeling out of control. So, yeah, explain the blood draw, please. And tell the nurse I'm a big baby.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed, Marquie. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical procedures. Okay, the blood draw itself is pretty quick. A nurse will tie a small tourniquet around your upper arm to make your veins more visible. They’ll then clean the area with an alcohol swab and insert a small needle into a vein – usually in the crook of your elbow. You might feel a brief pinch or stinging sensation, but it shouldn't be painful. They’ll collect a small amount of blood into different tubes, and then remove the needle and apply a bandage. It usually takes just a few minutes, and you won't even notice when it's over. I’ll let the nurse know you're feeling anxious, and she'll be extra gentle. She’s very experienced and will make you feel as comfortable as possible. And we’ll make sure you're sitting comfortably during the whole process. I’ll go ahead and get the orders for the blood work sent to the lab, and I’ll let the nurse know to come in as soon as she’s available. While we're waiting for the results, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No…I think that’s it. Just…thank you. For being patient with me, and explaining everything. It’s just…a lot to take in. I’m really hoping it’s nothing serious. My wife…she worries so much. I don’t want to scare her. Is it possible it’s just…allergies? Maybe something in the air? We just moved here a few months ago, and the air feels…different. I just wish I knew what was going on. Okay, I guess just…wait for the blood work. I'm gonna try to relax. Thanks again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marquie. And it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Allergies are a possibility, especially with the change in location, but we want to rule out other potential causes first. That’s why the blood work is important. In the meantime, try to take some deep breaths and focus on relaxing. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible, and we’ll discuss them together as soon as they’re available. I'll also check your medical records to see if there are any known allergies listed. And it’s good that you’re thinking about your wife. It's always helpful to have support during times like these. I’ll go ahead and get the nurse prepped, and I’ll be right back with her. In the meantime, if you start feeling any worsening of your symptoms – like increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness – please let me or the nurse know immediately, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. I will. Thanks again, Doctor. I'll just…sit here and try to breathe. And I’ll let you know if anything gets worse. I really appreciate you being so understanding. It's...it's nice to feel like someone is listening. .
