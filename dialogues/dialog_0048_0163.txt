DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Vantine, is it?
PATIENT: Indeed, Doctor. Jarvis Vantine, at your service. Though, I daresay 'service' is a rather grand word for a chap seeking a bit of advice on… well, rather foolish dietary experiments, truth be told.
DOCTOR: Dietary experiments. Yes. At your age, Mr. Vantine, “experiments” are rarely a good idea. Now, let’s not beat around the bush. What exactly have you been experimenting with, and what’s brought you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it began innocently enough, you understand. A rather… enthusiastic young man at the gym, touting the virtues of the “Carnivore Diet.” Pure protein, Doctor. No carbohydrates at all. Said it was the key to vitality. Then, after that proved… less than agreeable, I stumbled upon something called the “Blue Diet.” Essentially, only blueberries, lemon juice, and a small amount of protein powder. It seemed… simpler. And, well, I’ve always liked blueberries. Though, I confess, my energy levels have been rather… diminished, and my wife – my ex-wife, I should clarify – pointed out I was starting to resemble a rather pale ghost. Hence, the visit. I believe she might have been exaggerating, but one does prefer to err on the side of caution.
DOCTOR: Carnivore… Blue… Goodness. Well, Mr. Vantine, I must say, your commitment to… unconventional eating is admirable, if misguided. Diminished energy levels, pale complexion… have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes, actually. A rather persistent chill, despite the summer weather. And my digestion… well, let’s just say it’s been… irregular. Not painful, thankfully, simply… unpredictable. And, if I’m being entirely honest, my memory, normally quite sharp – I can recall details from my days working on The Invisible Man, you know – has been… a touch hazy. Nothing alarming, just… names escaping me, forgetting where I placed my spectacles, that sort of thing. Though, I did find them on top of the refrigerator yesterday, which is rather unusual.
DOCTOR: Right. Irregular digestion, chills, and some memory lapses. Hazy memory at 85 isn’t necessarily unusual, but we should investigate. Let’s start with a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A thorough examination sounds… sensible. Though, I must confess, I’ve always felt a bit like a specimen under these circumstances. Still, duty calls, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is… soft, but a little tender in the lower quadrants. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse 72. Not alarming, but we'll need some bloodwork to get a clearer picture. I’d like to check your vitamin levels, particularly B12 and D, and a complete blood count to rule out any deficiencies. Any known allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies, hmm. Nothing of any consequence, thankfully. A slight reaction to certain pollens in my youth, but nothing that required more than a handkerchief and a bit of patience. No, I’m rather fortunate in that regard. Though, I do find that strong perfumes tend to… disagree with me. Not an allergy, per se, just a rather unpleasant sensation. And, perhaps, a slight sensitivity to shellfish, but I haven’t indulged in oysters for decades, so it’s hardly relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: Pollens and perfumes… irrelevant, as you say. Now, any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a small dose of Lisinopril, prescribed by my GP some years ago for… well, a slight elevation in blood pressure, which seems to be well-controlled. And occasionally, a mild analgesic for my arthritis, but only when it flares up, which isn't terribly frequent. I prefer a hot soak in the tub, to be honest. More effective, and far more agreeable. I believe that’s all. Nothing… exotic, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… Right. And you said occasional analgesic?
PATIENT: Indeed. Just Ibuprofen, Doctor. When the joints protest a bit too loudly. Usually, a 200mg tablet, perhaps twice a week at most. Though, I've been trying to manage it with gentle exercise and a bit of fish oil. It seems to help, to a degree. I’ve always been a rather… active chap, despite my age, and I find staying mobile is the key.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Given your history of unusual diets, diminished energy, chills, irregular digestion, and some memory lapses, I’m going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count with differential, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a thyroid panel. We'll also check your electrolytes. And, given the occasional Ibuprofen use, we should check your kidney function. I’ll also send a stool sample to the lab to rule out any infections. This will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. I suspect it may be a combination of nutritional deficiencies and, potentially, a mild underlying infection. I’ll have the lab results back within a few days. In the meantime, please refrain from any further… dietary experiments.
PATIENT: A thorough investigation, Doctor. Sensible, indeed. And a wise precaution regarding the… experiments. I confess, I shall heed your advice. A rather stern lecture from my ex-wife was quite sufficient motivation, to be honest. She’s a woman of… strong opinions. And I shall endeavor to avoid any further radical shifts in my eating habits. Though, perhaps a small blueberry or two won't cause too much harm? I trust the tests are not too… invasive? And how long will they take to administer? I have a rather important appointment with the local historical society next week, and I wouldn't want to miss it. They're discussing the early days of cinema, you see, and I have a rather fascinating anecdote to share.
DOCTOR: The tests are quite routine, Mr. Vantine. A simple blood draw and a small stool sample. Shouldn’t take more than fifteen minutes at the lab. And I highly doubt it will interfere with your historical society meeting. I'll have the results sent to your GP, and we can discuss them next week. In the meantime, try to eat a balanced diet and stay hydrated. And please, no more “experiments.” I think that’s all for today. .
