DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tremor, they said I should come in about a tremor. It’s… well, it’s in my hands, mostly. Been happening for a bit now, I suppose. Not sure how long, exactly. Things aren’t what they used to be, you know? Hard to keep track of dates.
DOCTOR: A tremor, you say. In your hands… and you’re having difficulty pinpointing when it started. That’s alright, we can work with that. Can you describe the tremor to me?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It’s like… a shaking. A little wobble. Not constant, not all the time. Happens more when I try to… do things. Like, holding a cup of coffee. Or… buttoning my shirt. Things like that. It's not painful, just… annoying. And makes a mess sometimes. Not much fun, really.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's exacerbated by activity – specifically fine motor skills. And it doesn't cause you any pain. Is it present when you’re resting, say, when your hands are just… lying in your lap?
PATIENT: Resting… let me think. I… think so, sometimes. But it's much worse when I try to do something. When I'm just sitting, it's barely noticeable. It’s hard to tell, really. Like I said, things aren't as clear as they used to be. Maybe it's always a little there? I don't know. Is that helpful? I'm sorry, I'm probably not making much sense.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Jezik. You’re doing just fine. It’s common for these things to be difficult to describe. So, it seems to be present at rest, but worsens with activity. Has anyone else noticed this tremor?
PATIENT: Hmm… my daughter, I think. She mentioned something about it a while back when she was visiting. Said I spilled my tea a couple of times. She’s a good girl, always looking out for me. I don’t see her much anymore, though. She’s busy. I don’t really tell people about it. It's just… embarrassing, you know? Makes me feel old and shaky.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. Now, let's move on to some other questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tremor?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… well, I’ve been a bit… tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And my… balance isn't what it used to be. I nearly tripped over the rug the other day. But that could just be getting old, right? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what’s normal anymore. Everything feels… off. Is this going to take long? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and some balance issues… alright. We’ll get through this as efficiently as possible, Mr. Jezik. I just need to gather a bit more information to get a clearer picture. Now, have you experienced any stiffness in your muscles or joints?
PATIENT: Stiffness… Sometimes. My shoulders, mostly. A little bit in my back too. Not terrible, just… achy. Like I slept in a funny position. It’s usually worse in the morning. I used to be a pretty active man, you know? Worked hard all my life. This isn’t like me.
DOCTOR: I see. So, some morning stiffness. And you were previously quite active. Now, have you noticed any changes in your speech or swallowing?
PATIENT: Changes in… speech? No, I don’t think so. My daughter would have told me if I was mumbling or something. She's very observant. And swallowing… no, everything goes down alright. I haven’t had any trouble with that. I did have a bit of a cold last month, but that cleared up. Is this all important, Doctor? I really do need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to cover all bases, Mr. Jezik. Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… Hmm. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was… a long time ago. And my blood pressure used to be a little high, but I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I try to take care of myself, eat alright, but… things slip. I don't really remember much else, honestly. It was all so long ago. I don't even know if I have insurance anymore. It’s a mess.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, and a history of hypertension. And you haven't seen a doctor regularly for some time. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications… Just… sometimes I take something for my knees. When they’re really aching. It’s… ibuprofen, I think. The regular kind. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a little something… but it doesn’t really help. I can’t remember the name. It's one of those things my wife used to get for me. She's gone now, you know. A long time ago. Everything feels so… distant.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and an occasional sleep aid. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat just about anything. My wife always said I had an iron stomach. But honestly, Doctor, I can’t remember a lot of things these days. It’s like my memory is just… fading. Is this taking much longer? I really need to get to my appointment. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. We’ll proceed. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. I’ll check your reflexes, coordination, and muscle strength. Is that alright?
PATIENT: An exam… Fine. But please be quick. I really don’t have much time. And try not to… you know, poke around too much. It gets… uncomfortable. Just get it over with, please. I have a lot on my mind.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. I'll start with your reflexes. Extend your leg for me, please. And now the other one. Now, could you follow my finger with your eyes?
