DOCTOR: Right. Lucia Fogelstrom. Thirty-eight years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hello Doctor. It’s… the belching. I keep… burping. A lot. It’s been happening for, I think, maybe a week now? It’s not painful, exactly. Just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Annoying. Right. And… how would you describe the frequency?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It’s… after I eat, mostly. And sometimes just… random. Like, I was walking to the bus stop this morning and… burp Excuse me. There it is again! Maybe… ten, fifteen times a day? It’s hard to say for sure. I don’t keep a count, you know?
DOCTOR: Ten to fifteen times a day. Okay. And what did you eat today?
PATIENT: Let’s see… this morning I had a little bit of toast with… guava jam. And a coffee. Then, for lunch, I had a sandwich. Ham and cheese. And… an apple. Nothing too fancy. And I drank some water, of course. Why do you ask? Is something wrong with the food? I don’t think it’s that bad.
DOCTOR: We have to rule things out. It’s… basic procedure. And it's not necessarily the food. Just… attempting to gather information. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I mean, my stomach sometimes feels a little… full? But that’s probably just because I ate. And maybe a little… gassy? But that’s with the burping, you know? Nothing else. No pain, no… feeling sick, nothing like that. I just want the burping to stop. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Right. No nausea, no abdominal pain. Just… excessive belching and some fullness. Any recent changes in your diet, or…stress levels?
PATIENT: Hmmm… diet… not really. I eat pretty much the same things all the time. As for stress… well, work is a little busy right now. We’re trying to get a new machine set up, and it's… complicated. But I wouldn’t say it’s stressful stressful, you know? Just… a lot to do. Is that important? Could that make me burp?
DOCTOR: It could. Everything is connected. Have you tried anything to alleviate it?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I tried drinking some ginger ale. My grandmother always said that helps with the stomach. And I tried not eating so fast. But it doesn’t really seem to make a difference. I don’t know what else to do. I thought maybe it was something serious?
DOCTOR: Serious. Unlikely, but we still need to be thorough. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen. Nothing invasive, just a basic check.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… okay. I hope it doesn't take long. I have to pick up my nephew later. He gets out of school at four. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, four o’clock. Just… let’s get this over with. If you could lie down, please. And try to relax. Breathe normally. Just… normal breaths. Hmm. Okay. Everything seems normal, but let’s rule out a few possibilities. I want to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Reflexes? Like… when they hit your knee with a little hammer? I remember that from school. Is everything okay? You seem a little… worried.
DOCTOR: Standard procedure. Your reflexes are normal. Given your symptoms and the physical exam… it sounds like simple aerophagia. Essentially, you’re swallowing too much air. It's not a serious condition. Often dietary or behavioral. I recommend avoiding carbonated beverages, eating slowly, and… trying to reduce stress if possible. If it persists, or worsens, then we can consider further investigation. But for now…this should resolve on its own. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Um… so, it’s just… air? Like, I’m eating too fast and getting too much air in my stomach? That’s… it? That’s good, I guess. So, no medicine or anything? Just… eat slower? And not drink soda? That’s… okay. I can do that. What if I forget and drink a soda? Will I be burping forever?
DOCTOR: No, you won't be burping "forever." It's not a life sentence. Occasional lapses are…unavoidable. Just make a conscious effort. Here. A summary of my recommendations. Avoid carbonated beverages, eat slowly, reduce stress. Do you have any other concerns before I need to see the next patient?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. No, I think that’s… everything. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I’ll try to eat slower. And less soda. I promise. Four o’clock, right? To pick up my nephew? Just wanted to make sure. .
