DOCTOR: Hi Devin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. It’s… my cough. Been coughin’ up stuff. Not just regular stuff, you know? There's… red in it. I smoke, so I figured maybe… but it’s worryin’ me a little. I don’t remember exactly when it started, just… been happenin’ lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A cough with some red in the mucus is definitely something we want to check out, even with a smoking history. It’s good you’re getting it looked at. “Lately” is a little vague, though – can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe… a month? Two months, maybe? Time kinda… slips. I work a lot. Power stuff, you know? Dispatchin’. Keeps me busy. It’s not constant constant, the red, but it happens often enough now that… well, here I am. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Devin, it absolutely does. A month or two is helpful. And dispatching sounds stressful – lots of responsibility. Okay, so a cough for about a month or two, with red mucus appearing "often enough" to bring you in. Besides the red, is the mucus any other color?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes it’s just… dark. Like, brownish. Not always red, like I said. And it’s… thick. Hard to get up sometimes. I gotta really… push. I don't know what else to tell ya. It ain’t easy talkin’ about this stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand, it’s never easy discussing these things. Okay, so we've got a cough for about a month or two, mucus is sometimes red, sometimes dark brownish, and it's thick and hard to clear. Do you have any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I get tired easier, I guess. Workin’ long shifts, it just feels… harder now. And a little short of breath sometimes, climbin’ stairs. Not awful, but I notice it. No fever, I don't think. I haven't checked. I just figured it was the cough makin’ me tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and some shortness of breath, especially with exertion like climbing stairs. No fever that you’ve noticed. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. Probably. My clothes feel a little looser, but I ain’t been payin’ much attention. I eat when I can, mostly fast food, truth be told. I don't have time to cook. So… maybe? Hard to say. I ain't weighin' myself or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, possible weight loss, along with the fatigue, shortness of breath, and the cough with reddish-brown mucus. Now, have you had any chest pain at all, with the cough or otherwise?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. It feels tight sometimes, like my chest is… constricted. When I cough real hard. But not like… a sharp pain. More like a pressure. Does that make any sense? I just figured it was from strainin’ myself. I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tightness or pressure in your chest with coughing, not a sharp pain. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past health. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything like asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t think so. I’ve been sick, like colds and the flu, you know? But never anything… serious. Never been told I had any of them fancy names. I get checked when I have to for work, but everything always comes back… okay. Mostly. I forget what they tell me, to be honest. Long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnoses of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia. And routine work checkups have been generally okay, as far as you recall. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think… Nope. Never had any surgeries. Broke my arm when I was a kid, they put a cast on it, but that’s it. Nothing major. Just the arm, real long time ago. I don’t… remember much else. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, just a broken arm as a child. Now, thinking about your family – are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mom, she had… somethin’ with her lungs, I think. She smoked, too. Real bad. Coughin’ a lot towards the end. That's about all I remember, to be honest. My dad was… healthy, I think. Worked construction. Strong guy. Never got sick much. It’s hard to remember details… It’s been a long time. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your mother had lung issues and smoked, and your father was generally healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Don’t take nothin’ regular. Just… over-the-counter stuff sometimes for a cold. Cough drops, that kinda thing. I try to avoid the doctors when I can. But this cough… it ain’t goin’ away. It's makin' me worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Okay, Devin, this is good information. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Whatever you need to do. Just… get it over with, please. I got a dispatch to get back to. Not tryin’ to be rude, but I got people dependin' on me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. We'll be as quick as possible. Okay, if you could just take a deep breath for me…and another… good. Okay. I'm hearing some wheezing in your lungs, and some crackles as well, mostly in the lower lobes. That's consistent with some congestion. There’s some dullness to percussion on the lower right side. Your lymph nodes feel normal. Your heart sounds regular, and your blood pressure is 140/90. Okay. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The X-ray will help us see if there’s anything obvious going on in your lungs, and the blood work will check for infection and other potential issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work… yeah, alright. Sounds… necessary, I guess. Just… how long will it take? I really gotta get back to work. And… is it somethin’ bad? Don't gotta tell me if you don’t wanna, just… what am I lookin’ at here? I don't like bein' outta the loop.
DOCTOR: Okay. The X-ray and blood work should take about an hour or so, start to finish. The radiologist will need to read the X-ray, and the lab will need time to process the blood. It's hard to say definitively what's going on at this point without those results, but the wheezing and crackles, along with the red mucus, shortness of breath, and possible weight loss, are concerning enough that we need to investigate further. It could be a number of things - bronchitis, pneumonia, or something else entirely. Given your smoking history, we need to rule out anything serious. I don't want to alarm you, but it's always best to be thorough. We’ll get the results as quickly as possible and discuss them with you. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an albuterol inhaler to help with the wheezing. It should give you some relief.
PATIENT: Albuterol… inhaler. Okay. Sounds… serious. But alright. Gotta do what I gotta do, I guess. So, this… inhaler… what does it do exactly? And will it help me get back to work? I can't be out too long, people are dependin' on me. I don’t want to be a burden. Will it make me tired or somethin’? I just need to know. And thanks… for not makin’ me feel like I'm bein’ stupid askin’ all these questions. It’s just… scary.
DOCTOR: You're not being stupid at all, Devin. It's absolutely okay to be scared, and you're right to ask questions. The albuterol inhaler is a bronchodilator. It works by opening up your airways, making it easier to breathe. It won't cure whatever is causing your symptoms, but it will help relieve the wheezing and shortness of breath. As for making you tired, it can cause some mild side effects like tremors or a fast heartbeat in some people, but drowsiness isn’t common. It shouldn’t interfere with your ability to work. Here’s the prescription. You can pick it up at your pharmacy. The nurse will give you instructions on how to use it. We’ll call you as soon as the results are back, which should be within a few hours. In the meantime, if your symptoms get significantly worse – like if you have severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Just… thank you. For explainin’ things. And for bein’ patient. I really appreciate it. I gotta go now, if that's alright. Need to get this prescription filled and get back to work. I’ll be waitin’ for the call. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Devin. You take care, and don't hesitate to call if anything changes. We'll be in touch soon.
