DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It says here you're 51 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, frankly, I don’t have all day for pleasantries. I’m here because… I want to get pregnant. And I want to do it without complications. I don’t want a long, drawn-out process, or… you know, problems. Is that possible? At my age? Don’t sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand you want to get pregnant and are concerned about potential complications given your age. We can certainly discuss that. It is possible to get pregnant at 51, but there are increased risks. To get a better understanding of your situation, and to see what steps we can take, I’ll need to ask you some questions. First, have you been trying for a while now?
PATIENT: Trying? Well, not actively, if that's what you mean. It’s… complicated. My divorce was final just six months ago. Let's just say I’ve been… re-evaluating my life choices. And yes, part of that involves wanting a child. I haven’t been meticulously charting anything, if that's what you're getting at. I just want to know if it's even realistic before I waste my time. And frankly, yours.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, you’re newly considering trying to conceive after a recent divorce. That’s perfectly alright. It’s good you’re thinking things through. To assess feasibility, let's start with your medical history. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Yes. One. A very long time ago. I was… quite young. It didn’t… end well. I don’t really care to rehash the details, frankly. Let’s just say it was a difficult birth and… I haven’t been pregnant since. Is that sufficient? I don’t see what my history from forty years ago has to do with anything now. Do you need a list of every childhood illness?
DOCTOR: I understand you’d rather not dwell on the past, Ms. Shteynberg, and I apologize if my question was insensitive. Knowing about previous pregnancies is helpful, even if a long time ago, as it gives us some baseline information. Alright, let’s focus on now. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else you’re being treated for?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I’m perfectly healthy. Always have been. I eat well, I exercise… well, I used to exercise more, but honestly, who has the time? Look, I’m a reasonably intelligent woman. I understand that age plays a factor. Just tell me, straight, what the chances are. And what tests I'll need, and how much it will cost. I don’t want a lecture about lifestyle choices. Just the facts.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shteynberg. I appreciate your directness. The chances of conceiving naturally at 51 are significantly lower than in younger years, roughly 1-5% per cycle. This is primarily due to a decline in egg quality and quantity as we age. Assisted reproductive technologies, like in-vitro fertilization , offer a higher success rate, but also come with significant costs and aren’t guaranteed. Before discussing those options, we need to do some basic testing to assess your current health and ovarian reserve. I’d like to order a blood test to check your hormone levels, including FSH, LH, and estradiol, as well as a general health panel. We’ll also need to do a transvaginal ultrasound to look at your uterus and ovaries and estimate your antral follicle count. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Really? Must we? Look, I’m not thrilled about poking around. But… fine. If you insist. Just tell me how long these tests will take, and approximately what they'll cost. I have a very busy schedule. And don't try to upsell me on anything unnecessary. I’m perfectly capable of understanding my options if you simply present them. Do I need to fast for the blood work? Honestly, this is already taking up far too much time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand your concerns. The ultrasound is helpful for a more complete picture, but it’s not absolutely mandatory at this stage. We can proceed with just the bloodwork if you prefer. However, the ultrasound gives us a clearer understanding of your uterine health and ovarian reserve, which can inform our next steps. The blood work can be done today. You do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand – no food or sugary drinks. It will take about 30 minutes, and the cost is approximately $250 - $300, depending on the specific panel your insurance covers. The ultrasound, if you decide to proceed, will take about 20-30 minutes and costs around $400 - $500. I'll have the nurse draw the blood, and we can schedule the ultrasound for later this week if you'd like. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just the blood work, then. And I expect a detailed breakdown of the costs before anything is done. I’m not paying for anything unexpected. And frankly, I don't understand why it takes so long for a simple blood test. People get these things done all the time. Just… get it over with. I have a gardening appointment at 2:00. I sincerely hope this won’t interfere. And tell your nurse to be gentle. I have a very low tolerance for discomfort. Let's just be efficient. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand. I'll make sure the nurse is aware of your concerns and is as efficient and gentle as possible. She’ll provide you with a detailed cost breakdown before proceeding. We'll get you in and out quickly. Let me just quickly confirm your insurance information is still Medicare, and your date of birth for verification... Okay, perfect. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please let me know if you have any further questions. Alright, let’s get this done. .
