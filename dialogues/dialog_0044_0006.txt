DOCTOR: Good morning, Jeannemarie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Asami. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been coughing up… blood. A little bit, but it worries me. It started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, coughing up blood is definitely something we want to investigate. Just a little bit is still concerning, you’re right to get it checked out. When you say a few days ago, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was after my grandson's birthday. He turned eight. So… August 1st, maybe? Yes, August 1st. It happened when I was getting ready for bed. Just a small spot on the tissue, then again this morning. Not a lot, but enough to scare me.
DOCTOR: Okay, August 1st. That helps. And it's happened twice – once after your grandson’s birthday and again this morning?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Only those two times. I do not feel sick, though. No fever, no chills, no pain in my chest. Just… the blood. It is bright red, if that matters. Not dark or old-looking.
DOCTOR: Bright red blood is good information, thank you. No fever, chills, or chest pain – that’s helpful to know. Have you noticed anything that makes it happen, or seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I was just… brushing my teeth both times. I did not cough hard or anything. It just… appeared. I have been a little tired lately, but I thought that was just from taking care of my grandson when his parents are working. I do not know if that is related.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to happen spontaneously while brushing your teeth. And the tiredness you’re experiencing – that’s something we should definitely consider. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No… not really. I have a little… a little bit of a cough sometimes, but it is just a normal cough. Like when the air is dry. Nothing bad. Oh! And I have lost a little weight, maybe? My clothes feel a little loose, but I have not weighed myself recently. I do not know if that is important.
DOCTOR: A little weight loss is something we should note. And the cough, even if it seems minor, is good information. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like asthma, bronchitis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Years ago, a long time ago, the doctor said I had… a little bit of high blood pressure. But I took medicine for it, and it was okay. He took me off the medicine a few years later, and said it was fine. And… oh! I had pneumonia once, a very long time ago. But I got better. I do not have any other… problems, I think. I have not been to the doctor in a long time, to be honest. My husband… he always took care of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, treated and resolved, and pneumonia a long time ago. That’s good to know. And it's perfectly alright that you haven't been to the doctor in a while. We're here now, and we'll get to the bottom of things. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. And… no, I do not smoke. I never have. My husband… he smoked for a long time, but I always told him to stop. He did, eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, and you've never smoked. That's good. Now, thinking about your family… do you have a family history of any serious medical conditions – things like lung disease, bleeding disorders, or cancer?
PATIENT: Let me think… my mother had… arthritis. Very bad arthritis in her hands. And my father… he had a heart problem, I think. He died when I was young, so I do not remember much. And… oh! My aunt… on my mother’s side… she had… cancer. Lung cancer, I think. But it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, a heart problem in your father, and lung cancer in your aunt. That's important information. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I do not have any allergies. I can eat anything, and I have never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I have a sensitive stomach sometimes, but that is not an allergy. I do not know if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Jeannemarie. It's very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and sinuses. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please do what you need to do. I just want to know what is going on.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. "130 over 80… good. A little elevated, but not concerning given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me." "Your lungs sound clear on both sides, but I do hear some mild wheezing, which could be related to a little bit of bronchial irritation. Let's listen to your heart now." "Your heart sounds regular and strong. Finally, let's take a quick look at your throat and sinuses." "Your throat looks normal. No redness or swelling. Your sinuses are clear as well." "Okay, everything sounds and looks reasonably normal so far, but given the blood you've coughed up and the family history of lung cancer, I think it's important to get a chest X-ray just to be on the safe side."
PATIENT: That… sounds wise, Doctor. If you think it is best, then I agree. A chest X-ray… will that be painful?
DOCTOR: No, it won't be painful at all, Jeannemarie. It's a very quick and simple procedure. You’ll just stand in front of a machine and hold your breath for a few seconds. There’s no radiation exposure to worry about. We'll send you to radiology right away, and I can review the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I also want to order a complete blood count, just to check for any signs of infection or anemia. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Anything to be sure. A complete blood count… and the X-ray. Will I need to make another appointment to discuss the results? Or will you tell me right away? I have my grandson next week, and I would like to know before then, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll do my best to have the results back before your grandson’s visit. I’ll personally review them as soon as they’re available, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. If anything urgent comes up, she’ll call you immediately. We'll also want to consider a possible referral to a pulmonologist, a lung specialist, depending on the X-ray results. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. For now, let's get these tests done, and we'll go from there. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A pulmonologist… okay. I… no, I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I trust you will take good care of me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jeannemarie. I appreciate that trust. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions for the chest X-ray. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all before your follow-up appointment. And try not to worry too much. We’re taking all the necessary steps to figure out what’s going on. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will do that. Goodbye.
