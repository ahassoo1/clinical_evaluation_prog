DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is fine. Look, I need a check-up. For the… the army thing. Gotta get this exam done, you know? It's not like I want to be here wasting my time, but rules are rules. They want this signed paper, and you're the one with the pen, right?
DOCTOR: Right. The paperwork. Yes. Well, a "check-up" can mean a lot of things. To get this done properly for the army, I'll need some details. Let's start with why you need this particular exam now. Are you re-enlisting, or is this for a different purpose?
PATIENT: Re-enlisting? Goodness no. Never been in before. It's… a fresh start, alright? Long story. Point is, I gotta get in. They said I need this exam to prove I’m… capable. Don't need you digging up old history or anything. Just tell me what you need to know to sign the paper. Simple as that. What kinda stuff are we talkin' about here? Blood tests? X-rays? I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I understand you want to keep this concise. However, simply signing a paper without any assessment would be… irresponsible, frankly. And it wouldn’t be fair to you, should there be something we need to address. We’ll need to cover some basics, yes – a physical exam, certainly. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, that sort of thing. And some blood work is standard, just to get a baseline. It's not about "digging up history," it’s about ensuring you're physically fit for what you're undertaking. Before we get to the physical part, let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant? Look, I’ve had the usual colds, maybe a bad back once from liftin' too much. Nothing a bit of liniment couldn’t fix. Never been to a hospital for anything serious. Always been strong as an ox, really. This is ridiculous. Are you gonna ask me about chickenpox now? Honestly. Just… no major illnesses. Never had anything serious, okay? Can we please move on? This is takin' up my whole morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major illnesses. And you've never been hospitalized?
PATIENT: Never. Not once. Look, I work with machines all day. Engines, gears, you name it. It’s physical work. You gotta be strong to do it. I don't have time for sniffles and bed rest. And I certainly haven't needed a hospital. Are we done with the history? Because frankly, it's a waste of both our times if you keep askin’ the same things. I'm perfectly healthy, alright? Can we get to the… the exam part now?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I appreciate you stating your good health. But a physical exam is necessary. It isn’t just about what you feel. We need to objectively assess your condition. Before we move to that, just a few quick questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings – had any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history? Seriously? Now you’re askin’ about them? Look, I barely see my family. Haven't spoken to my brother in years. My mother… she was always a bit frail, I suppose. Had a bad cough sometimes, but who doesn’t? My father… worked in a factory, like me. Strong man, but he probably had some aches and pains towards the end. That's all I know. Honestly, I don't keep track of everyone's sniffles and ailments. Can we please just get on with it? I'm beginnin' to regret comin' here. This is a complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant family history known. Look, Mr. Hartness, I understand you’re frustrated. But this isn’t about wasting your time, it’s about ensuring you are physically capable and safe. I need to gather enough information to responsibly complete this exam. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical assessment. Please, if you could just step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Scale it is. But don't go makin' a fuss if I'm a bit… solid, alright? Workin’ with engines keeps a man… robust. Just get it over with. And don't judge.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your height, if you could stand against the wall for me?
PATIENT: One-eighty-seven. Centimeters. I always have been a tall one. Get it over with. I haven't got all day. And honestly, what difference does it make anyway? I can lift a whole engine block by myself, alright? I'm strong enough. Now can we please get this show on the road? I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, if you could just take a deep breath for me… and hold it. Breathe normally. Okay, now exhale… and breathe normally. Hmm. Your heart rate is… quite slow. And the sounds are… diminished. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, or chest pain recently?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. Never. I work hard all day, like I said. Engines don't fix themselves, you know? Chest pain? Nah. Maybe a bit of muscle ache after a long day, but that's just from the work. What are you lookin' for? Is somethin' wrong? You're makin' me nervous now. I feel perfectly fine. This is ridiculous. What's the problem? Don't tell me I'm too old for the army now. That'd be a right mess.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, your vital signs are… concerning. Your heart rate is significantly lower than normal, and the heart sounds are very faint. Your weight is also extremely low for your height. This isn't typical for someone engaged in manual labor. Have you experienced any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well… now that you mention it… I suppose I haven't been eatin' as much lately. Been busy, alright? Lots to do, not much time for meals. Always been a bit of a small eater, I suppose. Never been one to stuff myself. But I feel fine! Really, I do. I'm strong as an ox, remember? And this is all happening now? You're lookin' at me like I'm about to fall over. Don't tell me I'm sick. I don't get sick. This is probably just… stress. Yeah, that's it. Stress from all the work. It's makin' me lose my appetite. Now can we please just sign the paper? I need to get back to work. This is costing me money. And I need this job.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand you need this job, and I appreciate your honesty. However, based on my initial assessment, I cannot ethically sign this form. Your symptoms – the slow heart rate, faint heart sounds, and recent weight loss – are concerning and require further investigation. I need to refer you to a cardiologist for a full cardiac work-up and a comprehensive blood panel to determine the cause of your weight loss. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions before you undertake any strenuous physical activity. It would be irresponsible of me to sign off on this exam without knowing what's going on. I'm writing a referral now. Would you like me to explain the process?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? What are you talkin' about? A heart doctor? This is ridiculous. I don't need a heart doctor! I'm perfectly healthy, I tell you! This is a waste of time, a complete waste! This job… this job is everything. It’s a fresh start. If I don't get this job… I don't know what I’ll do. Look, can’t you just… overlook it? Say I’m fine? Just sign the paper! I need this job! I’m a strong worker, I’ll be alright. I’ve always been fine. Don’t tell me I have a heart problem! This is… this is unbelievable. You’re ruinining my life! Just… please. Please sign the paper. I’ll be careful, I promise. I just need a chance!
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your desperation, and I sympathize with your situation. But I cannot compromise my ethical obligations. Signing off on this exam without a proper assessment would be putting your health – and potentially your life – at risk. It’s not about doubting your strength or willingness to work. It's about ensuring you're medically fit for the demands of the job. I've already prepared the referral to the cardiologist. I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I can also provide a list of resources for financial assistance if that is a concern. I am very sorry that this is not the outcome you hoped for, but I believe it is the responsible course of action. I’m not able to proceed any further without further testing. .
