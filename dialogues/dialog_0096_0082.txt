DOCTOR: Right. Well, Odell, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. The… the travel thing. I need… papers? For going somewhere. My wife, she… she always did the papers. Now… I just need to go. It’s important.
DOCTOR: “Papers,” alright. And you mean medical documentation for travel?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that. Medical… things. For travel. I don't know what she called it. Just… need to go. Is that okay? Do you… make the okay papers? It’s for… Nepal. I’m going back to Nepal.
DOCTOR: Right. Nepal. Well, we can certainly discuss what kind of documentation you might need for travel. It depends on why you're going, and what requirements Nepal has. Are you travelling for a visit, or are you… relocating?
PATIENT: Relocating? No, no. Just… visiting. To… see family. Old family. It's been a long time. I just… need to be there. Does it matter why? Shouldn't I just get the papers? My wife, she never asked so many questions.
DOCTOR: It matters, Odell, because different types of travel require different documentation. If you’re just visiting, that’s one thing. If you’re planning to stay for an extended period, or work there, that’s another. We need to be thorough. Now, have you had any recent vaccinations?
PATIENT: Vaccinations…? Uh… I think so. A long time ago. When… when I first came here. But… I don’t remember what. My wife… she took care of all that. I just… went. She said it was important. I don't know which ones. Is it… is it bad if I don't remember?
DOCTOR: It’s not ideal, Odell. It's quite common to forget things, but for travel, especially back to Nepal, we need to be sure you're protected. Do you have any records of your vaccinations anywhere?
PATIENT: Records…? No. No records. She kept everything. In… in a box. After… after she was gone, things got… messy. People took things. I… I just took what I needed. The important things. Not… papers. I didn't think about papers then.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that complicates things. Do you know if you've ever had a tuberculosis test, Odell?
PATIENT: Tuber… what? Sounds… bad. Like a sickness. I… I don't know. Did my wife… did she make me take one of those? She made me take lots of things. Little needles… and pills. I just… trusted her. I didn’t ask. Is it… is it something I need to worry about? It sounds… serious.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, yes. And it’s common in Nepal, which is why I’m asking. We often recommend a TB test before travelling there. Have you had any coughs recently, Odell?
PATIENT: Coughs? Uh… maybe. A little. It's been… dusty. Working with the planes and all. Lots of metal shavings. I usually just… ignore it. It goes away. It’s not a… a bad cough. Just… a work cough. Is that what you mean? Like, a hacking, bad cough? No, not that. Just… a little tickle.
DOCTOR: “A little tickle,” right. And how long has this “tickle” been going on for, Odell?
PATIENT: Uh… I don't know. A few weeks? Maybe longer. Time… it gets away from me. After… well, things just blur together. It’s not like it’s stopping me from working. I can still… do my job. I need to go back. It’s important. Do I need to worry about a little cough to get the papers?
DOCTOR: Odell, we’re not just talking about “papers” here. We’re discussing your health and safety. A cough, even a “little” one, can indicate something more serious, especially when travelling to a place like Nepal. I need a clearer picture of your medical history to determine what, if any, vaccinations or tests you require before you travel. Let's start with this: have you been feeling feverish or experiencing any night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Feverish…? Sweaty at night…? Uh… I sleep hot. Always have. It’s the blankets. I like a warm bed. But… maybe? A little bit. Sometimes I wake up… damp. But it’s hot! It’s August. Is that… is that what you mean? Like, really sick sweaty? No, not that kind of sweaty. Just… warm. And tired. I'm always tired. Working… going back… it's a lot.
DOCTOR: Odell, you're telling me a lot of vague information. This is making it difficult to assess your situation. I need specifics. Let's try this: have you noticed any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Uh… I don’t know. Maybe? I… I haven’t been eating much. Not like I used to. Everything tastes… different. Less good. It’s hard to explain. The food here… it’s not the same. But I’m still… I’m still working. I can still lift things. So… I guess I haven’t lost much weight. I just… don’t feel hungry. It's not important, is it? Just the papers… I need the papers.
DOCTOR: Odell, you're avoiding my questions and providing minimal details. This is unacceptable. You need to understand that travel to Nepal may require certain precautions, and I cannot provide documentation without a proper assessment. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a chest X-ray, and a TB test. Until we have those results, I cannot advise you on whether or not it’s safe for you to travel. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests…? More tests…? That sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. I need to go now. It’s important. Is there… is there anything else I can do? Can’t you just… write something? Say I’m okay? I’ll be careful. I promise. I just need the papers. My wife… she would have handled this. She always knew what to do. I just… don’t want to be stuck here. It's not… it's not a good place for me.
DOCTOR: Odell, I understand you're frustrated, but I am a doctor. My priority is your health and safety, not expediting your travel plans. I cannot, and will not, fabricate medical documentation. The tests are necessary. I'll have the lab technician draw blood now, and we'll schedule the chest X-ray and TB test for tomorrow morning. Until those results are back, I strongly advise against travelling. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Uh… I don’t think so. Maybe… dust? I work with metal all day. It makes me sneeze sometimes. But that’s… not an allergy, is it? Just… dust. And… I get itchy sometimes. But that’s the heat. It’s hot. I just… don’t want to wait. This is taking too long. My wife… she’d be so annoyed. She always said I was impatient. Can’t you just… skip the X-ray? The blood work is enough, right? Just the blood?
DOCTOR: Odell, with all due respect, you are not a medical professional. You are continually downplaying potential health concerns and attempting to dictate my course of action. The chest X-ray is essential to rule out any underlying respiratory issues, especially given your cough and vague symptoms. I will not compromise your well-being. No, we will not skip the X-ray. I'll have the lab technician draw your blood now, and we'll schedule the X-ray for first thing tomorrow. Do you have private insurance?
PATIENT: Insurance…? Yeah. Private. My wife… she took care of all that too. She had… a plan. I have the card. Somewhere. In my wallet. But… how much is this going to cost? Is it… a lot? I don’t have a lot of money. I… I just want to go home. My family… they need me. I just want the papers. Can’t we just do the blood test and… be done with it? Just the bare minimum?
DOCTOR: Fine. Let me check your insurance coverage. But I'm warning you, if it's not fully covered, you'll be responsible for the out-of-pocket expenses. And just to be clear, even with the blood test, I cannot guarantee I'll be able to provide the documentation you need without further investigation. Your health is more important than expediency. Now, can you please spell your last name for me?
PATIENT: Uh… T-A-Y-A-R. Tayar. But… why does it matter? It’s just… going home. It shouldn’t be this difficult. My wife… she always said I was a problem patient. She’d know what to do. Is this going to take much longer? I have things to do. Important things. Things I need to… prepare for. Before I leave. Just… get the blood taken. Please. Just the blood. Then… the papers?
DOCTOR: Fine, Tayar. I'll order the blood work. The lab technician is ready for you. Follow the nurse to room three. Once the results are back, we'll discuss the next steps. But I want to be perfectly clear: this does not guarantee the documentation you’re seeking, and traveling before a thorough assessment could be detrimental to your health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Detrimental… She always used big words. Yeah. Okay. Room three. Fine. Just… the blood. Let’s just get it over with. Room three… right.
DOCTOR: .
