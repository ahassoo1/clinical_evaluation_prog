DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, state the reason for your visit today. And try to be concise; my schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Concise, you say? Right. Well, it’s… my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. Sort of… going quiet on me, then spinning around. It's happened a few times now. And my… my husband, bless his soul, he had trouble with that too. It runs in the family, I think. I don't really remember all the details, though. It was a while ago.
DOCTOR: “Going quiet,” you say. And “spinning.” Vague descriptions are… unhelpful. When did this begin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it begin… that’s a tricky one. It feels like… a long time. Not recent, definitely. Maybe… a few months ago? Or longer? It comes and goes, you see. Not constant. It's hard to pinpoint. I wish I could be more helpful, truly. It just… happens. A bit scary when it does, I'll admit. Makes it hard to stand up straight.
DOCTOR: "A few months." Right. And is this accompanied by any nausea, vomiting, or headache?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not usually. No sickness, no. And headaches… sometimes, maybe? But I get those anyway, you know? Old age, probably. It’s mostly just the quiet and the… whirling. Makes me feel a bit off-balance, that’s the worst of it. Nothing severe, not like falling down or anything. I just need to sit down for a bit.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief examination. Please, have a seat on the examination table. We'll check your ears, balance, and perhaps a quick neurological assessment. It's standard procedure. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. An examination sounds good. Table, you say? Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything, really. Though my memory isn’t what it used to be, so… I think I'm alright, but I couldn’t swear to it. Is there anything I should be particularly worried about?
DOCTOR: Please, undress from the waist up. We’ll begin with an otoscopic examination – looking in your ears. This is to rule out any obvious obstructions or infections. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but a proper assessment is vital. And please, try to remain still during the examination. Movement makes it more difficult.
PATIENT: Oh, right. Undress… from the waist up. Goodness me. It’s been a while since I… Well, alright then. Try to stay still, you said? I'll do my best. It's just… a bit chilly in here, isn't it? And I always have trouble with buttons.
DOCTOR: Ears appear clear bilaterally. Minimal cerumen present. Slight unsteadiness noted on Romberg. However, this could be attributed to… various factors. Do you currently take any medications, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Oh… clear, you say? That’s good. That’s a relief. Unsteadiness… well, I am getting on a bit, Doctor. It wouldn’t surprise me, truly. Medications… let me think. Just a little something for my blood pressure. A small white pill. I take it every morning. Can't remember the name, though. The chemist delivers it, you see. And I just… take it. It’s been years.
DOCTOR: Let me access your electronic health record… Amlodipine 5mg daily. Correct. And no other medications listed. Have you experienced any recent changes in vision, hearing, or speech?
PATIENT: Amlodipine… yes, that sounds right. Little white pill. Goodness, you know everything, don't you? Changes… hmm. Not that I've noticed, no. My eyesight's not what it used to be, of course, but that’s just age. And my hearing… well, that’s why I'm here, isn’t it? Everything feels a bit… fuzzy sometimes, if I'm honest. Not sudden, just… a general fuzziness. Hard to explain. It's like trying to remember a dream.
DOCTOR: "Fuzziness"… Right. Given your age, history of hypertension, and reported symptoms of intermittent dizziness and unsteadiness, my preliminary assessment suggests possible vestibular dysfunction, potentially exacerbated by medication side effects. However, further investigation is required to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a basic audiogram and a blood test to check your vitamin B12 and thyroid levels. These are routine tests to eliminate common causes. Do you have any family history of neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, that’s a lot of words, Doctor. Vestibular… dysfunction? Sounds… serious. Tests, you say? That’s alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. Family history… hmm. My husband’s mother, bless her soul, she had… something. With her balance, I think. Kept falling over. But that was years ago, and I was young. I don’t remember much about it, honestly. Just that she was always… unsteady. And my brother, he… well, he wasn’t quite right in the head. But that was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about things like that much then. Is that helpful? It’s all a bit… vague, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: "Vague" is… an accurate descriptor. A history of falls and possible neurological issues within the family warrants further attention, however limited the details. I will also arrange a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. Given your age and reported symptoms, it’s prudent to rule out any underlying neurological pathology. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A neurologist… oh dear. That sounds… quite serious. Is it something terrible, Doctor? I mean, is it… what's the word… serious? And a comprehensive evaluation… that sounds like a lot of tests. I just want to know what’s wrong with my ears. That’s all. I just want to be able to hear my grandchildren properly. That’s all that matters, really. Do I have to see a neurologist? Is there nothing else we can do?
DOCTOR: Ms. Mayhugh, it is highly unlikely that this is anything immediately life-threatening. However, your symptoms, combined with your age and family history, necessitate a thorough evaluation to determine the underlying cause. We cannot simply assume it’s “just your ears.” While I understand your concerns, dismissing potential neurological issues would be… irresponsible medical practice. The neurologist will perform specific tests to assess your balance, hearing, and overall neurological function. It is a precautionary measure. I will write a referral order. It is up to you to schedule the appointment. If you prefer, I can have my assistant contact you with information on local neurologists. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, should imaging be required?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A precaution, you say? I suppose… I suppose that’s sensible. But it all sounds so… frightening. An assistant contacting me would be lovely, thank you. I’m not very good with these things, you see. Computers and appointments… they just confuse me. Contrast dye… no, I don’t think so. I’ve never had any problems with anything before. But… what if they find something? I just want to be able to hear my grandchildren. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Mayhugh, it is statistically improbable that you have a serious neurological condition. However, excluding potential causes would be negligent. My assistant will contact you with a list of neurologists and assist with scheduling. I will also prescribe a course of Meclizine to manage your dizziness symptoms in the interim. It's an over-the-counter antihistamine that can provide temporary relief. Avoid operating heavy machinery while taking this medication. Any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Meclizine… antihistamine… for the dizziness. Alright. No, I don’t think so. Not at the moment. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for… everything. I hope it’s nothing serious. That’s all. Just… nothing serious. I just want to be able to hear my grandchildren. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My assistant will be with you shortly. Have a good day. .
