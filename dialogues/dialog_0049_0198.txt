DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… different, maybe. I've been thinking about trying mindfulness or meditation. I keep hearing good things, and honestly, life feels a little… hectic sometimes, even when it shouldn’t. I was hoping you might have some advice or know where to start.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness…meditation. Right. And you came to me… a physician… for guidance on that?
PATIENT: Yes, I did. I suppose it felt… safer, coming to someone I trust. It's a bit silly, maybe. I mean, you deal with… everything, don't you? And I thought you might know if it was something that could actually help, or if it was just…new-age fluff. I don’t want to waste my time if it’s not… practical. Plus, sometimes I worry if something is working, I might be overlooking a real medical reason for feeling stressed. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sugino, while I appreciate your… trust, my expertise lies in medicine. Stress, anxiety… those are often best addressed with therapy, or perhaps lifestyle adjustments. I see here your BMI is… elevated. Perhaps focusing on diet and exercise would be a more… practical approach than meditation?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Yes, I am aware of my weight. It’s… complicated. I do try to walk when I can, and I watch what I eat, mostly. But it’s not just about that, you know? It’s… a feeling inside. Like my thoughts are always racing, even when things are calm. I wasn’t necessarily hoping you’d prescribe meditation, Doctor, just… offer an opinion, maybe? Or suggest a good resource? I hadn't thought of therapy, actually. Is that something you think would be… helpful, in my case?
DOCTOR: Racing thoughts… right. Well, often those are symptoms of underlying… issues. We should rule out any physiological causes first. Have you had any changes in your sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Not really… consistent changes, no. Some nights I sleep wonderfully, others I wake up several times. It depends, I think, on what's on my mind. If I'm worrying about work, or something I need to do, that’s when it’s bad. But I don't usually have trouble falling asleep. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, to be honest. Is that… important? I hadn't thought of telling you about that, specifically. I just assumed it was… me.
DOCTOR: Everyone worries, Ms. Sugino. It's part of being… human. But frequent awakenings can indicate underlying anxiety, or even… sleep apnea. Do you snore?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… my neighbor has mentioned it, a few times. I hadn't really paid attention. I live alone, so… I didn't realize it was loud enough to bother anyone. I suppose I just figured it was a normal thing. I don’t feel tired during the day, not usually. But maybe that’s because I’m used to it? This is all starting to sound very complicated. I came in thinking meditation might be a quick fix, and now… it sounds like I might need a sleep study?
DOCTOR: A sleep study would be… prudent, yes. We need to rule out any physical causes for your disrupted sleep. And frankly, your weight is a contributing factor. I’m going to order a sleep apnea screening. In the meantime, I suggest you avoid caffeine after noon, and… try to establish a regular sleep schedule. I can give you a pamphlet. Is there a history of sleep disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Okay, a sleep study sounds… sensible. I’m willing to try anything at this point, honestly. No, no history of sleep disorders that I know of, not really. My mother always slept like a log, and my father… well, he worked long hours and mostly just collapsed when he got home. He didn’t talk much about how he slept, or didn't sleep. I remember he used to drink a lot of tea, though, especially chamomile. Would that…help? And a pamphlet would be great, thank you. Just so I can have something to read about all of this. It's a little overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Chamomile… well, it’s not a substitute for proper medical evaluation, Ms. Sugino. I'll have the nurse print you the pamphlet on sleep hygiene, and the instructions for the sleep apnea screening. It's a home study, so you'll be wearing a device overnight. We'll review the results at your follow-up appointment in… two weeks. Any other concerns?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Two weeks sounds good. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Doctor. It’s… good to know we’re trying to figure things out. I suppose I was hoping for something simpler, but… maybe this is the right approach. Thank you for not dismissing my worries completely. And thank you for the pamphlet. I’ll schedule the follow-up appointment now, if that’s alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, schedule the follow-up. The nurse will explain the rest. I have other patients waiting, Ms. Sugino. Thank you for your time.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Thank you again. I will. Have a good day.
