DOCTOR: Hi Derick, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, right. Well, my face… it’s been puffin’ up, see? And my legs too. Feels kinda… strange. Not painful, exactly, just… big. I dunno. It's been goin' on for a bit now, I reckon. Can't quite put my finger on when it started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Puffiness in your face and legs… and it's been gradual, you're not sure exactly when it started. "Old age" is definitely not always the answer, so I'm glad you came in to get it checked out. To help me figure out what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… well, it's worse at the end of the day, I think. After I've been on my feet all day at the shop. I do a lot of… you know, welding and such. Heavy work. Not that that should matter. Used to it for years, I have. It's not like it’s new work, see? Though my wife, bless her soul, always said I shoulda retired sooner. She was probably right, now I think about it. But she’s… gone now. Anyway, the puffiness. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Derick. It’s understandable that things feel different now. And thank you for sharing that with me. So, it sounds like the puffiness gets worse with activity, particularly at the end of the day when you’ve been on your feet at the shop. That's helpful information. Does it improve at all when you rest, or when you elevate your legs?
PATIENT: Elevate… hmm. I don't rightly know. I usually just collapse in my chair after work and watch the telly. Might get 'em up a bit, I suppose. But I ain't one for sittin' around doin' nothin'. Never been my style. Restin’… doesn’t seem to make much difference, no. It’s still there in the mornin’, kinda. Not as bad, maybe, but… there. It's just…annoyin’, that’s what it is. More than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t really seem to improve with rest or elevation. And it’s still present in the mornings, though perhaps not as noticeable. "Annoying" is a good way to put it – it’s good to know how this is affecting you. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? What do you mean? Like… goin' more often? I dunno. I go when I need to go. Haven't been rushin' to the loo any more than usual, I don't think. Never really paid much attention to it, to be honest. It's just… one of those things, innit? You don’t think about it unless somethin's wrong. And I ain't noticed nothin' wrong. Just the puffiness. And the achin' in my back, but that's from the bendin' over all day, I reckon. Old age, again.
DOCTOR: Alright, no changes in urination, and you attribute the back pain to your work. Thank you for clarifying. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other things you may have noticed. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, or noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. I get a bit winded climbin' the stairs, but that's just… stairs. Always been that way. Energy levels… well, I’m not as spry as I used to be, that's for sure. But who is, at my age? I get tired at the end of the day, but that’s work, innit? I'm not runnin' marathons, see? I'm a welder, not an athlete. It’s all just… normal old age stuff, I reckon. Honestly, I don't understand why I'm here. Is it somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Derick, and I understand your concern. It’s good you came in to get this checked out, even if it does feel like “normal old age stuff.” That's my job – to help figure things out, and rule things out. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or any unexplained weight gain or loss recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… yeah, it’s been a bit off, now you mention it. Not that I’m not hungry, just… not as enthusiastic, see? Used to enjoy a good hearty meal, but now it just feels like… effort. And weight… I've probably put a bit on over the years, but that's just age, innit? And biscuits. My wife always made a lovely biscuit. I haven’t been losin’ any weight, no. More likely gainin’ it, if I'm honest. Honestly, I’m startin’ to feel like a bit of a bother. Is all this talk helpin’ or…?
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Derick. It’s good you’re sharing all of this with me. It is helpful, and it's all part of understanding what's going on. Okay, so decreased appetite, and some weight gain. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned somethin’ about it years ago, I think. Said I should watch my salt intake. Never really paid much attention, to be honest. Used to get a bit dizzy sometimes, but that was just… life, innit? Diabetes… no, nothin’ like that. Heart problems… well, my chest feels a bit tight sometimes, but that’s probably just the… welding fumes, I reckon. Been doin’ it for years, see? Never been a sickly man, not really. Just… old. And a bit puffed up. Is this gettin’ anywhere? I just wanna know if it’s somethin’ serious or not.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of possible high blood pressure, occasional dizziness, and some chest tightness you attribute to welding fumes. I understand your frustration and wanting to know what's going on. Let's talk about your past surgeries and hospitalizations. Have you ever been hospitalized or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Had my appendix out when I was a lad, I think. That was years ago. And broke my arm when I was playin’ football, but that wasn't a surgery, just a cast. Not much else, no. Never been a big fan of hospitals, to be honest. They always smell funny. And I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. Is this all necessary? I just want to get this sorted and get home, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, just an appendectomy as a child and a broken arm. I understand your discomfort with hospitals and being examined, and I'll try to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Family history… My father… he had a bad heart, I think. Died young, he did. And my mother… she suffered with her kidneys, towards the end. But that was years ago. And my brother… he was always healthy as a horse, never a day's illness in his life. Never really paid much attention to family history, to be honest. Always thought it was just… luck of the draw, innit? Is this all important? I just want to know what's wrong with me, not what happened to my parents.
DOCTOR: Okay, a father with heart problems and a mother with kidney issues. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, it is all important to get a complete picture. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife hated 'em. Alcohol… I used to enjoy a pint with the lads after work, but that was years ago. Not really a drinker these days. Bit of a waste of money, innit? And recreational drugs… good heavens, no! Never been one for all that nonsense. I'm a simple man, see? Just a welder, not a… a criminal. This is gettin' a bit personal, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You are right to say it's getting personal, and I apologize if any of these questions feel intrusive. I'm just trying to get a full understanding of your health. Finally, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. I take a bit of paracetamol sometimes for me back, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, just the over-the-counter stuff. And I used to take something for me indigestion, but I stopped takin’ it. Didn’t seem to be makin’ much difference, and I don’t like fillin’ me body with chemicals. Is this all important? I just want to know if I'm gonna be alright. I'm startin’ to get a bit anxious now, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional paracetamol for back pain. Alright, Derick, thank you for answering all of my questions. That gives me a much better understanding of your situation. It sounds like you've been experiencing gradual swelling in your legs and face, along with some fatigue and decreased appetite. You have a history of possible high blood pressure, and your father had heart problems, and your mother had kidney problems. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your legs and abdomen. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam. I don't really like bein' poked and prodded, if I'm honest. But… if you think it's necessary. Alright. Go ahead then. But be gentle, alright? And don’t take too long. I get a bit nervous with all these medical things. Just get it over with quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Derick. I will be as gentle as possible and will explain everything as I go. Your blood pressure is a little high, which is something we’ll need to keep an eye on. I’m feeling some swelling in your legs, and when I press on them, it leaves a dent for a few seconds. This is called pitting edema. Your skin looks good. Okay, that concludes the physical exam. I’ll need to order some blood and urine tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. These tests will help us check your kidney function, liver function, electrolytes, and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood and urine tests… Oh, good heavens. More poking and prodding. I don't like needles, you know. Never have. But… if you think it's necessary. Alright then. Go ahead. But be quick about it, alright? And try not to hurt me. Just get it over with. I don't understand all this medical jargon, anyway. What are you lookin’ for, exactly? Is it somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Derick, and I will do my best to make this as quick and painless as possible. The phlebotomist will be very gentle. We’re looking at your kidney function, as swelling in the legs can be a sign of kidney problems. We’re also checking your liver function and electrolytes, as imbalances in these can sometimes cause swelling and fatigue. And finally, we’ll do a complete blood count to rule out any other potential causes. It's important to rule things out and get a clear picture of what’s going on. We'll get the results back within a few days, and I'll contact you as soon as they're available to discuss them. In the meantime, I'd like you to try to limit your salt intake and drink plenty of fluids. And if you notice any worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe fatigue, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Limit salt… drink fluids… It's all so complicated. I'll try my best, but I don't really understand all this medical talk. Alright then. I'll try to cut back on the salt and drink more water. But don't expect miracles. And I'll try to remember to come back if things get worse. But honestly, I'm just feelin' a bit overwhelmed at the moment. Is this somethin' serious, Doctor? Is it my kidneys? Or my heart? I'm just an old man, and I don't want any fuss.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, Derick. It is a lot to take in, and you're right, you're an old man, and you don't want any fuss. And I want to reassure you that we’re just gathering information right now. It’s too early to say definitively if it’s your kidneys or your heart, but that's exactly what these tests will help us determine. It could be something else entirely. We're just trying to rule things out. For now, I’m going to order the blood and urine tests, and I’ll also order an ECG to check your heart rhythm. This will give us a more complete picture of your health. We'll take it one step at a time. In the meantime, please try not to worry too much. We’re here to help you, and we'll get to the bottom of this. And if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions? Well… how long will it take to get the results? And will it hurt? And… is there anything I can do right now to make me feel better? I just want to get back to normal, see? I miss watchin’ the telly without feelin’ all puffed up. And… will this cost me a lot of money? I ain’t got much savings, you know. I'm just an old man, and I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Derick. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. The blood draw itself will only be a brief pinch – most people don't find it very painful. And the ECG is completely painless – we just attach some sticky pads to your chest. As for making you feel better right now, limiting your salt intake and elevating your legs when you're resting can help reduce the swelling. Drinking plenty of fluids will also help. And try to get some gentle exercise if you're able, such as a short walk. Regarding the cost, I understand your concerns. We do our best to keep costs as low as possible. Since you are uninsured, we can discuss a payment plan or see if you qualify for any financial assistance programs. We don’t want money to be a barrier to your care. The phlebotomist will be able to give you an estimate of the cost of the blood tests. I’ll also have my nurse give you a handout with information on reducing salt intake and managing edema. Does that help to ease your worries a little?
PATIENT: Handouts… payment plans… It's all so complicated. Alright then. I’ll take the handout, and I suppose I'll talk to the phlebotomist about the money. I don’t like askin’ for charity, you know. But I ain't got much choice, I suppose. Just get it over with, Doctor. I want to go home and watch the telly. Is there anything else I need to know? Honestly, I'm just feelin' a bit overwhelmed at the moment. I'm an old man, and I just want to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: You're not asking for charity, Derick. It's okay to ask for help when you need it, and we're here to support you. I completely understand you just want to get back to normal, and we’ll do everything we can to help you get there. The only other thing I'd like you to be aware of is that if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, severe fatigue, or sudden swelling, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don’t wait for me to call you. Otherwise, just focus on taking things one day at a time, and please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the handout with you and schedule the blood work. Is there anything I can do for you right now before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just get it over with, Doctor. Honestly, I just want to go home. Thank you, I suppose. I’m just an old man, and I’m a bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Alright Derick. Take care of yourself, and we’ll be in touch soon. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Bye now.
