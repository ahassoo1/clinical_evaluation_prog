DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. Or, Chanz, if you prefer?
PATIENT: Yeah, Chanz is fine. Look, honestly, I don't really remember filling out all those forms. It was… a while ago. Something about sleep, right? And, uh, getting… less floppy? Is that how they put it? I just feel… not great, you know? Like I’m wasting away.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Sleep difficulties… and you feel like you’ve been losing weight unintentionally. “Less floppy” is… an interesting way to put it. We'll get to the bottom of it. Okay, so let's start with the sleep. How long have you been having trouble sleeping, Chanz?
PATIENT: Oh, ages. Honestly, I’ve never been a great sleeper. But… recently it’s been worse, I guess? It’s hard to say. Time just… blurs. Maybe a few months? Look, it’s not like I’m counting sheep or anything. I just… lie there. And then I’m tired all the time. It’s ridiculous. I used to be able to work all day, now I’m dragging.
DOCTOR: A few months of worsening sleep… and fatigue that’s impacting your daily life. Okay. And when you are able to sleep, how many hours would you say you typically get?
PATIENT: Ugh, don’t even ask. Some nights, barely four. Other nights… maybe six, if I’m lucky? It’s really inconsistent. And it’s not good sleep, you know? I wake up feeling… bruised, almost. Like I haven't rested at all. Honestly, I've just been trying to power through with coffee. Which, I suppose, isn't helping.
DOCTOR: Right, inconsistent sleep, generally less than six hours, and feeling unrefreshed even when you do sleep. And relying on caffeine. Okay. Now, aside from the sleep and fatigue, anything else going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my appetite’s been… off. I just don’t feel hungry. Which, you know, contributes to the… floppiness, I guess. I used to eat pretty well. Syrian food is… substantial, let's say. But now, everything just tastes… bland. And I've noticed… my hands tremble sometimes. Not constantly, but enough to be annoying when I’m working on instruments. It makes it hard to be precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, so loss of appetite, changes in taste, and some hand tremors… When did you first notice the hand tremors?
PATIENT: Ugh, that’s a good question. Probably… around the same time as the appetite stuff, I reckon. A few months ago, yeah. It’s not like full-blown shaking, more like… a little quiver. Especially when I'm holding something small, like a tuning fork. It’s frustrating, honestly. Makes me feel… old. And useless.
DOCTOR: A few months for the tremors as well… And it’s worse with fine motor tasks. Okay. Now, before we go any further, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Look, is this really necessary? I came here about sleep, not… that. But fine. Uh, they're… irregular. Sometimes normal, sometimes… not. It's not something I usually pay attention to, if that's what you're asking. It's just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand it's not the most pleasant topic, Chanz. But changes in bowel habits can sometimes be important clues, and I want to get a complete picture of what’s going on. Okay. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Not really. Night sweats… now that you mention it, maybe. I do wake up a bit damp sometimes, but I just figured it was the summer. It gets pretty hot here. Look, I'm not one for complaining, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again. I miss being able to work without feeling like I’m going to collapse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chanz. I understand. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your hands. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I've got things to do, you know. Instruments don't repair themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay. Deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are regular, but a little… faint. Lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Hmm. I do see a slight tremor, as you mentioned, and some mild muscle wasting. It's subtle, but noticeable. Let’s check your reflexes now. Reflexes are a little diminished. Okay. I’d also like to check your thyroid. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged. Now, could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Thyroid? What’s wrong with my thyroid? I don’t even know what that is. Is it serious? Just tell me straight, Doctor. I can’t stand this vague… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your gait is a bit unsteady. Now, the thyroid is a gland in your neck that helps regulate your metabolism. The enlargement I feel could be causing some of your symptoms, but we need to do some blood tests to be sure. Based on what you've told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities, including hypothyroidism—an underactive thyroid—or potentially some vitamin deficiencies. We’ll run a full panel to check everything. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. I rarely take anything. Maybe some aspirin for a headache now and then, but that’s it. Honestly, I’m not one for pills. They just… mess things up.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Chanz. I’m going to order some blood tests. We’ll check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and do a complete metabolic panel. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. I'm also going to order a CBC – a complete blood count – just to rule out any other possibilities. The lab results usually take a couple of days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them when they’re back. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible, and drink plenty of fluids. And don’t hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Rest? Easy for you to say. Instruments don't repair themselves, you know. But fine. Two days, huh? I suppose. What… what if it's something bad? What if it’s… serious? Don't sugarcoat it, Doctor. I’d rather know the truth, even if it’s not what I want to hear.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively, Chanz. The tests will help us rule out a lot of possibilities. Many of the things we're investigating are manageable with treatment. Hypothyroidism, for example, is very treatable. We’ll address whatever it is, if there is something, together. I understand your concern, and I’ll do everything I can to get to the bottom of this. The lab work will give us more clarity, and we can discuss the next steps once we have the results. Do you want me to send the results to your email address, or would you prefer a phone call?
PATIENT: Email is fine. I rarely check my phone. Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. To be able to work without feeling like I'm going to collapse. That’s all. Just get me back to my instruments.
DOCTOR: Alright, I've sent the lab request and you will receive an email when the results are available. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them, Chanz. In the meantime, if anything changes, or you have any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I’ll see you then. .
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Stop wasting my time, Doctor. I have work to do.
