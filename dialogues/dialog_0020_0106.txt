DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Beinborn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Beinborn, you said? Well, it's about my foot. It’s been giving me trouble for…oh, a good while now, I reckon. A sore, really. A nasty one. It just won’t heal. And it’s a diabetic sore, if you must know. My Harold – bless his soul – always kept track of these things. I suppose I should be more diligent myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s not healing, and you know it’s related to your diabetes. I understand. It's good you’re aware of the connection; that’s very important. And you mentioned Harold kept track of things… I’m sorry for your loss, if you don’t mind my asking. To get a better idea of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about the sore?
PATIENT: Oh, Harold… it was three years ago, nearly. Cancer, you know. A terrible thing. But we don’t need to dwell on that. The sore... well, it’s on the bottom of my right foot, near my heel. It started small, just a little redness, I thought it was a blister from my slippers, maybe. But it just…got worse. Now it’s quite deep, and it’s…smelly, if I’m honest. And it aches. A constant ache, especially when I stand. I’ve been trying to keep it clean, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Honestly, Doctor, I’m worried it’s going to get infected. I read things, you know, on the internet...
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about Harold. It's perfectly alright to talk about it if you need to, but we can certainly focus on your foot if that’s your preference. Okay, so it’s on the bottom of your right foot, near the heel, started small and has gotten deeper and is now painful and has a smell. You're right to be concerned about infection, especially with diabetes. It's good you're keeping it clean. Can you tell me when you first noticed the redness, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Harold and I, we took a trip to Majuro for the cultural festival… that was… July of last year, I believe. Yes, July. And I remember walking quite a bit, new shoes, a bit too tight, perhaps. I think it was maybe a week or so after we got back that I noticed the redness. It wasn’t much then, just a little pink spot. I didn’t pay much attention to it at first, thought it would go away on its own. Should have seen someone sooner, I suppose, but… well, I don’t like doctors, if you must know. Too much poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Louine. We'll try to be as gentle as possible. It’s good we have a timeframe, though – July of last year. And new shoes might certainly have contributed. Now, besides the soreness and the smell, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me see… Well, the skin around it is a bit… hard, I suppose. And it feels warm to the touch. Not feverish, just… warmer than the rest of my foot. Oh, and sometimes my leg feels a little swollen, especially at the end of the day. It’s not terribly noticeable, but I have noticed it. And… oh dear. I've been feeling a bit tired lately, too. But I assumed that was just my age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hardening of the skin around the sore, warmth to the touch, some swelling in your leg, and some fatigue. Those are all things we need to take into account. Now, I'd like to take a look at the foot itself, if that’s alright with you. We’ll need to do a quick physical exam to assess the sore and check the circulation in your foot. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, exam, you say? Well... I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. And please, be gentle. My Harold used to say I have very sensitive feet. He always took such good care of them… Never let me walk barefoot, even in the house. It’s just… I don’t like anyone messing with my feet. But alright. Go ahead. Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Louine. I promise to be as gentle as possible. We'll take our time, and I’ll explain everything as I go along. Okay… I’m seeing a fairly deep ulcer on the plantar surface of your right foot, near the heel. There is some surrounding redness and the tissue is warm to the touch. I'm also noting some hardness around the edges of the ulcer. Your pulses are present, but somewhat diminished. And sensation appears to be reduced in the area around the sore. I don’t want to alarm you, but the reduction in sensation is a concern, as it makes it harder to detect further injury. I think we need to get some further testing done to determine the extent of the infection, if any, and to assess the circulation in your foot more accurately. I’m going to order a blood test to check your blood sugar and white blood cell count, and I think we should also get an X-ray of your foot to look for any underlying bone infection. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an X-ray? Goodness gracious. That sounds… serious. Harold always said I worry too much. And now this. Well… alright. If that’s what you think is necessary. But I’m not a fan of radiation, you know. Is it absolutely essential? And will it hurt? I’ve got a low tolerance for pain, Doctor. A very low tolerance. And what about the blood test? Do you have to take a lot? I get faint easily.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine. It’s good you’re asking questions. The blood test and X-ray will help us determine the best course of treatment and prevent the situation from getting worse. The X-ray does involve a small amount of radiation, but it’s a very low dose, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks in this case. It’s a standard procedure for evaluating foot ulcers, especially in patients with diabetes. As for the blood test, we only need a small sample, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. We can have you lie down during the draw to prevent any dizziness or fainting. The blood test will help us assess your overall health and check for signs of infection. The X-ray will help us rule out any underlying bone infection, which can be very serious if left untreated. I want to be thorough and make sure we address any potential complications. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: Well… if you put it that way. Harold always said I need to listen to the doctors. He was a smart man, that Harold. Alright. Explain it, then. What exactly does the blood test involve? And this X-ray… how long will it take? I have a bridge game on Thursday, you know. I can’t miss that. Mrs. Abernathy gets terribly upset if I’m not there. She’s a dreadful gossip, but I do enjoy a good game of bridge. And will I have to take off my slippers for the X-ray? They’re my favorite slippers. Harold bought them for me.
DOCTOR: Of course, we'll factor in your bridge game. That's important. Okay, so the blood test is pretty straightforward. A phlebotomist – that’s someone trained to draw blood – will clean a small area on your arm, usually the inside of your elbow, and insert a small needle into a vein. You might feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn’t hurt much. We’ll collect a small vial of blood, and it will take just a few minutes. We’ll have you sit or lie down to ensure you’re comfortable. As for the X-ray, it’s also quick and painless. You’ll sit or stand in front of an X-ray machine, and a technician will take a picture of your foot. It takes just a few seconds. You will need to remove your slippers for the X-ray, unfortunately, but you can have them right back on afterward. The whole process – the blood test and the X-ray – should take about 30-45 minutes, start to finish. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible, usually within a day or two. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. That might involve antibiotics to treat any infection, special dressings to protect the wound, and possibly a referral to a podiatrist – a foot specialist – for further care. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A podiatrist? Oh, goodness. More doctors. Well... alright. If it’s necessary. I still don’t like it, but Harold always said I need to be sensible. Sensible, that was him. Alright, then. Let’s get it over with. Thirty to forty-five minutes, you say? And I can have my slippers back right away? And you’ll tell me everything, step by step? I don't like surprises, Doctor. Not at all. And please, be gentle. My feet are very delicate.
DOCTOR: Yes, thirty to forty-five minutes, and you can have your slippers back immediately. I promise to explain everything step by step, and there will be no surprises. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to make you comfortable. And I will absolutely be gentle with your feet. "Nurse, could you please come in and assist us with the blood draw and X-ray for Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Alright. But if I faint, I want my bridge partners to know I sent my apologies. Mrs. Abernathy will be furious. Truly furious. I suppose I should call them, just in case… Do you have a telephone I can use? And is there anywhere I can sit while I wait? This chair is rather hard. And honestly, Doctor, are you sure about this podiatrist? I’ve heard terrible things…
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cannington. Let me get you settled in that armchair – it’s much more comfortable. And absolutely, you can use the telephone. It’s right over there on the desk. I completely understand your concerns about informing your bridge partners, and you have every right to do so. As for the podiatrist, I understand your hesitation. It’s perfectly normal to be wary of seeing another specialist. I only recommend it because a podiatrist specializes in foot care, and they have the expertise to provide the best possible treatment for your ulcer. I can assure you that I only work with highly qualified and compassionate podiatrists. We can discuss it further once we have the results of the blood test and X-ray. "Nurse, please make sure Ms. Cannington is comfortable throughout the process. And we’ll take things slowly." "Now, let's just take things one step at a time. We’ll get through this together."
PATIENT: .
