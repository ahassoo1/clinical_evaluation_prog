DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Meigs. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, my back. It's been really bad. Worse than usual, and… well, you know why I’m here, right? About the… the other thing. It just hurts a lot more now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see here in your chart a history of back pain, and you mentioned something additional. Could you elaborate on what you mean by “the other thing,” and tell me more about when this current bout of pain started, and what makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. The cancer. I… I had some treatment a while back. They said it was… contained. But it's still there. And this back pain… it started maybe two weeks ago. It was just a little ache at first, but now… now it feels like someone is stabbing me. Laying down helps a little, but not much. And trying to move… that really makes it bad. Even just sitting is hard.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Meigs. It takes courage to discuss these things. So, to clarify, the pain began approximately two weeks ago and has progressively worsened to a stabbing sensation, especially with movement. You find some relief when lying down, but it's not significant. I see here you’ve had prior cancer treatment. Do you recall the type of cancer, and what treatment you received?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It was… kidney cancer. They said it spread a little, but they got most of it. I had… surgery. And then… radiation. A lot of radiation. I think it was… targeted radiation? They tried to only hit the bad parts. It was a long time ago, though. Maybe… five years? Six? It's hard to remember exactly. Everything feels like a blur sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Meigs. Kidney cancer with some spread, treated with surgery and targeted radiation approximately five to six years ago. Now, regarding this current back pain, has it been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly constant. But it gets worse at certain times. Like… when I try to stand up. Or if I bend over. Even coughing makes it really sharp. And… sometimes, at night, it just throbs. It keeps me awake. Not every night, but a lot of them. It’s just… a deep, aching pain that won’t go away. It's different than the pain I had before the radiation, though. This feels… deeper.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Ms. Meigs. Constant pain with exacerbations from standing, bending, and coughing, and a throbbing sensation at night. And you feel this pain is deeper than previous pain experienced after the radiation treatment. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I’ve been… really tired. More tired than usual. And I haven’t been eating much. Everything just… tastes wrong, you know? Not much of an appetite. And… I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot more. Especially at night. It’s embarrassing, but… yeah. Just a lot. And… sometimes, I feel a little short of breath. Not all the time, but… when I walk up the stairs, for example. It's just… little things. But they're all happening at once.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Ms. Meigs. It's important to be thorough, and you’re right to mention all these things. Fatigue, decreased appetite, increased frequency of urination, and shortness of breath… these are all important details. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Aside from the kidney cancer, have you had any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. And… a broken arm once, when I was little. But that’s about it. Nothing serious. I always felt pretty healthy… until the cancer, of course. Before that, I never really went to the doctor much. Just for checkups, and things like that. Nothing like this. I… I don’t understand why all this is happening now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. Tonsillectomy and a broken arm in childhood. No other significant medical history. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mom… she had high blood pressure. And my dad… he had heart problems. He passed away a few years ago. I don't really know much about my grandparents' health. We weren't very close. I don’t think anyone else in my family had… anything like cancer, though. At least, not that I know of. It was a pretty small family. Mostly just me and my parents.
DOCTOR: Thank you. High blood pressure in your mother and heart problems in your father. And finally, could you tell me about your current medications, any allergies you have, and your lifestyle – smoking, alcohol use, and activity level?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… I don’t take any regular medications right now. Not anymore. After the radiation, I was on some pills for a while, but the doctor took me off them. I'm not allergic to anything that I know of. And… I don’t smoke. Never have. I used to drink a little… wine, sometimes. But not much anymore. Maybe a glass a few times a year. And… I try to walk. I used to walk a lot more, but with the pain… it’s hard. I mostly just sit around now. I used to garden, but… not anymore. It's just… hard to do anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Meigs. No current medications, no known allergies, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and decreased activity level due to pain. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your neurological function, including reflexes and sensation in your legs. I'll also palpate your spine to assess for tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. It probably won't be very pleasant, but… if it helps, then go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. This pain is really bad.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Meigs. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now… your heart rate is a bit elevated, and your breath sounds are clear, but slightly diminished at the bases. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some tenderness upon palpation in your lower back region, specifically along the spine. Your reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact bilaterally, but you do express discomfort with certain movements. Based on your history and this initial examination, the pain you’re experiencing could be related to several factors. Given your history of kidney cancer, metastasis to the bone is a concern. However, other possibilities include muscle strain, spinal compression, or nerve impingement. To further investigate, I recommend some imaging studies, specifically an MRI of your spine and a bone scan to evaluate for any potential spread of the cancer. I also want to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and kidney function tests. Would you be agreeable to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… serious. A bone scan? That means it could be the cancer again, right? I… I guess. If you think it’s necessary, then yes. Do whatever you need to do. But… will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I just… I want to know what’s going on. This waiting is the worst part.
DOCTOR: You are right to be concerned, Ms. Meigs. A bone scan will help us determine if there is any evidence of cancer spread to the bones, but it’s important to remember it’s not definitive. Other conditions can also cause abnormal results on a bone scan. The bone scan itself is relatively painless. It involves an intravenous injection of a small amount of radioactive tracer, which is then absorbed by the bones. After a few hours, we'll take images of your bones using a special camera. You’ll need to lie still for a period of time during the scan. The blood work is also straightforward and will provide us with valuable information about your overall health and kidney function. The results of the blood work usually take 24-48 hours, and the bone scan results typically take a few days to interpret. I understand your anxiety about waiting, and I will do everything I can to expedite the process and get you answers as quickly as possible. We can schedule these tests today, and I will personally review the results with you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I can prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A pain reliever would be good. Anything to help. And… thank you. For explaining everything. It still scares me, but… at least I know what’s happening, or what you’re trying to find out. Please, schedule the tests. And… let me know as soon as you get the results. I’ll be waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Meigs. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. Okay, I’ve scheduled the blood work for tomorrow morning at the lab across the street. The bone scan is scheduled for Friday afternoon. You'll receive a call from the radiology department to confirm the appointment and provide instructions. I'm also prescribing you a low dose of oxycodone for pain relief. Take it as directed, and please let me know if it’s not providing adequate relief. I will personally review the results as soon as they become available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as fever, weakness, or numbness, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And… I'll be waiting for the call. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I understand this is a difficult time, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
