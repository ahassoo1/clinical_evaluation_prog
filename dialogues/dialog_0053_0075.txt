DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. Even with the machine… the one I use at night for my sleep apnea. It just doesn’t seem to be doing the full job, you know? I’m still finding myself nodding off during the day, and it’s… worrisome.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use, alright. And how long has this been going on, with the machine not quite cutting it?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It’s been… maybe three months now? I started the machine in February, and for the first couple of months it was wonderful. Really made a difference. But then, gradually, I started feeling tired again. Not as bad as before I had the machine, mind you, but still… noticeable. Three months, I’d say. Definitely three months.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months of this gradual return of sleepiness. And are you using the machine every night?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. Every night. Unless… well, unless I'm travelling. But even then, I try to use it as much as possible. I have a travel CPAP, you see. It's a bit smaller, but it does the trick. But 95% of the nights, I'm using a machine. I wouldn’t want to waste the money, you know? And honestly, the first few weeks with it were such a relief, I don't want to go back to feeling like that.
DOCTOR: Right, so consistent use is good. Let's talk about the machine itself for a moment. Do you know what pressure it's set at?
PATIENT: Pressure? Oh dear. You know, I don't. They adjusted it when I first got it, of course, after the sleep study. But I don't remember the number. I just… turn it on and it works. I suppose I should have asked, shouldn't I? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is. It’s quite important, actually. We need to know if the pressure is still adequate. Let me pull up your records from the sleep study and see what the initial settings were. Just a moment... Ah, here we are. It looks like you were initially titrated to 12 centimeters of water pressure. Have you had any changes to your weight since then?
PATIENT: Twelve… okay. And weight… Now, that's a good question. I think I might have lost a few pounds, actually. My daughter, she’s a bit of a health nut, she’s always reminding me to eat my vegetables. Maybe five or six pounds, over the last few months. Nothing drastic, but enough to notice in my trousers, you know? Would that matter?
DOCTOR: It can. Weight loss can sometimes affect the pressure needed for effective CPAP therapy. Alright. We're going to do a quick exam, just to rule out anything else contributing to your fatigue. Then we can discuss potentially adjusting the pressure on your machine, or perhaps repeating the sleep study. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m just happy to try and figure this out. I really don't enjoy feeling so… sluggish all the time. An exam sounds good. Just let me know what you’d like me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look at your throat, just to make sure there aren't any obvious obstructions. And finally, I want to check your oxygen saturation. Please take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. Good. Now, let’s listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat looks clear as well. Now for your oxygen saturation… 95%. That's within normal limits.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, isn’t it? About the oxygen. I always worry about breathing, you know? My grandfather, he had… well, it doesn’t matter. As long as it’s good. So, what does this all mean, Doctor? Is the machine still working, or do we need to… adjust things, as you said?
DOCTOR: Well, your oxygen saturation is reassuring. The exam didn't reveal anything obvious contributing to your sleepiness. However, given the return of symptoms despite consistent CPAP use, and the slight weight loss, I suspect your current pressure may no longer be optimal. The pressure might have been correct at 98kg, but perhaps 92kg requires a different setting. We could try increasing the pressure slightly – a small increment, and see if that improves things. Alternatively, we could repeat the sleep study to get a more accurate titration. Which approach do you prefer?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tricky one. A sleep study… that’s a bit of a hassle, isn’t it? All that being hooked up to wires. If a small adjustment to the machine could solve it, that would be preferable, I think. I’d rather try that first, if you think it’s safe. I trust your judgement, Doctor. A small increment… what does that even feel like? Will I notice a difference?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly reasonable to try an adjustment first. It's a safe procedure, as long as we do it gradually. A small increment is typically 2 centimeters of water pressure. You might notice a slight increase in the airflow, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Some people find it helps to improve the effectiveness of the therapy. We'll start with 14 centimeters of water pressure, and you can use the machine at that setting for one week. Keep a sleep diary, noting how you feel each morning – your level of alertness, any daytime sleepiness. If you don't notice any improvement after a week, or if you experience any discomfort – dryness, claustrophobia – we'll go back to your original setting. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. A week at 14, keep a diary, and then we reassess. I can definitely do that. I'm quite good at keeping track of things, actually. And if it doesn’t work, we can go back to the old setting. No harm in trying, right? Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll make a note of the pressure adjustment in your chart. And I’m going to write you a brief note to take home outlining the instructions: use the machine at 14 centimeters of water pressure for one week, keep a sleep diary, and return for a follow-up appointment next week. Here you go. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very well, Doctor. The note is perfect, and I understand what I need to do. Thank you again for your help. I feel much more optimistic now. I appreciate your patience. I suppose I'll see you next week, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, next week. Same time, same place. And don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any problems or have any concerns before then. Have a good week, Mr. Paske.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you, Doctor Pitmon. I will do as you say. Have a good week yourself. And thank you again for everything.
