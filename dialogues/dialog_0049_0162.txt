DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't really have time for a lot of chit-chat. It's my stomach, okay? Bloated. Feels like I swallowed a beach ball. It's been…a while, I guess. Not fun.
DOCTOR: A while… could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Honestly? I don't keep track of these things. Weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. It’s just…uncomfortable. Look, I work hard, okay? Pile driving isn't exactly a desk job. I don't have time to be thinking about when my stomach puffs up. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Pile driving… right. And does anything specifically trigger this bloating, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like…food? I eat. You know, normal stuff. Burgers, sometimes. Rice. My wife used to cook a lot of fish…before. I don’t really pay attention to what makes it worse, to be honest. It just is. It’s annoying, not a science project. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other symptoms alongside the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. Maybe a little tired, but that’s from the job. Honestly, doc, I’m a pile driver. We’re always tired. It's just… the stomach. That's the problem. I don’t need a list of everything that's wrong with me, just fix this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Seriously? You're asking me about…that? Look, I came in because my stomach feels like it's going to explode, not to give you a detailed report on my…bathroom habits. Is this a joke? I really don't have time for this. Can we just get to the part where you tell me what's wrong and how to fix it?
DOCTOR: It’s important to have a complete picture, Mr. Kristofik. However, if you’re truly unwilling to provide any further information, we can proceed with a basic examination. I need to listen to your abdomen, and perhaps palpate it. Will that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got a job to get back to. Don't poke too hard, alright? I’m a tough guy, but still. Let’s just do it. Quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. I’m hearing some…increased bowel sounds. And it does feel a bit distended to the touch. No obvious tenderness, though.
PATIENT: Distended? What does that even mean? Look, I told you, it feels full. Like I ate a whole Thanksgiving turkey. Is that what distended means? And seriously, easy on the poking. It's not…pleasant. What's the verdict? Is it something serious? Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: "Distended" means your abdomen is larger than normal, yes. It could be a number of things, Mr. Kristofik. Gas, bloating, fluid retention…sometimes even something more. Given your job…and your reluctance to provide further information…it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. I'm hesitant to make a definitive diagnosis without more details or some further investigation. I recommend a stool sample to rule out any infection, and perhaps a blood test to check for inflammation. And honestly, keeping a food diary might be beneficial.
PATIENT: A food diary? You're kidding me, right? I'm a pile driver, not a…a food critic! Look, I don't have time to write down every single bite I take. And a stool sample? Seriously? No. Absolutely not. I'm not doing any of that. I just want something to make the bloating stop. Can’t you just give me a pill or something? This is ridiculous. I’m wasting my whole day here. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, but I am ethically obligated to gather sufficient information to provide appropriate care. Giving you medication without a proper diagnosis could be harmful. However, given your…resistance to further investigation, I can prescribe something to alleviate the symptoms temporarily. It’s a simethicone—an anti-gas medication. But I strongly advise you to reconsider the stool sample and food diary. And if your symptoms worsen, or you experience fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool, you must seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
