DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter from the lab... something about my cholesterol being high. Hyper... something-lipidemia, I think it said? It's a bit of a mouthful! I don’t really know what that means, exactly, but it sounded important enough to come see you.
DOCTOR: Yes, hyperlipidemia. It is a mouthful, isn’t it?
PATIENT: You’re telling me! It’s a good thing I like reading, because I had to look it up! So, high cholesterol… is that… bad? I eat pretty well, I think. Lots of vegetables. Not much fast food. I don’t understand how this could happen.
DOCTOR: It can be concerning, Ms. Geho, but it's also very common, and often manageable. Even people who eat well and exercise can sometimes have elevated cholesterol. There are a lot of factors involved – genetics play a role, for example. To get a better understanding, let's talk a little more about what's been going on. Do you have any family history of high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My mother… she had some heart trouble when she was older, I think. She had to take some pills for it. And my grandfather on my father’s side… he had a stroke, yes. It was a long time ago, though. I don't really know what was wrong with him, just that he had a stroke. Does that count? I wasn't very old then.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Geho, thank you. Both of those are relevant. And, just to clarify—when you say you eat well, could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Of course. Well, breakfast is usually oatmeal with some fruit – berries, maybe a banana. And a little bit of honey. Lunch is often a salad, with some chicken or fish on top. Nothing too heavy. And dinner… well, that varies. Sometimes I cook a roast chicken with potatoes and vegetables. Other times I'll have pasta with a tomato sauce and some lean ground beef. And I always have a piece of fruit for dessert. Oh, and I drink water with most meals. I really try to stay hydrated. Do you need me to be more specific? I can talk all day about food, I enjoy it so!
DOCTOR: No, that’s a very good start, Ms. Geho, thank you. It sounds like you’re making very healthy choices. Do you use a lot of butter or oils when you cook?
PATIENT: Well, I do use a little bit of olive oil when I’m cooking, mostly for the salad dressings and sometimes for the roasting vegetables. Not a lot, though. Maybe a tablespoon or two? And sometimes, if I’m baking, I’ll use butter. But not every time. I try to use margarine sometimes, instead. Is that a problem? I read somewhere that margarine isn’t as good as butter, but I’m not sure I believe everything I read. It's confusing!
DOCTOR: It is confusing, you’re right. Olive oil is good – a healthy fat. Margarine… that’s a longer discussion for another time. Now, let's talk about other habits. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked a day in my life! And I don’t drink alcohol, either. Never really liked it. I suppose I have one bad habit, if you could call it that. I don't get a lot of exercise. I used to walk more when I was younger, but I haven't been as active lately. I sit at a desk all day, working on designs. It’s not very good for me, I know. Do you think that's a big factor? I’m hoping it’s just that, and not something more serious.
DOCTOR: That's certainly a piece of the puzzle, Ms. Geho. Lack of activity can definitely contribute. And while that’s a good starting point, it's important to get a more complete picture. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your abdomen. Then we can discuss your lab results in more detail and formulate a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. Just tell me if anything feels strange. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It makes me feel much better.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Geho. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, at 142 over 90. It’s not dramatically high, but we’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your abdomen feels normal. Now, let’s talk about those lab results. Your total cholesterol is 260, your LDL – the "bad" cholesterol – is 180, your HDL – the "good" cholesterol – is 40, and your triglycerides are 150. These numbers indicate you do have elevated cholesterol. Specifically, your LDL is higher than we’d like to see. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Those don’t sound very good, do they? So, the LDL is the one I need to worry about? Is that the dangerous one? And the HDL… is that supposed to be low? I'm terrible with numbers, as you can probably tell. Is this something I can fix with diet and exercise, or will I need medication? I really don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Ms. Geho, but don't panic. Elevated LDL is the one we focus on primarily, as it contributes to plaque buildup in your arteries. And yes, HDL is the “good” cholesterol – it helps remove the bad cholesterol – so we want that number to be higher. It’s good that you’re thinking about lifestyle changes first. Often, diet and exercise can make a significant difference. However, given your numbers and your family history, I think a combined approach might be best. I’d like to start with dietary modifications – focusing on reducing saturated and trans fats, increasing soluble fiber – and a regular exercise routine, at least 30 minutes most days of the week. But I also think we should consider a low-dose statin medication. It would help lower your LDL more effectively and reduce your risk of heart disease or stroke. The risk of side effects is low, but we’ll monitor you closely if we go that route. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a lot to take in. I was really hoping to avoid medication, if possible. But I suppose I understand what you’re saying. I do want to be healthy, and I don’t want to end up like my mother. If I commit to really changing my diet and exercise habits… could we try that for, say, three months? And then recheck my numbers? If they haven’t improved enough, then I would be willing to consider the medication. I promise to be diligent! I will walk every day, even in the rain! And I'll read up on those foods you mentioned. Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable plan, Ms. Geho. I appreciate your commitment, and I think it’s a good approach. Three months is a good timeframe to see if lifestyle changes can make a difference. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment then to recheck your cholesterol levels. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a handout with dietary recommendations and a list of resources for exercise programs. We'll also discuss some stress management techniques, as stress can also contribute to high cholesterol. I will write you a prescription for a low-dose statin – just to have on hand. You don't have to fill it right now, but it'll be there if needed. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much for being so patient and explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing I have a plan, and I really appreciate you giving me a chance to try the lifestyle changes first. And thank you for the prescription – it’s good to know I have it if I need it. You've put my mind at ease. I think that's all I need for today. Is there anything else I should be asking you, or anything I need to do before my next appointment?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Geho. I’m glad I could help. No, I don't think there's anything else you need to do right now. Just focus on making those healthy changes. I’ll schedule your follow-up appointment for three months from today – August 2, 2025, plus three months, so November 2nd. The nurse will call you to confirm the time. Here are those handouts, and the prescription. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor Glazewski. Thank you again for everything. I will definitely call if I have any questions. I’m feeling much more optimistic now! Have a wonderful day.
DOCTOR: You too, Ms. Geho. Take care.
