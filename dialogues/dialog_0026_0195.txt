DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Lovely to meet you as well. It's just...well, it's a bit silly, really. I just wanted a card. A “Get Well” card, or maybe one with some nice encouragement on it. You know, from a doctor. It just feels…more official that way. My niece, she’s having a tough time, and I thought a card from you would really cheer her up. Is that…strange?
DOCTOR: Not strange at all, Janeth! That’s a very thoughtful thing to do for your niece. It’s kind of you to think of that. While I don’t usually prescribe cards, I absolutely understand wanting something a little extra special to lift her spirits. Let me see… I can certainly write something out for you. But just to be thorough, and since you're here, would you mind if I asked a few general questions, just to get a sense of your overall well-being?
PATIENT: Oh, well, if it’s just a few. I suppose it can’t hurt. I'm perfectly healthy, mind you. Always have been. Strong Nepalese genes, you know. But go ahead, ask away. I haven't got anything to hide. Though I don’t see what my health has to do with a card for my niece...it's a bit roundabout, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You're right, it is a bit roundabout! It's just standard practice, Janeth. We like to have a little background information, even for seemingly simple requests. Alright. To start, could you tell me about any major illnesses or surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think...major illnesses? Not really. I had the measles as a child, of course, but everyone did back then. And I had my tonsils out when I was…oh, maybe eight years old? It was a very long time ago. The doctor then wasn’t nearly as nice as you are, I’ll tell you that much. He was German too, actually. Small world. Nothing else, really. I’ve always been very careful. A good diet, lots of walking… that sort of thing. I haven’t been seriously ill a day in my life. Are you writing all this down? It feels a bit… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am making notes, Janeth. It’s just to have a complete record. Knowing even things like childhood illnesses is helpful. And it’s good to hear you’ve been so diligent about your health! Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family. Well, my husband, of course. We’ve been married…let me see…fifty years this November. A good man, a very practical man. My niece, Sarita, is his daughter’s child. A lovely girl, but a bit…sensitive, you know? Always worrying about something. That’s why I wanted the card, really. To cheer her up. My sister, she lives in Pokhara, but we don’t see each other much anymore. Everyone’s scattered, as they do. No major health problems in the family, thank goodness. A bit of arthritis here and there, but nothing serious. Are you going to ask me about every relative now? It’s getting a bit tedious.
DOCTOR: No, no, not every relative! I just wanted to get a general sense. It's helpful to know if there's a family history of certain conditions, but if everything has been good, that’s wonderful to hear. Now, just a quick question. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any sensitivities to anything in particular?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens, no. I eat everything. Spicy food, sweets, you name it. My stomach is like iron. I can’t abide those people who are constantly complaining about a little bit of spice. Weak constitutions, that's what it is. No, I've never had a reaction to anything. Not a single thing. And I’ve tried plenty, believe me. My husband likes to experiment with new chutneys. Sometimes they're a bit much, but I always manage. Honestly, Doctor, I think I’m the healthiest person you’ll see all day. It’s a bit odd to be asking me about allergies, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You certainly sound very robust, Janeth! It’s always good to meet someone with such a strong constitution. One last quick question, and then we can get to that card for your niece. Are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? No, absolutely not. I don't believe in all those pills and potions. A bit of ginger tea if I have a cold, maybe. But that's it. I find fresh air and a good walk are far more effective than anything the doctors prescribe these days. Honestly, I think most people take too many pills. It just weakens the system, you know? No, I don't take any medications. Never have, never will. Now, about that card…are you going to write something nice? Sarita is a very sensitive girl, you must be careful with your words.
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth, it sounds like you are a very healthy and independent woman! I admire that. And absolutely, I will be very careful with my words for Sarita. Just give me a moment. While I'm writing, would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure and pulse, just as a formality?
PATIENT: Oh, really? Must you? I told you, I'm perfectly healthy. All this poking and prodding seems rather unnecessary for a simple card. But…alright. If you must. Just be quick about it, will you? I have things to do, you know. And try not to pinch! I have very sensitive skin. It's a family trait.
DOCTOR: Of course, just a quick check. Your pulse is a bit on the lower side, 62, and your blood pressure is 118 over 78. That's perfectly acceptable, actually quite good. And you are right, your skin is very sensitive. It feels lovely and smooth. Now, let me finish this card for Sarita.
PATIENT: Well, I should hope so! I take very good care of myself. Lower side, you say? That’s because I walk so much. Keeps the heart strong, you know. And smooth skin is just good genes. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making me sound like a medical marvel! I trust you’re writing something encouraging? Sarita gets very discouraged easily. A simple “get well soon” won’t do. It needs to be… uplifting. Something about her potential, perhaps? She’s very creative, you see. A bit lost, but creative. Do you think that's enough information? Is that card almost ready? I'm starting to get impatient.
DOCTOR: Here you are. I’ve written something about embracing her creativity and having faith in her potential. I hope it brings her some comfort. “Dear Sarita, Wishing you strength and peace as you navigate this challenging time. Remember your inner light and the beautiful talents you possess. Believe in yourself and know that you have the power to create a life filled with joy and purpose. Sending you warmth and encouragement. Sincerely, Dr. Finco.” Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmm…yes, that’s…quite nice, actually. “Inner light” is a bit…fluffy, but the rest is good. “Potential” is a good word. Sarita likes words like that. She’s always reading poetry. "Purpose" is good too. Yes, that will do nicely. It’s much better than a simple “get well soon.” Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very…attentive. Though all that poking and prodding really wasn’t necessary. Still, I appreciate the effort. I suppose a doctor’s job is to poke and prod, isn't it? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must get going. Sarita is expecting this card. And I promised to make her a special chutney. It’s a bit spicy, but she likes it that way. Thank you again, Doctor. And try not to poke too many people!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janeth. It was lovely meeting you, and I’m glad I could help, even in a small way. Do take care of yourself, and enjoy that chutney! And don’t worry, I try to limit the poking and prodding. And if Sarita ever needs a little encouragement, feel free to come back and see me. Have a wonderful day.
PATIENT: Oh, I’m sure she will. A bit of encouragement is all she needs. And I suppose I will. It's always good to have a sensible doctor nearby. Goodbye.
