DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Voytek. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's… well, it’s this cough. Been hacking away for a while now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Doesn’t bring anything up, if you know what I mean. Feels like… like there's dust in my throat, maybe? It’s been bothering me. I can’t rightly say how long, though. Time… it slips away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough, feeling like dust in your throat. And you said it’s been going on for a while… can you try to give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. My wife… she passed… oh, goodness, must be… five, maybe six years ago now? It was before that, I think. Before she got sick. It wasn't right after, no. But it's been a good long spell, that’s for sure. Longer than it should be, I reckon. I just… haven’t gotten around to seeing anyone about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s been going on for at least five or six years. And it hasn't been getting significantly worse, just… persistent?
PATIENT: Persistent is a good word, Doctor. Yes, that's it. It comes and goes, but it's always there, somewhere in the back of my throat. Sometimes worse when it’s dry out, I suppose. Or when the wind blows a lot of dust around. We get a lot of dust here, you know. Living out in the country like this. It just… bothers me when I try to sleep, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, I get a little tired sometimes. But I’m ninety years old, Doctor! I figured that was just… old age. And my bones ache a bit, especially in the mornings. But that’s the weather, mostly. I don’t know… I don't think so. Nothing else really. I still eat alright, and I can still get around… slow, but I get around. It's just… this cough.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever smoked, or been exposed to a lot of smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke… When I was younger… during the war… a little. Everyone smoked back then, it seemed. Not me personally much, but I was around it a lot. After the war, not so much. My wife… she didn't like it. So I mostly stayed away from it. It’s been a long time since I’ve been around a lot of smoke. A very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I've ever noticed, no. Maybe to bees, once or twice. Got stung as a boy and swelled up a bit. But nothing serious. No hay fever, no sniffles… I don’t think so. I mostly just get dust in my lungs, I guess. Living out here, you can’t avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you had any recent hospital stays or surgeries?
PATIENT: Medications… Just a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor gave me a while back. A small white pill, I take it every morning. That’s all. As for hospital stays… not in a long time. I had my appendix out when I was young, but that was… goodness, ages ago. And a broken arm once, falling off a ladder. But nothing recent, no. I mostly just try to stay out of the doctor’s office, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a medication for blood pressure, a small white pill daily. And no recent hospitalizations or surgeries. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your throat.
PATIENT: Sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. My wife always said I was a tough old bird. Just… be gentle, if you would. My bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be. Just relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Take a nice deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. Your lungs… I do hear some mild wheezing, particularly on exhale. Not alarming, but it's something we'll keep an eye on. Your throat is a little dry, but no significant redness or swelling. I don't see any obvious signs of infection. Now, I'm going to gently feel your lymph nodes to check for any swelling. No significant swelling of the lymph nodes. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you have a chronic cough, likely related to some mild airway inflammation. The wheezing suggests some narrowing of the airways. We need to rule out a few things though. I'd like to order a chest x-ray to get a better look at your lungs. And I think a simple blood test to check your overall health and rule out any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An x-ray and a blood test… Sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… when do I get the results? And will it hurt? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: The x-ray won't hurt at all, Mr. Pavlovic. You just stand still for a few seconds while the machine takes a picture. As for the blood test, there will be a small pinch, but it's very quick. We usually get the results back within a few days. I'll have the nurse schedule you for both tests right away. We’ll call you as soon as we have the results, and we can discuss them then. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated and avoiding any irritants that might worsen your cough, like dust or smoke. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Irritants… Avoiding dust out here is like avoiding the air, Doctor. But I'll try. Hydrate… yes, I can do that. Water's good. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. It’s been bothering me for a long time, and it’s good to finally have someone look at it. Just… call me if you need anything. I might forget things, but I’ll try to remember to answer the phone.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovic. I understand. We’ll do our best to make sure you get the care you need. I'll have the nurse come in and schedule those tests for you and go over the instructions. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: .
