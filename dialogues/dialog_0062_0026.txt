DOCTOR: Hi Ardelle, it's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, it’s just… this tiredness. It comes and goes, you see. Really knocks me about when it does. And the young man at the lab said something about my… my numbers being off. Something about my muscles? Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things anymore. It's all just a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness that comes and goes, and some results from the lab that weren't quite what they expected. I understand it can be a lot to keep track of. Let’s try to sort it out. When you say “numbers being off”, do you recall what the young man said specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. He used a long word. Started with a ‘C’, I think. Creat… something. It sounded important, he made quite a fuss. He kept saying it meant my muscles were… damaged? I’ve been diving for a long time, you know. Always been strong as an ox. Maybe it’s just old age creeping in. Though I don’t feel old. Not usually, anyway. This tiredness is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, a word starting with 'C'… likely he was referring to Creatinine, or possibly CK, which stands for Creatine Kinase – both can relate to muscle health. And diving for a long time – that’s good to know! It’s good you're staying active. So this tiredness is new, and comes and goes. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like being sleepy, dear. It's… a weight. Like trying to lift something very, very heavy all the time. Even just getting out of bed can be a struggle. And it doesn't go away with rest, not always. Sometimes it's just… there. All day. It comes on suddenly, too. One minute I'm fine, the next I feel like I've run a marathon. My husband, Pemba, he helps a lot, but I don't like being a burden.
DOCTOR: That sounds really frustrating, Ardelle – a constant weight, even with rest, and coming on suddenly. It's completely understandable you wouldn't want to be a burden to Pemba. Okay, let's try to get a better picture of what might be going on. Besides this tiredness and the muscle issue the lab flagged, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… well, my appetite hasn’t been the best. Not that I need much at my age, mind you. But even Pemba’s cooking doesn't tempt me like it used to. And my legs… they ache sometimes. Not all the time, just now and then. He rubs them for me, but it doesn’t always help. And I’ve been a bit… forgetful, I suppose. Though that’s probably just getting old too, isn’t it? I keep misplacing things. Small things, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite, leg aches, and some forgetfulness. It's good Pemba's helping with the leg rubs. And it is common to have some changes with age, but it's good we're talking about everything. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, years ago, the doctor said my blood pressure was a bit high. He put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I don't like taking pills if I can help it. Apart from that… not much, really. I’ve always been quite healthy, all things considered. A strong constitution, my mother always said. I rarely get sick. I've had the usual jabs, of course, as the government requires. And Medicare keeps me ticking along, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past, treated with medication you stopped taking, and otherwise generally good health. And you stay up-to-date with your vaccinations. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now, Pemba did take me to the hospital once, many years ago. I broke my wrist. Fell off a ladder while cleaning the gutters. Silly thing to do, really. They set it in a cast, and it healed up fine. Apart from that… no. No surgeries. Never needed one, thank goodness. I've always been careful. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken wrist years ago, healed with a cast. And no other surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… Now, Pemba would know better than me. He always kept track of these things. My mother… she had arthritis, I think. Badly in her hands. And my father… he died young, of a heart attack. Sudden like. Didn't see it coming. That was a long time ago, of course. I don't remember much about it, to be honest. Just a lot of sadness. Pemba’s family… mostly healthy folk, I believe. Farmers, they were. Strong and sturdy. They didn't get sick much, either. Mostly just aches and pains from hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of arthritis in your mother’s family and a heart attack in your father's. And generally healthy in Pemba’s family. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones or vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my joints. Dr. Sharma gave it to me a while back, said it might help with the aches. It’s a small white pill. I can’t remember the name of it, honestly. And sometimes I take a little something for indigestion. Pemba buys it for me at the shop. It's pink, I think. That's all. I don't believe in taking too many pills, you see. Messes with your head, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill for your joints prescribed by Dr. Sharma, and a pink pill for indigestion that Pemba buys at the shop. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything. And I haven’t had any trouble with any medicines, as far as I can remember. Pemba always checks, though. He’s very careful. He wouldn't let me take anything that might hurt me. A good man, that Pemba. Always looking after me. I can't think of anything else, dear. Is that all? I’m a bit tired now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And it sounds like you have a very supportive husband in Pemba! That’s wonderful. Thank you, Ardelle, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a few other simple things. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just don’t poke too much, alright? My joints are a bit sensitive today. And try not to take too long, I have a bit of a headache coming on now. Just get it over with quickly, if you don't mind. I trust you know what you’re doing, of course.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I’ll be gentle and as quick as possible. Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and again… Good. Your heart sounds a little fast, but otherwise, everything sounds okay. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. Just relax your leg for me… and again… Okay. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which can be common with age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. And just feeling your legs here… there's some tenderness to the touch, especially on the outer side. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! A bit, yes. Not terrible, but… a dull ache. Like when the weather changes, you know? It’s been like that for a few weeks now. Pemba rubs it, but it doesn’t always help. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a bruise, almost, but without the colour. And it gets worse when I walk too much. That's why I don't go out much anymore, honestly. It’s just not worth the trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your legs, especially when walking, and it’s been present for a few weeks. It sounds like it's exacerbated by activity. Now, I’m going to check the strength in your legs. Could you please try to push your foot against my hand like this… and again… Okay, and now pull your foot up like this… and again. Your muscle strength feels a little weaker than expected, especially in your lower legs. Alright, Ardelle. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I’m concerned about a few things. Your tiredness, the leg pain, the muscle weakness, and the elevated Creatinine from the lab results all point towards possible muscle damage or inflammation. It could be several things – a vitamin deficiency, a medication side effect, or even something more serious like polymyositis. It’s important to figure out what’s going on.
PATIENT: Polymy… what-itis? Oh dear. Sounds dreadful. Is it… is it serious? Pemba wouldn't like that. He worries enough as it is. A vitamin deficiency? I do try to eat well, but maybe I'm not getting enough. I’ve been losing my appetite, you see. And what about the medicine? Is that what’s causing it? I told you, I don't like taking pills. What do we do now, dear? Please don’t tell me I need a lot of tests. I hate hospitals.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Ardelle. Polymyositis is a type of inflammation of the muscles, and it can be serious if left untreated, but it's not always the case. We need to investigate further to find out what's causing your symptoms. I understand you don't like hospitals, and I'll do my best to minimize the tests, but we will need some blood work to get a clearer picture. It will help us rule out some of the more common causes, like vitamin deficiencies, check your kidney function, and look for signs of inflammation. It’s a standard procedure, and it will give us a lot more information. We may also need to do a Creatine Kinase test, which measures the amount of an enzyme released from damaged muscles. That will confirm whether there’s ongoing muscle breakdown. I’ll also want to check your Vitamin D levels. I’m not saying you definitely have polymyositis – we just need to rule things out. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood work, of course. I knew it. Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But please, just the essentials. I don’t want any unnecessary poking and prodding. And can Pemba come with me? I get nervous on my own. He always knows what to ask the doctors. A good man, that Pemba. Always looking after me. And what about the medicine? Should I stop taking those pills? They might be causing this, you said. I don't want to make things worse. And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to wait too long, I’m already feeling so tired.
DOCTOR: Of course, Pemba is very welcome to come with you. Having someone there for support is always helpful. We'll just do the essentials – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, Vitamin D level, and a CK test. That will give us a good starting point. And yes, let’s stop the white pill for your joints for now, just to see if that makes a difference. Stop taking it tonight. The pink pill for indigestion is probably fine to continue, but let me know if your symptoms worsen after you stop the white pill. The results usually take about 3-5 business days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and avoid any strenuous activity. If your symptoms worsen significantly – for example, if you develop a high fever, shortness of breath, or severe muscle pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, dear. Just… try not to give me too many complicated instructions, alright? My head is swimming already. And please, remember to call as soon as the results are in. I don't want to be waiting around for weeks. And tell Pemba to get the car warmed up, alright? It's a bit chilly outside. He’s very good at looking after me, that Pemba. Always thinking ahead. Yes, alright. I think that's everything. Thank you, dear. I hope you can figure out what’s wrong with me. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I'll keep things as simple as possible, and I promise to call as soon as the results are in. I’ll make a note to have my staff call you directly. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. It was lovely meeting you both. I’m hopeful we can get to the bottom of this. And please give Pemba my thanks for taking such good care of you. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
