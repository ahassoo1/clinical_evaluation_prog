DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor Billman. It's this…sleepiness. Even with the machine, I’m still awfully tired during the day. It’s just… bothersome, you know? I thought the machine was supposed to fix all this.
DOCTOR: The machine, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, the CPAP machine. My doctor back in the city – Dr. Ramirez – prescribed it a couple years ago now. Said I had sleep apnea. I use it every night, faithfully. Well, mostly faithfully. There were a couple of nights on trips when it was just too awkward to bring, but other than that, I really do try. But this tiredness… it’s still there. Like a fog, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of nights off the machine… that’s something we’ll need to talk about. But first, let's try to pinpoint this tiredness. When did you start noticing this fog, as you call it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. It wasn't immediately after starting the machine, that's for sure. I felt a bit better for a while, I recall. Maybe… six months ago? No, maybe a little longer. Eight or nine months ago, perhaps? It just… crept up on me. I'd be reading, and suddenly my eyes just get heavy. Or driving – not a good feeling, let me tell you. That's when I really started to worry. I haven’t had any accidents, thankfully, just…drowsy. Really drowsy.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's been creeping up over the last eight to nine months. And you said it happens when reading or driving. Are there any other times you notice it?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. After lunch is a bad time. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. And… evenings, sometimes. Not every night, but when I’m sitting in my chair watching television… that’s when it hits me hardest. It's almost like… I can fight it for a while, but eventually I just… drift off. My daughter visits sometimes, and she's always teasing me about nearly nodding off during the news. She means well, of course. But it’s still… unpleasant. I used to enjoy my evenings. Now I’m always bracing myself.
DOCTOR: So it's pretty consistent – after lunch, evenings, while reading or driving. And you're using the machine every night except those couple of trips. Okay. Do you snore, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Loudly, according to my ex-wife. And my daughter. It’s… always been a bit of a problem. Even before the machine. I used to wake myself up sometimes with the racket. My ex-wife certainly didn't need a sleep machine to know I was breathing! She’d nudge me and tell me to turn over. It’s a family joke now, but it wasn’t much fun at the time, I can tell you that. It's still pretty noticeable even with the machine, though not as bad. My daughter says so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you aware of any pauses in your breathing during the night?
PATIENT: Pauses… hmm. That’s a difficult one. I don’t think so, not that I’ve noticed. I mean, I’m asleep, aren't I? I haven't exactly been lying awake counting my breaths! But my daughter – she told me once she heard me… stop breathing, and then start again with a big gasp. That was before the machine too. She was worried, naturally. That's when I finally went to Dr. Ramirez. But I don’t know if she’s just remembering things… she does tend to exaggerate. Still, she was quite insistent. I suppose it’s possible. I just… don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about the machine settings for a moment. Do you know what pressure it’s set at?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I have no idea. Dr. Ramirez explained it all, of course, but… well, I'm 83 years old, Doctor. A lot of things go in one ear and out the other! I think he said it was a low setting to start with, and then he adjusted it a few times. I remember the tests, lying there with all the wires, but the numbers… they just went whizzing by. I just assumed he knew what he was doing, and I’ve been using it ever since. Is that bad? Should I have written it down?
DOCTOR: It’s not bad, Mr. Paske, but it would be helpful to know. We need to see if the machine is actually doing its job. Have you ever downloaded any data from it?
PATIENT: Downloaded data? Oh, no. Absolutely not. I barely know how to turn on my television, let alone download data from a machine! Dr. Ramirez said something about it, I recall, but it sounded very complicated. Something about a card and a computer and… it all went over my head. I just… use the machine. I plug it in, put on the mask, and hope for the best. Is that… sufficient? It seems a bit much for an old man, all this technology!
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we're going to have to do some investigating, then. It sounds like the machine may not be optimized for you, and honestly, the fact that you've been off it a few times isn’t ideal. It’s important to keep it consistent. Let’s start with a physical exam, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A good look-over. I haven't had one in a while, to be honest. I suppose it’s good to make sure everything is still working properly at my age. Lead the way. And don’t worry if I ask a lot of questions. I’m a curious fellow, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. Let's start with your height and weight. Then we'll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please step onto the scale for me, and I'll record your weight. Your chart says you're 161 centimeters and around 92 kilograms… is that about right?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about correct, Doctor. I haven’t weighed myself in ages, but that's probably pretty close. I used to be taller, I think, but I've shrunk a bit in my old age. It happens, you know. Every inch counts when you’re getting on!
DOCTOR: Alright, 158 centimeters. A little shorter, yes. And the weight is stable. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. 145 over 88. A bit elevated. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please take a deep breath for me… and another…
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. As deep as I can manage. My lungs aren't what they used to be, you know. I used to smoke, years ago. Stopped a long time ago, thankfully. A very bad habit. But I still feel it sometimes, a bit of a tightness in the chest.
DOCTOR: Alright. I do hear some slight wheezing, and your heart rate is a little irregular. Nothing immediately alarming, but we need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to take a look at your throat… open wide and say "Ahhh".
PATIENT: Ahhh… There you go, Doctor. It's probably not very interesting, but you're the expert. I do have a bit of a dry throat these days, you know. It's the air conditioning, I suspect. Or maybe it’s just old age creeping up on me again!
DOCTOR: Alright. A little redness, but nothing concerning. No swelling in your lymph nodes. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax your stomach muscles for me. Are you experiencing any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain or discomfort. Not at all. My stomach’s been pretty good, actually. I watch what I eat, you know. Old habits die hard. Although I do enjoy a little pastry now and then. Can’t resist a good apple strudel, myself!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. That completes the physical exam. It doesn't reveal anything immediately serious, but your blood pressure is a little high, you have some slight wheezing, and an irregular heartbeat. And, of course, we still need to address the persistent tiredness and ensure your CPAP machine is properly optimized. Now, let’s go over your medications, allergies, and medical history. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Well, let me think... I take a low-dose aspirin every day, Dr. Ramirez prescribed that years ago for my heart. And I take a vitamin D supplement, my daughter keeps reminding me to. Said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. She worries about my bones, you know. As for allergies… not that I know of. Never had any bad reactions to anything, thankfully. And my medical history… well, I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. And I had my gallbladder removed in the 1980s. Other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, aspirin, vitamin D, pneumonia and gallbladder removal. Good. Do you have any family history of heart disease, diabetes, or other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My father had heart disease, he passed away when he was in his 70s. And my mother had diabetes, she was very careful with her diet. And my sister… she had high blood pressure, just like me. It seems to run in the family, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. That's important information. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor, nothing like that. Quit smoking over 40 years ago, best thing I ever did. And I haven't touched a drop of alcohol in years. Doesn't agree with my stomach, you see. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not! Never had any interest in those. I'm a simple man, Doctor. I enjoy a good book, a quiet evening at home, and the occasional visit from my daughter. That's enough excitement for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. That's good. Now, let’s discuss your sleep habits. Aside from the tiredness, are you experiencing any difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or do you wake up feeling refreshed?
PATIENT: Well, falling asleep isn't usually a problem. I get tired easily, you see. But staying asleep… that's another story. I wake up several times during the night, sometimes to use the restroom, sometimes just… because I'm restless. And waking up feeling refreshed? Definitely not. I always feel groggy and sluggish, even after a full night's sleep. It’s just… frustrating, you know? I want to enjoy my days, but I’m always fighting this tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay. Difficulty staying asleep and waking up feeling unrefreshed. Alright, Mr. Paske. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, I believe your persistent tiredness is likely multifactorial. We need to rule out some potential causes and optimize your CPAP therapy. First, I'm going to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels, vitamin D levels, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I'm also going to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart rhythm more closely. Finally, I want you to keep a sleep diary for two weeks, recording your bedtime, wake-up time, and any interruptions during the night. And most importantly, we need to ensure your CPAP machine is properly calibrated and functioning. Do you have it with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I brought it with me. It’s in the car, I’ll fetch it. A sleep diary… alright, I can manage that. It sounds a bit tedious, but I'm willing to try anything. And the blood work and EKG… yes, yes, that sounds sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I'm just… eager to find out what’s causing this tiredness. It's interfering with my life, you see. I want to enjoy my remaining years, not spend them feeling exhausted all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. That's good. Let's get your machine and then we can schedule those tests. And don’t worry, we will figure this out. I'll have my nurse explain the details of the sleep diary and the blood work. Go ahead and fetch your machine, and I'll have my nurse come in and start the paperwork for the tests.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR:
