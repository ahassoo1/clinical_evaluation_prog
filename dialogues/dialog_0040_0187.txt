DOCTOR: "Bird flapping," hmm. Palpitations, we call those. And your wife is concerned about your blood pressure…yes, alright. It is good she's keeping an eye on things. Now, when did you first notice this 'funny feeling' in your chest?
PATIENT: First…? Oh, jeez. Old man forget things, you know? Maybe…week? Two week? Not long. It come and go. Not every day. Mostly when I…eat too much spicy kimchi. Wife make good kimchi, but…too much spice.
DOCTOR: Right. Spicy kimchi. Okay. And aside from the chest feeling and the blood pressure…anything else bothering you?
PATIENT: No! Nothing else. I strong man. Always been strong. Emergency…what you call it…director. I tell people what to do. Not the other way around. Just…chest. And wife nag. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. Let's just get a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and then we'll check that blood pressure. Just to satisfy your wife, you understand. If you could just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But don’t take long. I have things to do. Important things. Not sitting around listening to…heartbeat.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds…regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is…160 over 95. Yes, your wife is right to be concerned. It’s elevated. Do you have any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: History…? No. Never. I work hard, eat…sometimes too much. Spicy food. Always been healthy. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t at my age? Never see doctor much. Waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No! No pills. I don’t like pills. Make you weak. I take…tea. Green tea. Good for everything, they say. Wife try to give me some…water pill, but I throw it away.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. Well, your blood pressure is quite high. We need to address this. I'm going to order some blood work and a basic EKG to rule out any underlying issues. It's just standard procedure. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Kimchi, spicy soup, all kinds of food. Never have problem. Except maybe…too much spice sometimes. Stomach get a little upset, but that's not allergy. That's just…good food.
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies. Okay. I’m going to write you a prescription for a low dose blood pressure medication. It's just to start, we'll see how you tolerate it. And I strongly advise limiting your sodium intake and…yes, the spicy kimchi. The lab order is for the clinic downstairs. Can you go down there now?
PATIENT: Pills… Hmph. Fine. But if I feel bad, I stop taking them. Wife not here to tell me what to do. And kimchi is good! Important part of life. Clinic downstairs? Okay, fine. Let's get this over with.
