DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I'm Dr. Sham. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac, though I suspect that is what your papers say. I am here today to get cleared for a new place to live. A senior living facility. A bit of a change, you understand, but I believe it is time.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Senior living… that's good, a positive step. They usually require a physical exam for clearance, which is what you’re here for. I see you’re 81 years old… alright. To start, can you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am eighty-one years of age, as you say. I have been… fairly fortunate, all things considered. I bake, you see. Have for most of my life. Keeps me active, mostly. I have always been… reasonably strong. My weight has been stable, around one hundred and eighty pounds, give or take. No major illnesses, not that I recall. A few aches and pains, naturally, at this age, but nothing that stops me from kneading dough. I do have private insurance, if that is of import.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Tkac. And the insurance is helpful. Now, just to be thorough… have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything like heart problems, diabetes, lung disease, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… heart problems, no. My father had some trouble with his heart, but I seem to have missed that inheritance, thankfully. Diabetes, no, never. Lung disease, no. I’ve always been careful to avoid smoke. Arthritis… now, there’s something. My hands, you see, they ache sometimes, especially in the cold weather. Nothing debilitating, but… noticeable. The baker’s arthritis, I suppose you could call it. It hasn’t stopped me yet, though. Not entirely.
DOCTOR: Alright, “baker’s arthritis.” We’ll definitely need to take a closer look at your hands. Have you ever been officially diagnosed with arthritis by a doctor?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve never really needed to see a doctor about it. Just… managed it, you understand? Warm water, a little bit of rest when needed. I’ve always been a bit… stubborn about doctors, I suppose. It never slowed me down enough to bother anyone. Perhaps it is time, though, if you think so.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re here now, then. Alright. And what about any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had the need for any. A few broken bones when I was a boy – climbing trees, mostly – but those healed up just fine on their own. I’ve always been… lucky, I think. Or maybe just careful. I did have my tonsils out when I was quite young, but that was so long ago, I barely remember it. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Tonsils don't usually factor in at this point, Mr. Tkac. Alright, good. Now, thinking about your family… are there any major health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. My mother, she lived to be a very old woman, almost ninety. She was strong as an ox, that one. She did have… trouble with her eyesight in her later years, cataracts, I believe they called it. And my father, as I mentioned, had some heart trouble. But beyond that… not particularly. Mostly just… folks living long lives, and then… not. The Lakota aren’t known for our long medical histories, not in the way some are. We just… endured.
DOCTOR: Alright, cataracts and heart trouble in the family. And you said you're Lakota… is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. Lakota Sioux, to be precise. My family has lived on the land for… a very long time. Though, I suppose, “land” is a complicated word. It is important to me, my heritage. It shapes… everything, I suppose. Do you need to know anything specific about it for this… clearance? I am happy to share, if it is relevant.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Tkac, no need at this time. It’s good to know. Now, regarding your current medications… are you taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I take a multivitamin, every now and then, just to be sure. And when my hands are especially achy, I take ibuprofen, the over-the-counter kind. But that's it, mostly. I prefer to avoid pills whenever possible. I believe in a good diet and hard work, you see. Those are the best medicines, in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Now, just one last quick question before the physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, and I’ve never had a reaction. I’ve spent a lot of time outdoors, as well, and never been bothered by plants or insects. I seem to be fairly resilient, thankfully. Although, I do dislike cilantro. But that is a matter of taste, not allergy, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. No allergies, just a dislike of cilantro. Good to know. Now, if you’ll just follow me, we’ll do a quick physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your hands, as we discussed. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No questions, Doctor. I am ready when you are. I understand you will be looking at my hands closely, and that is perfectly alright. I suppose it is time someone did. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit here, and we’ll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming for your age. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs… take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. Sounds clear, no wheezing or murmurs. Now, let’s take a look at those hands. Can you open and close them for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There. As you can see, they are… well-used. A lifetime of kneading dough, you understand. Sometimes they ache, especially in the mornings or when the weather is cold. But they still work, mostly.
DOCTOR: I see… There is some redness and swelling around the knuckles, particularly on this hand… and this one. And some bony prominence here. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a little bit. Not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache. It’s most noticeable when you press on those joints, as you are doing. It comes and goes, you understand. Some days it’s worse than others. It hasn't stopped me from working, though. Not yet, anyway. A little stiff, perhaps, but… functional.
DOCTOR: Alright. It appears you have some signs of osteoarthritis in your hands. It's a common condition, especially with age and repetitive use. Now, let's check your reflexes... Good. And finally, let's just take a look in your ears and throat. Open wide and say "Ahhh..." Everything looks clear. No signs of infection. Okay, Mr. Tkac. That completes the physical exam. I’ll review my findings and discuss the next steps with you. Give me just a moment.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. Take your time. I am not in any particular hurry, you understand. I’ve had a long life, and I’m accustomed to waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. As I suspected, you have osteoarthritis in your hands. It’s a degenerative joint condition, and unfortunately, there’s no cure. However, it’s manageable. The good news is, it doesn’t appear to be severely limiting your function at this time. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but we can monitor that. Based on your exam and history, I think you are medically cleared for the senior living facility. However, I recommend a few things. First, continue to manage the pain in your hands with over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed. Second, we should keep an eye on your blood pressure. I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to recheck it. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: That is… reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. Three months sounds perfectly reasonable. I am glad to hear I am cleared for the facility. I suppose I should ask… is there anything I should be doing to help manage this arthritis? Aside from the ibuprofen, of course. Any exercises, or things I should avoid? I am a baker, you see, and I suspect stopping entirely would be… detrimental to my spirit.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Tkac. You’re right to ask. Stopping baking entirely isn’t realistic, nor is it necessarily recommended. The key is moderation and proper technique. Gentle hand exercises can help maintain your range of motion and strength. There are resources online with specific exercises for arthritis sufferers, or a physical therapist could provide tailored guidance. Also, try to avoid gripping things too tightly or doing repetitive motions for extended periods without breaks. Warm water soaks can help ease the pain. Consider using assistive devices if needed, like jar openers or ergonomic tools. And, importantly, listen to your body. If your hands are hurting, take a break. I can write you a referral to a physical therapist if you’d like. They can teach you exercises and provide strategies to manage your symptoms while continuing to bake. Do you think that would be helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a referral to a physical therapist would be most helpful. I appreciate your thoughtfulness. I’ve always been one to rely on my own strength, but I suppose a bit of professional guidance wouldn’t hurt. And I am… accustomed to listening to my body, you are correct. It has served me well for eighty-one years, after all. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave? Perhaps something I should discuss with the facility? Or any paperwork I need to complete?
DOCTOR: Alright, here is the referral to a physical therapist. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience. Regarding the facility, let them know about your osteoarthritis and slightly elevated blood pressure. They should be able to accommodate your needs. I’ll also send a summary of your exam findings to them directly. As for paperwork, no, nothing further is needed from my end. Just make sure they have your insurance information. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You have been most thorough and kind. I appreciate your time and attention. And thank you for not dismissing my “baker’s arthritis” as simply the aches of old age. I feel much more confident moving forward, knowing I have a plan. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It was a pleasure meeting you. I'm glad I could help. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Take care of yourself, and enjoy the new facility. Goodbye. .
