DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I haven't been myself lately. Just… a bit down, you know? It’s been going on for a while now, and frankly, I’m tired of feeling this way. I suppose that’s what you’re here for, isn’t it? To sort things out. I’d like to get this over with quickly if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We'll try to get to the bottom of things as efficiently as we can. It sounds like you've been experiencing some… low mood?
PATIENT: Low mood is… a polite way to put it. It's more than that, Doctor. It’s like… a weight. A constant weight on my chest. Things don’t bring me joy anymore, not like they used to. Even my work… and I love my work. Being out there, helping people… it used to fill me up. Now… it’s just another thing I have to do. Is this what you need to know? I'm not sure what exactly you want to know.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Nani. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like this has been significantly impacting your life, and that’s important for us to understand. When you say it’s been going on “for a while now”, could you give me a sense of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… around last November, I believe. Yes, November. After the ski season ended. Usually, I’m quite alright taking a break, recharging. But this time… it just didn’t lift. And it hasn’t, really. Six, seven months now, maybe? It all feels like one long grey stretch, to be honest. I hope that answers your question. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. About six or seven months. And you mentioned it started after the ski season. Did anything else happen around that time – any major life events, stressors, or changes?
PATIENT: Well… my divorce was finalized around then, too. December, I think it was. We’d been separated for a year, so it wasn't unexpected, but… it still hit me harder than I thought it would. Edwin… he wasn’t a bad man, but we just… grew apart. Different things we wanted out of life, you see. Does that matter? I’m not sure if that's related to how I’m feeling. It just… is. Everything feels connected, somehow. A mess, really.
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, Nani. Major life changes like a divorce are often very closely linked to changes in mood. It's not unusual at all to feel this way after such a significant event. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Sleep… yes, that’s been off. I have trouble falling asleep, and when I do, I wake up several times during the night. I’m not sleeping properly, Doctor. It’s… restless. And my appetite? It’s just gone. I force myself to eat, really. Don’t have much of an interest in food anymore. I used to love to cook, Nigerian food especially. Now… it just feels like another chore. Everything feels like a chore. Is this… is this normal? Am I making sense?
DOCTOR: You’re making perfect sense, Nani. And yes, those are both common symptoms when someone is experiencing a period of low mood. Difficulty sleeping and changes in appetite are frequently associated with it. Have you been feeling tired or fatigued, even after sleeping?
PATIENT: Tired doesn’t even begin to cover it, Doctor. Exhausted. Bone-deep exhausted. I could sleep for a day and still feel drained. And it’s not just physical. It’s… mental exhaustion, too. Difficulty concentrating, you see. I struggle to focus on anything. At work, I have to really push myself to stay alert. It’s… worrying, frankly. I pride myself on being capable, on being strong. This… this feels like weakness. I don’t like it. Are we nearly finished? I have a luncheon later.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your daily life, and it's completely understandable that you’re feeling frustrated. We're getting there, Nani. Just a few more questions, and then we can discuss some potential next steps. Have you noticed any changes in your enjoyment of things you used to like, besides your work and cooking?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. I used to love reading, Nigerian literature mostly. Wonderful stories, you see. Now… I can barely get through a page. And I used to enjoy spending time with my grandchildren, playing games, telling them stories. But even that… it feels like an effort. I don’t have the energy, the… enthusiasm. I feel guilty, Doctor. They deserve a happy grandmother, and I… I’m just not it right now. It’s… awful. Truly awful. Can we please be done soon? I really must prepare for this luncheon.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We’re almost finished, Nani. Thank you for being so open with me. Just one final question, and then we’ll talk about options. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or feeling like life isn’t worth living?
PATIENT: Oh… no. No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I would never. I have my faith, you see. And my grandchildren. They need me. I’ve just been… sad. Very, very sad. And tired. It’s… a weight, as I said before. But I would never… think like that. Never. Please, let's finish now. I truly do need to prepare. This luncheon… it’s a charity event. I need to be presentable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Nani. I’m glad to hear that. Okay. Based on what you've told me – the low mood, loss of interest in activities, changes in sleep and appetite, fatigue, and the onset after the divorce – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. It's a very common condition, and it’s important to remember that it is treatable. I’d like to do a brief physical exam just to rule out any other potential causes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… very well. If you think it's necessary. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been to doctors before for various things, and they always poke and prod and it doesn’t change anything. But… if you think it will help, then alright. Let’s just get it over with. Quickly, if possible. I have a timeline to adhere to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. We’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a bit elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Pulse is 72, also within normal limits. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Everything looks clear there as well. Finally, I'll just quickly assess your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Overall, physically, everything appears to be within normal limits. This supports the possibility that your symptoms are related to your mood.
PATIENT: As I suspected. Nothing physically wrong. It’s… what I thought. So, what now, Doctor? Are you going to give me something to… cheer me up? Honestly, I'm not one for dwelling on things. I just want to feel like myself again. And quickly, if you don’t mind. This luncheon… it’s important. It's for the children’s hospital, you see. I need to be strong for them.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. There are a few different options we can consider. Medication, like you mentioned, is one possibility. There are several antidepressants that can be very effective in managing symptoms like yours. However, it’s important to remember that they take time to work, usually several weeks, and finding the right medication and dosage can sometimes involve a bit of trial and error. Another option is therapy, or counseling. Talking to a qualified therapist can help you process your emotions, develop coping mechanisms, and address any underlying issues contributing to your low mood. A combination of both medication and therapy is often the most effective approach. What are your thoughts on these options, Nani?
PATIENT: Therapy… I’ve never been one for talking about my feelings. I prefer to deal with things myself, you see. It's always been my way. And medication… I’m not fond of taking pills if I can avoid it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure I want either one. Is there… nothing else? Some sort of… quick fix? A vitamin, perhaps? I know my daughter swears by Vitamin D. Honestly, I'm just tired of feeling this way. I need to be strong for my grandchildren. This luncheon… it's very important. Can we at least try something less… invasive first?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Nani. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to explore less invasive options first. While a vitamin like Vitamin D can be helpful, especially if you’re deficient, it’s unlikely to be enough to significantly address symptoms of depression. However, we can certainly check your Vitamin D levels to rule out a deficiency. Another thing we could consider is a trial of regular exercise and mindfulness techniques. Studies have shown that both can be very effective in improving mood and reducing stress. Would you be open to trying those things for a few weeks, and then re-evaluating how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Exercise… yes, I suppose I can manage that. I used to swim regularly, before… well, before everything. And mindfulness… I’m not sure what that entails, but I can try. It’s better than taking pills, I suppose. But honestly, Doctor, I don’t have much time for all of this. I have commitments, responsibilities. This luncheon… it's tomorrow, you see. And I need to be presentable. Can you give me something… something to help me sleep tonight? Just something to get me through tomorrow. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. I can prescribe a short course of a mild sleep aid to help you get through tonight. It’s not a long-term solution, but it can help you get some rest before your luncheon tomorrow. I’ll write a prescription for Trazodone 50mg to be taken one hour before bedtime for up to three nights. However, I want to emphasize that this is just a temporary measure. It’s important to address the underlying cause of your sleep difficulties and low mood. I also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in two weeks to re-evaluate your progress and discuss whether medication or therapy might be beneficial. In the meantime, please try to prioritize regular exercise and explore some mindfulness techniques. There are many helpful resources online and in the community. Do you have any questions about the medication or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you. Thank you for listening. I appreciate you not pushing pills on me. I just want to feel like myself again. And I need to be strong for my grandchildren. And this luncheon… it's very important. Is there anything else I need to do? Any forms to fill out? I'm terribly busy, you see.
DOCTOR: No, there are no additional forms to fill out at this time. Just follow the instructions on the prescription for the sleep aid. I’m glad I could help, Nani. And remember, I’m here if you need anything in the future. Don't hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if you're not feeling any improvement, or if your symptoms worsen. Here’s a brochure with some information about mindfulness techniques and local support groups. And please, try to be kind to yourself. It takes time to heal. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must prepare for tomorrow. It's a very important event, you see. I wish you a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nani. It was a pleasure meeting you. And best of luck with your luncheon tomorrow. I hope it goes well. Have a good day as well. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
