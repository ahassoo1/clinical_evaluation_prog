DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Nestingen. It is… a little embarrassing to talk about, but I have been having… much gas. A lot of it. It has been going on for a few weeks now, I think. It is… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Gas, you say. For a few weeks. Hmm. And is it… constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. But… it is more often than not there. Especially after I eat. It’s… not painful, exactly. More… bubbly. And loud, sometimes. I apologize for the details.
DOCTOR: Loud, yes. Well, it’s good you’re being thorough, Mr. Goodstein. It's helpful for me to get the full picture. After eating, you say. What specifically are you eating when this happens?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That is a good question. Let me think… It seems to be worse with… beans, of course. And cabbage. Anything with a lot of… you know, the leafy green parts? And… bread. White bread, mostly. Not so much the whole wheat. I eat a lot of bread. It is… comforting.
DOCTOR: Beans, cabbage, leafy greens…and white bread. Right. And how about dairy?
PATIENT: Dairy? I drink milk with my breakfast, sometimes. And I have yogurt… a few times a week. But… I do not eat much cheese. It doesn’t bother me, I think. Not that I have noticed, anyway. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be. A lot of people have trouble digesting lactose – that’s the sugar in dairy. Now, you said you've noticed it's worse after eating. Is there any bloating with the gas?
PATIENT: Bloating… yes, Doctor. That is a good way to describe it. My stomach… gets bigger. And… tighter. It is not painful, but… uncomfortable. Like a balloon, maybe? Not always after I eat, but… often. Especially with the bread, I think. It is strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… No… not really. I… I have been a little tired lately, but I think that is just… being my age. And… sometimes my stomach makes noises. But I think everyone’s stomach does that? No pain, no… nothing else comes to mind. Is this… bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Goodstein, it doesn't sound like anything immediately alarming, but we need to rule a few things out. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then I’ll order some basic bloodwork. Just to be thorough, you understand. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Thorough is good. I… I can lie down, yes. Just tell me what to do. I will cooperate. Is there anything I need to… prepare for?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just lie flat on your back. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll feel around gently. Just to check for any tenderness or… unusual masses. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. You may proceed whenever you are ready. I will try to remain still.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm hearing some…active bowel sounds, which isn't surprising given your symptoms. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels painful. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… not painful. Just… pressure, I suppose. Like when you… push on my belly. Not… unpleasant, just… noticeable. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: No significant tenderness, which is good. Some mild distension, but that's likely related to the gas. I don't feel any masses. Alright. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. However, we need to rule out other possibilities with some bloodwork. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a celiac disease panel.
PATIENT: IBS… Is that… serious, Doctor? I have heard that name before, but I do not know what it means. And… celiac? Is that related to the… belly? Bloodwork… that sounds… official. Will it be… painful?
DOCTOR: IBS isn't serious in the sense that it's life-threatening, Mr. Goodstein. It's a chronic condition that affects the digestive system, causing symptoms like gas, bloating, and abdominal discomfort. It’s often managed with diet and lifestyle changes. As for celiac disease, it’s an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, which can also cause digestive issues. The bloodwork will help us rule it out. And no, the bloodwork itself isn’t painful. It’s just a simple blood draw. I’ll have the lab technician take a sample. It will only take a few minutes. Then we'll get the results back in a few days, and we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any allergies to latex or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies to latex, or anything else that I know of. That is… good to hear. So, just a blood draw, then we wait? I can do that. Will I need to… prepare for the blood draw? Fasting, perhaps? Or… is there anything I should avoid eating before?
DOCTOR: No, no fasting is required for this blood draw. You can eat and drink as usual. I’ll give you a lab requisition form with instructions, but it’s fairly straightforward. I’ll also give you some information about IBS to read in the meantime. Now, while we’re waiting for the results, I recommend keeping a food diary. Write down everything you eat and drink, and note when you experience symptoms. That will help us identify any potential triggers. Do you understand everything I’ve explained?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. A food diary… write down what I eat and when I… have the gas. And wait for the blood test results. IBS… and celiac. I will try to… remember everything. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very… thorough. I think… I think that is all I need to know for now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Goodstein. The lab is just down the hall. Once they've taken your blood, you're free to go. I’ll have my assistant contact you when the results are available. If your symptoms worsen significantly before then, or you develop a fever, seek immediate medical attention. .
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will remember. Thank you again. .
