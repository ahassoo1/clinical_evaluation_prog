DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's August 2nd, and I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. Well, it’s these… bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, and they’re really bothering me. Red and kinda painful, you know? Been there for a little while now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Bumps on your shins that are red and painful. Let's get a better understanding of this. When did you first notice these bumps appearing, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it was probably… oh, maybe a couple of months ago? Hard to say exactly. It started with just one or two, and I didn’t really pay much attention. Then more kept showing up, and they started to hurt more. Now… well, you see them.
DOCTOR: I see. So, they've progressively worsened over the past couple of months. Have you noticed anything that specifically triggers them or makes them feel better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Honestly, I don’t think so. I haven’t noticed anything specific. I do a lot of walking at work, moving things around, you know? But I've been doing that for years, and this is new. They just… ache sometimes. Especially after I've been on my feet all day. Nothing makes them better, really. Maybe resting helps a little, but not much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are these bumps accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… not really. No fever, no itching. They don’t feel hot or anything. Just… painful. Sometimes my legs feel a little tired, but that's probably just from work. No swelling, either. Just these red bumps. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, it's not necessarily bad that there aren't other symptoms – it helps us narrow down the possibilities. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a while back, but the doctor put me on some medicine, and it's been okay since then. Been taking it regularly. Other than that… nothing much. I'm a pretty healthy guy, usually. I try to eat okay, you know, mostly Filipino food. And I've got Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And what medications are you currently taking for that high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s a small white pill. I think… yes, it’s Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. Been taking it for, oh, maybe five years now? The doctor told me not to stop taking it, even if I feel okay. And I haven't! I'm good about my medicine.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine the doctor has given me before. No allergies to pollen or dust or anything like that, either. I think my wife would know if I had allergies! She's always watching out for me.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Mr. Aluia. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or skin problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, but she passed away a long time ago. My father had heart problems, too. He had to be careful with his diet. And… my sister has some kind of skin condition, but I don't really know much about it. She gets rashes sometimes, but it doesn’t look like these bumps. It’s more… all over her body. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is helpful information, Mr. Aluia. Knowing about the family history helps us to consider potential causes. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean by that, Doctor? Like… do you want to know if I smoke or drink? I don’t smoke, never have. And I only drink a little bit of beer sometimes, with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing much. I mostly just work and spend time with my wife. We like to watch TV.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Aluia. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination of your legs to get a better look at these bumps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Go ahead. Just let me know if it hurts, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The bumps are approximately 0.5 to 1 centimeter in diameter, erythematous – meaning red – and slightly raised. They appear firm to the touch and are located primarily on the anterior – front – aspect of your shins. There is no significant warmth or swelling at this time. I’m also noting no broken skin or ulceration. Based on my examination, and considering your history, these appear to be consistent with shin splints, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome, or potentially some form of dermatitis. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a complete blood count, and possibly a skin biopsy, if these don't improve with conservative treatment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Shin splints? I've never heard of that. And a skin biopsy… is that going to hurt? I mean, I work on my feet all day, like you said, but I don't run or anything. And if it's just shin splints, is it serious? Will I have to stop working? I don't want to lose my job. I'm not sure I want a biopsy if it's not too bad…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Aluia. Shin splints are caused by overuse or repetitive stress on the shin bone, and as you mentioned, running is a common cause, but not the only cause. Prolonged standing or walking, particularly on hard surfaces, can certainly contribute. They're generally not serious, but they can be quite painful and debilitating if left untreated. A skin biopsy involves taking a small sample of skin to examine under a microscope, and while there is some mild discomfort involved, it is usually well-tolerated. It will help us rule out other conditions, such as vasculitis or dermatitis, which could require different treatment. We can start with conservative treatment first – rest, ice, compression, and elevation – and see if that improves your symptoms. I’ll also recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. If your symptoms persist after a week or two, then we can discuss the possibility of a skin biopsy. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… better. Rest, ice, and those pills… I can try that. I don't want a biopsy right away. A week or two… yeah, that’s good. What kind of pills are we talking about? And how often should I put ice on them? And will these pills interact with my blood pressure medicine? I need to make sure. My wife will worry if I start taking new pills.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll start with a conservative approach. The pills I’m referring to are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen or naproxen. Ibuprofen, for example, is typically taken 200-400 milligrams every 4-6 hours as needed for pain. Naproxen is usually 220-440 milligrams initially, then 220 milligrams every 8-12 hours. Regarding your blood pressure medication, Lisinopril, there is a potential for interaction with NSAIDs, although it’s generally mild. NSAIDs can sometimes reduce the effectiveness of Lisinopril, so it's important to monitor your blood pressure closely if you start taking them. I will write you a prescription for Ibuprofen, and I recommend checking your blood pressure daily and informing your wife of any changes. If your blood pressure increases significantly, we may need to adjust your Lisinopril dosage. As for the ice, apply it to your shins for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, especially after you’ve been on your feet for a long period. Wrap the ice pack in a towel to protect your skin. I’ll also provide you with a handout detailing these instructions and potential side effects. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s a lot to remember… but I think I can do it. Check my blood pressure, ice packs, and those Ibuprofen pills… And tell my wife. Got it. I think… I think I understand. So, if the pills and ice don't help after a couple of weeks, then we talk about the skin biopsy? And you'll write all this down for me? That would be a big help. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Precisely. If the pain persists after two weeks of conservative treatment, then we will reassess and discuss the possibility of a skin biopsy to determine the underlying cause. And yes, absolutely. I'll write down all these instructions for you, including the dosage of the Ibuprofen, the ice pack application guidelines, the importance of monitoring your blood pressure, and a brief explanation of shin splints. I’ll also include my contact information should you have any questions or concerns. Here you go. This handout provides a detailed summary of our discussion, and this is the prescription for Ibuprofen. Please let your wife know about the medication and the importance of monitoring your blood pressure. Do you have any questions before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for not rushing me. I’ll try the pills and ice, and I’ll keep an eye on my blood pressure. And if it doesn’t get better… well, I know what to do. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day as well.
