DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I just want to get this sorted. A friend – a good friend – suggested I look into something to, well, help prevent… things. She called it PrEP. I don't really understand it all, but she said it's good to know about, especially for someone like me. I'm single, you know? And… things happen. I just want to be careful.
DOCTOR: PrEP. Right. Preventative measures. While I commend your… foresight, Ms. Trefren, it's often the case that these… trends… are overblown. Nevertheless, let's cover the basics, shall we?
PATIENT: Trends? Look, Doctor, it’s not a trend to me. It’s about being responsible. And my friend… she’s a nurse, actually. A very good one. She explained it helps if… if you’re worried about getting something. I don’t need a lecture, I just want to know if it’s right for me. What does it even do? And are there… side effects? I'm 55, not a spring chicken. Medicare covers this, right?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's not dwell on the… origins of your inquiry. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, involves taking a daily medication to reduce your risk of contracting certain… infections. It’s primarily focused on sexually transmitted diseases. As for side effects, naturally there are some. Nausea, fatigue, headaches... the usual. Though, in a woman of your… age, we must be particularly cautious. As for Medicare coverage, that can be complicated. We’ll need to verify your specific plan details. Now, before we proceed further, let's get a thorough medical history. Have you been sexually active recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Hmm… that’s… personal. But yes, I have been. A few dates in the last six months. Nothing serious. I haven't had any… problems, if that’s what you're asking. No infections, no unusual symptoms. Just… dating. I mostly meet people online, if that matters. And I always use protection. But my friend said PrEP is extra, you know? A backup. Does that make sense? I just want to be safe. Is that so bad?
DOCTOR: “Extra” measures are often indicative of… underlying anxieties, Ms. Trefren. However, we are here to address your concerns, not your emotional state. Now, let’s move beyond “dates.” Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not once. I’ve been careful my whole life, honestly. My mother… she raised me to be very cautious. And I've always gotten tested when I've… changed partners. I’m very particular about that. I can even tell you the dates of my last three tests, if you want. July 14th, 2023, February 8th, 2024, and… let me think… April 21st, 2025. All clear, every time. I have the results at home, if needed. This whole thing feels… unnecessary, but I'm here, aren't I?
DOCTOR: Frequent testing… admirable, if somewhat… excessive. Nevertheless, let’s establish a broader medical context. Do you have any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing chronic. High blood pressure, maybe, a little. But my doctor has it under control with a small pill. Nothing else. No diabetes, no heart problems, no… anything serious. I’m pretty healthy for my age, actually. I walk every morning, I eat reasonably well… I'm not a saint, but I take care of myself. Really. I just… I want to be sure about this PrEP thing. Is it going to interact with my blood pressure medicine, you think? That's what I'm worried about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Trefren. Let me review your electronic health record. Height and weight are… noted. 192 centimeters and 104 kilograms. That places you in the… overweight category. And your insurance is Medicare, as stated. Now, let’s see… blood pressure medication – Lisinopril, 10mg daily. Yes, we need to be cautious about potential drug interactions. Now, for the sake of completeness, have you ever had a hepatitis B vaccination?
PATIENT: Hepatitis B? Oh… let me think. I had a lot of vaccinations growing up, back in… Palestine. But I don't remember specifics. Probably not, actually. Not specifically for hepatitis B. I went to the doctor regularly, but it was a long time ago, and honestly, the records aren't great. I've never been tested for it, either. I mean, I've had some blood tests, but I don't know what they tested for. Is that important? Is this going to take all day? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: "Not important?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like you're judging me. I came here to ask about a preventative measure, not have my entire medical history dissected. I’m 55 years old, I'm trying to be responsible, and I'm getting the third degree! I'm happy to answer your questions, but I don't appreciate the tone. Is the vaccine essential for PrEP? If not, can we just move on? I'm a bit flustered, to be honest. And yes, I understand it's important, but I just want to know if I need it, specifically.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Trefren. Let's proceed with the assumption that you have not received the hepatitis B vaccination. It is strongly recommended before initiating PrEP, as co-infection can complicate matters. Now, to be absolutely thorough… do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years – antibiotics, painkillers, even strong allergy medicine when I have a cold. Never had a reaction. I'm pretty sure. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like this whole process is more trouble than it's worth. Is there a simpler way to figure out if PrEP is right for me? Can we just do a blood test? I'm starting to get a headache. Really.
DOCTOR: A blood test will be necessary regardless, Ms. Trefren. It’s standard procedure to assess your kidney function and screen for HIV before starting PrEP. However, that won't address the complete picture. Now, one final question, and I assure you, it is critical: Have you ever shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Needles? Absolutely not! Doctor, are you serious? Where is this even going? I am a… a respectable woman! I have never shared needles with anyone in my life! That is… offensive, frankly. I came here for a preventative measure, not an interrogation about… about that. This is ridiculous. I think I want to stop this consultation right now. I'm getting very upset. Just... forget it. I’ll talk to someone else.
