DOCTOR: Good morning, Edric. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Muscle weakness, mostly. It’s… hard to explain exactly when it started, but it’s been getting worse the last few weeks. It feels like I just don't have the strength I used to, you know? Especially in my arms and legs. It makes things difficult with work, lifting things and all.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle weakness… and you said it's been progressively worsening over the last few weeks. Primarily in your arms and legs. And it’s impacting your ability to lift things at work. Can you tell me a bit more about how it’s impacting your work specifically?
PATIENT: Well, I'm an auto damage appraiser, so I'm always looking at cars, climbing around, under hoods, things like that. It used to be no problem. Now… I have to ask other guys to help me lift parts, get under vehicles. It’s embarrassing, honestly. Makes me look… slow. And it takes longer to do inspections, which, you know, isn't good for business. I’m having trouble even holding my camera steady sometimes to take pictures of the damage. It's little things, but they add up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s affecting your ability to do your job – lifting, climbing, even holding your camera steady. That’s helpful to know. Has this weakness been sudden in onset, or has it been a gradual decline?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. It wasn't like I woke up one day and couldn't lift anything. It's been… slowly getting harder and harder. At first, I just thought I was tired, or maybe not getting enough sleep. But it’s not going away, and it keeps… you know, getting a little worse each week. I don't recall any specific injury or anything that triggered it.
DOCTOR: Alright, gradual onset, no specific injury… And you mentioned fatigue as well. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. No fever, no pain, no numbness. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, like I said, but that could just be the heat, honestly. It’s been pretty hot lately. I haven’t noticed anything else unusual, just the weakness and feeling a bit worn out. I sleep okay, I guess. I wouldn’t say great, but okay.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, no pain, no numbness, just weakness and fatigue. You said your sleep is “okay.” Do you have any difficulty falling asleep, or staying asleep?
PATIENT: No, not really. I usually fall asleep pretty quickly. It’s more… I wake up feeling like I didn’t sleep well, even if I got eight hours. Not restless or anything, just… not refreshed. And sometimes I’ll wake up once or twice during the night, but it's usually just to use the bathroom, then I fall right back asleep. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty with restorative sleep, despite getting an adequate amount. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. Had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. But no serious illnesses or anything I've been treated for as an adult. I haven't seen a doctor in… probably five or six years, maybe more? Just for check-ups. I usually just avoid them if I can. No surgeries, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical conditions, no surgeries. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my mom had… arthritis, I think it was. She had a lot of joint pain. But other than that, nothing major that I recall. No heart disease, no diabetes, no neurological issues, as far as I know. I wasn't really close to a lot of my family, so I don’t know a whole lot about their medical history, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your mother. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. I’ll have a beer occasionally with dinner, maybe once or twice a week, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t do any drugs. Never have, never will. I stay pretty busy with work, mostly. Don’t really have time for that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no drugs. And you're busy with work. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just… nothing. I’ll take an aspirin if I have a headache, but that’s about it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing regular. I figure if I'm eating okay and getting enough rest, that’s good enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. And you mentioned you've been feeling fatigued. Are you experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Hmm… I guess my appetite hasn’t been great lately. Not terrible, but not as much as usual. And I think I’ve lost a little bit of weight, maybe five or ten pounds? It's hard to say for sure, I haven’t actually weighed myself. But my clothes feel a little looser, if that makes sense. I haven’t been pushing myself to eat, I guess. Just haven’t been very hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some unintentional weight loss. Alright, Edric, I'm going to do a quick physical exam now. I’ll check your strength, reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we'll decide what, if any, further tests we need to do. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good, Doctor. Let’s get it done. I just want to figure out what’s going on. The sooner the better, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels… a little harder than it used to. I’m trying, but it doesn’t feel as strong as it once did. I used to be able to really crush a handshake, you know? Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the other hand… Okay. And now, can you push against my hands with your legs?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… harder than it should be. My right leg feels… weaker than the left. I'm trying to push as hard as I can, but it’s just not the same. I feel like I’m straining just to do it. This is… concerning, honestly. I haven't felt this weak before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the other leg. Okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear. No obvious swelling or tenderness. Okay, Edric. Based on this quick exam, you do have some noticeable weakness in your arms and legs, more pronounced on your right side. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not dramatically so. This weakness, combined with your fatigue, decreased appetite, and unintentional weight loss, is something we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel, to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also want to order a Vitamin D level, as deficiency can sometimes cause muscle weakness and fatigue. We might also consider a creatine kinase level, which can indicate muscle damage.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Blood tests, Vitamin D, creatine… whatever that is. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. When will I get the results? And… will I need to come back for more tests after that?
DOCTOR: The results should be back in about 3-5 business days. The lab will notify me when they’re available. Once I have those results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. Depending on the results, we might need to consider further imaging, like an MRI, or a referral to a neurologist. It’s too early to say for sure right now. Here’s the requisition for the blood tests. You can get these done at [Name of local lab]. In the meantime, I recommend trying to get as much rest as possible, and eating a balanced diet, even if you don't have much of an appetite. And please, if your weakness gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms – like difficulty breathing, or numbness or tingling – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Emergency room if it gets worse… got it. Three to five days for the results… okay. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Doctor. It’s been worrying me. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Thank you. I’ll go get these done tomorrow. .
DOCTOR: Okay. You're welcome, Edric. We'll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day. .
