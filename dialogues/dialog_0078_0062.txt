DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s good to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Solero. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today regarding a matter with my work. I am a Protective Service Worker, and we’ve recently been asked to wear masks consistently, and… well, I’m having a difficult time with that. I was hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're seeking a medical exemption from the mask requirement at work due to difficulties wearing one. That’s perfectly reasonable to discuss. To help me determine if an exemption is appropriate, could you tell me more about what difficulties you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. It isn't a simple dislike, I assure you. It feels… constricting. A tightness in my chest, a bit of shortness of breath, and a… a rising panic, almost. It's not constant, but it happens frequently enough that it interferes with my ability to do my job effectively, and safely. I need to be able to think clearly, and react quickly, and the mask makes that hard. It feels like… it's cutting off my air, even though I know logically it isn’t.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you’re experiencing some anxiety-related symptoms when wearing the mask – the tightness in your chest, shortness of breath, and panic. It’s good you recognize it’s not a physical blockage, but the feeling is very real and impacting your work. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety, panic disorder, or any other mental health condition?
PATIENT: That is a very good question, Doctor. No, I haven't been formally diagnosed with anything of that nature. I’ve always been a… a fairly stoic person, if you understand. I don't often complain, and I tend to work through things on my own. This… this feeling is new, though. It started with the mask requirement, so I figured it was best to get it checked out. My family… well, we don’t have much of a history of going to doctors, to be honest. We handle things… differently.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Knabenshue. It’s not uncommon for people to put off seeking medical attention, and it sounds like that’s been the case for you and your family. And it's good you're addressing this now that it's impacting your ability to work. Since this started with the mask requirement, and you haven’t had a previous diagnosis, we’ll want to rule out any underlying physical causes for your symptoms. Have you ever had any issues with asthma, COPD, or other respiratory conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. My lungs have always been strong. I spent a great deal of my youth outdoors, running and… well, being a boy. I've never had any trouble breathing until this mask situation. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. I eat well, I exercise when I can, and I don’t smoke or drink. I just… I don’t understand why this is happening. It’s frustrating, and a little frightening, to feel like something is wrong with me when I’ve always been so solid.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of that, Mr. Knabenshue. It is frustrating when something new arises, especially when you’ve always been healthy. It sounds like we’re dealing with something triggered by the mask, and less likely to be a pre-existing condition. To get a better understanding, could you describe exactly when these symptoms occur while wearing the mask?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It usually begins within a few minutes of putting the mask on. A slight pressure around my nose and mouth, and then… a tightening in my chest. The breathing doesn’t necessarily feel difficult, but it feels… restricted. Like there isn’t enough air, even when I take deep breaths. Then the panic starts to creep in. A rising sense of unease, a racing heart, and a feeling like I need to get the mask off immediately. It’s worse in enclosed spaces, naturally. And if I’m under stress – a difficult case at work, for example – it happens much faster, and is much more severe.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. It sounds like the symptoms are definitely related to the mask, and exacerbated by stress and enclosed spaces. It’s consistent with a possible anxiety response, specifically claustrophobia or panic related to the sensation of being restricted. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment. I understand the need to rule out other possibilities. Please, proceed. I'll do my best to remain calm, even though… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat on the table, we'll start with listening to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths through your mouth for me, please. In… and out… good. Again… and out… Lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackling that would indicate any obstruction. Blood pressure is 130/80, heart rate is 78, regular rhythm. Neurological assessment is normal as well. Everything appears physically normal. Given the physical exam findings, and your description of the symptoms, it’s most likely that you're experiencing anxiety-related symptoms triggered by the mask. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you, Mr. Knabenshue, but it does mean we need to address the anxiety.
PATIENT: I see, Doctor. That… that makes a certain amount of sense, I suppose. It’s just… unsettling, to have something cause this reaction. I’ve never felt this way before. What does addressing the anxiety entail? Are there… medications involved? I’m not particularly fond of taking pills, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about medication, Mr. Knabenshue, and we can absolutely explore non-medication options first. There are several approaches we can take. One option is talk therapy, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. This can help you identify and manage the thoughts and feelings that are triggering your anxiety. Another is relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises and mindfulness. We can also discuss strategies for gradually exposing yourself to the mask in a controlled environment, to help desensitize you to the sensation. Medication is an option, but it's not the first line of defense. If the therapy and relaxation techniques aren’t enough, we can consider a low-dose anti-anxiety medication to help manage the symptoms, especially during stressful situations. To determine the best course of action, I'd like to ask a few more questions. Have you ever experienced significant stress in your life – work related, personal, or otherwise?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you outlining the options like that. Therapy… I suppose I could consider that. I've always been a private person, but… I suppose talking about it couldn’t hurt. As for significant stress… yes, I’ve had my share. My work is demanding, to say the least. Dealing with difficult cases, protecting vulnerable people… it takes a toll. And… well, I lost my wife a few years back. That was… difficult. Very difficult. I managed, of course. One does what one must. But it left a… a hollowness.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, I am very sorry to hear about your wife. Losing someone close to you is incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable that it would leave a lasting impact. And your work sounds emotionally taxing as well. It's not surprising that you're experiencing anxiety, given everything you’ve been through. Given your history, and the severity of your symptoms, I think a referral to a therapist specializing in grief and trauma would be very beneficial. They can provide you with a safe space to process your emotions, and develop coping mechanisms to manage your anxiety. Would you be open to me providing you with a list of therapists in the area?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be… very helpful. A list of therapists would be greatly appreciated. I’ve… avoided seeking help for so long, I don’t even know where to begin. And if they specialize in grief… that sounds particularly relevant. Perhaps… perhaps talking about it will make a difference.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here you go. This list includes several therapists in the area who specialize in grief and trauma. I’ve included their contact information, as well as a brief description of their approach. As for the mask exemption, given your symptoms and the recommendation for therapy, I’m comfortable writing a note to your employer stating that you have a medical condition that makes wearing a mask difficult, and recommending accommodations to ensure your safety and well-being. We can discuss specific accommodations – such as working remotely when possible, or using a face shield instead of a mask – once you’ve spoken with a therapist. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect, Doctor. A note to my employer would be incredibly helpful, and the suggestions for accommodations are much appreciated. Knowing I have some options… it eases my mind considerably. Thank you, Doctor Solero. You’ve been very understanding, and… reassuring. I truly appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. It was my pleasure. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Here's a copy of the note for your employer. And one for your records. I wish you all the best, and I hope you find the therapy helpful. Take care, and have a good day. .
