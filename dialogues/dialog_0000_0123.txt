DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cassimatis. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Batara. Well, it's my skin. It's been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It's all over, not just one spot.
DOCTOR: "All over," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, all over. My arms, my legs… even my back. It’s hard to reach, so my daughter has to help me with lotion sometimes. It's not… like a rash, really. No bumps or anything. Just… incredibly itchy. It's worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long has this "incredible itch" been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started a few weeks ago, maybe a month? It wasn't bad at first, just a little annoying. But it’s gotten steadily worse. I figured it was just the heat, honestly. It has been a hot summer. But it’s not getting better, and now it's really bothering me.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And have you tried any different lotions or creams?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Lots! My daughter, she’s a very practical girl, brought over all sorts of things. Eucerin, Aveeno… that one with the oatmeal, it helped a little, but not for long. And a regular moisturizer, you know, the kind for dry skin. Nothing seems to really stop it, it just… takes the edge off for a bit. It always comes back. I even tried some of that anti-itch cream, the one with the menthol, but that didn’t do much either. It smells nice, though!
DOCTOR: Menthol… right. And do you have any other symptoms alongside the itching?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think. No, not really. I haven’t noticed any… spots, or blisters, or anything like that. No fever, no tiredness… I feel fine, other than the itching! It’s just… so distracting. And sometimes, it feels… almost like a burning sensation, you know? Not a bad burn, just a little… prickly. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: "Prickly," you say. Hmm. And have you changed anything in your routine lately?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me see… Well, I started taking a new vitamin. My friend, Elena, she swears by it for her joints, so I thought I'd give it a try. It’s one of those multi-vitamins with all sorts of things in it. And… oh! I switched laundry detergents too. I used to use the one with the floral scent, but it was getting expensive, so I switched to a cheaper brand. It's unscented, I think. Could that be it? I wouldn’t know where to start figuring it all out. It’s just… a lot of little things.
DOCTOR: Unscented detergent… vitamins… Frankly, Mrs. Cassimatis, it sounds like you're trying everything but seeing a doctor. Let's do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, I am seeing a doctor now! That's why I'm here, isn’t it? I just thought I’d mention everything I've tried, in case it helped you figure it out. I don't like to bother people unless I have to, you know? But yes, an exam sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to stop itching. It's driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cassimatis. Just lie down on the table. We'll take a look. Please, remove your sweater and let's see the extent of this “itchiness.”
PATIENT: Okay, okay. It's mostly on my arms and back, like I said. And my legs, a little bit. It’s hard to see, though, it’s just… dry skin, mostly. It doesn’t look bad, that’s why I hesitated to come in, I guess. I didn’t want to bother you with something silly. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything.
DOCTOR: Hm. Yes, the skin is rather dry. Some excoriation consistent with scratching, but no obvious rash or lesions. A few small areas of dryness here as well. Your weight is noted as 90 kilograms, which is… substantial. Do you have any difficulty with mobility?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, I know I've put on some weight, Doctor. It’s been hard with… well, with everything. My divorce, you know? It just… takes away your appetite, then you comfort yourself with food. It’s a vicious cycle! And no, I don't have trouble moving, not really. I walk every day, well, almost every day. It’s just… harder now, with the heat. And the itching, of course. It distracts me. Is my weight causing the itching, do you think?
DOCTOR: It's certainly a contributing factor, Mrs. Cassimatis. Obesity can lead to a number of dermatological issues. We’ll need to discuss your diet and exercise regimen. For now, I’m going to prescribe a stronger topical steroid cream. Use it twice daily for two weeks. If that doesn’t improve things, we may need to consider a referral to dermatology. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh. Topical steroid cream… okay. I haven't used anything like that before. No, I don't think I have any allergies, no. My daughter always checks for that when she buys me over-the-counter things. She's very careful. But… what if it doesn’t work? Is it safe to use? I don’t want to make things worse. And a referral to dermatology… that sounds expensive. I don’t have insurance, you see. It’s… complicated.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Cassimatis, I understand your concerns, but we need to address the itching. The cream is relatively mild, but prolonged use can have side effects. That’s why it's important to follow the instructions carefully. As for the dermatology referral, we can discuss options for low-cost clinics if the cream doesn't help. Now, let’s review your current medications. Are you taking anything else besides the multi-vitamin?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Okay, I’ll try to follow the instructions carefully. Let me see… besides the vitamin… Well, I take a little bit of medication for my blood pressure. It's… losartan, I think. My doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take some ibuprofen. But I don’t take it very often, just when I really need to. It’s over-the-counter, the regular kind. Oh, and sometimes I take a little bit of something for sleep. Just when I can't sleep at all, you know? It’s… diphenhydramine, I think. My daughter bought it for me. Could any of those be causing the itching too? It’s all so confusing!
DOCTOR: Diphenhydramine… that could very well be the culprit, Mrs. Cassimatis. Antihistamines, particularly first-generation ones like diphenhydramine, are known to cause itching in some individuals. I strongly recommend you discontinue the diphenhydramine immediately. See if that alleviates the itching before resorting to stronger medications or expensive referrals. We'll monitor your blood pressure and arthritis separately. Now, let’s get you a prescription for the topical steroid cream.
PATIENT: Oh! Well, that’s… good to know. I’ll stop taking it right away. I didn’t even think about that. My daughter said it helped me sleep, but if it’s causing the itching… yes, I’ll stop. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel much better. So, I just need to try the cream and see if that helps? And I don’t need to worry about the dermatology referral right now? That’s a relief. It’s… expensive, you know?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mrs. Cassimatis. Try the cream as directed. If there's no improvement within two weeks, then we can discuss referral options. And please, avoid self-treating with diphenhydramine. It’s clearly not helping your situation. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you very much, Doctor Batara. I really appreciate your help. I’ll stop the diphenhydramine right away and try the cream. I hope it works. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. You're dismissed. .
