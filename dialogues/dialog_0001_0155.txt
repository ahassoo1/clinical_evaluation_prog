DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik, good to see you... or, well, to have you here. Look, I'm Dr. Pehrson. Let’s just get right to it, okay?
PATIENT: Right, right. Doctor. Yes. Getting right to it is... good. Fine. Tremor, you said? It's just... my hands. Shake a bit. Been happening… well, a while now, I suppose. Not sure exactly how long. Everything feels a bit hazy these days.
DOCTOR: Hazy, okay. And it's just your hands?
PATIENT: Mostly. Though... sometimes feels like everything inside is shaking, too. A little bit. But it's harder to say. It comes and goes. Don't remember when it started, like I said. Was married, a long time ago... divorced now. That’s not… relevant, is it? Just trying to… fill in the blanks, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. Divorced. Look, Mr. Jezik, we don't need your life story, just the medical stuff. So, this "shaking inside"... is that with activity?
PATIENT: Activity? Hmm... not sure. I used to... work with water, you know? At the plant. Big pipes, everything. But that was... ages ago. Now I mostly just sit. Maybe it's worse when I try to do something? Like… button my coat, or eat soup. It's hard to say. My memory isn't what it used to be. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if it's something serious. Is it… dangerous?
DOCTOR: Well, everything is dangerous, Mr. Jezik. Look, let's do a quick exam, okay?
PATIENT: Exam? Fine. Quick is good. I don’t like… fuss. Just tell me what you need me to do. Is it going to take long? I have… things to get back to. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: Just sit here. I'll check your reflexes, coordination, things like that. Relax your hands… please. And try to stay still. This won’t be a whole ordeal. Just let me see what's going on. Okay, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes. I can follow it. It's a bit… difficult to be perfectly still, Doctor. My hands... they have a mind of their own sometimes. Not a good mind, mind you. Just… shaky. Is that what you're looking for? The shaking? It seems to be worse now that you're… looking at them.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I see the tremor. And it is more pronounced when I’m examining you, noted. Okay, now clench your fists tightly... then release. Do that a few times. Quickly.
PATIENT: Like this? Is that…fast enough? It feels… strained, Doctor. Like I'm trying to squeeze something very hard. Used to have strong hands… fixing things at the plant. Now… not so much. It’s… tiring. Is something wrong? You’re quiet. Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: Look, I haven't diagnosed anything yet, Mr. Jezik. It could be a lot of things. Could be nothing. Could be… well, we'll see. Any history of this in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Hmm. That's… a good question. My mother… she was a strong woman, always busy. Don’t remember her shaking, not really. My father… he left when I was young. Never knew him well. So, no. Not that I recall. My wife… she had… other problems. Not this. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep track of family medical history. It’s all… very hazy. Is this important? Will knowing about my mother help you fix my hands? Because that's all I really care about.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Jezik. I'm going to be blunt. It sounds like you may have essential tremor. It’s common, especially at your age. It doesn’t usually indicate anything serious, but it can be… bothersome. We can try some medication to help manage the shaking, but it won’t cure it. I can write you a prescription.
PATIENT: Medication… Okay. Fine. If it helps the shaking. Less shaking would be… good. Doesn’t cure it? So it will… just keep getting worse? And what about the feeling inside? Is that part of this “essential tremor”? I just… I want to be able to eat a bowl of soup without making a mess, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? And… how much will this medication cost? I don’t have… good insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, look. The medication is propranolol. It’s a beta-blocker, used for high blood pressure and anxiety, among other things. The "feeling inside" could be related, anxiety often accompanies tremor. As for cost... I don't know exactly. It varies. You'll have to ask the pharmacist. There are generics available, which are cheaper. Here. This should help. Take it as directed. And honestly, try to relax. Stress will only make it worse. Next patient.
PATIENT: Relax… Right. Easy for you to say. Anxiety… Well, who isn’t anxious these days? Stress… Yes. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I’ll… ask the pharmacist about the cost. Is there… anything else I should be worried about? Anything at all? No? Alright then. Thank you. .
