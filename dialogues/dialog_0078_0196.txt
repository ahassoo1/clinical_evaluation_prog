DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. It’s…nice to meet you too, Doctor. Um…well, I’m just…so tired. Always tired. That’s why I’m here, I think. It’s been going on for…a long time now. Honestly, I can’t even remember exactly when it started. It just…is.
DOCTOR: I see. Constant fatigue can be really disruptive to your life, and it’s good you’re addressing it. It's not unusual for that feeling to creep up gradually, so not remembering a specific start date isn't uncommon. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More about it… Well, it’s not just feeling sleepy, you know? It’s…everything feels heavy. Like I’m pushing through mud all the time. Even just getting out of a chair is…a lot. And it doesn’t matter how much I sleep, it doesn’t help. I used to be…more energetic, I guess. Before…well, never mind. It’s just…constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy” and requiring a lot of effort, even with adequate sleep… that’s helpful. It sounds like it's impacting your daily life significantly. You mentioned you used to be more energetic. Has anything changed recently that you can think of that might have coincided with this feeling starting or getting worse?
PATIENT: Coincided… Oh, goodness. Changes… let me think. My husband… he passed away a few years ago now. That was a big change. Everything changed after that, really. But…I don’t know if that’s what caused this tiredness. It just…feels like it’s always been there, getting worse slowly. It’s hard to say. I take Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Licano. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and grief can certainly have a long-lasting impact on both emotional and physical well-being. It absolutely can contribute to feelings of fatigue. Medicare is noted, thank you. To help me rule out other potential causes, I’d like to ask some further questions, if that's alright with you. We’ll go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re currently being treated for?
PATIENT: Other conditions… Hmm. Let me see. The doctor told me a while back I have a little bit of…arthritis, I think? In my hands mostly. It doesn’t bother me too much, honestly. I take something for it, but I can’t remember what it’s called. And… I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was… unpleasant. Other than that… not really. I think that’s it. It all feels so long ago, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand – it can be hard to recall things from the past. Arthritis and a previous gallbladder removal are noted. And it's good to know the arthritis isn't currently causing you significant trouble. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements, for anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, let’s see. For the arthritis, I take… this little white pill. I think it’s…naproxen? Yes, that’s it, naproxen. And sometimes, when my stomach bothers me, I take something for that. Tums, I think. Just when I need them. That’s about it, really. I don't take anything regularly, except the naproxen.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen for arthritis and occasional Tums as needed. Thank you. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I haven’t had any…reactions, ever, as far as I can remember. I used to get a rash sometimes when I was a little girl, but I don’t think that was an allergy. Just…childhood things. I'm pretty sure I'm not allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s…tricky. My mother…she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father…he had something with his heart, but I don’t remember exactly what. They’re both gone now, you see. I had a brother, but…we weren’t very close. I don't really know much about his health, to be honest. It's all a bit…fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I understand; it's common to not have a complete picture of family medical history. High blood pressure in your mother and some sort of heart condition in your father are noted. Now, just to get a better sense of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I live alone now, you see. I don't really do much. I used to enjoy gardening, but it's hard to get around these days. I mostly just…watch television. And I try to eat healthy, but… sometimes I just don't have the energy to cook. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink. I try to take walks when the weather is nice, but it's not very often. It’s…a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Licano. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and you're navigating a quiet life right now. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your symptoms to get a more detailed picture of what you're experiencing. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, sometimes I feel a little dizzy, especially when I stand up too quickly. And my muscles ache a bit, all over. Not just from gardening, but just…generally. And… I’ve been having trouble sleeping, even though I’m always tired. It’s strange, isn’t it? I feel exhausted all the time, but when I finally get to bed, I just lie there. Sometimes my memory is bad too... like I told you.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is a lot to consider. Dizziness, muscle aches, trouble sleeping despite fatigue, and some memory difficulties… thank you for sharing those details. To help me get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief neurological assessment. It's fairly standard. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Alright. That’s…fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel…better, you know? So yes, go ahead. I hope it doesn't take too long, though. I have…things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Licano. We'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. Okay, everything seems within normal limits, but your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your reflexes are a bit diminished. Your coordination is also a little slow, which could be related to the fatigue. I'd like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what might be going on. These tests will check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and some other basic metabolic markers. Do you have any preferences for where you'd like the blood drawn?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Oh dear. I don't really like needles, Doctor. But if you think it's necessary… There's a lab just down the street, isn't there? The one near the pharmacy? That would be…convenient, I suppose. As long as they’re quick about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good choice. The lab near the pharmacy is perfectly fine. I'll send the order over electronically right away, and they should be expecting you. They are usually very efficient. While we're waiting for the results, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other concerns you have?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. I just… I just want to feel normal again. I’m tired of feeling tired all the time. Thank you for listening. I hope these tests can help.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Licano. Feeling constantly fatigued is incredibly draining, and I want to help you get to the bottom of this. We will do everything we can. I’ll give you a copy of the lab order and some information about what to expect during the blood draw. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very clearly. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I should probably get going now.
