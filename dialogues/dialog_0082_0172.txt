DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Honestly, I don’t quite recall everything. Something about… a visit? My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. It’s all rather… disruptive. I suppose a general check-up is fine. As long as it doesn’t take long.
DOCTOR: Yes, a general check-up sounds good. It’s perfectly alright if you’re not sure what brought you in – sometimes just getting settled in a new place is disruptive. And we'll certainly try to keep things brief. Let me just start by asking a few questions, if that’s alright. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly? Heavens, no. Not unless absolutely necessary. I’ve always been… quite healthy, thank you very much. A bit of this and that, naturally, at my age, but nothing a good lie-down and a cup of tea couldn’t fix. Honestly, all these appointments… I do wish people would just get on with things. Is this going to involve poking and prodding?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. We’ll try to make this as comfortable as possible. There will be some examination involved, yes, but I'll explain everything before we do it. So, you said “a bit of this and that.” Could you tell me a little more about what you’ve been experiencing recently?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? It’s all a blur. A little… dizziness, perhaps? And my hands ache something awful when it’s damp. But that’s just the weather, I expect. It’s always been the weather. And I forget things, naturally. Happens when one gets… seasoned. Though I assure you, my mind was perfectly sharp once. Perfectly sharp. Are we quite finished?
DOCTOR: Alright, dizziness and some hand aches, worse with damp weather, and some forgetfulness. We can definitely look into those. Just to clarify – when you say dizziness, is that a spinning sensation, or more of a lightheadedness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Spinning? Lightheadedness? I haven’t the faintest idea what you mean. It just feels… off. Unsettled. Like the room is… not quite right. Honestly, all these precise terms! It’s perfectly simple, really. I feel a bit wobbly sometimes, and that’s that. And please, let’s not dwell on it. I have a luncheon appointment. A very important luncheon.
DOCTOR: Yes, “off” and “unsettled” is perfectly good enough for now. We’ll try to figure out what’s causing that feeling. Now, Candice, just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Oh, I eat perfectly well, thank you. Always have. A sensible diet, you see. Husband does the cooking, though. He’s rather particular. As for weight… well, I haven’t stepped on a scale in decades. Really, I haven't the time for such frivolities. It’s all perfectly adequate, I assure you. Are we nearing the end of this… inquiry?
DOCTOR: Alright, a sensible diet, husband does the cooking, and you haven’t been weighing yourself. That's helpful to know. One more quick question, and then we can proceed to a brief examination. Have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, my hearing isn’t what it used to be, naturally. Everyone says I speak too loudly. Husband complains incessantly. And my vision… well, things are a bit blurry, but I have glasses, you see. It’s perfectly manageable. Honestly, I really must insist, Doctor. I have people waiting. And I do dislike being kept from my schedule. Is there anything essential you need to know before we conclude this… procedure?
DOCTOR: Alright, some hearing loss and blurry vision with glasses. That is good to know. Before we proceed, Candice, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, goodness. Let me think… Husband handles all that, you see. He’s terribly organized. I think… something for my blood pressure? A small white pill. And perhaps something for my joints? I really couldn't say for certain. He has it all written down somewhere, I’m sure. Honestly, all these details! It’s simply overwhelming. Perhaps you should ask him. I’m quite tired now, Doctor. Can we please be done?
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like your husband manages your medications. We can certainly ask him, but let me just quickly access your electronic health record here… Ah, yes. It appears you are currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for high blood pressure, and Meloxicam 15mg daily for osteoarthritis. Now, Candice, just a few quick questions about your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh, goodness, let me think… It was ages ago. Back when my husband and I first married, I believe. Something… with my appendix, perhaps? It was quite a commotion. And then… I broke my wrist once, falling off a horse. Terribly embarrassing. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. I really don't recall the specifics. Are we absolutely certain all this is necessary, Doctor? I have a bridge game at three. A very important game. .
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy many years ago, and a broken wrist. Now, Candice, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me if anyone in your family has a history of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
