DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sucich. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor Stilaire. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups, see? They just won’t stop. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I’d say about three days now, and they’re really starting to get on my nerves. Not painful, just… persistent. Like a little bird trapped in my chest, flapping about.
DOCTOR: Three days of persistent hiccups, I understand. That is quite bothersome. And you describe it as feeling like a little bird flapping in your chest—that’s a very helpful description, thank you. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when they started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Three days ago… It was Tuesday, wasn’t it? I was having lunch with my friend, Elina – lovely woman, Elina – at that new cafe down by the market. We were laughing about something silly, I can’t even remember what now, and then hic… started right in the middle of a sentence. Thought it would pass, you know? But it didn’t. Just kept going, on and off all afternoon, and then all day yesterday, and still today.
DOCTOR: So, they began mid-sentence while having lunch with your friend, Elina, on Tuesday. That's helpful. Have you noticed anything that seems to make them worse since then—certain foods, drinks, positions, or activities, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that's a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, to be honest. I've tried drinking water slowly, like they always say, and holding my breath, but nothing seems to do the trick. Maybe when I lie down? They seem a little more frequent then, but I can’t say for sure. I did have a cup of tea this morning, a nice chamomile, and they didn't stop, so it wasn't that, anyway. I really don’t know! It’s just… random, I think.
DOCTOR: Random, alright. And you’ve tried the usual remedies—slow sips of water, holding your breath—without any relief. No change with lying down is also good to know, and the chamomile tea didn’t seem to have an effect. Now, outside of the hiccups themselves, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside them?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, no trouble breathing, no dizziness… just the hiccups. I feel perfectly fine otherwise, thankfully. A little annoyed, of course! And tired, because they keep waking me up at night, but that’s about it. I haven't had a fever or anything like that, and my appetite’s been normal. I’m still eating everything I usually do.
DOCTOR: That's reassuring to hear, Mrs. Sucich. No pain, no difficulty breathing, no fever, normal appetite—that’s all very good. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have a list of any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… Just this one, for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, it’s called. Ten milligrams, once a day. And that’s it, really. I had my gallbladder out years ago – goodness, must be twenty years now – but that’s all. No allergies that I know of. I'm usually a pretty healthy woman.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily for blood pressure, and a cholecystectomy—gallbladder removal—twenty years ago. No known allergies. Thank you for that information, Mrs. Sucich. And could you tell me about your family’s medical history, if you know it?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that's a bit tricky. My mother lived to be eighty-five, but she didn’t really talk much about illnesses. She had some arthritis in her hands when she got older, but nothing major. My father… he passed away quite young, from a heart attack, I think. And my brother, he had high blood pressure, like me. That’s about all I can remember, really. My family wasn’t one for keeping track of such things.
DOCTOR: Alright, so your mother had arthritis, your father passed away from a heart attack, and your brother also had high blood pressure. That's helpful to know. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I live alone, in a small house. I keep busy, mostly. I volunteer at the library a couple of times a week, and I enjoy gardening – that’s how I spend most of my time, really. I try to eat healthy, but I do enjoy a little treat now and then. I don't smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not much of a drinker, I’m afraid. I walk most days, unless the weather is really bad.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very active and healthy lifestyle, Mrs. Sucich. Volunteering, gardening, walking—that’s excellent. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m not worried, but I suppose it’s always good to be sure, isn’t it? I’m used to doctor visits, having been around for as long as I have!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath for me... and another... good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No palpable masses or organomegaly. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all four quadrants. Everything seems within normal limits so far, Mrs. Sucich. Now, can you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Alright, that wasn’t bad at all. There you are. I hope my breath isn't too awful! I did have a little peppermint this morning, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Your mouth looks healthy, Mrs. Sucich. The peppermint might affect things slightly, but it’s not a concern. Everything appears normal. Alright, Mrs. Sucich, based on the examination and what you’ve told me, it sounds like you have a case of persistent hiccups. Most hiccups are benign and resolve on their own within 48 hours. However, since yours have been going on for three days, we should consider a few things. While uncommon, prolonged hiccups can sometimes be a sign of an underlying medical condition. To rule out anything serious, I would like to order a few simple blood tests: a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. These will help us check your overall health and see if there is anything causing the hiccups. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests… Well, if you think it's best, Doctor, then yes, of course. I’d rather be safe than sorry. It's just hiccups, but I suppose it's good to check everything properly. You're right, I wouldn’t want anything lurking. Yes, go ahead with the tests. Where do we go from here?
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Mrs. Sucich. I completely agree. I’ll write an order for the lab tests now. The phlebotomist will draw a small sample of blood from your arm. It usually only takes a few minutes, and it’s relatively painless. Once the results are back—typically within a day or two—we’ll review them and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, you can continue to try the home remedies—slow sips of water, holding your breath—if they provide any relief. If the hiccups become significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms—such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain—please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just the blood tests, and we'll see what they say. And call if they get worse, you said? Alright. Thank you for taking such good care of me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Sucich. That's what I’m here for. Yes, please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide you with instructions on where to go afterward. I’ll also have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the lab results. Thank you again for coming in today. Have a pleasant afternoon, and please try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will try to relax. It's just… annoying. Goodbye now.
