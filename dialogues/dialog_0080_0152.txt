DOCTOR: Hi Chelise, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. Hyperlipidemia, it said. I don't really know what that means exactly, but it sounded… not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, a letter about your cholesterol. That's a good reason to come in and have a chat. Hyperlipidemia basically means you have higher than ideal levels of fats – cholesterol – in your blood. It can be something we need to address, but it's also very common and often manageable. First, let’s get a clearer picture. Have you ever been told you have high cholesterol before, or is this the first time?
PATIENT: No, this is the very first time. I've always been pretty healthy, I think. I eat okay… lots of vegetables. Not a huge amount of red meat, mostly chicken and fish. I walk most days, too. It was a bit of a shock, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand – it is surprising when something like this comes up unexpectedly, especially when you feel healthy. That’s why we want to look into it a bit more. Okay, so first time diagnosed. That's helpful. Do you know what your numbers were, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, not a single number. The letter just said "high" and that I should schedule an appointment. I didn't really write them down, I just… got a little worried and called. I'm not very good with remembering those kinds of things, to be honest.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, that's perfectly alright! We can easily look up the results on the computer here. Okay, here we are. It looks like your total cholesterol is 245, your LDL is 160, HDL is 45, and triglycerides are 180. Do those numbers mean anything to you, or should I explain those a little bit?
PATIENT: Oh, no, those numbers are all… just a blur. Definitely nothing to me. Could you explain, please? If you don't mind. It would be very helpful. I feel a bit silly asking, but… I really don't know about this stuff.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all! It is a lot of information. I’m happy to explain. Think of cholesterol as a type of fat that your body needs to work properly. There are different types, though. Total cholesterol is… well, it’s all the cholesterol combined. Ideally, we want that under 200. Your’s is a little high at 245. LDL – that’s the “bad” cholesterol. High levels of LDL can build up in your arteries and cause problems. We want that under 100, and yours is 160. HDL is the “good” cholesterol – it helps remove the bad cholesterol. We want that higher, ideally over 60, and yours is 45. And triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood; ideally, we want those under 150, and yours are 180. So, your LDL and triglycerides are a bit elevated, and your HDL is a little on the lower side. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes a little more sense, actually. The “bad” and “good” cholesterol. Okay. So, mostly the “bad” is too high. And not enough of the “good”. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Mostly the LDL is what we're concerned about right now. Okay, so let's talk about what could be contributing to this. Beyond diet and exercise – which you already mentioned are pretty good – do you have any family history of high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father had… some heart trouble when he was older. He had a blockage, I think, and had a stent put in. And my mother’s brother… he had a stroke, maybe ten years ago? It was a while ago. So, yes, I guess there is some family history.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information to know. Family history definitely plays a role. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Just a multivitamin sometimes. I try to eat well enough that I don't need anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Everything sounds and feels good so far. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be due to being in the office – "white coat hypertension." We can monitor that over time. Now, let's talk about a plan. Given your cholesterol levels and family history, I think we should start with lifestyle modifications and see how that goes.
PATIENT: That sounds good to me. Lifestyle… so, more walking? Better food? What do you suggest specifically?
DOCTOR: Exactly. More walking is great! Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. As for diet, focusing on heart-healthy foods is key. That means reducing saturated and trans fats – found in red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. Increase your intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein – like fish, chicken, and beans. Also, consider adding foods rich in soluble fiber – like oatmeal, apples, and berries – as these can help lower cholesterol. And including omega-3 fatty acids – found in salmon and flaxseed – can also be beneficial. I can give you a handout with more specific dietary recommendations. We’ll recheck your cholesterol levels in three months to see how you're doing. If they haven’t improved enough with lifestyle changes, we can discuss medication options at that time. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. A handout would be great, thank you. I think I can manage that – more walking, better food, those things. Three months… alright. I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here you go. This has more details on specific foods to include and avoid. I'm also going to order a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel to get a more complete picture of your cholesterol levels and overall health. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. The handout is very helpful, thank you. And… no, I don't think I have any questions right now. Unless… is there anything I should be worried about in the meantime?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. Honestly, at this stage, there's no need to be overly worried. We’re being proactive, which is good. Just focus on the lifestyle changes we discussed. However, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or weakness on one side of your body, please seek immediate medical attention. Those could be signs of a more serious problem. Otherwise, just focus on the plan, and we'll see you back in three months. I’ll have the lab results ready for our next appointment. Do you need a work note for any time off?
PATIENT: No, I don't need a work note. Thank you so much, Doctor. You've really put my mind at ease. I appreciate your time and your thorough explanation. I'll do my best to follow the plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chelise. I'm glad I could help. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day, and I'll see you in three months.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too Doctor. Thank you again!
