DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get this over with. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of my left ear, and my face feels… droopy on that side. It’s quite alarming, really. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sudden hearing loss and facial weakness – that’s definitely something we need to investigate. To start, can you tell me exactly when you first noticed this?
PATIENT: This morning, like I said. I woke up, went to say good morning to my housekeeper, and… nothing. Just a ringing. And when I looked in the mirror, the left side of my face… well, it wasn’t right. It’s all very… inconvenient. I have a garden party to plan, you know. These things don’t just organize themselves.
DOCTOR: Right. And has anything like this ever happened before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always had excellent hearing, I pride myself on that. And my face… well, it's always been perfectly symmetrical, thank you very much. I haven’t had any injuries or anything like that recently. No falls, no bumps, nothing. I just… woke up like this. It's probably some sort of… virus, isn’t it? A temporary thing?
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No headache, no dizziness, no blurry vision. Just the ear and the face. Honestly, it's incredibly frustrating. I can barely understand a word anyone says. And I'm sure it looks dreadful. Do you think it's noticeable? My friends are very… critical, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I’m going to need to ask you a few questions and do a quick physical examination, alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But please be quick about it. I really don't have all day. And try not to poke me too much. It's very sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit here for me. I’ll start with a few questions, then do a quick neurological exam and look in your ears. First, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I'm always a bit chilly, to be honest, but that's just me. I have poor circulation. I don’t get fevers. I take very good care of myself. I eat well, I exercise…well, I used to, before all this, of course. It’s difficult to exercise when you can’t hear properly, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any weakness in any other part of your body?
PATIENT: No. Just the face, as I've repeatedly said. My arms and legs are perfectly fine. I walked here myself, didn’t I? Though it is rather a long walk from the car park. Honestly, the clinic is terribly inconveniently located. Are you sure there isn’t something simple you can give me for it? An antibiotic, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand you’re concerned about getting back to your activities. But based on your symptoms, we need to rule out a number of possibilities, some of which are quite serious. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, my blood pressure has been a bit high at times. But I manage it with diet. And I had a hysterectomy years ago, of course. Beyond that…no. I’ve always been remarkably healthy. My mother lived to be ninety-two, you know. Good genes. Though she did have dreadful arthritis, thankfully I seem to have missed that. I suppose that's good luck. I don’t see why I have to go into all this detail, it’s just an ear problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you take any medications currently, besides anything you might use for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No. As I said, I manage my blood pressure with my diet. I don’t believe in loading up on pills if I can avoid it. I prefer a natural approach, you know? Herbal teas, things like that. I do take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but that's all. It’s probably a waste of money, to be honest. But my friend insists. She’s very insistent.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm going to need to do a quick examination of your ears, your face, and check your reflexes. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, must I? It's rather cold on those tables, isn't it? And I just had my hair done. But very well. Quickly, please. I have a luncheon to arrange, you know. And I really need to call my gardener. He’s terribly unreliable. But I’ll lie down, if I must. Just be gentle. And don't mess up my hair.
DOCTOR: If you could lie on your back for me, please. I'll start by examining your ears. Please try to stay as still as possible.
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't see what looking in my ears has to do with not being able to hear. But very well. Just… be quick. And try not to poke too hard. It's dreadfully sensitive. And do tell me what you're seeing, so I can… assess the situation myself. I do have some medical knowledge, you know. My mother was quite a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. Your ear canals and eardrums appear normal. I’m not seeing any obvious signs of infection or blockage. Now, I’m going to check your facial muscles. Can you please close your eyes tightly and wrinkle your forehead?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that tight enough? It's a bit difficult, to be honest. My face feels rather… strange. And it’s rather cold in here, isn’t it? Makes it hard to concentrate. Is it symmetrical? Do I look ridiculous? You have to tell me. I need to know if people will notice.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. I notice some weakness on the left side of your face. Now, can you please try to smile?
PATIENT: Like this? Is it… obvious? It feels… strange, as I said. It's hard to smile when your face feels like it's… drooping. Honestly, it's quite distressing. People will think I've had a stroke. My social life will be ruined. Is it very bad? Do you think I need to go to the hospital? But I have a bridge game tomorrow…
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, based on what I’m seeing, this could be a sign of a neurological problem. It could be something serious, and we need to rule out a stroke immediately. I’m going to recommend that you go to the hospital right away for a CT scan and further evaluation. This isn't something we can wait on. I'm writing a referral now. Do you have someone who can take you?
PATIENT: A stroke?! Oh dear heavens! A stroke! But… but I feel perfectly fine! Apart from the ear and the face, of course. And the cold. And the gardener. But a stroke? I can’t have a stroke! I have too many things to do! Bridge, garden parties, luncheon… My life will be over! And a CT scan? Is it… painful? And will it mess up my hair? I suppose I’ll have to call my housekeeper. She’s terribly unreliable, but it’s better than nothing. But a stroke… oh dear.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, it's important not to panic. We don't know for certain if it's a stroke, but we need to rule it out quickly. The CT scan is painless - it’s just a series of X-rays. As for your hair, they will take precautions to protect it. The important thing is to get this checked out immediately. I'm going to write a referral to the emergency department at St. Luke's Hospital. They are equipped to handle this quickly and efficiently. Do you have any allergies or medications I should note on the referral?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. And as I said, I don't take any medications. Except for the vitamin D in the winter. But that's just a supplement. And I really prefer herbal teas. Will they have herbal teas at the hospital? Honestly, this is dreadful. Absolutely dreadful. And I have to call my friend. She’ll be terribly worried. She's the one who insisted on the vitamin D, you know. It’s all her fault! But, fine. St. Luke's, you said? Is it far? And will they have comfortable chairs in the waiting room? I have a bad back.
DOCTOR: Here is the referral. St. Luke's is about 20 minutes from here. I will call ahead and let them know you are on your way. They have comfortable chairs in the waiting room. Please try to stay calm and breathe deeply. I’m also going to have my nurse come in and check your blood pressure and heart rate before you leave. It's best to be cautious. Do you have someone who can drive you, or should I call a taxi?
PATIENT: A taxi, I suppose. My housekeeper is utterly useless. She can’t drive, and she’s terribly slow even when she’s not driving. Honestly, this is a disaster. A complete and utter disaster. Garden party ruined, bridge game canceled, stroke… Oh, heavens. Could you… could you perhaps write a note for the hospital explaining about the garden party? They might be more sympathetic if they know I have important commitments. And please, tell them to be careful with my hair. It’s quite expensive, you know. And tell them about the vitamin D. It’s very important. My friend will be furious if I don’t mention it. And… and could you please, please call and make sure they have comfortable chairs? My back is acting up something awful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. I’m writing a note for the hospital explaining your concerns about the garden party and your commitment to your social engagements. I'm also noting your preference for herbal teas and the importance of your vitamin D supplement. And I will personally call the hospital to confirm the availability of comfortable chairs. Please, try to stay calm. My nurse will be in shortly to check your vitals and arrange the taxi. I'm going to step out for a moment and let her assist you. It's vital that you get this checked out quickly, and I want to ensure you are as comfortable as possible during the process. “This is why I specialized in family medicine…”
