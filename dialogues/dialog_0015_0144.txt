DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Trestrail, you said? Seems a… unique name. Well, honestly? I just wanted to see what this place was all about. My neighbor, Agnes, she keeps going on and on about preventative care. Said I should get myself checked out, just to be safe. I don't really need anything, mind you. Just curious, I suppose. Though, Agnes does worry too much.
DOCTOR: Preventative care is… commendable, I suppose. Though it’s often a waste of resources when patients aren’t experiencing any actual complaints. Still, we’ll do a basic assessment. To get started, let’s clarify what “basic” means for you. Are you currently experiencing any pain, discomfort, or unusual symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Pain? Heavens, no. I've had a life, you know? Surgeries, all sorts. I am a surgical tech, or… was. It’s been a while. No, nothing unusual. Just… getting older, I guess. Things ache a bit sometimes, but that's just age, right? Not something to bother a perfectly good doctor over. I don't understand why you need to ask all these questions if I’m not sick.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Ms. Calvery. Even without acute symptoms, a comprehensive history allows me to understand your baseline and identify potential risks. “Things ache a bit” is vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, dear. Well… my knees, mostly. And my back. And sometimes my shoulder. It’s… everywhere, a little. It’s not bad bad, just… old lady aches. Honestly, Doctor, I used to deal with this all the time with patients. You ask a lot of questions. It’s usually the people who complain the least that have the most going on, you know? Though, I'm not one of them. It's just…normal.
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a subjective term, Ms. Calvery. And while your experience as a surgical tech is…relevant, it doesn’t negate the need for a proper evaluation. To get a clearer picture, let’s briefly go over your medical history. Have you been formally diagnosed with arthritis or any other chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, now you're asking about history? That's…a long list, Doctor. So many surgeries over the years. I honestly can't recall every little thing. Arthritis…maybe? Agnes keeps saying I should get tested for that. But honestly, I don't remember a doctor ever telling me I had it. Mostly, it was just…fixing what was broken. I worked with Dr. Hemlock for years. A good man, but he always moved so fast, I never really understood all the details. Is it important? Because I’m telling you, I really don’t recall a diagnosis.
DOCTOR: It is…important to have an accurate record, Ms. Calvery. While I appreciate your candor, “fixing what was broken” doesn't provide me with a complete clinical picture. Do you have access to your medical records, perhaps through your insurance or previous physicians?
PATIENT: Records? Oh, heavens no. I’m not very good with all that computer stuff, and Agnes handles all my bills and insurance. She's a whiz with technology, that one. I doubt she has them, honestly. We just…always went to whoever Dr. Hemlock recommended. He retired years ago, you know. Moved to Florida, I think. I really don't worry much about paperwork. As long as things are working, that’s all that matters. Medicare takes care of everything, right? I don't see why I need a bunch of old papers. Is this going to take long? I had a lovely garden this year, and I need to get back before the sun gets too strong.
DOCTOR: Very well. Since you're hesitant to provide specific medical history and lack access to records, we'll proceed with a brief physical examination. It will be limited, of course, given your stated lack of complaints, but it's a necessary step. Please sit up straight on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. An examination… Well, I suppose that's fair. I've seen plenty of those in my day. Just… be gentle, Doctor. My bones aren't what they used to be. And please don't poke too much. It’s just a waste of time, really, but if you have to… be careful.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, please. And exhale slowly… Good. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Just relax. Let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That doesn't feel too bad. Abdomen… yes, perfectly normal. Always been a strong stomach, mine. I can eat just about anything. Though, Agnes keeps telling me I should watch my sodium intake. Honestly, Doctor, I think she worries too much. It's just… gas, sometimes. All that cabbage, you know? Perfectly normal. And I’ve always been able to tolerate pain. Years of surgeries will do that to you.
DOCTOR: And your knees, Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees… yes. They ache a bit, you know? Especially when the weather changes. Agnes says it's the arthritis acting up, but I told you, no one ever told me I had arthritis. It just… hurts sometimes. It’s been that way for years. I try not to think about it. It's just part of getting older.
DOCTOR: And your back?
PATIENT: Oh, my back... Well, it's not sharp pain, you understand? It’s more of a… dull ache. Like a constant pressure. I used to be able to do all sorts of gardening, bending and lifting without a thought. Now… it's a bit more difficult. I have to take things slower. Agnes says it’s probably just old age and recommends yoga, but honestly, Doctor, I’m too old to start yoga. It’s just… life.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, based on my limited examination and your history, it appears you're experiencing typical age-related musculoskeletal changes. This can include joint pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While I cannot definitively diagnose arthritis without further investigation, your symptoms are consistent with osteoarthritis. However, given your reluctance to pursue further testing and your stated lack of acute concerns, I recommend a conservative approach. This includes over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, as needed, and gentle exercise to maintain your range of motion. I also strongly advise discussing your concerns with your neighbor, Agnes. While her input is valuable, it’s important to base medical decisions on a comprehensive evaluation and your own comfort level.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that's… what I figured, really. Old age, it just happens, doesn’t it? Acetaminophen… yes, I think I have some of that at home. Ibuprofen, maybe? Agnes buys all sorts of things. Gentle exercise… hmph. I’ll think about it. And Agnes… yes. She means well, she really does. But sometimes she gets a little carried away. Honestly, Doctor, I think I’ll just stick to my garden. That’s what keeps me going. Thank you for listening. I suppose that's all I needed. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Calvery. If your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. Here is a pamphlet on osteoarthritis and over-the-counter pain management. Have a pleasant day, and enjoy your garden. .
