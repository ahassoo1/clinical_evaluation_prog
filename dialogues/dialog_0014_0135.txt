DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have… something coming from my ear. It is… discharge, you understand? It started maybe… three days ago. Not much at first, but now… more.
DOCTOR: Right, discharge from the ear. Okay. And is it… painful at all?
PATIENT: Not really painful, Doctor. More… uncomfortable. Like… pressure, sometimes. And it feels… wet. Sorry to say that. It makes me feel… not clean, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. "Wet" and "uncomfortable" is helpful. Has there been any hearing loss, ringing in your ears, or dizziness associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Hearing… yes. A little. Not much, but… things sound quieter. Like someone is… turning down the volume. And no ringing, no. And no dizziness, Doctor. I have not felt… off balance. I walk okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or any other symptoms like a headache or sore throat?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. No headache. And my throat is… fine. I did not feel sick, Doctor. Just this ear. It is… worrying me, because I need to hear well for my students, you understand? I teach. Postsecondary. History.
DOCTOR: History, right. Okay. Have you tried anything at all to treat it yourself?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I did not. I do not know what to do. I tried… cleaning the outside of my ear, very gently with a cloth. But that did not help. I do not put anything in my ear. I hear that is… bad.
DOCTOR: Good, very good. Putting things in the ear is generally a bad idea. Have you had any ear infections before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Hmm. When I was a boy, maybe. In Somalia. A long time ago. My mother, she… used something warm. A cloth, and… oils, I think. But I was very young. I do not remember exactly. It did not hurt so much then. This is… different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, are you experiencing any pain in your jaw, face, or teeth?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain in my jaw, my face, or my teeth. Everything feels… normal there. Just this… wetness. And the quietness. It is… annoying. It makes it hard to hear my students' questions, you understand? I worry they will think I am not listening.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to take a look in your ear now. It might be a little uncomfortable, but try to stay still. Let me know if you feel any sharp pain.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will try. I will stay still. Sharp pain… I will tell you, yes. But I do not think it will hurt. Just… uncomfortable, maybe. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there is some discharge present, and the ear canal is a bit inflamed. The tympanic membrane… appears slightly bulging, but I can't get a perfectly clear view with all the… congestion. It looks like you have otitis externa - an outer ear infection, likely. It’s fairly common.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? Is that… bad, Doctor? Will I… lose my hearing? I need to hear, you understand? For my teaching. Is there something you can give me? Something to… fix it? Quickly?
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s not generally serious if treated promptly. And you’re not likely to lose your hearing. But it can be quite uncomfortable and, as you said, interfere with your work. It's the inflammation and swelling causing the blockage and discomfort, and potentially the quietness you’re experiencing. I'm going to prescribe you some ear drops with a steroid and antibiotic to reduce the inflammation and fight the infection. It’s important to complete the full course, even if you start feeling better.
PATIENT: Okay. Ear drops. Steroid and… antibiotic. I understand. Complete the full course… yes, I will. How many drops? And how often? And… will it burn? I do not like burning. And… can I still teach? I have classes tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You’ll instill two drops in the affected ear three times a day for seven days. It may cause a slight stinging sensation initially, but it shouldn’t be painful. If it is painful, stop using the drops and contact the office. As for teaching… it's generally okay to continue, as long as it doesn't cause you significant discomfort. But avoid getting water in your ear, and I recommend wearing earplugs when you are lecturing, just in case. I'll also write you a note for any accommodations you might need.
PATIENT: Ear plugs… yes, that is good. And the note… thank you, Doctor. You are very helpful. Water in the ear… no, I will be careful. So, two drops, three times a day, for seven days. And if it burns too much, I stop. I think I understand. Will this… fix it quickly, Doctor? Before my classes tomorrow?
DOCTOR: It should start to provide some relief within a couple of days. However, it takes time for the inflammation to subside completely. It’s unlikely to be completely resolved before your classes tomorrow, but the drops should help manage the discomfort and hopefully allow you to hear well enough to teach. If it doesn’t improve after three days, or if you develop a fever, severe pain, or notice any discharge with a foul odor, contact the office immediately. Here's the prescription for the ear drops, and this is a note for your school explaining the situation. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. Two drops, three times a day, for seven days. Watch for fever or bad smell. And… ear plugs. Thank you very much for your help. You have been very patient with me. I will be careful, and I will follow your instructions. I hope to hear better soon.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Radillo. Just follow the instructions, and if you have any concerns, don't hesitate to call. Get well soon. .
