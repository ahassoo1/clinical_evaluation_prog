DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're with Medicare, and we’re located in a rural setting… right. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it’s my legs. They just… gave out. Not completely, but weak. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a really nasty cold. I haven’t felt this helpless in years, and I certainly don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness in the legs, beginning a few days after a cold. Hmm. And when you say “gave out,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, please. Don’t need me to draw you a picture. It's like trying to walk through molasses. Everything feels heavy, and I have to really think about lifting my feet. It’s not a sudden collapse, it’s just…effort. And it's both legs, which is what’s so concerning. I usually pride myself on being quite agile, you know? Travel guides have to be, to keep up with tourists. This is… disruptive.
DOCTOR: “Like walking through molasses,” right. And this is present in both legs equally, you stated. Has this weakness been constant since it began, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's been pretty consistent, actually. Maybe a little better in the mornings, but by the afternoon…forget about it. Honestly, I had to practically drag myself out of bed yesterday. It doesn’t hurt, mind you, it's just… not there. It's like someone put weights on my ankles, and I haven't been doing squats. Do you understand what I mean? It’s frustrating trying to explain this.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Ms. Firestone. It's helpful to have that level of detail. Now, aside from this leg weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But honestly, who isn't tired these days? And maybe a little shaky, not a full tremor or anything, just… not as steady on my feet as I normally am. Which, naturally, doesn't help with the leg problem. I haven't had a fever or anything like that, if that’s what you were going to ask. I'm normally quite robust, you know.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and some unsteadiness… alright. Now, let’s move on to your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, please. I keep myself in excellent shape. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, none of that nonsense. I had a hysterectomy years ago, and a rather unpleasant bout of shingles a few years back, but that’s it. Perfectly healthy, I assure you. Was perfectly healthy, anyway. And a divorce, but I hardly consider that a medical condition. Though some days… Never mind.
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy and shingles noted. And no other surgeries or significant illnesses?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. A broken wrist when I was a child, climbing a mango tree, but that hardly counts. I've always been very careful. Mostly. And I've had all my vaccinations, of course. I’m a practical woman. I need to be, running tours and all. Can we just get to the bottom of this problem, please? It’s just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, regarding family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, neurological disorders, or muscle weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens. My family? A complicated bunch, honestly. My mother had arthritis, pretty severe towards the end, but that’s a given with age. My grandmother… well, she died young, of something vague. They didn't have the medical technology back then. No one in my family ever had anything fancy like heart disease or stroke, if that’s what you're getting at. Mostly just… normal ailments. This leg business is… unusual. It's quite worrying, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs?
PATIENT: No allergies. And no, I don’t take anything regularly. Maybe a pain reliever if I get a particularly nasty headache, but that's it. I pride myself on not needing medication. I prefer to let my body heal itself, naturally. It's always worked before. Until now, that is. Are you going to actually do something about this, or just ask me questions all day? I have a tour group scheduled for Friday, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Firestone. Now, if you’ll allow me, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. It will involve checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs. And perhaps a look at your neurological state. This will help me to better assess the cause of your weakness. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, get on with it. Honestly, the sooner we figure this out, the better. I don’t have all day. And please be gentle, I have a reputation to uphold. Tourists expect a certain…gracefulness.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat on the examination table. We’ll begin with your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Reflexes are present, though slightly diminished bilaterally. Now, I’d like you to try to resist as I apply pressure. There is some weakness in both legs, primarily in the dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Sensation is intact, though slightly reduced distally. Gait is slightly unsteady and requires a wider base of support. The examination suggests a possible peripheral neuropathy or proximal muscle weakness. It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation.
PATIENT: Peripheral what now? Honestly, Doctor, are you speaking English? And "proximal muscle weakness"? Sounds terrifying. Is this something serious? Will I be able to walk by Friday? Because if I have to cancel that tour…well, let's just say it won't be pleasant for anyone. Tell me plainly what you think is going on, and what we need to do about it. I don't need a medical lecture; I need solutions.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, let me explain in plain terms. “Peripheral neuropathy” means there may be some damage to the nerves in your legs and feet. “Proximal muscle weakness” suggests a problem with the larger muscles in your thighs and upper legs. This doesn’t necessarily mean anything catastrophic, but it does require investigation. Given your recent cold, one possibility is a post-viral neuropathy – sometimes viruses can temporarily affect nerves. However, other possibilities need to be ruled out. I’d like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and signs of inflammation. I also recommend an electromyography, or EMG, to assess the function of your nerves and muscles more precisely. This will help us determine the exact cause of your weakness. As for whether you’ll be able to walk by Friday… it’s difficult to say. It depends on the underlying cause. It's possible the weakness will improve on its own, but we need to know what we're dealing with first. I can’t provide a definitive answer without those tests. Cancelling the tour might be prudent. We need to prioritize your health.
PATIENT: Electromy…whatsit? And more tests? Honestly, this is ridiculous. A cold! It's a cold, not some debilitating illness. I’ve walked through jungles with less trouble than this. And cancelling the tour is not an option. The arrangements are made, the clients are expecting me, and my reputation… well, you wouldn't understand. Look, can't we just give me something for the weakness? A shot, a pill, something to get me through Friday? I don't have time for endless tests and investigations. I'm a busy woman. And frankly, I'm starting to doubt your competence. A cold shouldn't cause all this. Are you sure you're considering all the possibilities? Perhaps I should get a second opinion.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your frustration, but I cannot simply prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. That would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. While a cold is often a benign illness, it can occasionally lead to complications, including nerve inflammation. It’s my duty to investigate the cause of your symptoms thoroughly, not just mask them. I will order the blood tests and the EMG. It's a non-invasive procedure, and it will provide valuable information. I’m not dismissing your concerns, but I need you to trust my professional judgment. As for a second opinion, you are, of course, free to seek one. However, delaying treatment will not improve your condition. I strongly advise against undertaking strenuous activity, such as leading a tour, until we have a clearer understanding of what is causing your weakness. If you insist on proceeding, you do so at your own risk. I can write you a temporary prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory, to help with any discomfort, but it will not address the underlying cause. It’s a temporary measure, nothing more. Would you like me to proceed with the orders?
PATIENT: Fine. Do the tests. But I'm telling you, it's a waste of time and money. And write the prescription for whatever it is. Honestly, a little something to take the edge off wouldn't hurt. I still think I should be able to handle the tour, but if you insist... I'll consider canceling. Consider. But if I have to cancel, I expect a full explanation, and I expect it to be quick. And you'd better be right about this diagnosis. I don’t have time for medical guesswork. Now, let's get this over with. Where do I go for these tests? And how long will it take? I have a schedule to maintain, you know.
DOCTOR: Here is a prescription for naproxen, a mild anti-inflammatory. Take as directed. The blood tests can be done at the lab across the street. They should only take about fifteen minutes. The electromyography will be scheduled at Regional Neurology – I’m writing the referral now. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. It typically takes a few days to get in, and the test itself will take about an hour. The results will be sent to my office, and I will contact you as soon as I have them. I anticipate having them within a week. In the meantime, please avoid strenuous activity and monitor your symptoms closely. If your weakness worsens or you experience any new symptoms – such as numbness, tingling, or difficulty breathing – contact me immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Fine. A week? Honestly. That’s an eternity. I suppose I have no choice. No, I don't have any further questions. Just… get it done. And I expect a prompt response when the results are in. Don't leave me hanging. And Doctor… try to remember that some of us actually have lives to lead.
