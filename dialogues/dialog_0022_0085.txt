DOCTOR: Good morning, Gabbrielle. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s this discoloration on my skin. It’s rather bothersome, honestly. I noticed it a few weeks back and it hasn’t gone away. I really don't understand what could be causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Discoloration can be concerning. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's…patchy, really. Not all over, thankfully. Mostly on my arms and a bit on my chest. It’s not raised or anything, just…different colored. A sort of…dull grey, I suppose. Not a healthy color at all. And it doesn’t itch or burn, which is good, I suppose, but it is noticeable. I’ve tried some lotions, but they haven’t done a thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, patchy discoloration on your arms and chest, described as a dull grey color, and it’s not associated with itching or burning. You’ve tried lotions without any improvement. That’s helpful to know. To get a better understanding, could you tell me when you first noticed this discoloration?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It was shortly after I got back from visiting my sister in Lviv. Probably…mid-July? Yes, around the 15th of July, I believe. We were doing a lot of gardening while I was there, and the sun was quite strong. Though I was careful with sunscreen, of course. One can’t be too careful, you know.
DOCTOR: Gardening in mid-July in Lviv, and you were using sunscreen. Good. That’s important information. Just to clarify, was the discoloration present before the gardening trip, or did it appear after you returned?
PATIENT: Definitely after. I would have noticed it immediately if it was there before. I always check my skin before and after any sun exposure. No, it wasn't there when I left for the visit. It appeared within a week or so of getting back. I remember specifically thinking it was odd because I had been diligent with the sunscreen. It really shouldn’t have happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it developed within a week of returning from your trip to Lviv after gardening with sunscreen use. That's very helpful. Have you noticed any other changes to your skin besides the discoloration?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s just…the color. It’s not dry or flaky, doesn't feel different to the touch. And no bumps, no pain, nothing like that. It’s just…unsightly. Honestly, I’m a bit worried it’s something…serious. I try not to jump to conclusions, but you read things, you know? And one never knows.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you’re paying attention to it. It’s always best to get things checked out. Now, I’d like to take a look at the discoloration myself. Would you mind rolling up your sleeves and perhaps lowering the neckline of your shirt a bit so I can get a good view of the areas you mentioned?
PATIENT: Well, alright. If you think it's necessary. It's just...I don't usually dress like this for doctor's appointments. There. Is that alright? I do hope it’s nothing too concerning. Really, I’m quite fastidious about my health, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I appreciate your cooperation. I see what you mean. The discoloration is fairly localized to your arms and chest, as you mentioned, and doesn’t appear raised or inflamed. The borders are somewhat irregular, and the color is indeed a dull grey. The skin feels normal to the touch. I'm going to document these findings. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently – fatigue, weight loss, changes in appetite, or any other unusual feelings?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all. I've been perfectly fine, thank you. A little tired, perhaps, but who isn’t these days? My appetite is normal, and my weight hasn’t changed. I'm very regular with my check-ups, you see. I eat a healthy diet, exercise when I can, and I sleep well enough. Honestly, Doctor, I really can’t think of anything else that might be relevant. It’s just…this discoloration. It’s quite perplexing. It simply appeared, and it won't go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know – no systemic symptoms, stable weight, and good overall health habits. Given your history and the appearance of the discoloration, one possibility could be pityriasis versicolor, a common fungal skin infection. However, there are other conditions that can present similarly. To be certain, I’d like to perform a simple test – a skin scraping to examine under a microscope. It's a quick and painless procedure. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A fungal infection? Oh dear. I hadn't thought of that. I do try to keep everything very clean, you know. Well, if you think it’s necessary. But is it…contagious? I wouldn't want to pass anything on to my husband, or anyone else. And what sort of treatment would be involved if that is what it is? I’m rather sensitive to medications, you see. A lot of things upset my stomach.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned about contagion and medication sensitivities. Pityriasis versicolor isn't highly contagious, but it can spread through close contact, so avoiding sharing personal items like towels is a good idea. As for treatment, it’s typically managed with a topical antifungal cream or, in some cases, an oral antifungal medication. We would start with the topical cream first, as it has fewer side effects. If that doesn’t work, we can discuss other options. We can also consider a test dose to see how you tolerate any medication. I’ll be sure to choose something gentle, given your sensitivity. Let’s proceed with the skin scraping. It will help us confirm the diagnosis. This might feel a tiny pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you think it's the best course of action. But please be gentle, Doctor. I do hope it isn’t something serious. My husband would be terribly worried. And I have a garden party next month, you know. I’d rather not look…unpresentable. Do let me know if it stings. And please be quick about it. I’m not very fond of these sorts of procedures, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a look… Hmm…yes, I see it. There are hyphae and spores present, consistent with Malassezia fungus. This confirms the diagnosis of pityriasis versicolor. The good news is, it’s a very treatable condition. It's not serious, and we caught it early. We’ll start with a topical antifungal cream – clotrimazole or ketoconazole – applied twice daily for two weeks. This should clear up the discoloration. I’ll write you a prescription. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. Not serious, you say? That’s a relief. Topical cream…yes, that sounds much better than pills. Clotrimazole or ketoconazole…I’ve never heard of either of them, but if you recommend it, Doctor, that’s good enough for me. Will it stain my clothes? I do have a rather nice linen dress I’d like to wear to the garden party…and I wouldn’t want to ruin it. And will it take long to work? I’m hoping to see some improvement before next month. The garden party is rather important, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. I understand your concern about your linen dress and the garden party. Both clotrimazole and ketoconazole are generally well-tolerated, but they can occasionally cause mild skin irritation. As for staining, they shouldn’t stain clothing, but it’s always best to avoid applying it directly to garments. Allow the cream to fully absorb before getting dressed. As for how long it will take to work, you should start to see some improvement within a week or two, but it can take up to a month for complete clearance. We can reassess in four weeks to make sure it’s working effectively. If it isn’t improving, we can discuss other options. I’ll write you a prescription for clotrimazole cream 1%, to be applied twice daily to the affected areas after washing and drying the skin. I’ll also give you instructions on proper application and hygiene. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor. And reassuring. Thank you. Hygiene…yes, I always wash my hands thoroughly, of course. And I keep everything very clean. Linen, you see, is quite delicate and requires special care. Four weeks…yes, that gives me enough time before the garden party. I do hope it works. It’s a rather important event, you know. My husband’s colleagues will be there. Just one last thing. Is there anything I should avoid in the meantime? Sun exposure, perhaps? Or certain types of soaps? I do have sensitive skin, you see. I wouldn’t want to aggravate the condition.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could reassure you. You’re right to ask about sun exposure and soaps. While not strictly necessary, minimizing sun exposure is a good idea, as it can worsen the discoloration and make it harder to treat. If you must be in the sun, wear protective clothing and a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. As for soaps, avoid harsh, heavily fragranced soaps. Opt for gentle, hypoallergenic cleansers. Cetaphil or CeraVe are good options. I’ll also write a brief note for your primary care physician, informing them of the diagnosis and treatment plan. Here’s the prescription and the instructions. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You've been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you again. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. I do hope this cream works. The garden party is rather important, you know. And I wouldn’t want to disappoint my husband. Well, I suppose I should be going. Thank you once again for your time. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gabbrielle. I’m confident the cream will help. And I understand about the garden party – we want everything to go smoothly. Have a lovely day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Goodbye, and take care.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Goodbye.
