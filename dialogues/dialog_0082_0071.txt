DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. IUZZOLINO. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, it’s about getting some shots, I reckon. My granddaughter… she’s trying to get her husband to come live here from overseas. Something about needing to prove he’s healthy for a visa, and I believe he needs vaccinations. I’m just trying to understand what’s required, if you don’t mind helping me sort it out.
DOCTOR: Of course, I can certainly help with that. It sounds like you’re looking into required vaccinations for visa purposes. That’s very thoughtful of you. Hmm… let’s see. To best advise you, could you tell me a little more about where your granddaughter’s husband is coming from?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Thank you. He's coming from… let me think. It’s a small country… oh! He’s from Nepal. That’s where he’s lived his whole life. I’m not sure what shots they require there to leave, if that even matters. I just want to be sure he has what you require to come here safely.
DOCTOR: Nepal… alright. That helps narrow things down. Yes, it does matter what vaccinations are standard there, but we’ll focus on what’s needed for entry into the United States. According to the CDC guidelines… and I’ll double-check this in a moment… generally, for adults immigrating from Nepal, we look at ensuring they’re up-to-date on routine vaccinations – things like MMR, DTaP, varicella… and then there are some specifically recommended or required vaccines depending on their age and health history. Do you happen to know if he’s had any vaccinations previously?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don't have a clue. He didn’t grow up with the same access to… well, anything really, compared to folks here. I doubt he’s had many, if any, shots at all. He’s a strong young man, though. Healthy as can be, as far as I know. He’s about… oh, 32 years old, I believe. Would that matter?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Thirty-two years old is helpful. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t know his vaccination history – we’ll just proceed as if he hasn’t had any, and get him properly protected. So, generally for an adult with no documented vaccination history, we'll want to consider a series of vaccinations. We’ll definitely look at Tdap – that protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Then, we’ll want to check his immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella – with a blood test. And then there’s varicella, for chickenpox… and influenza and COVID are also recommended, of course. Does that sound… overwhelming?
PATIENT: Well… yes, it does sound like a lot, Doctor. A lot of shots. I was hoping it wouldn’t be that many. Is all of that absolutely necessary for him to get his visa? And… are these shots painful? He’s a good man, but he doesn’t do well at doctors, if you understand. I’m just worried about him getting scared and… refusing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Mr. Skarbek. It is a fair amount, and it’s good you’re thinking about his comfort level. Let me clarify about the necessity. The requirements depend on the specific visa type, and the immigration medical examination. Some vaccinations are legally mandated, and some are strongly recommended. We'll need to document everything accurately for the civil surgeon. As for pain… it’s a quick pinch, really. It’s not comfortable, but it’s over quickly. We can certainly talk about strategies to minimize discomfort – a little ice beforehand, distraction techniques… and I’m very gentle. We can also break up the vaccinations over several appointments if that would be less stressful for him. Would you like me to pull up the specific requirements for a common spousal visa, so we can see exactly what’s needed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be wonderful. Showing me exactly what’s required would ease my mind a lot. And… breaking it up into smaller doses sounds like a very good idea. He’d appreciate that, I think. He’s a strong man, but he’s… easily overwhelmed, if that makes sense. Thank you for being understanding. This is a big help.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, here we are… the requirements for a spousal visa. According to the U.S. Department of State… and I’ll read through the key points… all visa applicants are required to have proof of certain vaccinations. For adults, this includes proof of vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, polio, tetanus and diphtheria, and influenza. Hepatitis B is also recommended, although not strictly required. They also require a completed Form I-693, which is the Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record. We can handle that here in the clinic, of course. Does that list seem… manageable?
PATIENT: Measles, mumps, rubella… tetanus… oh my. That is a lot. Polio, too? I hadn’t even thought about polio. I suppose if it’s required, it’s required. I’m more worried about him being scared of the needles, truthfully. He’s a very… stoic man, and doesn’t like showing weakness. But needles… that’s a different story. Is there anything… anything at all, we can do to help him relax? Maybe some sort of cream to numb the area? Or… would talking to him beforehand, explaining everything, help?
DOCTOR: You're right to focus on his anxiety, Mr. Skarbek. That’s very important. We absolutely can address that. We have a few options. First, we can use a topical anesthetic cream – EMLA cream – to numb the injection site about an hour before the shots. That can significantly reduce the discomfort. Second, we can talk through the procedure beforehand, explain everything step-by-step, and answer any questions he has. Third, distraction techniques are helpful – listening to music, looking away, deep breathing exercises. And finally, I’m very gentle and efficient, and I’ll explain everything as I go. We can also schedule a longer appointment initially, so we’re not rushed. Would you like me to start with a blood test to check his immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… good. All of that sounds good. The cream, the talking… the longer appointment. That would be very helpful. And yes, let’s start with the blood test. See if he’s already got some protection, at least. I appreciate you being so patient with me. And him. It’s just… a lot to take in. I just want him to be able to come here safely, you know?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mr. Skarbek. That’s perfectly natural, and it’s what I’m here for. We'll take it one step at a time. Let’s get that blood test ordered, and then we can schedule an appointment for him to come in. I'll need to get some basic information from him – his date of birth, any allergies, and a list of any medications he's currently taking, if any. Do you have that information readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, I do, thankfully. My granddaughter is very organized. She gave me this just in case. Here you go. His birthday is… August 14th, 1993. No allergies that I know of, and he doesn’t take any medicine regularly. He's a very healthy man, as I said. Just a little… nervous around doctors. He works hard, out in the fields, so he's usually pretty tough. I just worry.
DOCTOR: August 14th, 1993… excellent. No allergies, no medications… that simplifies things. Alright, I’ve ordered the blood test. It's just a standard draw, nothing too invasive. The lab is just down the hall, and they can take care of it anytime today. Once we get the results back, we can discuss the next steps and schedule an appointment for him. We'll take things slow, alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. So, he can just go down the hall, and they’ll take care of it? No need to make an appointment or anything? I was worried about having to schedule everything and keep track of dates. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: No need to worry about scheduling, Mr. Skarbek. You can just walk him down to the lab – Room 203. They accept walk-ins, and it shouldn't take too long. Just tell them Dr. IUZZOLINO ordered the blood test for Karry Skarbek, and they’ll take care of everything. I’ll have the nurse give you a slip with the lab’s phone number, just in case you have any questions. We'll call you when the results are back, usually within a few days. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds wonderful, Doctor. Just walk him down to Room 203… I can do that. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly. You’ve really eased my mind. I think… I think that’s everything for now, isn’t it? I don’t want to take up any more of your time.
