DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Krok is the name, as you know. A... delicate matter, really. One doesn’t simply discuss these things, you understand. But I suppose… well, there's been a… leakage. A discharge, my wife called it. She insisted I come. It's quite bothersome, naturally. And embarrassing. I haven’t the foggiest idea why it's happening, mind you. Old age, I presume. Everything falls apart eventually.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krok. It can be difficult to discuss these things, and it’s very common to feel embarrassed. You’re doing the right thing by coming in, and I assure you, we’ll address this with discretion and find out what’s going on. When you say leakage, could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmmm. Well, it’s… wet. That much is obvious. And… yellowish, I believe. Or perhaps a pale green? My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you see. It certainly isn’t clear, if that makes any sense. And there's a… a scent. Not pleasant, I assure you. It’s not… painful, exactly. More… irritating. A constant nuisance, really. It seems to happen… mostly after I… relieve myself. Does that clarify anything? It’s all rather unpleasant to think about, frankly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Krok. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Yellowish or pale green discharge with an odor, occurring after urination… That gives me a better understanding. To help me narrow down the possibilities, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any burning or discomfort during urination?
PATIENT: Burning… now that you mention it… perhaps a little. Not a searing pain, mind you, just a… sting. A very mild sting, really. It’s easily dismissed, if I’m being honest. I assumed it was simply… age. Everything aches these days. And… now that I think about it… it does feel like I don’t empty my bladder completely sometimes. A little dribbling afterwards. Is that… important? I haven't brought this up to my wife, she worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: That is important, Mr. Krok. Burning with urination, and the sensation of not fully emptying your bladder… Those symptoms, combined with the discharge, are giving me a clearer picture. To get a more complete understanding, I’m going to ask you a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don't believe so. I haven't taken my temperature, mind you, but I haven’t felt feverish. Chills, no. And abdominal pain… well, my stomach is always a bit… unsettled. Old age, again, I presume. Indigestion, mostly. Nothing particularly concerning. A dull ache, perhaps, but nothing sudden or sharp. I do have a bit of… constipation, if that matters. It’s a constant battle, frankly. This is all rather… tedious, isn’t it? So many questions about… that area.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok, and I apologize for asking such personal questions. It's important to gather all the information necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. Constipation is helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather… lean. My wife keeps a close watch on my diet, thankfully. Prostate… now that’s a question. The doctor mentioned it years ago, a routine check, I believe. Something about being enlarged, but he said it wasn't anything to worry about. Just… normal for a man my age. I don't recall the exact terminology. It was… quite some time ago. And I haven't seen that doctor in years. He retired, I believe. I’m not one for frequent visits to the… establishment. Too much fuss, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. That’s helpful. An enlarged prostate years ago… that certainly fits with your symptoms. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. My wife handles most of that. I take a pill for my… blood pressure, I believe. A small white one, once a day. And something for my… cholesterol. A larger, yellow pill. And occasionally, when my joints are particularly… troublesome, I take ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. Nothing else that I can recall. My wife is very particular about what I ingest. She wants me to live to be 100, you see. A rather ambitious goal, frankly. She also makes me take a… fish oil supplement, but I confess, I often forget. It smells dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure medication, cholesterol medication, occasional ibuprofen, and fish oil… Thank you, Mr. Krok. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite… robust, you see. I recall being stung by a bee as a child, but that was decades ago, and I didn't suffer any ill effects. My wife is always very careful about what she feeds me, she doesn’t want me to have any… reactions. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. Certainly nothing serious. Although, I do find that certain foods… disagree with me, if you catch my meaning. But that's hardly an allergy, is it? Just… indigestion. Again. It seems to be my defining characteristic these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, Mr. Krok, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your abdomen, and a gentle examination of the area to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An examination… well, I suppose it's unavoidable, isn't it? I must admit, I'm not particularly fond of doctors poking and prodding, but if it's necessary… very well. Just… please be gentle, Doctor. And discreet. This is all rather… embarrassing, as you can imagine. My wife will be furious if she finds out I've been subjected to… that. She’s very protective, you see. A whirlwind of a woman. Proceed, then. But do be quick about it, if you would.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I completely understand your concerns, and I will be as gentle and discreet as possible. I will explain each step before I perform it. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72. That’s within a normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual sounds detected. Finally, I’m going to need to perform a gentle examination of the area. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. Do you feel any pain or tenderness in this area?
PATIENT: A little… a little discomfort, yes. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. Around… there. It’s not terribly painful, but I can feel something… swollen, perhaps? It’s difficult to describe. It’s not normally like this, I assure you. My wife would have noticed. She’s very… observant. And critical, naturally. But yes, there's definitely some… fullness. And a bit of tenderness. Just be gentle, Doctor. Please. This is all rather… undignified. I feel like a… specimen.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. Thank you for letting me know. I do feel some fullness and tenderness in your prostate area, as you mentioned. It does feel somewhat enlarged, which is consistent with your history and current symptoms. Based on my examination and your reported symptoms – the yellowish discharge, the burning sensation with urination, the incomplete emptying of your bladder, and the tenderness in your prostate area – it’s highly likely you have prostatitis. Prostatitis is an inflammation of the prostate gland, and it can be caused by a bacterial infection or other factors. It’s quite common, especially in men your age. However, to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment, I would like to order a urine test to check for infection, and a prostate-specific antigen test to rule out other potential problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Prostatitis… an inflammation, you say? Well, that sounds… unpleasant. But at least it has a name. It's less unsettling when one knows what one is dealing with. A urine test and… a what-now? A prostate-specific antigen test? Is that… painful? My wife will never forgive me if I’ve subjected myself to unnecessary discomfort. She always says I should have stayed home and rested. If it's necessary, Doctor, then very well. But please assure me it won’t be too… intrusive. And that it will actually help determine the best course of treatment. I haven't the patience for endless tests and procedures. I'm an old man, you see. I simply want this… inflammation… rectified. Quickly and efficiently. Can that be arranged?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok, absolutely. The prostate-specific antigen test is a simple blood test. It measures the level of PSA in your blood, which is a protein produced by the prostate gland. A high level of PSA can indicate inflammation or other potential problems, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It's simply a tool to help us understand what's going on. It's not painful, just a standard blood draw. The urine test will also be straightforward – you'll simply provide a sample. Both tests are quick and relatively painless. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. In most cases, prostatitis can be effectively treated with antibiotics or other medications. I'll have my nurse draw the blood and collect the urine sample now. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate the bladder. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Fluids, yes. My wife is always reminding me to drink more water. Caffeine and alcohol… well, I do enjoy a glass of sherry with dinner. But if it's for the best… very well. I shall abstain. So, a blood test and a urine sample… and then we wait. It sounds… manageable. Just please keep me informed, Doctor. I don’t like being kept in the dark. And I trust you will explain everything thoroughly. I’m an old man, you see. I require clarity and reassurance. Very well, then. Proceed with the tests. And thank you, Doctor. For your patience and… discretion. This has been… less unpleasant than I anticipated. Though I shall be quite relieved when it's all over. Perhaps a glass of sherry will be in order then, to celebrate a swift recovery. Assuming, of course, it's possible.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I’ll keep you informed every step of the way. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect the urine sample. I will review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And yes, a glass of sherry sounds like an excellent idea after a swift recovery.
