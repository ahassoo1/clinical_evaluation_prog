DOCTOR: Right. Alroy, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Alroy Mombrun. It's a pleasure to meet you, Doctor Osga. Though, I must say, your office is… quite cozy. A rural setting suits you, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Cozy is one word for it. Look, I'm a bit swamped today, so if we could just get straight to why you’re here, that'd be helpful. Don’t mean to be rude, but time is… precious. What’s bothering you, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Perfectly understandable. I requested a general wellness panel – a full check-up, really. I'm seventy-four years young, and while I feel quite robust for my age, my wife, Elena, insists I be… thorough. She worries, you see. I wanted to review the results with you, if they are available. No specific complaints, just proactive maintenance, as it were.
DOCTOR: Seventy-four…right. Proactive. Hmm. Okay, let’s see… wellness panel, August 2nd… Yes, here we are. Blood pressure’s a little elevated – 142 over 88. Cholesterol is… borderline high, honestly. Not alarming, but something we should be aware of. Anything else?
PATIENT: Borderline high, you say? Hmm. I do enjoy my arepas, Elena’s are the best, naturally. She uses a good bit of cheese. Is that likely the culprit, Doctor? And 142 over 88… I occasionally enjoy a small glass of red wine with dinner. A good Venezuelan Malbec, of course. Could that be contributing as well? I try to walk daily, perhaps I should increase the distance.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Mombrun, I’m not here to critique your diet. Cheese and wine… yes, those can contribute. It’s fairly basic stuff. What about family history?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. Yes, quite important. My father… he lived a long life, well into his eighties, but suffered from… what we would now call hypertension, I believe. He wasn’t a man for doctors, mind you. Stubborn as a mule, he was. My mother, she passed younger, complications from childbirth, sadly. No heart trouble that I’m aware of on her side. I have two sisters, both still living, and thankfully, both seem to be in good health as well, though we don't speak as often as we should. Does that provide sufficient information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Sufficient, yes. Stubborn fathers… a common story. Alright, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking anything?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Nothing. I pride myself on being a very healthy man, as I mentioned. I take a daily multivitamin, and Elena makes me drink a rather unpleasant herbal tea she swears by for… vitality. But truly, nothing prescribed by a physician. I avoid pills whenever possible. I believe in letting nature take its course, within reason, of course. Do you have any concerns about that, Doctor? Perhaps you feel I should be on something?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Mombrun, I’m getting a picture here. Healthy, stubborn, enjoys cheese and wine… Fine. For a man your age, not being on any medication isn't necessarily a bad thing. But your blood pressure is creeping up. I'm going to order a repeat blood test, just to be sure. And I want you to monitor it at home. I'll have the nurse show you how to use one of those home devices. If it consistently stays above 140/90, we’ll need to talk about starting something. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly understandable. A repeat test and home monitoring. I can certainly do that. Elena will be pleased; she’s been subtly hinting at this for months, I suspect. I appreciate your thoroughness, and I'm happy to comply. Do you have a preferred device you recommend for home monitoring, or is any reliable brand sufficient? And would you like me to bring any specific information with me when I return with the results of the second test?
DOCTOR: Any reliable brand is fine. The nurse will show you what to look for. Bring the results of the test, of course. And a log of your readings. Date, time, blood pressure. Basic stuff, really. Honestly, Mr. Mombrun, I have other patients waiting. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that covers everything splendidly. I appreciate you taking the time. Elena and I thank you for your attention. I'll follow your instructions regarding the repeat test and home monitoring, and I’ll be sure to bring the results and log with me. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Good. The nurse will be in shortly. Don’t bother me with questions, ask her.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall certainly ask the nurse. .
