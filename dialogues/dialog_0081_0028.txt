DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it feels a little funny with it. Been going on for about two weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Two weeks, alright. And you said it feels “funny”?
PATIENT: Yes, funny. Not painful, exactly. More like… tired? Like it’s working harder than it should. I get short of breath sometimes when I walk around the kitchen, even. It’s not like it used to be. I used to be able to run all over, cooking for everyone. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Short of breath with minimal exertion. And this cough… is it productive?
PATIENT: Productive? Oh, goodness. Let me think… yes, I cough up some… phlegm. It’s usually clear, but sometimes it’s a little… yellowish. Not a lot, though. It doesn’t bother me too much, just… there. Does that make sense? I’m not good with those medical words.
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Sadhu. Clear to yellowish phlegm. And has anything changed recently that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Hmm… changed? Well, my grandson, Miguel, he came to visit last month. He had a bit of a cold, but he was careful, he swore. And… oh! The weather has been awful humid lately. Really sticks to you, you know? But nothing else really. I eat the same, sleep the same… I'm an old lady, Doctor, not much changes!
DOCTOR: I understand. And when you say "tired" feeling in your heart, can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a sharp pain, like I said. It's more like… a heaviness. Like someone is sitting on my chest, maybe? And sometimes it feels like it’s… skipping a beat. Not every beat, but sometimes. It worries me because… well, you know, I have this heart trouble. My old doctor, Dr. Ramirez, he used to say it was “congestive heart failure.” Is that what you call it now?
DOCTOR: Congestive heart failure, yes. I see Dr. Ramirez's notes here. And it sounds like your symptoms are… potentially worsening. Let’s do a quick examination, if you don’t mind. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your legs for swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. My legs do feel a little puffy sometimes, now that you mention it. Especially at the end of the day. Go ahead, please. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sadhu. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. Alright. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, and I’m hearing some congestion in your lungs. And your legs do have some swelling, as you mentioned. I'm also noting some crackles in your lungs. This is consistent with a possible exacerbation of your congestive heart failure.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Exacerbation? That sounds… serious. Is that because of the cough? And what does that mean, exactly? Will I have to go to the hospital? I really don't want to go to the hospital, Doctor. It’s so cold there.
DOCTOR: Now, now, Ms. Sadhu, let's not jump to conclusions. An exacerbation simply means your heart failure is currently more active than usual. The cough could be contributing, especially if it's causing you to strain. It’s often triggered by things like infection, or even just changes in the weather. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a clearer picture of what's going on. We'll also do some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out any infection. Based on those results, we can determine the best course of action. It might require a short hospital stay, but we'll see. We’ll start with these tests first. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Tests first, that’s good. I don’t mind the tests. As long as I don’t have to go to the hospital right away. Can someone help me with the X-ray? I'm not as steady on my feet as I used to be. And… what about my medicine? Should I still take it like usual? The little white pills, for my heart?
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will assist you with the X-ray. She’s very good, you’ll be in safe hands. Regarding your medication, yes, continue taking your usual dose of your heart medication as prescribed until we have the results of the tests. Do not stop or change anything without my instruction. It's important to keep that consistent. We’ll decide if any adjustments are needed based on the results. I’m also going to prescribe you a diuretic—a water pill—to help reduce the fluid buildup in your lungs and legs. This should help with your breathing and swelling. It's a low dose to start. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. Not that I know of. Dr. Ramirez gave me something for my arthritis years ago, and I didn’t have any trouble with that. But other than that, no. I'm pretty good with medicines, usually. And… a water pill? Will that make me have to go to the bathroom a lot? I already have to get up several times at night as it is.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sadhu, a diuretic will likely increase your urination. That's how it helps remove the excess fluid. We’ll start with a low dose, as I mentioned, to minimize that effect. It’s best to take it in the morning to avoid disrupting your sleep. I also want you to limit your salt intake. It causes your body to retain fluid, which is exactly what we’re trying to avoid. Now, do you understand everything I’ve explained so far?
PATIENT: Well… mostly. The tests, the medicine, the salt… and the water pill making me go to the bathroom more. It sounds like a lot to remember. But I think I can manage. Just… to be clear, you don’t think I need to go to the hospital right now? As long as I take the tests and the pills and don't eat much salt?
DOCTOR: That is correct, Ms. Sadhu. At this moment, we are not recommending a hospital stay. We are starting with these conservative measures—the tests, the medication, the dietary changes—to see if we can manage your symptoms effectively. However, if your symptoms worsen—if you become severely short of breath, experience chest pain, or develop a high fever—you must go to the emergency room immediately, regardless of the time of day. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Short of breath, chest pain, or fever… go to the emergency room. I’ll remember that. Alright. When can I expect to get the results of the tests? And where will the nurse take me for the X-ray? I’m a little nervous, you know. Old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be in shortly to take you for the X-ray. It shouldn’t take long. And the results of the tests should be available within a few hours. I will review them as soon as they are available and contact you—or your family, if you prefer—to discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me before I let the nurse come in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough. Thank you. I’ll just sit here quietly and wait, then. And try to remember everything you told me.
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Sadhu. I'll have the nurse come in right away. Please don't hesitate to call if you think of anything else. .
PATIENT: .
