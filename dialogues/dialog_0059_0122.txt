DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you are 53 years old. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure as well. Yes, fifty-three. I am here because… well, things have been… slipping, I suppose. My memory. It is becoming… troublesome. Especially with my blood pressure being… not good.
DOCTOR: I understand. Memory problems can be quite concerning, and it's good you're addressing them, especially alongside managing your blood pressure. “Slipping,” you say. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… difficult to explain. Small things. I will go to put the kettle on, and… forget why I went to the kitchen. Or I will speak with someone, a neighbor, perhaps, and… the name will be gone the moment they are out of sight. It is not… everything. Just… pieces. Very frustrating, you understand?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Ms. Alvara. That sounds very frustrating indeed. Forgetting names or the reason you went to another room – those are common experiences, but when they become frequent, it's important to investigate. To get a better picture, let's start with how long this has been going on. Would you say this started recently, or has it been a gradual process over weeks or months?
PATIENT: It is… gradual. Perhaps six months, maybe longer? It began… slowly. A missed appointment here, a forgotten grocery item there. I thought it was just… stress. My husband… passed away two years ago, you see. I attributed it to that. But it is… more now. It is not just forgetting what I needed, but sometimes… where I was going.
DOCTOR: I see. Losing your husband two years ago must have been incredibly difficult, and grief can certainly impact memory and concentration. It’s understandable you initially attributed these changes to that. Six months of gradual worsening is helpful information. To get a clearer understanding, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Yes, it was… a great loss. A typical day… I wake early. I used to walk with Dmitri, my husband, every morning. Now, I make tea, and… I try to do some gardening. I manage several properties, you see. Real estate. It keeps me busy. I answer emails, speak with tenants, arrange repairs. In the evenings, I… read, or watch television. I try to stay active, but… this forgetting makes it difficult to schedule things. I worry I will miss an important appointment.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very full and active life, Ms. Alvara. Managing properties is certainly demanding. It's good you’re trying to stay active. You mentioned worrying about missing appointments - has that actually happened?
PATIENT: Yes. Twice. Once with a… a contractor regarding some roof repairs. And another time, with a potential tenant viewing a property. Both times, I simply… did not remember. I had written them in my calendar, of course, but… I did not look at the calendar. I found out later, from the contractor and the estate agent. It was… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. That is concerning, Ms. Alvara. And understandably frustrating and embarrassing. It’s good you’re recognizing this is becoming a problem, and that you came in to discuss it. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of, besides the blood pressure issues you mentioned?
PATIENT: Yes, the blood pressure is… consistently high, my doctor tells me. I have been told to watch my diet, take less salt. I… try. But it is difficult. Otherwise… I had a hysterectomy many years ago, perhaps twenty years. And my knees… they ache, especially in cold weather. Nothing serious, just… arthritis, I suppose. No other… major illnesses.
DOCTOR: Thank you. High blood pressure, a hysterectomy twenty years ago, and some arthritis in your knees. Are you currently taking any medications for any of these conditions?
PATIENT: Yes. For the blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it is called. Ten milligrams, every morning. And… sometimes, ibuprofen for the knees, when they are particularly painful. Not every day, just when needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I am aware of. I have eaten… everything. And I have lived in Russia my whole life. Cold weather, dust, pollen… I am accustomed to it. Never had a… reaction.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any instances of memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My mother… she became forgetful in her later years. But it was… old age, we thought. She was very old, ninety-two. My father… he had a stroke, but it affected his… speech, not his memory. My grandmother… I do not recall. I was very young when she passed away. Nothing… specific, no. No one was… formally diagnosed, if that is what you mean.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Alvara. It's common for memory changes to occur with age, and it’s good to know about the history of stroke in your father. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My mother did, unfortunately, but I… I did not like the smell. Always preferred fresh air. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But… only one. Occasionally two, if it is a special occasion.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking, and occasional social drinking. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your typical diet?
PATIENT: It is… not very good, I admit. I try to eat healthy, but it is difficult when you live alone. Lots of potatoes, vegetables, some meat. I enjoy soups, borscht especially. But… I do enjoy salty foods. Pickles, cured meats. I know I should cut back, but… it is a habit. I do not drink much sugar, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment – checking your reflexes, balance, and cognitive function. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I just… want to know what is happening. And hopefully… do something about it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat here, and I’ll take a reading. Okay, your blood pressure is 150 over 92. A bit elevated, as expected. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but there's a slight murmur. Nothing concerning at this time, but we'll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Okay, your reflexes are normal. Your gait is a little unsteady, but that could be due to age or the arthritis in your knees. Finally, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your cognitive function. I'll ask you to recall a few words and do a simple calculation. This is just a quick screening tool. Do you mind?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. I understand. Go ahead, please. I will do my best. My memory… it is not what it once was, but I will try to remember.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright, I'm going to say three words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me. Then I'll ask you to recall them later. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those for me, please?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Yes. Those three words. I… think I have them.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions about your current location and the date. Do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… 2025, is it not? August, the second.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a good question. It is a suburban area, I know. A quiet place. But the name… escapes me. I see the shops, the houses… but the city’s name… no.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. It’s understandable. Now, I'm going to ask you to do a simple calculation. If you have 10 apples and you give 3 away, how many apples do you have left?
PATIENT: Ten… minus three… is… seven. Seven apples. I… believe that is correct.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, can you please recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… Apple… I remember Apple. And… Table, yes. But the third word… it is… on the tip of my tongue. It was something small… shiny… A… Penny! Yes, Penny. Apple, Table, Penny. Did I remember correctly?
DOCTOR: Yes, you remembered all three words correctly! That’s very good. Okay, Ms. Alvara, that concludes the brief exam. Based on your history, your symptoms, and the exam findings, I'm concerned about possible mild cognitive impairment. Your memory issues are concerning, and the slight unsteadiness and elevated blood pressure are factors we need to address. It's important to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I recommend some further testing, including blood work to check your vitamin levels and thyroid function, and an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I would be very comfortable with that. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what is happening. And hopefully… do something about it. The MRI… it sounds a little… frightening, but if it will help… yes, please.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel anxious about an MRI, Ms. Alvara, but it's a safe and painless procedure. It will give us valuable information. I'm also going to prescribe you a medication to help lower your blood pressure. Lisinopril 20mg once daily. And I recommend lifestyle modifications, including a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and stress reduction techniques. I’ll write you a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and management of your cognitive issues. They are the specialists in this area and can provide a more comprehensive assessment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at this moment. You have… explained everything very clearly. Just… when will I be able to schedule the MRI? And the appointment with the neurologist? I am… eager to get this sorted, if that is not too forward of me.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Alvara. It's good you're proactive. My nurse, Sarah, will schedule both the MRI and the neurology appointment for you before you leave. She'll also give you detailed instructions on how to prepare for the MRI. I anticipate the neurology appointment will be within the next few weeks, and the MRI can usually be scheduled fairly quickly as well. In the meantime, please start the Lisinopril as directed and try to focus on a healthier lifestyle. I'll also give you a handout with information about memory strategies and resources for support. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have been… very kind. And helpful. Thank you. I… I appreciate your time. And your patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Sarah will be with you shortly to schedule your appointments and provide you with the necessary information. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Goodbye. .
