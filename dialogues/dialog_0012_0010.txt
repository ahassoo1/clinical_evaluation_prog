DOCTOR: Hi Jahaad, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Dr. Yoshino. Well, to be frank, I’ve noticed some swelling… it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely where it started, or even when exactly. My memory isn’t the best, I’m afraid. But it’s… noticeable, and a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all about the memory – we’ll take it slow. "Noticeable" and "uncomfortable" are good starting points. Can you tell me a little more about the swelling?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my face, I think. My cheeks, perhaps? And maybe around my jawline. It’s not terribly painful, more… puffy. It feels tight, if that makes sense. Like when you've cried for a long time, but… not from crying. I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… hard to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jahaad. It's helpful to know it's in your face, cheeks and jawline, and that it feels tight and puffy rather than painful. When did you first notice this swelling?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. Honestly, it feels like it’s been gradually getting worse over the last… week or two? It’s difficult to say for certain. I didn’t pay much attention at first, I suppose. I just assumed it was… tiredness, perhaps? I’ve been rather busy with work lately. I truly wish I could give you a more precise timeframe.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over the last week or two, that’s helpful. And you've been busy with work. Have you noticed anything else accompanying the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I think I’ve been a little more tired than usual, yes. And… perhaps a bit more thirsty? I’ve been drinking a lot more water lately, without really realizing why. And… oh! My skin feels a little warmer than usual, if that makes sense? Not feverish, just… warmer to the touch. Does any of that sound relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that all sounds relevant, Jahaad. Increased thirst, feeling warmer, and the swelling… Okay. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No fever, chills, or night sweats. I've been sleeping alright, all things considered. I did have a bit of a headache yesterday, but I often get headaches. I didn’t think much of it at the time. It was quite mild, really. I took a pain reliever and it went away. Is this… concerning?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or night sweats, and a mild headache yesterday that responded to pain relief. It's good that the headache improved. I want to get a better picture of things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. As far as I know, no. I don’t think I have any allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. I can eat pretty much anything. And I haven't experienced any skin rashes or breathing difficulties that I associate with allergies. I’ve taken antibiotics before, without any issues. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies. And you’ve tolerated antibiotics without issue. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I don't take any regular medications, prescription or over-the-counter. I occasionally take a pain reliever for headaches, as I mentioned, but that’s it. And I don’t take any supplements… vitamins or anything like that. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I don’t really feel the need for supplements.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no medications or supplements. Great. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, kidney issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been relatively healthy, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing – but I haven’t been seriously ill. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything like high blood pressure or diabetes. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, but that’s it, really. I don’t think there’s much else to report, truthfully. I've never spent much time in hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tonsillectomy as a child, but otherwise healthy, no chronic conditions. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: That's a bit harder to recall… My mother, she has… high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some heart issues when he was older, but I don’t know the specifics. He’s no longer with us, so I don't have much information. I have one sibling, a sister, and she's healthy as far as I know. We don’t speak very often, so I’m not really aware of her medical history. I wish I could provide more details, but my family isn’t very forthcoming with such things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure in your mother and some heart issues in your father. That's helpful to know. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I work as a Speech-Language Pathologist, so my job is quite active – lots of talking, listening, and moving around. I enjoy my work very much. I live alone, in a small apartment. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. I don't smoke, and I drink alcohol only occasionally, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner. I try to get regular exercise, although I haven't been as diligent lately due to work commitments. I wouldn’t say I lead a particularly stressful lifestyle, although work can be demanding at times. Is there anything specific you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a Speech-Language Pathologist, healthy diet, occasional alcohol, no smoking, and generally not a stressful lifestyle. That all sounds good. I see here your height is listed as 168 cm and weight as 126 kg. Do you mind confirming those numbers?
PATIENT: Oh. That...doesn't sound right. 126 kilograms? No, that’s… definitely incorrect. I’m much smaller than that. I believe my weight is closer to 70 kilograms, perhaps 72. And my height is about 168 centimetres, yes, that part is correct. There seems to be a mistake in the records. It's easy to misread numbers, I suppose. I apologize for the confusion.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Jahaad, thank you for pointing that out. It's good to get accurate information. Okay, so 70-72 kg. That changes things a little. Alright, with your permission, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your face and jawline. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Dr. Yoshino. Please, proceed. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a nice deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or unusual sounds that I can detect. Lungs are clear as well. This might feel a little tight… Okay, 130/80. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now, let's take a look at your face… I do notice some mild swelling in your cheeks and jawline, as you described. It's not pitting edema – meaning it doesn't leave an indentation when I press on it. Your skin feels warm to the touch. I don’t see any redness or rash. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s not painful, just… tight. And a little uncomfortable, perhaps. It’s difficult to describe. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… pressure. It feels like there's something…full, inside my cheeks. It's not a constant pain, it comes and goes. More noticeable when I talk or chew, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, not sharp pain, more of a tightness and pressure, particularly when talking or chewing. Alright, Jahaad. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we should consider. The swelling in your cheeks and jawline, along with your increased thirst and warmer skin, could be suggestive of several things. One possibility is salivary gland inflammation, like sialadenitis, though the lack of pain makes that less likely. Another is parotid gland swelling. It’s also possible this is related to a sinus infection, though you don’t mention any nasal congestion or drainage. It could even be something as simple as a reaction to something you ate. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count will help us rule out infection, and we can also check your kidney and liver function. I’d also recommend a CT scan of your head and neck to get a better look at your salivary glands and sinuses. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Blood tests and a CT scan, yes, that seems sensible. If that’s what you recommend, Dr. Yoshino, then I trust your judgment. Are these tests… expensive? I do have private insurance, but I worry about the cost.
DOCTOR: That's a valid concern, Jahaad. Let me check your insurance coverage to get an estimate of the costs. Okay, it looks like your insurance should cover the majority of the blood tests and the CT scan, with a reasonable co-pay. I'll have my staff contact your insurance company to confirm the exact amount and pre-authorize the CT scan. They can also discuss payment options with you if needed. In the meantime, to be on the safe side, I'd like to prescribe you an antibiotic as a preventative measure, in case this is related to an infection. It’s a relatively mild one, Amoxicillin. We’ll see how you respond to that, and the blood tests and CT scan will help us refine the diagnosis. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. An antibiotic as a preventative measure, and then the tests to confirm… I appreciate you checking my insurance coverage, Dr. Yoshino. That puts my mind at ease. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any specific foods I should avoid? Or anything I should watch out for that would indicate I need to seek medical attention sooner?
DOCTOR: Good questions. For now, try to drink plenty of fluids – water is best. Avoid overly salty or sugary foods, as those can contribute to swelling. And avoid anything that requires a lot of chewing – softer foods are easier on your jaw. "Watch out for:" I’ve written down a few things here. "High fever , difficulty breathing or swallowing, severe pain in your face or jaw, or any new numbness or weakness." If you experience any of those symptoms, please go to the emergency room immediately. We’ll get the lab order and CT scan request sent to the lab and imaging center. My staff will contact you to schedule those appointments. We'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we'll discuss a plan from there. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: High fever, difficulty breathing, severe pain… Yes, that’s very helpful. I appreciate you being so thorough, Dr. Yoshino. No, I believe that answers everything. You’ve addressed all of my concerns. Thank you again for your time and attention. I’ll wait to hear from your staff about scheduling the tests.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And remember, if anything changes or you experience any new symptoms, don’t wait – please contact us immediately. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and take care.
