DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I’m Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit… strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and kind of yellow – my skin, you know? And it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It’s happened a couple of times now, and I’m starting to get worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, tired and yellowing of the skin, and you’ve noticed it after eating fava beans. That is a little unusual. Can you tell me more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just feeling a little sleepy, you know? It’s… like all my energy is just gone. Even simple things, like walking up the stairs or doing a bit of gardening, leave me completely wiped out. It started a few weeks ago, I think, but it’s been getting worse lately. And the yellowing… that’s pretty new, maybe a week or so. It started in my eyes, I think, and now it’s on my skin too. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so progressive fatigue over a few weeks, worsening recently, and now you’re noticing yellowing of the skin and eyes—that's jaundice. It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. Let's get a bit more detail. When you say after eating fava beans, how soon after eating them does this start?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s not right after, like immediately. I’d say within a day or two, maybe? I eat them, and I feel fine. Then the next day, or the day after that, I start feeling tired, and then I notice the yellowing. It’s hard to say exactly, because sometimes I don’t connect it right away. I just feel bad, and then I realize… oh, I ate fava beans recently. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A delayed reaction is helpful information. And it sounds like you’re making a connection between the fava beans and these symptoms. Have you always eaten fava beans, or is this something new?
PATIENT: Oh, I’ve always eaten them! My grandmother, she was Romanian, and she used to make a dish with them all the time. I loved it. We had it every summer. I haven’t had it every year, but I’ve been eating them on and off for… well, my whole life, really. This is the first time I’ve ever noticed this happening, though. It’s really strange. I’m starting to worry it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, lifelong fava bean consumption with a new onset of symptoms. That’s…significant. It does point us in a certain direction. Before we go further, let’s get a more complete picture. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I've been a bit more short of breath than usual, especially when I'm trying to do something active. And… oh, and my urine is darker than it normally is, almost tea-colored. I didn't really think much of it, just figured I wasn't drinking enough water, but now that you ask… yeah, my pee is darker. I haven’t had a fever or anything like that, and no stomach pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath and dark urine are important additions. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’m generally pretty healthy. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that’s it. And I don’t take any regular medications, just the occasional pain reliever for a headache. I’ve never been allergic to anything, as far as I know. My grandmother had some heart trouble, but that was a long time ago. Does the gallbladder removal matter?
DOCTOR: The gallbladder removal is good to know, but likely not directly related to what’s going on now. Let's talk about this fatigue and jaundice in relation to the fava beans... Have you noticed any other foods that seem to trigger these symptoms?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I haven't specifically tried other foods, to be honest. After the first time this happened, I just avoided fava beans. I haven't really thought about looking for other triggers. I suppose I haven't really considered that it might not be the beans themselves, but something about them. Is that possible? I feel a little silly for not thinking of that sooner.
DOCTOR: No, not silly at all. It's good you're asking questions. It is possible. Now, I need to do a quick physical exam. Could you please hop up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently press on your abdomen. Then I'll take a look at your eyes and skin more closely. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Now another one. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. It feels… normal, I guess. A little sensitive, maybe, but nothing major. Like, it’s not painful, just… aware of your hand. And my lungs feel okay, I think. I haven't been coughing or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just checking your sclera—the whites of your eyes. Yes, I do see some yellowing, as you mentioned. And yes, some jaundice is present here as well. Your heart sounds normal, lungs are clear. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m seeing, I’m concerned about a condition called G6PD deficiency. It’s an enzyme deficiency that can cause someone to become sensitive to certain foods, like fava beans. It causes a breakdown of red blood cells, which explains the fatigue, jaundice, and dark urine. It's not uncommon, especially in people with certain ethnic backgrounds. I want to order a G6PD enzyme level test, and a complete blood count. It's a simple blood draw. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: That sounds… scary, honestly. But okay, if that’s what you think is best. I mean, I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it is something serious. A blood test sounds fine. Is it something I should be really worried about? And is it… hereditary? My grandmother was Romanian, like I said… would that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ms. Haggar. It’s good we're looking into this. G6PD deficiency itself isn't usually life-threatening, if you avoid the triggers. It’s more about managing the condition. And yes, it is hereditary, meaning it’s passed down through families. It is more common in people of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and African descent, so your grandmother's Romanian heritage fits. We need the test results to confirm, but it's definitely a possibility. I’ll order those tests now, and the lab will call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, it’s best to avoid fava beans and any other foods you’re unsure about. I'm also going to order a reticulocyte count, which will tell us how your body is making new red blood cells. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Avoiding the beans is easy enough. So, if it is that, I just… never eat them again? And what about other foods? Should I be worried about anything else? And is there anything I should be feeling for, like… if it's getting worse? I'm a little overwhelmed, to be honest. It's good to know what might be going on, but it's also a bit scary. .
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, and I understand your anxiety. To answer your questions, yes, if it’s G6PD deficiency, avoiding fava beans is usually the main thing. There's a list of other foods and medications to avoid, which I’ll give you with the test results. It's not a huge list, but it’s important to be aware of it. As for feeling for anything, keep an eye out for increasing fatigue, shortness of breath, or yellowing of your skin. If you notice any dark urine, that’s also something to be aware of. If you experience any chest pain or feel very weak, seek medical attention immediately. We'll review the results together as soon as they come in and create a plan for managing this. Here's some information to review while you wait for the lab results. Do you have any other concerns before we wrap up for today?
