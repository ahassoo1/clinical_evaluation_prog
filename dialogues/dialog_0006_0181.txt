DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I requested a general wellness panel, you see. Just thought it was time for a check-up, make sure everything is still in order. I’m feeling quite well, thankfully, but one can never be too careful, eh?
DOCTOR: Right, a general wellness check-up. Good idea. Always best to be proactive. Hmm... seventy-four, you said?
PATIENT: Indeed, Doctor. Seventy-four years this past March. Though I feel more like sixty on a good day! My wife always says I’m a young man at heart. She’s probably right, she usually is.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear. Alright, let’s just go through a few things. Do you have any specific concerns at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. That's precisely why I scheduled this – no specific complaints, thankfully! Just wanting to get a good overview, you understand? Make sure my numbers are where they ought to be. I’ve been quite diligent with my diet and exercise, for a man of my age, at least. Perhaps we can discuss those results later?
DOCTOR: Good, good. So, no recent changes in your health?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing significant. No sudden illnesses, no new aches or pains that haven't come and gone on their own. My energy levels have been steady, I sleep well – about seven hours a night, usually. And my appetite is… robust, shall we say? I do enjoy my food, you see.
DOCTOR: Seven hours of sleep, good appetite... alright. Have you been taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, Doctor. My cardiologist suggested it a few years back, just as a preventative measure. And occasionally, ibuprofen for a bit of muscle soreness after working on the house. But nothing regular, truly. I prefer to avoid pills whenever possible, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Aspirin, ibuprofen as needed… good to know. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not to foods, medications, or anything else, as far as I know. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. My wife teases me, says I should be more careful, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. We’ve travelled quite a bit, and I’ve never had any issues with new foods or plants.
DOCTOR: No known allergies... excellent. And just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a few. Back in Venezuela, I had my appendix removed when I was quite young – perhaps ten years old. And then, about fifteen years ago, I had a knee replacement. It’s been quite successful, thankfully. I can walk without much discomfort these days, thankfully. Nothing else, though. Just the two, really.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal, knee replacement... alright. Now, how about your family history?
PATIENT: Ah, family history… a bit of a mixed bag, I’m afraid. My father lived to a good age – eighty-five – but he had some heart trouble towards the end. My mother passed away younger, at seventy, from complications with diabetes. And my only brother, he sadly passed away a few years ago from… well, from cancer. Lung cancer, I believe. It’s why I’m so careful with my health, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. Heart trouble, diabetes, lung cancer… Thank you for sharing that. Let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life, Doctor. My wife would never allow it! And I drink… very occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on a special occasion. But I wouldn’t say I’m a drinker, certainly not. I prefer a good cup of coffee, if I'm honest. And plenty of water. It’s the key to a good life, you see.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol… good. Now, what do you do to stay active?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned, I like to keep busy. I do a bit of gardening, mostly vegetables, and I enjoy working on my house. It always needs something done, you see! I also walk most days, about a mile or so. Nothing strenuous, but enough to keep the blood flowing. And, of course, I love to dance with my wife! We go to a little social club a couple of times a month, it’s good exercise, and good for the soul.
DOCTOR: Gardening, walking, dancing… wonderful. Alright, Mr. Mombrun, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Yes, please do. I have no objections at all. I’m quite comfortable with that. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don’t mind, please sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. First, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning at this time. Pulse is 72 and regular. Let me listen to your heart now... Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let me take a look in your ears... Ears are clear, no signs of infection. And finally, let me take a look in your throat... Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything seems to be in order, physically. Now, let me just check your reflexes... Reflexes are normal.
PATIENT: That’s reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you being so thorough. So, what does all this mean? Is there anything I need to be concerned about? I understand you'll be reviewing the lab panel results as well.
DOCTOR: Well, physically, everything looks good. As I said, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that could be a number of things. We'll need to see what the lab results show to get a more complete picture. Based on your history and the physical exam, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. Just to make sure everything is functioning optimally. We should have those results back in a few days.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. A comprehensive approach is always best. I trust your judgment entirely. And a few days is perfectly acceptable. So, just to be clear, you’ll contact me when the results are available? And is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any dietary adjustments or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, my office will contact you as soon as the results are in. And in the meantime… continue with your healthy lifestyle. Focus on a balanced diet, low in sodium and saturated fats. Continue with the walking and dancing – that's excellent. I wouldn’t worry too much about specific dietary changes until we see the results. We’ll make a plan based on those. Just keep an eye out for any new symptoms, anything that’s concerning, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring, Doctor. I will certainly do that. Balanced diet, keep active, and await the results. It sounds perfectly reasonable. Thank you for your time and attention. I feel much better having had this check-up. I appreciate you taking such good care of me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It was my pleasure. And remember, don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Goodbye.
