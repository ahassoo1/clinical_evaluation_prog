DOCTOR: Hi Evann, it's good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is pleasant to meet you as well. I... believe I am here regarding some paperwork. Advance directives, or perhaps a POLST form? It was suggested to me, and frankly, my recollection of the specifics is rather... hazy. I understand it concerns wishes for future medical care, should I become unable to communicate them myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Advance directives and POLST forms… it is good to get those in order, even if it feels a little daunting. A lot of people find it helpful to have those conversations now, just to be prepared. So, to clarify – you’re looking to create or update these documents?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Create, I believe. Though, as I mentioned, my memory isn’t what it once was. I don’t recall having completed anything of this nature previously, but I cannot be entirely certain. It's… frustrating. Is there a difference between the two forms, perhaps? If it wouldn't be too much trouble to explain?
DOCTOR: Not at all, it’s a very common question! An advance directive is a broader document – it outlines your wishes for medical care in general, should you become unable to speak for yourself. It can include things like a living will and a durable power of attorney for healthcare. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is more specific. It's actually a medical order, based on your wishes, that tells healthcare providers what treatments you want—or don’t want—in a crisis. It's usually for people with serious illnesses or who are frail. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that is helpful. The distinction is becoming clearer, thank you. So, the POLST is… actively directing care, while the advance directive is more… guiding principles? And it sounds as though, given my… general good health, the advance directive would be the more appropriate starting point. Is that correct? It's just… a bit overwhelming to consider, to be perfectly honest.
DOCTOR: Exactly. An advance directive would be a great place to start, given your health. It's wonderful that you're thinking about this now. And it is a lot to consider, absolutely. We can take it slow, and I’m here to help you through the process. Before we dive into the specifics of the document itself, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. My overall health... is reasonably good, I believe. I work as an etcher, which requires a steady hand and… focus. I try to maintain a healthy diet, though I confess I have a weakness for pastries. I’ve not been to a doctor in quite some time, truthfully. I haven’t experienced any major ailments, or… chronic conditions. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Is there anything specific you are concerned about? Or, perhaps, a particular area I should focus on when considering these directives?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! It’s good you’re active and haven’t had major health concerns. And the pastry indulgence is perfectly acceptable – everything in moderation, right?
PATIENT: Precisely. Though, my former spouse was of a different opinion. He was rather… strict regarding diet. But I digress. Perhaps we should focus on the directives themselves, then? If you have a questionnaire, or a starting point, that would be most helpful. I want to ensure my wishes are… clearly articulated, even if I find the process somewhat daunting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. This packet has some questions to get us started. It covers things like your values, preferences for life-sustaining treatment, and who you'd want to make decisions on your behalf if you were unable to. Take your time, and feel free to ask me anything as you go through it. There’s no rush. We can go through it section by section if that’s easier. Would you like me to leave the room while you start, or would you prefer I stay?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I believe… I would prefer you remain, if you don’t mind. It might be… helpful to have someone present, just in case I have questions as I proceed. And honestly, having a quiet room to focus will be beneficial. It’s just… sometimes the thoughts don't come as easily as they once did. Would it be alright to ask for clarification if I misinterpret a question? I apologize in advance for any… inefficiency.
DOCTOR: Of course, Evann. That’s perfectly alright. It's completely normal to have questions, and I'm here to help in any way I can. There's absolutely no need to apologize for taking your time or asking for clarification – we're doing this together, to ensure your wishes are clearly documented. Let’s start with the first section, then. It asks about your overall values and what’s important to you in life. Just take your time and answer as honestly as you can. And please, don't hesitate to stop me if anything is unclear.
PATIENT: “What gives your life meaning?”… It’s a rather broad question, isn’t it? My work, certainly. Creating something beautiful… preserving a moment in time. And… my independence, I suppose. Though, that’s becoming increasingly difficult. I’m unsure if that’s a sufficient answer. Or, if I’m even understanding the question correctly. It feels… philosophical. Is there a more practical way to approach this?
DOCTOR: You're right, it is a broad question! It's meant to get you thinking about what’s truly important to you, and how that might influence your medical decisions. There’s no right or wrong answer, and you’re interpreting it perfectly well. Think of it this way: if you were facing a difficult medical choice, what aspects of your life would you want to protect?
PATIENT: My… my ability to create. That is paramount. The freedom to continue my work, to express myself. And… perhaps my sense of dignity. I've always valued my independence. I wouldn't want to be… a burden. I'm unsure if that conveys what I mean. It feels… inadequate. Is it acceptable to list multiple values? Or is it seeking a singular, overriding principle? I apologize for my hesitation. This is… more challenging than I anticipated.
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful answer, Evann, and perfectly acceptable. It's absolutely fine to list multiple values. In fact, it’s better to list multiple values – it gives us a more complete picture. “Ability to create”, “freedom to continue your work”, and “sense of dignity” are all excellent points. These are important things to us, and it's wonderful that you’re able to articulate them. We can certainly note all of those down. Let’s move on to the next question, then. It asks about your preferences for life-sustaining treatment. It's a bit more direct, but we can take it slow. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Though, I confess, I find the concept of “life-sustaining treatment” rather… unsettling. It implies a situation I prefer not to contemplate. But I understand it is necessary, so I shall attempt to address the questions as honestly as possible. Is there a glossary of terms, perhaps? Just in case I encounter something unfamiliar? I don’t want to misinterpret the options and inadvertently… make a decision I wouldn’t otherwise choose.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a very good idea. This booklet explains some of the common terms used in advance directives, like “CPR”, “mechanical ventilation”, and “artificial nutrition”. Feel free to refer to it as you go through the questions. It is a difficult topic, and it's perfectly normal to feel uneasy about it. We'll go through it at your pace, and I'm here to explain anything that's unclear. The first question is about CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It asks if you would want to receive CPR if your heart stopped beating. Do you want me to explain what CPR involves before you look at the options?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I believe I have a vague recollection of what CPR entails… chest compressions, breathing assistance, but my memory is… fragmented. A concise explanation would be most helpful. And perhaps a gentle warning if the description is… graphic? I apologize for my… sensitivities. This is… a rather overwhelming process.
DOCTOR: Of course, Evann. Absolutely no apologies necessary. CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation – is a life-saving technique used when someone’s heart has stopped beating. It involves chest compressions to circulate blood and rescue breaths to provide oxygen. It’s often depicted in movies and television, so you might be familiar with it. It can be physically demanding and doesn't always work, but it’s the standard treatment for cardiac arrest. It can involve breaking ribs, and there is a risk of other complications. Does that explanation help?
PATIENT: Yes… that is… clarifying. It sounds… rather aggressive. And the potential complications… unpleasant. I confess, the thought of broken ribs… unnerving. I believe… I would prefer not to receive CPR. If it is unlikely to be successful, and carries the risk of further discomfort, I would rather… allow nature to take its course. Is that an acceptable response? I understand this is a rather… solemn decision.
DOCTOR: That is absolutely an acceptable response, Evann. It’s a very thoughtful and courageous decision, and you have the right to make that choice. We will document your wishes clearly, and I want to be sure you understand the implications. Just to clarify – you’re stating that if your heart stops beating and there is a low likelihood of successful resuscitation, you would prefer not to receive CPR. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Precisely. I understand it may be… unconventional, but I have given it considerable thought. I would rather focus on preserving my dignity and… avoiding unnecessary suffering. And if, as you say, success is improbable, then it seems… pointless. I apologize for my… morbidity. This is… a difficult conversation. Perhaps we should proceed to the next question? If it does not involve… bodily interventions?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Evann. No apologies needed. You're being very thoughtful and proactive, and I commend you for having this conversation. The next question focuses on mechanical ventilation – a breathing machine. It asks if you would want to receive mechanical ventilation if you were unable to breathe on your own. It doesn't involve any immediate physical interventions, so it might be a bit easier to discuss. Would you like me to explain what mechanical ventilation entails before you look at the options?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Mechanical ventilation… I believe I have a vague understanding, a machine assisting with respiration. But the specifics… and the potential implications… remain unclear. If you could provide a concise explanation, that would be most helpful. And, if I may ask… what are the typical circumstances that necessitate such intervention? Is it usually a temporary measure, or… something more prolonged? I apologize for my… inquisitiveness. I simply wish to be fully informed before making a decision.
DOCTOR: Of course, Evann. That's perfectly alright. It’s good to ask questions. Mechanical ventilation involves using a machine to help you breathe. A tube is inserted into your airway, and the machine delivers air into your lungs. It's often used when someone is unable to breathe on their own due to a serious illness or injury, like pneumonia, a stroke, or a severe asthma attack. Sometimes it’s temporary, used for a few days until someone recovers. Other times, it can be more prolonged, especially if someone has a chronic condition. It can be life-saving, but it also has potential complications, like infection and discomfort. Does that explanation help?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… clarifying. A tube inserted into the airway… that sounds… unpleasant. And the potential complications… concerning. I believe… I would prefer to avoid mechanical ventilation, if at all possible. Unless it is a short-term measure, with a high probability of recovery. I wish to avoid prolonged dependence on machinery, if I can. Is that a reasonable request? And, if I may ask… what constitutes a “high probability of recovery”? What criteria are considered? I apologize for my… persistence. I simply wish to ensure my wishes are clearly understood.
DOCTOR: That is absolutely a reasonable request, Evann. We will document your preference to avoid prolonged mechanical ventilation. And it’s good you’re asking about the criteria for a “high probability of recovery.” Typically, we would consider a short-term need, such as a few days to a week, with a clear underlying cause that is likely to resolve. For example, if you developed pneumonia and needed ventilation for a few days while you recovered, that would be a reasonable scenario. However, if you had a chronic condition that required prolonged ventilation, we would respect your wishes and avoid it. We would, of course, discuss your specific situation with you at the time and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable, Doctor. A short-term need, with a clear path to recovery… that is acceptable. And the assurance of a thorough discussion, with all the relevant information… reassuring. I believe I am beginning to feel… less overwhelmed. Perhaps we should proceed to the next question? If it does not involve… invasive procedures? I apologize for my… apprehension. This is… a difficult process, but I am grateful for your patience and guidance.
DOCTOR: You're doing wonderfully, Evann. Absolutely no apologies needed. It is a difficult process, and I’m happy to guide you through it at your own pace. The next question focuses on artificial nutrition and hydration – receiving nutrients and fluids through an IV or feeding tube. It doesn’t involve any immediate invasive procedures, but it’s something to consider. Would you like me to explain what that entails before you look at the options?
PATIENT: Artificial nutrition and hydration… yes, please. I believe I have a vague understanding, receiving sustenance through alternative means. But the implications… the potential complications… remain unclear. And, if I may ask… what circumstances necessitate such intervention? Is it usually a temporary measure, or… something more prolonged? I apologize for my… inquisitiveness. I simply wish to be fully informed before making a decision. And, if it’s not too much to ask… is it typically comfortable? I confess, the thought of being fed through a tube… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Of course, Evann. That's a perfectly valid question, and you're right to ask. Artificial nutrition and hydration involves providing nutrients and fluids directly into your bloodstream or digestive system when you're unable to eat or drink on your own. It can be administered through an IV line or a feeding tube inserted into your stomach or small intestine. It's often used when someone has a serious illness or injury that prevents them from eating or drinking, such as a stroke, cancer, or a severe neurological condition. It can be temporary, used for a few days or weeks while someone recovers, or it can be more prolonged, especially if someone has a chronic condition. Regarding comfort, it can be uncomfortable initially, especially with the insertion of a feeding tube. However, once it's in place, it's usually well-tolerated. There are potential complications, such as infection and digestive issues. Does that help?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… clarifying. The potential for infection and digestive issues… concerning. And the thought of prolonged dependence on artificial sustenance… unsettling. I believe… I would prefer to avoid prolonged artificial nutrition and hydration. Unless it is a short-term measure, with a high probability of recovery. Is that a reasonable request? And, if I may ask… what constitutes a “high probability of recovery” in this context? What criteria are considered? I apologize for my… persistence. I simply wish to ensure my wishes are clearly understood. I feel… rather drained. Perhaps we should pause for a moment? I am grateful for your patience and guidance.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. That is a perfectly reasonable request, and we will document your preference to avoid prolonged artificial nutrition and hydration. And no apology necessary—you're being very thoughtful and proactive. It’s important to take the time to consider these difficult decisions. In this context, a “high probability of recovery” would mean a short-term need—a few days to a week—with a clear underlying cause that is likely to resolve, such as recovering from a surgery or a temporary illness. We would consider your overall health and prognosis at the time. And you are absolutely right—we should pause for a moment. Would you like a glass of water or a few minutes to simply rest and collect your thoughts?
PATIENT: A glass of water would be most welcome, thank you. And a few moments to simply rest and collect my thoughts… yes, please. I confess, this process is… rather draining. I am grateful for your patience and guidance, Doctor. Perhaps, after a short respite, we can proceed to the section regarding… who I would designate to make decisions on my behalf? If I am able?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. Take your time. It’s perfectly alright to pause and rest whenever you need to. And yes, after you’ve had a moment, we can certainly proceed to the section regarding designating someone to make decisions on your behalf. That’s a very important part of the process, and we can take as long as you need to consider who you would trust to represent your wishes. Just let me know when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is most welcome. I believe… I am beginning to feel… slightly more composed. Perhaps… perhaps we can proceed to the section regarding designating a representative? If you are not too pressed for time? I believe… I have someone in mind. Though, I confess, I worry about burdening them with such a responsibility. But, if I am unable to articulate my wishes myself, I believe they would… represent them faithfully. Perhaps we can discuss the necessary documentation?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. That's wonderful. We can definitely proceed to that section. It's a very important step, and it's good that you've already given it some thought. And it’s perfectly natural to worry about burdening someone with that responsibility, but it sounds like you’ve chosen someone you trust implicitly. We can discuss the necessary documentation and ensure they understand their role and responsibilities. To start, we need to identify their full name, address, and relationship to you. We'll also need their consent to act as your healthcare proxy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Her name is… Anya VOLKOVA. She is my… former colleague. We worked together at the museum, restoring antique textiles. Her address is… 142 Birchwood Drive, here in the city. I believe she still resides there. And yes, she is… fully aware of my wishes. Though, she may require some guidance regarding the formal procedures. I believe… she would be willing to act as my healthcare proxy, if properly informed. She is… a very conscientious person. Perhaps… perhaps we can proceed with the necessary documentation? I apologize for my… rambling. I am simply… relieved to have someone I trust implicitly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve entered her information, and I’m printing out the healthcare proxy form now. It's a fairly straightforward document, but it's important that you both understand it fully before signing it. It outlines her authority to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself, and it allows her to access your medical records. We’ll go through it section by section, and I’ll answer any questions you or Anya may have. Do you want to complete the form today, or would you prefer to take it home and discuss it with her first?
PATIENT: I believe… I would prefer to take it home and discuss it with her first. I wish to ensure she is… fully informed and comfortable with the responsibility before committing to anything. And I wish to allow her ample time to review the document and ask any questions she may have. Perhaps… we can schedule a follow-up appointment to complete the form at a later date? If that is acceptable? I apologize for my… hesitancy. I simply wish to proceed with caution and ensure everything is… properly addressed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. That's perfectly reasonable, and I commend you for proceeding with caution. It's important that both you and Anya feel comfortable and informed. We can certainly schedule a follow-up appointment to complete the form at a later date. How about next week?
PATIENT: Next week would be… acceptable, yes. Perhaps… Tuesday afternoon? If that is convenient? I believe… that would allow me ample time to discuss everything with Anya and address any concerns she may have. I apologize for any… inconvenience. I appreciate your patience and guidance, Doctor. You have been… most helpful. I believe… I am beginning to feel… considerably less anxious. Perhaps… perhaps we have completed enough for today?
DOCTOR: Tuesday afternoon works perfectly. I’ve scheduled you for Tuesday at 2:00 PM. And no inconvenience at all, Evann. I’m happy to help. I understand this is a lot to process, and I’m glad I could ease some of your anxiety. It sounds like we’ve completed enough for today. We’ve discussed your advance directives, identified a healthcare proxy, and scheduled a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… most helpful. I believe… you have addressed all my concerns. I am… profoundly grateful for your patience and guidance. You have been… most reassuring. I apologize for my… rambling. And thank you, once again, for your time. I believe… I can now proceed with a greater sense of peace. Perhaps… perhaps we shall meet again next week?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. It was a pleasure meeting you. And yes, I look forward to seeing you next week. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions before then. Have a wonderful day, and take care.
PATIENT:
