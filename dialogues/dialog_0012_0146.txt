DOCTOR: Hi Edric, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. I've been having trouble with my muscles feeling weak, just… not as strong as they used to be. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Muscle weakness, and it's been going on for a bit. That's good you're getting it checked out. To get a better idea of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It's… hard to explain. It's not like a sudden thing, you know? It’s just… everything feels heavier. Lifting things, even walking sometimes, takes more effort. It’s mostly in my legs and arms, I think. I haven’t noticed it in my face or anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, thank you. So it’s a gradual onset of weakness, mostly in your legs and arms, making everyday tasks harder. And you haven’t noticed any weakness in your facial muscles?
PATIENT: No, not in my face. Everything seems to work okay there. I can smile and talk like normal. It's just... the effort feels different, like I'm using more energy than I should. And it's been getting worse slowly over, oh, maybe the last three months? It's hard to say exactly. I don't really keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over the last three months. And it’s the effort that feels different, not necessarily that you can’t do things, just that they take more energy. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No… not really. I've been a little more tired lately, but honestly, who isn't? I work a lot. And maybe a few more aches, but I do pretty physical work, so that’s not surprising. Nothing major that I can think of. No dizziness, no numbness, no… anything else really. Just the weakness and a little extra tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no dizziness, numbness, or other significant symptoms besides the weakness and increased fatigue. Now, can you tell me a little bit about the work you do?
PATIENT: I’m an insurance appraiser. Auto damage, mostly. I go to car accident sites and assess the damage, write up reports, figure out how much the repairs will cost. It involves a lot of walking around, bending, looking at things, sometimes climbing under cars. It’s not easy work, if that makes sense. It keeps me on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're an auto insurance appraiser, a lot of physical activity involved. Has this weakness been impacting your ability to do your job?
PATIENT: Yeah, it has, actually. I'm finding it harder to get up and down after inspecting a car, and bending down to look at things takes more effort. I’ve had to ask my coworkers to help with some of the heavier lifting, which I don’t like doing. It’s slowing me down, and I'm worried it’s going to affect my work if it keeps getting worse. I really need to be able to do this job.
DOCTOR: Okay, it’s definitely impacting your work. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything. I usually just try to tough things out. I had the flu a few times, and a bad sprain in my ankle a couple years ago, but nothing serious. I don't really go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Just the ankle sprain I mentioned, but that didn't require anything more than a cast and some physical therapy. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Haven't had too many health problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my dad had some issues with his heart when he was older, but that was pretty late in life. And my mom, she had high blood pressure, but she managed it with medication. Nothing major that runs in the family, as far as I know. It’s a pretty small family, mostly. I don't really keep in close contact with everyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart issues in your dad and high blood pressure in your mom. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything. Never have. I try to avoid medication if I can. I figure if it’s not broke, don’t fix it, you know? I’ve always been pretty healthy, until this started happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, I can touch anything. No reactions, no hives, no problems. I’m pretty lucky that way too. Is that everything? I’m kinda eager to get this figured out, if that’s okay to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. That’s good to know. Thank you for that information. Alright, Edric, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and range of motion. I’ll also listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I have a lot of reports to finish today.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Here. Is that enough? It feels a little weaker than usual, but I'm probably just imagining things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now your arms... can you try and resist as I push against your arms?
PATIENT: Yeah, I'm trying… it’s getting harder to hold it. It feels like it's taking a lot of effort. I'm not as strong as I usually am.
DOCTOR: Okay. You're right, there is some weakness noted in your upper extremities. Now, let's check your legs. Can you sit on the exam table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Okay, here I am. Just tell me what you want me to do. I'm a little nervous now. Is this something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Edric, let's just take it one step at a time. Okay, can you try and resist as I push against your legs?
PATIENT: Ugh… okay, I'm trying, I'm trying… it's… harder than it looks. My legs feel… heavy. And they’re starting to shake a little. I really have to focus to hold it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Okay, Edric, based on what you've told me and the exam, there is some weakness in your arms and legs. The fact that it's gradual onset and affecting both sides is important. There are a lot of things that could cause this, so we need to run some tests to figure out what's going on.
PATIENT: Okay… tests? What kind of tests? Blood tests? X-rays? I really don't like needles. And I have a report due tomorrow, so I don't have a lot of time for… this. What are we even looking for? Just… give me the bad news now, if you have it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your anxiety. I'm not going to give you the "bad news" right now because we don’t have enough information to have bad news. Jumping to conclusions wouldn't be helpful. We need to gather more data first. I'm going to order some blood work. It will check your vitamin levels, electrolyte balance, and thyroid function. We'll also do a complete blood count to rule out any infections or anemia. It's standard procedure. We'll also order a creatine kinase level which can indicate muscle damage. As for imaging, I'm not going to order an X-ray at this point. It wouldn't be helpful in this case. We can discuss an MRI if the blood work doesn't give us a clear answer. The blood work will give us a lot of information. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… blood work. I guess that’s better than an MRI. So, just a few vials of blood? How long will it take to get the results? And will it affect my ability to work? I need to finish that report, like I said. And is there anything I can do in the meantime? Anything to help with the weakness? I really don't want this to get worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. Yes, just a few vials of blood. The lab usually takes a couple of days to get the results back – let’s say 48-72 hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. As for affecting your work, it shouldn’t. You can go about your normal activities after the blood draw. As for what you can do in the meantime, it’s important to listen to your body. Don’t push yourself too hard. Avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates the weakness. Gentle stretching and light walking are okay, but don’t overdo it. I also recommend staying well-hydrated. While we wait for the results, it’s difficult to say exactly what’s causing this, so it’s best to avoid any self-treatment. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. Just… 48-72 hours? That feels like a long time. Okay. Can I get the lab order now? And… where is the lab located? I need to figure out how to fit this into my schedule. I have a lot of appointments already. I really appreciate you not making me get an MRI right away, though. That makes me feel a little better.
DOCTOR: Okay. Here’s the lab order. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, just a few blocks from here. It’s open from 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. You don’t need an appointment, but it’s always a good idea to call ahead to check the wait times. The number is 555-1212. I understand your concern about the wait time, but getting these tests done is the first step in figuring out what’s going on. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’ll get this sorted out. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. 123 Main Street. 555-1212. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I'll call as soon as I get the results. Hopefully it’s nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: Okay. You're very welcome, Edric. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. I'll be expecting your call with the results. Have a good day and try to take it easy.
