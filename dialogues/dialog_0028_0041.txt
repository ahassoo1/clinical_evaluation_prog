DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Astores, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Dorman Astores. It is good to meet you, Doctor… Memmolo, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Memmolo is fine. Look, I have a rather full schedule today, so if we could just get straight to why you’re here, that would be appreciated. What brings you in today, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. No problem at all. Well… it’s my legs, mostly. They just… get weaker. It started slow, you know? A little harder to get up from the chair. Now… now it’s getting harder to walk even with my cane. My wife, Leilani, she says it’s getting worse quicker, and… well, I trust her. It feels like they just… don’t want to go sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Vague. “Don’t want to go.” Right. So, weakness… when did you first notice this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It was… maybe six months ago? Around Christmas, I think. We had family visiting, and I noticed I was… slower getting around. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it hasn’t gotten better. It’s… more every month. I don't know exactly when, but it was definitely before the new year.
DOCTOR: And is this weakness in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Both legs, Doctor. But… it’s worse on my right side, I think. It feels… heavier, harder to lift. My left leg… it gets tired, but it’s not the same. It’s like my right leg is… fighting me. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Sometimes my hands… they get numb. Not all the time, but often in the mornings. And… well, my vision. It gets blurry sometimes. Not always, and it doesn’t last long, but it worries me. Leilani says I stumble more, too, even when I think I'm steady. It's hard to tell sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Numbness, blurry vision… have you noticed any pain associated with the weakness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really pain. It's not like a sharp pain or anything. It's more… a tired feeling. Like my legs are just… worn out. Sometimes, if I try to walk too far, they feel… heavy and achy, but it’s not pain, exactly. More… discomfort, I suppose. It’s a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: And your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I used to be a coach, you know? Lots of running around. No major illnesses, nothing like that. I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist, but that healed up fine. My wife, she keeps track of all the doctor visits. I go to the doctor for check-ups, you know, regular things. Mostly, I’ve been good. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. Past surgical history: wrist fracture. Any family history of… neurological issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother… she had trouble walking when she got older, but we didn’t really know what it was. Just… old age, we thought. My brother, he had some problems with his balance, but again, nobody really knew what it was. We didn’t have a lot of doctors in the family growing up. Nothing specific, no. Just… people getting old, you know? It wasn’t something we talked about much. I don’t think so, Doctor. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your legs. Please sit here, and I’ll do a quick exam. I need to check your reflexes and strength. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm a little unsteady, as you can see.
DOCTOR: Strength is… diminished bilaterally, more pronounced on the right. Reflexes are…hypoactive. Sensory function appears intact, but diminished proprioception in the feet. Alright. We'll need to do some blood work to rule out certain deficiencies. Also, I'm ordering an MRI of your spine to assess for any structural issues. We need to get a better understanding of what's causing this weakness.
PATIENT: That sounds… serious, Doctor. An MRI? Is it something… bad? I just want to know what’s going on, you know? I trust you, of course, but… it's a little scary to hear all of this. What do you think it could be?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Astores, it’s too early to say definitively. Weakness can be caused by a variety of things. The MRI will help us rule out some of the more serious possibilities, like spinal cord compression or nerve damage. The blood work will check for vitamin deficiencies or other underlying medical conditions. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. We're just being thorough. I’ll have the lab draw blood now. The MRI will need to be scheduled. The receptionist will assist you with that. For now, I recommend you continue to use your cane, and avoid any strenuous activity.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Well, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’ll go get the blood work done. And I’ll see about scheduling the MRI. Thank you. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or anything I should be watching out for?
DOCTOR: If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms—increased weakness, numbness, or difficulty with bowel or bladder control—go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just follow up with the scheduling department and come back when the MRI results are available. That's all for today, Mr. Astores. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Yes, of course. Thank you, Doctor Memmolo. I’ll… I’ll see you when the results are back. .
