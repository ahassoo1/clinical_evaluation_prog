DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It's lovely to meet you. I see here you're 50 years of age. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re still going. It's been over 48 hours now, which is… longer than usual, I think. It's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can certainly be disruptive, and 48 hours is quite a while to be experiencing them. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. To start, can you describe the hiccups themselves?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. They’re… normal hiccups, I guess. You know, the kind where your chest jolts and you make that “hic” sound? It feels like a spasm, really. Not painful, just… annoying. And they come and go, but they're pretty frequent. Maybe every few minutes? Sometimes a little longer between them, but not much. I haven't noticed anything specific causing them, which is odd. Usually, it's something like a fizzy drink or eating too fast. But nothing like that this time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. So, no obvious trigger this time, and they’re not accompanied by any pain. And you’d characterize them as fairly frequent, occurring every few minutes or so. Have you noticed anything that makes them worse, or perhaps anything that seems to relieve them, even temporarily?
PATIENT: Well… nothing reliably makes them worse, honestly. I tried holding my breath a few times, like my grandmother used to do. That sometimes worked for her, but it didn’t do a thing for me. And drinking water… no luck there either. I did have a cup of chamomile tea last night, hoping it would calm things down, but… still hiccuping! I guess that didn't work either. I'm really starting to get worried, to be honest. It’s just… constant.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Redeye. Persistent hiccups can be worrisome. It’s good you’ve already tried some common remedies. Let's explore a little further. Aside from the hiccups themselves, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. No fever, no cough. No stomach pain, although I have been feeling a little bloated, now that you mention it. I haven't been eating particularly well, to be honest. It's hard to eat with the hiccups! And… no, nothing else really. I'm not feeling dizzy or anything like that. Just… tired. And irritated, because of the hiccups, of course! I did have a bit of heartburn a couple of times yesterday, but I get that sometimes anyway. It's probably unrelated.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Bloating and heartburn are good to know. It sounds as though you haven't experienced anything major, but those symptoms, combined with the hiccups, warrant a bit of further investigation. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, um, okay. Well, I don't have any serious conditions, thankfully. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, and I have slightly high blood pressure, but I take medication for that – a small pill every morning. Other than that… nothing much. No allergies, no asthma, no diabetes. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I used to be very active, but with the divorce a few years ago… I haven’t been as good about exercising. I had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago, but that shouldn’t be related, should it?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Redeye, that's very helpful. No, the hysterectomy shouldn’t be directly related. It’s good to know about the gallbladder removal and the high blood pressure, and that you are taking medication for it. Can you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... it's a small white pill. Um… I have the bottle here, just a moment. It’s Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for about five years now, and it seems to keep my blood pressure under control. My doctor checks it regularly.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Lisinopril is good to know. And you mentioned your blood pressure is checked regularly. When was the last time it was checked?
PATIENT: Let me see... It was about three months ago, I think. I had a check-up with Dr. Hassan, my family doctor. He said everything was fine, blood pressure was good, cholesterol was a little high, but he just told me to watch my diet. He didn't mention anything about the hiccups being a concern, and they hadn’t started yet then. I feel a little silly even bringing this up, honestly. It’s just hiccups! But they’re just… so persistent.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Redeye. It’s always best to investigate any new or unusual symptoms, even seemingly minor ones. And persistent hiccups can sometimes indicate an underlying issue, which is why we’re exploring this further. Now, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. My mother had diabetes, and her mother had high blood pressure, so that probably explains my own issues. My brother has heart disease, but he smoked for years, so… that’s probably not relevant. My father was healthy as a horse, never had a sick day in his life. And… no, I don’t think there’s anything else major. Nothing about hiccups, at least! My grandmother used to get them occasionally, but she always had a simple remedy – holding her breath or drinking water. It never lasted this long though.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That gives me a good overview. Now, before we proceed with a brief physical exam, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Since the divorce, it’s just been me. I have a small apartment downtown. It's quiet, but… lonely sometimes, I suppose. I used to work long hours managing events, which kept me busy, but I retired a couple of years ago. Now I mostly just… read and watch television. And try to avoid getting hiccups! I do have some friends I see occasionally, but… not as much as I’d like. It’s hard to go out when you’re constantly worried about… well, this.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you have friends you can see, even if it's not as often as you'd like. Now, just a final question before we proceed with the exam. Are you currently taking any other medications or supplements, besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me think carefully... Um, no, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but I've been out of it for a few weeks now. And… oh! I occasionally take a pain reliever for my arthritis, when it flares up. It’s just ibuprofen, over the counter. Nothing regular, just when I need it. I really try to avoid taking too many pills, honestly. I have a bad reaction to a lot of them. I think that’s everything, though. Really. Just the Lisinopril and the occasional ibuprofen. Oh, and the multivitamin, when I remember to buy it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Redeye. That’s very helpful. Alright, now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. This will help me rule out any obvious causes for your hiccups. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It won’t be uncomfortable, just a quick listen and gentle palpation. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I notice some mild bloating, but no significant tenderness. Your abdomen is soft.
PATIENT: Okay. It’s a little tender right here, on the left side, but it’s not painful, just… sensitive. I sometimes get cramps in that area, but they usually go away on their own. It doesn’t feel different than usual, really. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Thank you for pointing that out. Mild tenderness on the left side can be common, and, as you said, may be related to occasional cramps. However, given the persistence of your hiccups, I want to be thorough. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any underlying electrolyte imbalances or other potential issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. If that’s what you think is best, then please do. I just want to get this sorted out. These hiccups are driving me crazy! Is it… a lot of blood? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Redeye. It's just a small amount of blood, a couple of vials. And you’re right to mention your discomfort with needles – we can make sure the phlebotomist is gentle and efficient. The tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. While we wait for the results, I would also like you to keep a food diary for the next three days, noting anything you eat or drink, and whether it seems to trigger or worsen your hiccups. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds manageable. A food diary… okay, I can do that. It’s just a little hard when I’m the one doing the cooking, sometimes I just grab whatever’s easiest. But I’ll try my best to be accurate. And… how long will the results take? I’m not a very patient person, if you haven’t noticed.
DOCTOR: I have noticed! Typically, the results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. My office will contact you as soon as they're in. In the meantime, if your hiccups worsen significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or fever – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, let's focus on the food diary and see what that reveals. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience, Doctor. And thank you for not dismissing this as just… hiccups. It's been quite stressful, to be honest. I suppose I’ll just go home and start the diary.
