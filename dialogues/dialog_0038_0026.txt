DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Auelua, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s… it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful tiredness. Comes and goes, but when it comes, I can barely lift a cup of tea. And the young man at the lab said something about my… my numbers being off. Something about my muscles? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. My husband usually handles all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, that’s a good place to start. And you mentioned something about lab results and your muscles… let’s unpack that a bit. Do you remember roughly when you had those lab tests done?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… Dates are just… a blur these days. Let me think. It was… after I helped my grandson move some furniture. Big, heavy things. He's a strong boy, but he needed a hand. Maybe… June? Or was it July? It all blends together. Honestly, I don’t recall exactly when the tests were. Just that they said something wasn’t right. And they poked me a lot.
DOCTOR: Right, poking and numbers! That's alright, we can look it up in your chart here. Ah, here we are. Yes, I see results from July 15th. It does look like your creatine kinase level was elevated, and that can definitely cause tiredness and muscle weakness. Do you have any pain in your muscles at all?
PATIENT: Creatine… what now? Sounds foreign. And pain… well, sometimes. Not a sharp pain, more of an ache. Like I’ve been doing too much gardening, even when I haven’t. It’s not constant, mind you. Just… a general feeling of being worn out. Really, I just want to be able to keep up with my grandson. He’s always so full of energy, and I hate being a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, an ache that comes and goes, and feels like you've overdone it even when you haven't – that's helpful. And wanting to keep up with your grandson is a perfectly good reason to get this sorted. This elevated creatine kinase… it suggests there might be some inflammation or damage to your muscles. It’s not necessarily anything serious, but we need to figure out what’s causing it. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and muscle aches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me see. I've been feeling a bit… clumsy lately. Dropped a plate the other day. A perfectly good plate! And my skin feels… funny. Sort of sensitive. Not itchy, exactly, but… odd. Oh, and my urine has been darker than usual, I think. But I drink a lot of tea, so… well, it’s probably just the tea.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness, sensitive skin, and darker urine… those are all things we should definitely look into. The darker urine especially is worth noting. It could be from the tea, as you said, but it can also be a sign of muscle breakdown. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Health conditions… Oh dear. Well, I have my age, of course! That’s a condition in itself. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on a little pill and it's been alright ever since. And I had my gallbladder out, goodness, must be twenty years ago now. Other than that… not much, really. I've always been a strong woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure managed with medication, and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. That’s good to know. And being a strong woman is definitely a plus! Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. Just this one, I believe. A little white one. The doctor said it was for my pressure. And sometimes, just sometimes, I take something for my arthritis in my hands. But only when it really flares up. It’s just a little over-the-counter thing, nothing fancy. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so one pill for blood pressure regularly, and an over-the-counter medication for arthritis as needed. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I used to get a bit of a rash when I was a girl, but that was from poison ivy, I think. And I can't stand shellfish, but that’s more of a dislike than an allergy, really. It just… smells funny. I've never had a reaction to any pills or anything. At least, not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That's a long story. My mother, she had a weak heart. She didn't live to be very old. And my brother, he had… something with his nerves, I think. He had to use a cane in his later years. But other than that, we were a pretty healthy bunch, really. Lots of strong farmers in the family, you see. We worked hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, a mother with heart problems and a brother with nerve issues. That's good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I like to garden, when I have the energy. And I enjoy spending time with my grandson. He keeps me young, that boy! I don’t really do much exercise, not proper exercise. I used to walk more, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I enjoy a cup of tea with my biscuits. And I don't smoke, never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening, spending time with your grandson, enjoying tea and biscuits, and no smoking. That’s all very good. Now, one last thing before we do a quick physical exam. Are you currently experiencing any stress or significant life changes?
PATIENT: Stress… Well, my grandson is starting university soon. That's a big change for everyone. And my daughter… she worries a lot. Always has. She fusses over me, wants me to slow down, take it easy. It’s not that I mind, exactly, but it can be a bit… much. But other than that, no, not really. Just the usual worries of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, your grandson starting university and your daughter worrying about you. That's understandable. Okay, Ardelle, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and feel your muscles. It won’t take long. If you could just sit up here for me, that would be lovely.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Be gentle with my knees, if you would. They creak something awful these days. And I'm a bit ticklish, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I’ll try to avoid the ticklish spots! Heart sounds are a little… faint, but regular. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Reflexes are a little slow, which isn’t uncommon with age. Now, let's just check your muscles. There's some tenderness here, especially in your upper arms and thighs. Not significant pain, but you are a little sensitive to the touch. Okay, everything seems relatively normal, but the muscle tenderness and slightly diminished reflexes are things we should investigate further. Now, to help us figure out what's going on, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will check your creatine kinase levels again, as well as your thyroid function and vitamin D levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… more poking, I presume? Oh, alright, Doctor. If it will help, then yes, go ahead. I just hope they don’t take too much blood. I get a bit faint sometimes, you know. And please, tell my daughter it’s all perfectly routine, if she asks. She’ll worry herself sick otherwise.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take it slow and make sure you’re comfortable. And I’ll definitely let your daughter know it’s routine. We'll only take a small amount of blood, and the nurse will keep a close eye on you. The lab is just down the hall, and they're very good at what they do. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I’d like you to continue to stay hydrated and get as much rest as you can. Are there any questions you have for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long for the results, alright? My grandson is starting his preparations for university, and I want to be at my best when he leaves.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us once they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We are here to help. Thank you for coming in today, Ardelle. It was lovely meeting you.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor Auelua. Thank you for your time and patience. I do hope these tests don’t reveal anything too alarming. Goodbye now.
