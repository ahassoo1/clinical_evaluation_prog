DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome in. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's lovely to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my legs. They are… how you say… puffy? After the cancer treatments. It’s been a few weeks now, and they don't seem to be going down. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Puffy, you say. A few weeks after treatments, okay. That is something we should take a look at. It's good you're bringing this up. Cancer treatments can definitely have side effects like that. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the puffiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… a week after the last chemo? Not right away, but then I noticed my ankles were bigger. And then my legs, you know, all over. It’s not painful, just… strange. And they feel heavy, like I’m walking through water sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A week after chemo, starting in the ankles and then spreading up the legs... and the heaviness, that's helpful to know. Not painful, just strange and heavy. Alright. And just to be thorough, Sasha, have you noticed any changes in your skin color or temperature in your legs?
PATIENT: Skin color… Not really. They look… normal, I think? Maybe a little paler than usual, but I don’t get much sun, so it's hard to say. And no, not warmer or colder. Just… puffy. Honestly, I'm not sure what is normal anymore after everything. Is this something serious, Doctor? I’m a little scared.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to be scared, Sasha, especially after everything you've been through. And you're right to ask. It's good you're paying attention to these changes. Okay, normal is… tricky after treatments, you're right about that. No change in skin color, good. Let's do a quick examination of your legs, and then we can talk about what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Whatever you need to see. I just want to know what’s happening and if it's something I need to worry about. It's just… tiring, you know? Always something.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm feeling some definite swelling – pitting edema – in both ankles and lower legs. The pulses feel good and strong, which is reassuring. No significant discoloration or skin changes. It does seem to be fairly symmetrical, meaning it's happening equally in both legs. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you're experiencing edema, likely as a side effect of the cancer treatments. The treatments can sometimes affect the kidneys or the lymphatic system, leading to fluid buildup. It's also common after chemotherapy. However, we want to rule out other potential causes. Have you had any issues with your heart or kidneys in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, my heart? No, not that I know of. The doctors did lots of tests before the cancer, to make sure I was strong enough for everything. They didn't say anything about my heart. And my kidneys… I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. Just… tired now. Is this going to go away? Will I need more medicine? I don’t want more medicine if I can help it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – no history of heart or kidney problems. And I completely understand wanting to avoid more medication if possible. Okay. The good news is, edema related to cancer treatment often resolves on its own as your body recovers. However, because it's been a few weeks and it's not improving, I'd like to order a few blood tests just to be on the safe side. It will help us check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out other potential causes. We should also check your albumin level, as that can sometimes contribute to swelling. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… I suppose so. If you think it’s important. I just… I hate needles. But if it will tell you what’s going on, then yes. Do I need to come back another day for those? And will it take long? I have a friend coming to visit next week, and I don’t want to be stuck at the doctor’s all day.
DOCTOR: I understand – nobody enjoys needles. We'll get it done as quickly and comfortably as possible. We can do the blood tests right here in the clinic today, shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes, including the waiting time. You’ll be able to go home afterwards, plenty of time before your friend visits. While we're waiting for the results, I also want to recommend some simple things you can do at home to help reduce the swelling. Would you like me to tell you about those?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Anything I can do to help. I'm willing to try anything. Tell me what to do. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It makes me feel a little better, knowing there's a plan.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sasha. That’s what I’m here for. Okay. First, elevation. When you're sitting or lying down, try to elevate your legs above your heart. You can use pillows or a footrest. Second, compression. Wearing compression stockings can help improve circulation and reduce swelling. We can get you a prescription for those if needed. Third, hydration. Drinking plenty of water is important for overall health and can help flush out excess fluid. And lastly, reducing salt intake can also help. Are these things you think you can incorporate into your routine?
PATIENT: Elevation, stockings, water, less salt… Yes, I think so. I have pillows. I don't mind drinking water, actually. And I suppose I can try to eat less salt. It’s just… my friend, she likes to cook very salty dishes. But I can ask her, politely. I’ll try my best. Will the results be back quickly? When will I hear from you? I don't want to worry unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Sasha. Asking your friend politely is a perfect approach. And you’re already thinking about how to manage things, that’s wonderful. The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours. My nurse will give you a call as soon as they're available, and we can discuss the results and the next steps. If we need to do further testing, we’ll let you know. In the meantime, if you notice any sudden worsening of your swelling, or if you develop any pain, redness, or warmth in your legs, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor Renzi. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little less scared now. I’ll try to remember everything you said.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I’m glad I could help ease your worries. And don’t worry too much about remembering everything – we have all this documented, and my nurse will go over it with you when she calls. Just focus on elevating your legs, staying hydrated, and taking it easy. And remember, we’re here for you every step of the way. Have a lovely day, and enjoy your visit with your friend.
