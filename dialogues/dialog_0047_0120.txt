DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get straight to it. I want to have a baby, and I want to make sure everything works. My husband… well, he passed, and I don't want any… surprises, you know? I’m not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… straightforward enough. “Everything works.” I suppose we can start there. It’s good you’re being proactive. So, to clarify, you’re looking for a fertility check-up, essentially?
PATIENT: Check-up sounds… fancy. I just want to know if I can have a baby. Is that so hard to understand? I had one already, years ago, so it should be simple. I don’t need a whole song and dance about it.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not hard to understand, Ms. Villarreal. Though, having a child previously doesn't guarantee it will be simple this time. Things can change. But alright. Let’s get some basics down. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Conditions? No, not really. I mean, I get the occasional headache, who doesn’t? And my blood pressure… the doctor always says it's a little high, but nothing serious. Honestly, I’m pretty healthy for my age. I eat well, mostly. I don’t go around doing anything foolish.
DOCTOR: "Occasionally high blood pressure." And when was the last time you had a blood pressure check, Ms. Villarreal?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I… I don’t really remember. It was… a while ago. Probably at my husband’s doctor’s appointment with him, I suppose. He had to go regularly. I just tagged along. It wasn't that high, if you're worried. I'd know if it was.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll need to get a current reading. And a complete medical history, really. It's standard procedure. Have you had any surgeries, Ms. Villarreal?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. Oh! Yes. I had my appendix out when I was a little girl. That's it, I think. A very long time ago. It was a simple thing, nothing to worry about. Don’t make a big deal out of it. Is that enough history for you? I really don't remember much else.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Now you’re just fishing. Look, my mother lived to be eighty, so did her mother. They were both perfectly healthy. My father… he had a bad heart, but that was from smoking. I don’t smoke. See? Good genes. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I don’t see what any of this has to do with me having a baby.
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Ms. Villarreal. Family history can indicate predispositions to certain conditions that might affect fertility or pregnancy. But alright. We can move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just vitamins. You know, a multivitamin. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I take… ibuprofen, I think it's called. Nothing fancy. Just the usual stuff. Why are you asking so many questions? It’s starting to feel like an interrogation. I just want to know if I can get pregnant!
DOCTOR: It’s necessary to gather all this information, Ms. Villarreal. It’s not an interrogation, it’s a medical assessment. Now, allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not really. I mean, I don’t like cats, if that counts. But I'm not allergic. And dust makes me sneeze sometimes, but everyone sneezes. Nothing serious. Honestly, I'm a pretty robust person. I don't go around breaking out in rashes or anything. I think I've answered enough questions. Can we move on to the actual tests now?
DOCTOR: Very well. Before we proceed to testing, I’m going to perform a brief physical exam. Blood pressure, weight, basic palpation… standard things. Then we can discuss what blood work and other tests I recommend. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. The quicker we get this done, the better. And please don't poke and prod too much. I hate that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat on the table. We’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Ugh. I really don’t like doctors. Can't you just tell me if everything's okay without all this fuss? It's ridiculous. Honestly…
DOCTOR: 148 over 92. That's elevated, Ms. Villarreal. As I suspected. And your weight is 130 pounds, height 164 centimeters. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort with this?
PATIENT: No! Don’t poke so hard! It’s uncomfortable. And 148… is that bad? I told you my blood pressure was a little high. It’s probably just nerves. I don’t like being in doctor’s offices, it makes me anxious. Can we just skip the poking and get to the tests? This is taking forever. I have things to do. Honestly... .
DOCTOR: “Nerves” don't account for this level of elevation, Ms. Villarreal. And yes, it is concerning. Before we move forward with any fertility testing, we need to address this hypertension. I’m going to recommend a full lipid panel and a comprehensive metabolic panel, and I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist. We are not proceeding with fertility workup until this is addressed. It would be irresponsible.
