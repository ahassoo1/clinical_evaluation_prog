DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Wartick. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that’s what doctors are for. It’s about… a problem my… associate is having. He's been… leaking, if you understand what I mean. It’s quite unseemly, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Wartick. You’re seeking medical advice regarding a concern your partner is experiencing. It's perfectly alright to discuss these issues with me; patient confidentiality is of utmost importance. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a bit more about this "leaking"?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a flood, Doctor, don’t get me wrong. It's more of a… a dampness. And it smells… not pleasant, naturally. He's terribly ashamed of it, poor man. He tries to keep everything very… tidy, but it’s proving difficult. It's been going on for… oh, I suppose a couple of weeks now. At least. He doesn’t tell me everything, you see. Men. They're so… secretive about these things.
DOCTOR: I see. A couple of weeks of dampness, with an associated odor, and your associate is understandably reluctant to discuss it fully. That is quite common. To help me determine the potential cause, could you tell me a little more about when this dampness occurs?
PATIENT: Well, it's not… after a bath, if that's what you're thinking. Goodness no, he's very clean. It seems to be…random, really. Sometimes it’s there when he wakes up. Other times it's… later in the day. It's not connected to… anything I've noticed. Honestly, Doctor, it’s very unsettling. And frankly, I’m worried it's… contagious. One can never be too careful, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about it being contagious, Mrs. Wartick. Random occurrences, appearing at different times of the day... That certainly helps narrow things down. Has your associate noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, he hasn’t said anything, Doctor. He’s not one for complaining. Though he has been a bit… quieter than usual. And perhaps a little more irritable. But honestly, that could be anything. He's getting on in years, you know. Men get… grumpy. He also seems to spend more time in the bathroom… but, again, that could be nothing. He’s always been a bit of a… fussbudget. It’s hard to say, truly. He keeps things to himself. It’s most frustrating!
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing those observations, Mrs. Wartick, even if it's difficult to get a complete picture. The recent quietness and irritability, along with increased bathroom visits, could be relevant. To help me rule out some possibilities, could you tell me about his past medical history, if you're aware of it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. His medical history… let me think. He had a touch of the flu, I think, last winter. And he had his prostate checked, years ago. Seemed alright then. He complains about his knees, always has, but that’s just old age. He doesn’t see a doctor regularly, Doctor. Far too proud, that man. He insists he’s “perfectly healthy,” right up until he’s absolutely not. Honestly, I’m the one who usually deals with these things. I'm the sensible one in the relationship. I don’t think there’s much to tell you, really. He’s a stubborn old… never mind. I shouldn’t say that.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Wartick. It sounds like he’s a bit resistant to medical care, and you’re often the one advocating for his health. Knowing he had his prostate checked in the past is helpful. And even the mention of knee complaints can sometimes be relevant. Just to be thorough, has he ever had any surgery?
PATIENT: Surgery… let me see. Oh! Years and years ago, he had his appendix out. When he was a young man, I believe. That’s the only thing I can think of. Nothing recently. And… oh! He broke his wrist once, falling off a bicycle. A silly thing, really. He was trying to impress a… never mind. That's irrelevant. He's always been rather clumsy, to be honest. Apart from that, no. He’s remarkably… intact, for his age. It’s just this… dampness that’s so worrying. And the smell! It's dreadful, Doctor. Truly dreadful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Wartick. That gives me a good starting point. To complete the picture, could you tell me about any medications he’s currently taking, or has taken recently?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. He takes something for his knees, I believe. A little white pill. And… occasionally, he takes something for indigestion. He gets heartburn sometimes. Nothing regular, though. And… oh! He had some antibiotics last year for a… a skin infection, I think. Just a small thing. Apart from that, nothing. He’s very careful about taking pills. Doesn’t like them at all. He’ll only take them if he absolutely has to. Honestly, he’s a terrible patient. I do worry about him, you know. He’s a good man, deep down, but… difficult. Very difficult.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Wartick. This is all very helpful. And I appreciate your patience in providing so much detail, even with your associate being… somewhat reticent. Now, with your permission, I’d like to ask him a few questions directly, and perform a brief physical exam. That will allow me to better understand the situation and determine the most appropriate course of action. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose so, Doctor. He won't like it, I can assure you. He hates doctors. But if you think it's necessary… I just don't want him making a fuss. He’s quite capable of being… dramatic. And please, be gentle. He’s a sensitive soul, you know, despite his gruff exterior. And try not to ask too many personal questions. He’s a private man. Honestly, this is all rather upsetting. But if it will help… alright. Proceed. But be warned, he might complain. A lot.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mrs. Wartick, I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. I will focus on gathering essential information and minimizing any discomfort. I'll also try to avoid anything overly personal. Perhaps you could stay in the room with us if that would make him more comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, Doctor. Yes, please. He definitely needs me there. He’ll be much calmer if I'm with him. Honestly, he's like a child sometimes. Alright. Let’s get this over with. But do be quick, please. I have errands to run, you know. And… try not to stare. He doesn't like being stared at. Goodness. This is all so… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Wartick. Please, have a seat. And we will proceed at a comfortable pace. I will call him in now. “Mr. [Patient’s Last Name], could you please come in?
