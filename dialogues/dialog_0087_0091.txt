DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Is good to meet you as well. Well, lately I does be feeling very, very thirsty. All the time, I need water. And I does be hungry too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just… not right, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling excessively thirsty and hungry, even after eating, is certainly something we should investigate. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see… it start maybe, maybe two, three months now? I not really sure the exact time. It just come on slow, slow. First, I notice I drinking more water than usual. Then, I start feeling hungry all the time. I does eat, but it not stay with me long, you know? Like my belly empty quick, quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been a gradual onset over the past two to three months. And you’ve noticed increased thirst and increased hunger, despite eating regular meals. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside those – anything like frequent urination, blurry vision, unexplained weight loss, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Frequent... what you say? Going to the bathroom more often, you mean? Yes, I does go more often than before, yes. Especially at night, which is not good for sleeping, you know? And… maybe a little tired too. Not all the time, but sometimes I feel like I could just lie down. Blurry vision, no, I not think so. And I not losing weight, maybe a little, but nothing big. I still big woman!
DOCTOR: I understand. Frequent urination, especially at night, and some fatigue… those are helpful details. And it's good you haven’t noticed significant weight loss. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High... what you call it? My pressure, sometimes it go up, the doctor tell me so, years ago. But I does take the pills, you know? And… no, nothing else really. No diabetes, no heart problems. Just the pressure. I does try to eat healthy, but sometimes is hard, you know? Especially with all the nice food around!
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of hypertension, which you manage with medication – that’s good. And you don't have a diagnosis of diabetes. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. Never had any. I does try to stay healthy, you know? And I not been in the hospital, thank God. I had the children at home, both of them. Old-fashioned way, you could say.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had the pressure too, like me. High blood pressure, yes. And my father, he had problems with his heart. He was a strong man, but he get sick when he get old. My brother, he healthy as a horse, always running around. And my sister… she alright too, I think. Nothing really serious with them, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of hypertension and heart problems. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications other than the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Just the pills for the pressure, Doctor. That is all. Sometimes I take something for the pain in my knees, when it acting up, but is just the over-the-counter stuff, you know? Not nothing special. I try not to take too much medicine, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I not have any allergies. Never had any problems with that. I does eat everything, almost! Maybe a little sensitive to the cold sometimes, but is not an allergy, you know? Just get a little sniffly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I never smoke. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband used to, years ago, but he stop long time now. Bad for the health, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, and how much alcohol do you typically drink in a week?
PATIENT: Oh, not much, Doctor. Just a little wine sometimes, with my dinner. Maybe one or two glasses, two times a week. Nothing big. I not a big drinker, you know? I prefer a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about what your typical diet is like?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy, but it hard, you know? I like my food! I eat a lot of rice and beans, that is my staple. And fish, I does eat fish a lot. Chicken too. And some vegetables, but not enough, maybe. I does like a good roti sometimes, but that not healthy, is it? And I does like my sweets, but I try not to eat too much!
DOCTOR: That gives me a good idea. Alright, Ms. Zicarelli, I think it's time we do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a simple blood test to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just let me know if it going to be uncomfortable, you know? I not as young as I used to be!
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll explain everything as I go, and we’ll take it slow. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here you go.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That's a bit elevated, even with your medication. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… deep breath in… and out… Everything sounds clear, but your heart rate is slightly elevated as well. Now, I'd like to check your feet and legs. Do you experience any numbness, tingling, or pain in your feet or legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no numbness or tingling. Sometimes my knees does ache, but that is just old age, you know? And sometimes my feet does feel a little tired after a long day, but not pain. Just tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to order some blood work. This will help us check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and other important markers. We'll also check your HbA1c, which gives us an average of your blood sugar control over the past few months. Do you have any concerns about getting blood drawn?
PATIENT: Blood drawn? No, Doctor, I alright with that. I had blood drawn before, many times. Is just a little pinch, yes? I more worried about what the results will be, you know? Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: It is just a little pinch, yes. And it’s good you’ve had blood work before. We'll get those results back within a few days. Based on your symptoms – the increased thirst, increased hunger, frequent urination, and elevated blood pressure and heart rate – and your family history, I want to investigate the possibility of diabetes. But we need those blood work results to confirm or rule it out. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your blood pressure medication as prescribed, and I would advise you to try and reduce your intake of sugary drinks and processed foods. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Diabetes… oh dear. My mother, she had that too, towards the end. So, you think is possible? Is it serious? And… the sugary drinks, I does like a nice juice with my lunch sometimes. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Zicarelli. It is possible, given your symptoms and family history, but we don’t know for sure yet. We need the blood work results to confirm. If it is diabetes, it is a serious condition, but it’s very manageable with diet, exercise, and medication, if needed. Early detection is key. Regarding the juice, yes, it’s best to limit sugary drinks like juice. Even 100% fruit juice contains a lot of sugar. Water is the best option. If you enjoy a sweet taste, try adding a slice of lemon or cucumber to your water. We can discuss dietary modifications in more detail once we have the blood work results. I'm going to write down the lab order for you. Once you've had the blood work done, the results will be sent directly to my office. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is all. You explain everything very good, and you make me feel a little better. Thank you for taking the time with me. I will go and do the blood work as soon as I can. And I will try to drink more water, you hear?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Zicarelli. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a bit. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before I call you with the results. And yes, drinking more water is a great start. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day now.
