DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Way. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, things have been… painful, lately. It’s mostly in my back, lower back to be exact. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, getting worse each day.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain. And you said it's been getting progressively worse?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. It started as just a little ache after I’d been standing for a long time, you know? Like after working in the garden. But now… now it hurts even when I’m just sitting. It’s making it hard to sleep, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when did you first notice this ache in the garden?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it was probably… end of July, maybe the first week? It was a really hot day, I was weeding the tomatoes. Nothing major, just a little twinge. I didn’t think much of it at the time. I just figured I was old, ha!
DOCTOR: Okay, so about two weeks now. And has anything specific made it better or worse since then?
PATIENT: Well, resting helps a little, if I lie down flat. But honestly, not much makes it better for long. What makes it worse… pretty much everything, ha! Bending over is awful. And like I said, sitting for too long is bad. Even just walking sometimes. It just… feels stiff, and then a sharp pain shoots through.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness and sharp pain. Do you feel that pain radiating anywhere – down your legs, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually, now that you mention it… it does go down my left leg sometimes. Not all the way to my foot, but down the back of my thigh, and into my calf. It’s not constant, but when the back pain is really bad, I feel it there too.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Just the pain shooting down. It's more of an ache that turns into a sharp pain, if that makes sense. It doesn't feel… numb, just… ouch.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness, just pain. Have you noticed any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Not really, I don't think. I haven't been trying to do anything too strenuous, to be honest. I've been taking it easy because of the pain. But I haven’t noticed stumbling or anything like that. It’s hard to say if I'm being careful, or if it's actually weak.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever had back problems before?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, aches and pains here and there, you know, like everyone else gets. But nothing like this. No surgeries, no serious injuries. I pulled a muscle once, a long time ago, but that healed up pretty quickly. Nothing I ever had to see a doctor for.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior significant back issues. Any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… I have a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. But I take a pill for it, keeps it under control. And my cholesterol is a little high too, but nothing too serious. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking for those conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… for the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. And for the cholesterol, it’s Atorvastatin, 20 milligrams, also once a day. That’s it, just those two pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I can take most medicines without any problems. My wife always checks, just in case, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And just to get a complete picture, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I quit a long time ago, thankfully. I used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I’ve cut back on that too. Just trying to be healthy, you know? And no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never been my thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that’s a good start. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll need you to lie down on the exam table. We'll check your range of motion, reflexes, and see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I’ll lie down. Hopefully, you can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Great. Please lie flat on your back. I’m going to gently palpate your lower back to assess for tenderness and muscle spasm. Let me know if anything is particularly painful. Alright, can you tell me where it hurts the most when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Right… right there. Yeah, that’s the worst spot. It’s a sharp pain when you push on it. And it kind of radiates out, you know? Not too hard, Doctor, please! It’s sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm being very gentle. And do you feel any pain when I lift your leg straight up like this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. That’s… not good. It’s a stretching pain, down the back of my leg. Not terrible, but definitely uncomfortable. Like that nerve is being pulled or something.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about when I lift your leg up while your knee is bent?
PATIENT: That’s… better. Not much pain with that one. Just a little bit of stiffness, but nothing like when you lifted it straight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes seem normal. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof. I can’t quite reach my toes, Doctor. It’s too painful. I get a sharp pain in my lower back when I try to go further. This is… not easy.
DOCTOR: Alright, don’t push yourself. That’s enough. Based on the exam, it sounds like you may have a lumbar strain, possibly with some nerve irritation, what we call sciatica. I want to get some imaging done just to rule out anything more serious, like a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. We'll start with an X-ray. Would you be able to get that done today at the imaging center across the street?
PATIENT: Okay, a lumbar strain… sciatica. Sounds… bad. An X-ray… yeah, I guess so. Across the street, you said? I can probably manage that. Is that going to be expensive, Doctor? I don’t have insurance, as you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost. Let me call the imaging center and see what the cash price would be for a lumbar X-ray. Okay, they said it will be $150. We can also discuss some pain management options while we wait for the results. I can prescribe a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory to help with the pain and inflammation. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: $150… okay, that’s… manageable, I think. Yeah, a muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory… that sounds good, Doctor. Anything to help with the pain. I’m really struggling. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm prescribing you Cyclobenzaprine 10mg, take one tablet three times a day for seven days. And I'm also prescribing Naproxen 500mg, take one tablet twice a day with food for ten days. Here are your prescriptions. Please take these as directed, and be sure to let me know if you experience any side effects. Also, I recommend gentle stretching and light walking, as tolerated. Avoid any activities that worsen your pain. We’ll review the X-ray results when you get them, and we can discuss further treatment options at that time. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, Cyclobenzaprine and Naproxen… got it. Three times a day for the muscle relaxant, twice a day for the Naproxen. Gentle stretching and walking… okay, I can try that. Hmmm… what kind of side effects should I look out for? And… how long should I wait before calling if the pain doesn’t get better with the medication?
DOCTOR: With the Cyclobenzaprine, you might experience drowsiness, dizziness, or dry mouth. Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how it affects you. If you experience any severe dizziness, confusion, or fast heartbeat, stop taking the medication and call me immediately. As for the Naproxen, the most common side effects are stomach upset, heartburn, or nausea. If you experience any severe stomach pain, black stools, or vomiting, stop taking it and contact me right away. If your pain doesn’t improve within a week of taking the medication, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we’ll discuss other options. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth for the muscle relaxant, and stomach issues for the Naproxen. And call if it gets really bad or doesn't improve after a week. Okay, I think I’ve got it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll go get the X-ray done now and schedule a follow-up if needed.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, rest, gentle exercise, and take the medications as prescribed. I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor. I will. You have a good day too. .
