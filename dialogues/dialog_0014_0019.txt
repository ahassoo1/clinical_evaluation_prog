DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Hmm... let me see. My wife... she wants... a baby. We old, you know? She think maybe need help. I not so sure what help is, but she say come see you. Is that right? I forget things easy.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's…certainly a request. Okay. So, your wife is hoping to become pregnant. And you're here to discuss options…or concerns. Let’s start with you. You said you forget things easily. Has this been a recent thing, or something long-standing?
PATIENT: Long-standing, yes. Always been like this, I think. My wife, she remember everything for both of us! I make things... little boats, you know? Metal ones. Need good hands for that. Sometimes I forget where I put my tools... or what I was making! It not so bad, though. Mostly just annoying.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. “Memory issues, long-standing.” We'll need to explore that a bit later, just to get a baseline. But let's focus on your wife for now. How old is she, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. She… she is 68, I believe. Yes, 68. Almost the same as me. We meet a long time ago, in… Mogadishu, I think. Everything is blurry now, you know? But she is strong woman. Always been strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, 68. And you’re 70. Right. Well, attempting pregnancy at this age…it's…uncommon. And carries significant risks for both of you, frankly. Before we even consider options, we need to understand your overall health. Do either of you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Existing…conditions? She have…pressure, sometimes. In her chest. Doctor give her little pills for that. And I… I get tired easy. Old man tiredness, you know? Nothing serious, I think. We both go to the doctor regular. Medicare pays for it. Does that help? I forget the names of the pills, sorry.
DOCTOR: "Reports chest pressure, medicated. Reports fatigue." Okay. Medicare coverage is good to know. The names of the pills would be helpful, if you happen to remember. But if not, we can probably get that information from your records. Do you know what the chest pressure is being treated for?
PATIENT: She say… her heart, maybe? Something with the blood flow, I think. The doctor talk fast, lots of words I don't understand. She take the pills every day. Small white ones. I think it help, she doesn't complain so much now. I mostly just worry about her. She is everything to me.
DOCTOR: Okay. According to these records, your wife is being treated for hypertension – high blood pressure – and has a history of angina. That’s chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart. And you… have a diagnosis of early-stage cognitive decline, consistent with what you’ve described. It appears you also have a history of mild anemia. This does complicate things. Before discussing any options for pregnancy – which, frankly, are limited – we need to assess your overall health more thoroughly. I'd like to start with a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical...exam? Yes, okay. If you think it's best. I trust you, Doctor. I just... want my wife to be happy. And safe. All these words... it's too much sometimes. Cognitive... what did you say? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: “Cognitive decline” simply means some changes in memory and thinking. It's not necessarily “bad,” but it's something we need to monitor. It's common with age, and we can manage it. First, let’s just do a quick check of your heart and lungs, and I’ll check your reflexes. Then I’ll take a look at your wife. Could you please sit up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Exam table. Old bones, you know? But I can manage. What do I do? Just... sit here? My wife, she is very strong. She help me with everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, just sit comfortably. And don't worry, we'll take it slowly. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. “Heart sounds…slightly muffled. Some diminished breath sounds bilaterally, but no wheezing or crackles noted. Reflexes…slightly diminished, but within normal limits for age.” “Okay, that's good for now. Now, let's check your blood pressure.”
PATIENT: Okay, yes. Blood pressure. I always forget the numbers. My wife, she remembers everything. Is it high? Should I worry? I try to eat healthy... mostly. And I don't smoke.
DOCTOR: “Blood pressure is… elevated. 160 over 95. That’s concerning, especially with your history of hypertension. And it explains some of your fatigue.” “Okay. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart again, more closely. And I’ll check your pulse. Just relax.” “Irregular rhythm noted. Possibly atrial fibrillation. We’ll need to get an EKG to confirm.” “Mr. Carlotta, this is more serious than I initially anticipated. Before we even consider options for your wife, we need to address your health issues immediately. I'm going to order an EKG and a full blood workup. And I strongly recommend a cardiology consult.”
PATIENT: EKG… cardiology…? All these words… What does that mean? Is something wrong with my heart? My wife… will she be upset? I just want her to be happy. Maybe… maybe we are too old for all this, Doctor. I don't understand. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, let's take things one step at a time. An EKG is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us determine if there’s a problem with your heart rhythm. And a cardiology consult means I want you to see a specialist – a doctor who specializes in heart conditions. Yes, there is something concerning about your heart rhythm. It's irregular, which can cause fatigue, dizziness, and other symptoms. It needs to be investigated. As for your wife… we’ll worry about that later. Right now, we need to focus on you. I understand this is overwhelming, and you're worried about her. But you can’t help her if you’re not healthy yourself. I’m going to call for the EKG now. And I'll have my nurse explain the blood workup process to you. .
