DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this headache I've been havin'. Right at the back of me head, you know? Feels like a tight band, sometimes. It's been botherin' me for a little while now, nothin' too serious, but it just won’t quite go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. A headache, primarily at the back of the head, described as a tight band. And you said it's been going on for "a little while." Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It started, I’d say, maybe three weeks ago? Around the first week of July, I reckon. Not constant, mind you. Comes and goes. More often in the evenings, after I've been on me feet all day at the shop. I'm a manicurist, you see. Lots of bendin’ and lookin’ down.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, starting around the first week of July. More frequent in the evenings after work. You mentioned you’re a manicurist, which involves bending and looking down a lot. Has anything changed recently with your work—different products, longer hours, a different chair perhaps?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes! Old Miss Mabel, she retired last month. Lovely woman, but meant I had to take on a few extra clients. Maybe an hour or so more each day, on average. And the new chair at me station… it's not as comfortable as the old one, definitely. It doesn't give me proper support, I find.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, an increase in work hours and a less supportive chair. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… well, sometimes me vision gets a little blurry when the headache’s bad, but that passes quickly. And I feel a bit tired, naturally, with the extra work. But nothin' major, Doctor. No nausea, no dizziness, nothin' like that.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision with the headaches, and fatigue. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Me appetite’s been the same, thankfully. And me weight… well, I’m a skinny fella, always have been! Haven't gained or lost a pound, I reckon. Always been too busy workin’ to eat proper, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I try to stay away from pills if I can. Just a bit of liniment for me joints now and then, when they’re actin’ up. But nothin' regular, and nothin' for me head.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin' in me life, thankfully. Me mother always said I had a strong constitution. She was a wise woman, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any significant medical history—any past illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I had me appendix out when I was a young man, maybe sixty years ago now. That was all done and dusted quick enough. Apart from that, just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old! Nothing serious, mind you. Never been in hospital for anythin’ else. Good health, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Appendectomy sixty years ago, otherwise generally good health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll examine your neck and neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. Always been one to listen to me doctors, you see.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear. Neck shows mild tenderness in the suboccipital muscles. Neurological exam is normal. Based on your symptoms and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing tension headaches, likely exacerbated by the increased workload and the less supportive chair at your work station. The elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to monitor.
PATIENT: Tension headaches, you say? That makes sense, I suppose. I do carry a lot of tension in me shoulders and neck. And me blood pressure bein’ a bit high… that doesn't surprise me neither. I worry a lot, you see. What do you recommend I do, Doctor? Anything I can take? Or is it just a matter of tryin’ to relax more?
DOCTOR: It’s a combination of things. I’m not overly concerned about the blood pressure at this moment, but we should keep an eye on it. I’d like you to check it weekly at a pharmacy, and let me know the results. For the headaches, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief—either ibuprofen or acetaminophen as directed on the label. However, the most important thing is to address the underlying cause. I strongly advise you to see if you can get a better chair at your workstation. Perhaps a chair with more lumbar support. Also, focus on stress reduction techniques—deep breathing exercises, stretching, or even gentle yoga. I’m also going to recommend a course of physical therapy – three sessions, to focus on strengthening your neck and shoulder muscles and learning proper posture. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. A better chair… I'll definitely look into that. Me customers are always complainin' about me back, maybe it's time I took it seriously! And the physical therapy… yes, I think that's a good idea. I do get stiff and achey easily. Weekly blood pressure checks, pain relief when needed, a better chair, and some therapy… I think I can manage that. Will you write me a referral for the therapy?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll write you a referral to a physical therapy clinic nearby. Here you are. This referral is for three sessions with a physical therapist specializing in musculoskeletal issues. They'll assess your posture and teach you exercises to alleviate the tension. I also want you to monitor your headaches. If they become more frequent, more severe, or are accompanied by fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. You've put me at ease. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen and explain things so clearly. I’ll get started on findin’ a better chair and schedule the therapy as soon as I can. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions. And remember, check your blood pressure weekly and let us know the results. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will.
