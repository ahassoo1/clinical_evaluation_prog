DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm, yes. Good to meet you as well, Doctor… Gorga, is it? Well, I believe it’s this certification. One must keep up with these things, you know. Though, truthfully, the specifics… slip my mind. Something to do with ensuring I can continue… practicing. It’s rather tedious, all this paperwork and examination.
DOCTOR: Gorga, yes, that's right. And you're right, those certifications are a bit of a hassle. Just trying to pull up your records here… Okay, so it looks like this is your periodic re-certification physical. Just a standard check-up to make sure everything's still in order. To start, is there anything specific you've been feeling that brought you in today, aside from needing the certification?
PATIENT: Feeling? Oh, goodness. Well, let me see. At my age, one feels something most days, doesn’t one? Nothing particularly alarming, I suppose. Perhaps a touch more… fatigued than usual. But that could simply be the summer heat. And… well, my hearing isn’t what it used to be, naturally. Though I wouldn't say it's bad. Just… diminished. It’s difficult to follow conversations sometimes, especially when people mumble. A common affliction, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and some hearing loss… okay. We’ll definitely look into both of those. When did you start noticing the increased fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that is a difficult question. Time… it tends to blur, you see. Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It wasn’t sudden, not like a flu. Just… a gradual lessening of… pep. I used to be able to work a full day, no problem. Now, I find myself needing a little… respite in the afternoons. Though I maintain a perfectly respectable schedule, I assure you. I simply pace myself a bit more. Is that the sort of information you require, Doctor? I’m not accustomed to dissecting my daily constitution in such detail.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, actually. Gradual onset over six months. And you said it impacts your ability to work a full day?
PATIENT: Impacts is a strong word, Doctor. It… necessitates adjustments. I still see my patients, of course. I simply may not take on quite as many new cases. And perhaps I delegate a bit more of the administrative work. A prudent course of action, really. One can't be expected to do everything at my age. It's not as if I'm incapable, mind you. Just… prioritizing efficiency. It’s a matter of sound management, really. Do you follow? I find people often misunderstand.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Oriley. Prioritizing, managing workload… perfectly reasonable. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, let me think… My digestion isn’t quite what it once was, if you must know. A bit of… discomfort after meals. Nothing debilitating, mind you. And I’ve been… a little more irritable, perhaps. My wife—ex-wife, rather—always said I had a short fuse, but I believe it’s been… exacerbated lately. Though I assure you, Doctor, it doesn’t affect my professional conduct. I maintain a perfectly civil demeanor with my patients.
DOCTOR: Okay, some digestive discomfort and increased irritability. Anything that makes the digestive discomfort better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that is a question. I've not kept a precise log, you understand. Spicy foods certainly don't help. And… large portions, naturally. I find smaller, more frequent meals are… preferable. Though I do enjoy a good steak now and then. One mustn’t entirely deprive oneself. As for what improves it… a bit of rest, perhaps. And… a quiet evening. Though, truthfully, I haven't paid a great deal of attention. It's not a particularly… pressing concern. It's merely a minor inconvenience. Are we getting anywhere, Doctor? This feels rather… exhaustive.
DOCTOR: We’re getting there, Mr. Oriley. Smaller meals are better, spicy foods worsen it. And rest helps. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… Oh, dear. That’s… a rather broad inquiry. Well, my blood pressure has been… occasionally elevated, I believe. The doctor—a younger man, not nearly as experienced as myself—mentioned it a few years ago. He prescribed some… pills. I took them for a while. I stopped taking them, eventually. I prefer a more… natural approach, you see. And… well, I felt perfectly fine without them. I’ve always been rather… robust, constitutionally. As for other conditions… I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years ago, but I recovered admirably. And… well, that’s about it, I believe. I’ve been blessed with good health, all things considered. Is this information relevant, Doctor? I’m not quite certain I understand the purpose of this… interrogation.
DOCTOR: Okay, so I do see a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, treated with medication that you discontinued. That's important to know. Were you ever told about any other conditions – like high cholesterol, arthritis, or any problems with your heart or lungs?
PATIENT: Cholesterol… now there’s a word I haven’t heard in some time. I believe the aforementioned doctor—the younger one—mentioned something about it. He spoke of “numbers” and “levels.” I didn’t pay a great deal of attention, truthfully. I eat a perfectly sensible diet, you see. Plenty of fish, lean meats… not excessively fatty. And I’ve always been rather active. I walk regularly, maintain a good posture… the fundamentals, really. As for other problems… arthritis, you say? No, I’ve never been afflicted with such a condition. I have a perfectly supple range of motion. And my heart… well, I’ve always considered it to be in perfectly good working order. Though, admittedly, it beats a bit faster after a brisk walk. Which, I suppose, is to be expected. Is this all relevant, Doctor? I’m beginning to feel rather… fatigued. Perhaps we should conclude this… examination?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. I see a note about slightly elevated cholesterol in the past as well. Just to finish up the history, have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Oh! Yes, actually. When I was a young man, I had my tonsils removed. A rather unpleasant experience, I assure you. And… well, I believe I had a small mole removed from my back many years ago. A minor procedure, really. Hardly worth mentioning. Is that all, Doctor? I’m growing rather impatient. And I have a rather important appointment this afternoon. It’s a matter of… professional significance.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and mole removal. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… A rather… complicated subject, truthfully. My father… he was a robust man, a fisherman. He lived to a respectable age, though he suffered from a touch of… melancholy in his later years. My mother… she was a homemaker, a rather… delicate woman. She passed away relatively young, from… complications, I believe. As for other relatives… well, my family is rather… dispersed. I haven’t maintained close contact with many of them. I believe my uncle suffered from some… digestive ailment, but I’m not entirely certain. And my cousin… she had a touch of… arthritis, perhaps? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not particularly knowledgeable about my family’s medical history. It’s not a topic we… dwelled on. Is this information of any consequence, Doctor? I’m beginning to feel rather… unwell. Perhaps we should conclude this… inquiry?
DOCTOR: Okay, some digestive issues and arthritis in the family. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I have never touched a cigarette in my life. A most unhealthy habit, you see. As for alcohol… I occasionally partake in a glass of red wine with dinner. A small glass, mind you. For medicinal purposes, naturally. It’s good for the heart, you see. And… recreational drugs? The very idea! I am a healthcare professional, Doctor. I adhere to the highest ethical standards. Honestly, Doctor, I find these questions… rather impertinent. Are we nearing the conclusion of this… examination? I have a rather important appointment this afternoon, and I’m beginning to feel… decidedly faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a small glass of red wine. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Now let me think… I believe I experienced a touch of… discomfort after taking some… antibiotic years ago. A minor rash, I believe. It cleared up on its own, mind you. And I believe I had a slight… reaction to some… pain reliever once. A minor headache, I believe. Nothing debilitating, mind you. And… well, I have a slight aversion to penicillin. It… disagrees with me. But I wouldn’t classify it as a full-blown allergy. More of a… sensitivity. Is that all, Doctor? I’m growing increasingly impatient, and I must confess, I feel a bit… lightheaded. Perhaps we should conclude this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Thank you for answering my questions. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears, and feel your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of being… prodded and poked. I suppose it’s a necessary evil, if you insist. However, I must warn you, my constitution is… rather sensitive. Please be gentle. And do try to be expeditious. I have a rather important appointment this afternoon, and I’m beginning to feel… decidedly unwell. And please, no cold instruments. I dislike the sensation immensely. Let us get this… ordeal over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Hmm. Heart sounds are a bit… distant, but regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Ears look clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the lower quadrants. Alright, everything seems within normal limits, though your blood pressure is a little high and your abdomen is tender. It's likely nothing serious, but we should keep an eye on it. I'm going to order some routine blood work and a urine sample just to be on the safe side. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and urine samples… Honestly, Doctor, the indignity of it all! Very well. If you insist. Though I must confess, I find the process… rather unpleasant. And please, ensure the facilities are… impeccably clean. I have a certain… standard of hygiene. And will this… ordeal require a significant amount of my time? I have a rather important appointment this afternoon, and I’m beginning to feel… decidedly faint. And, please, no unnecessary poking and prodding. I have a sensitive constitution, you see. Let us get this… over with, shall we? I trust this will not take long.
DOCTOR: I'll write the orders for the lab now. It should only take about 15-20 minutes at the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. The nurse will give you a slip with the instructions. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce your stress levels, eat a healthy diet, and get regular exercise. We can also discuss some options for managing your blood pressure if the results come back high. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Reduce stress? Eat a healthy diet? Get regular exercise? Honestly, Doctor, are you suggesting I’ve been… neglecting my well-being? I assure you, I maintain a perfectly respectable lifestyle. I walk regularly, maintain a good posture, and eat a balanced diet. And as for stress… well, I am a healthcare professional, you see. I am accustomed to dealing with… challenging situations. Very well. I will… consider your suggestions. Though I must confess, I find the implication… rather insulting. And I trust these… blood tests will not reveal anything… alarming? I have a rather important appointment this afternoon, and I’m beginning to feel… decidedly unwell. Let us conclude this… consultation, shall we? I trust you will expedite these… results? And please, ensure the nurse is… discreet. I have a certain… reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Oriley. I didn't mean to imply anything. Just routine recommendations. The nurse will be in shortly with the lab orders. She’s very discreet. I'll have the lab fax the results to my office as soon as they're available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. I trust this… ordeal will not be repeated anytime soon. I have a rather important appointment this afternoon, you see, and I must confess, I am feeling… decidedly faint. And I sincerely hope these… blood tests reveal nothing… alarming. Please, let us conclude this… consultation, shall we? I trust you will expedite these… results? And please, inform the nurse to be… discreet. I have a certain… reputation to maintain. Very well, Doctor. Good day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. I'll have the nurse come in right away. Get some rest and try not to stress. The nurse will be very discreet. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
