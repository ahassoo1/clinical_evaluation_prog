DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Benic, is it?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Aurthur Benic. Good morning to ye, Doctor… Batara, is it? I hope I’m no keepin’ ye late.
DOCTOR: Morning. No, you’re not keeping me late. Though, frankly, I wish more patients were punctual. Now, let’s get down to business. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's been this nausea, see? Happens most mornings, right after I get up. It’s no a violent sickness, mind ye, more like a queasy feeling that sits in my stomach for a bit. The nurse asked a lot o’ questions, but I thought I’d explain it to ye directly, if that’s alright. It’s been happenin’ for… oh, maybe a month or so now. I've also been feelin' a wee bit breathless lately, but I figured it was just my age catchin’ up to me. They told me somethin’ about my heart… is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, roughly. It started gradually, just a bit off, but it's become more consistent lately. Every mornin', pretty much. It doesn't last long, thankfully. Maybe half an hour, an hour at the most. I usually just sit with a cup o’ tea and try to ignore it, but it's… worryin', ye ken? Especially with what the nurse said about my heart. Is it bad? I was told I had heart failure a while back… is this gettin’ worse?
DOCTOR: Heart failure… yes, I see here a previous diagnosis of congestive heart failure. And you’re experiencing nausea and shortness of breath. Right. And you say this happens after you get up?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. Usually within an hour or so o’ wakin’. I try to take it easy, but it’s still there. It’s no like a proper sickness, like the flu or nothin’. It’s more of a… unsettled feeling. And the breathlessness is just when I move around a bit, mind ye. Nothin’ major, but noticeable. I’m worried it’s all connected. They gave me some water pills last time, but they didn’t seem to help much with the nausea. Is that normal? Should I be expectin’ somethin’ worse? I’m no wantin’ to be a bother, but I just want to understand what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Water pills, diuretics… yes, those address the fluid retention associated with heart failure. The fact that they haven’t touched the nausea… well, that’s not entirely unexpected. Nausea isn’t always a direct symptom of heart failure, though it can be. Let's review your medications, shall we?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fair enough. I’ve got… let me think. There’s the Lisinopril, for my blood pressure, and the Digoxin, that’s for the heart, I believe. Oh, and I take a little somethin’ for my arthritis in my knees, but I doubt that's related. I’ve been takin’ them all for a good while now, and nothin’ has changed recently. I take them every mornin’ with my breakfast. I've no been missin' doses or nothin'. I’m pretty careful with that sort o’ thing. I just… I'm a bit anxious, ye see? It's worryin’ to feel different, especially when it comes to the heart. Do ye think it could be somethin’ else entirely?
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril and Digoxin… standard for heart failure management. We'll need to rule out medication side effects, of course, though nausea isn't a common one with either. It could be a simple stomach upset, but given your history, we can’t dismiss anything. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll need to take your blood pressure. Just relax, and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible enough. I’ll do me best to relax. It's just… I always feel a bit flustered when I’m at the doctor’s. Been comin’ here for years, and it still gets to me. Go ahead, then. I’ll sit still and try not to fidget. Let me know if ye need me to do anythin' special. I’m a bit bony, if that helps. No much to feel through, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is… irregular. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Lungs are clear, though I do detect some mild congestion. Blood pressure is elevated, 150 over 90. Not dangerously high, but certainly not optimal. It’s possible the nausea is related to your medication, but we need to rule out other causes. I’m going to order a basic blood panel – check your electrolytes, kidney function, and thyroid levels. Also, an ECG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. And, because of the shortness of breath, I want a chest X-ray. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I think so. Blood panel, ECG, and a chest X-ray… sounds thorough enough. Electrolytes, kidneys, thyroid… all the important bits, I suppose. Is that somethin’ I can get done here, or do I need to go somewhere else? And how long will it take to get the results back? I'm no in a rush, but it’s nice to know what I’m lookin’ at. It’s just… all this worryin’ is takin’ it out o’ me.
DOCTOR: We can do all of that here. The blood work will take about fifteen minutes, and the X-ray technician is free after lunch. Results usually come back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have the nurse contact you with the findings. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Aye, that's good to hear. Here, so it’s not too much bother. No allergies, no. Not to any medications, anyway. I’m a bit sensitive to pollen in the spring, but that's just a sniffle. Nothin’ serious. I’ve had all me vaccinations, and I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly. Fish and vegetables, that sort o’ thing. I do enjoy a wee bit o' chocolate now and then, but I don't go overboard. I try to be sensible, ye see.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Good. Now, do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, not a puff. Never have, never will. My father smoked, and it didn't do him any good. I've always steered clear of it. And I don't drink much either, just a small glass of wine with my supper on occasion. Mostly water, like I said. I’m tryin’ to look after meself, ye see. Is this all the questions ye have, Doctor? I'm happy to answer anythin' else ye need to know.
DOCTOR: Very well. I think that's all for now. The nurse will take you to get the blood work and schedule the X-ray. We’ll review the results when they come back. Try not to worry excessively. I’ve seen many patients with similar symptoms, and it's rarely anything catastrophic. Though, frankly, you really should be more diligent with your blood pressure. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Aye, I understand ye're busy, Doctor. And I’ll try not to worry, though it’s easier said than done. I’ll see the nurse, then. Thank ye for yer time. And thank ye for not makin’ me feel like a complete bother.
