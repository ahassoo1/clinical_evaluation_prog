DOCTOR: Good morning, Lytisha. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good morning to you too. Um... well, it's about a test, I think? Something to do with… checking things. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It was something the office called about, a screening, maybe? For… substances? I’m not entirely sure.
DOCTOR: Right, right. That's perfectly alright. Don’t worry about remembering all the details. It sounds like you're referring to a routine screening we sent out, likely for cholesterol and blood sugar – just a general health check. We often recommend those around your age. Do you have any specific concerns that prompted you to schedule this, or were you just responding to the office’s notice?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes sense. Cholesterol… yes, that rings a bell. No, no specific concerns, not really. Just… getting older, I suppose. The office said it was important, so I figured I should come in. It's been a while since I’ve had a proper check-up, to be honest. My husband… well, he always took care of all that.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very common for one partner to handle those things. No worries at all about the gap in check-ups, we'll get you back on track. Let's just run through a bit of your medical history to get a clearer picture. Have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I recall. I mean, doctors have poked and prodded over the years, but nothing major ever came of it. I think I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure once, a long time ago, when I was… stressed. But they said it was just temporary. Honestly, it's all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, “possible past elevated blood pressure, related to stress.” We can certainly check that again today. And what about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a little girl. And… and I had a hysterectomy many years ago. That's about it, I believe. Nothing else that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal and hysterectomy. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tough one. My mother… she had heart trouble, I think. And my father… he had something with his lungs, maybe emphysema? They both smoked, you see. A lot. It was a different time. My brother, he’s still alive, thankfully, but he has arthritis, pretty bad arthritis in his knees.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble and lung disease in your mother, and arthritis in your brother. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle… Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked. Never even tried it. My husband smoked for a while, but I always hated it. Made the house smell awful, and it worried me something terrible.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And what about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing regular, not a drinker really. Maybe once or twice a week, if that. Mostly, I drink water.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take something for my knees, a cream, mostly. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it last winter, said I wasn’t getting enough sun. Oh, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee cream, vitamin D supplement, and occasional ibuprofen. Alright. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m outside, but I think that’s just pollen. Nothing serious, nothing I need an EpiPen for.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to know. Now, Lytisha, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees, if you don't mind. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. My knees do bother me sometimes, so checking them would be good, if you think it’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll get started. First, let's take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, but a slightly faint murmur. Lungs are clear, but you have diminished breath sounds at the base of both lungs. That could be related to age or previous exposure to irritants. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. There’s some tenderness and swelling in both knees, and limited range of motion. It looks like early signs of osteoarthritis. It doesn’t appear to be acutely inflamed, thankfully.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Osteo… what was it? Arthritis? Is that serious? My knees have been aching more and more lately, especially when the weather is cold. And I do get stiff when I first get up in the morning.
DOCTOR: Yes, osteoarthritis. It’s a common condition, particularly as we get older. It’s essentially wear and tear on the cartilage in the joint. It's not necessarily serious in the sense of life-threatening, but it can certainly cause discomfort and limit your activity. The good news is we can manage it with various treatments. Given your blood pressure and diminished breath sounds, I’d also like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a vitamin D level. Perhaps a chest X-ray would also be helpful. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… a lot. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, of course. I trust your judgment. Just… please explain everything to me, okay? I don’t want to be surprised by anything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll explain everything as we go. The blood work will give us a better picture of your overall health, including your cholesterol, kidney function, and vitamin levels. The chest X-ray will help us to assess your lungs and determine the cause of the diminished breath sounds. It’s routine, Lytisha, just to be thorough. Now, I’m going to write up the orders for the lab work and X-ray. I'll also give you a referral to a physical therapist who can help you with your knee pain. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that aggravate your knees, and consider using a warm compress or over-the-counter pain reliever if needed. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A physical therapist… that sounds good. Maybe they can teach me some exercises. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… when will I get the results of the tests? And will you explain them to me when I come back?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. The X-ray results may take a bit longer, perhaps a week. The office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once everything is available. At that appointment, we’ll discuss the results in detail and develop a plan to address your blood pressure, knee pain, and any other concerns that arise. I will personally go over everything with you. Now, here are the lab orders and the referral to the physical therapist. If you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe knee pain, please don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room. Do you have any other concerns before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lytisha. It was my pleasure. Remember, we're a team, and we'll work together to get you feeling your best. If anything comes up, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
