DOCTOR: Good morning, Tierney. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I came in to get tested for HIV. I wanted to get it checked, just to be sure, you understand. It’s better to know, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It is always better to know. Thank you for being proactive about your health, Tierney. To give you the best care, I’ll need to ask a few questions, if you don’t mind. It’s all confidential, of course. First, have you had any recent illnesses or been feeling unwell lately?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I’ve been quite well, thank you. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, you know? Nothing serious. No fever, no cough, nothing like that. I’ve been eating well, trying to stay active. My husband and I, we go for walks most evenings.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, staying active is excellent. And how about any changes in your weight recently – either loss or gain?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I think my weight has stayed pretty much the same. Perhaps a little fluctuation, as you'd expect, but nothing significant. I’m quite tall, you see – almost six foot six – so a pound or two doesn't make much difference! I haven’t been dieting or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, I do see your height noted here. Good. Now, have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. This would be my first time. I’ve always been careful, of course, but… well, you never know, do you? It’s just something I’ve been thinking about lately. I wanted to have peace of mind. My husband doesn’t know I’m here today, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. That’s perfectly alright, everything is confidential here. Now, to help me understand your risk a bit better, have you ever shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. I’ve never taken any sort of… injections, except for what the doctors have given me, and always with a clean needle, of course. I wouldn’t dream of it. I'm a very cautious person, Doctor. You have my word.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s good to know. And have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections – STIs – diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Not ever. I’ve been married for a very long time, almost forty years now, and we’ve always been… faithful to each other. We’ve been very careful over the years. I can assure you of that. It’s something we both take seriously.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Tierney. Now, sometimes HIV can be transmitted through blood transfusions, although it’s much rarer these days with the testing they do. Have you ever received a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I believe I did, a long time ago, when I had my son. It was a complicated delivery, and I lost a lot of blood. That must have been… oh, almost thirty years ago now. I don't recall the exact date, but it was definitely after he was born. It was at the local hospital, the one that’s now closed down.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. Now, to be thorough, have you ever had any unprotected sexual contact with anyone other than your husband?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. As I said, my husband and I have been together for forty years, and we’ve always been faithful to each other. I’m a very devoted wife, Doctor. I wouldn't dream of such a thing. I simply wanted to be sure, you understand? Peace of mind is what I’m after. It's not that I suspect anything, but… one can never be too careful, can one?
DOCTOR: No, you are absolutely right. It's always best to be cautious. Alright, Tierney, given your history, we can proceed with the HIV test. It's a simple blood draw. I'd also like to check for other sexually transmitted infections, just to be comprehensive. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. If it's comprehensive, then yes, please do. The more information, the better, as you say. A blood draw is fine, no problem at all. Just tell me when and where, and I’ll be ready. I’m not afraid of needles, you know. It’s the result I’m a little anxious about, but… we’ll face it either way.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your anxiety, and we will discuss the results thoroughly, no matter what they are. The phlebotomist is just down the hall, in room three. They will draw the blood, and it will take about ten minutes. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, typically within a week, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Room three, you say? I’ll go right now. A week is perfectly acceptable. Thank you for being so thorough and understanding. It’s put my mind at ease already, just knowing I’m doing this. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tierney. That’s what I’m here for. And remember, regardless of the results, we'll figure out the best plan of action together. Don't hesitate to let the nurses know if you feel unwell after the blood draw. And please, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Now, you go ahead and see the phlebotomist.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that very much. You’ve been most kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tierney. Have a good day. .
