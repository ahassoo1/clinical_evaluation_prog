DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Schaust, let's get straight to it. You're 25, Swedish… and rather thin, if I may say so. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, that’s correct. It’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker lately, and my eyelids… they’re drooping. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, I’d say. It makes me look quite tired, and honestly, it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids… months, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. It started subtly, I think around… February, maybe? At first, I just thought I wasn't sleeping enough. But it hasn't gotten better with more rest. It’s… it’s in my arms and legs mostly, a general feeling of being… less strong, if that makes sense. And the eyelids are definitely getting heavier. I have to concentrate to keep them open sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. And has this weakness been progressively worsening, or has it been fluctuating?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it's been pretty steady, actually. Not big jumps, just… a little bit worse each week, perhaps. It's not like some days are good and some are bad. Just… consistently getting weaker. I haven’t noticed anything helping it, either. No matter how much I rest, it doesn't seem to improve. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a… relative term. Any changes in vision?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Now that you mention it… yes, actually. My vision gets blurry sometimes, particularly towards the end of the day. It's not terrible, but I have to squint more to read or look at the computer screen. I thought it was just eye strain from work, to be honest. I do a lot of work on the computer. Is that related, do you think?
DOCTOR: And your occupation is…?
PATIENT: I'm a Facilities Manager. So, I’m often running around, inspecting buildings, coordinating repairs… it keeps me quite busy. A fair amount of walking and being on my feet, but not… strenuous physical labor, if that makes sense. Mostly problem-solving and organisation.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any difficulty with swallowing or speech?
PATIENT: No, no difficulties with those, thankfully. Swallowing is normal, and my speech… well, I don’t think it’s changed. I haven’t noticed anything different there. My ex-wife would certainly have told me if she noticed anything unusual, she always did. But, no, genuinely, I haven’t had any trouble with either of those.
DOCTOR: Any family history of… neurological issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's… a tricky one. My mother had some health problems, but I’m not entirely sure what. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t have a lot of information. My father… he’s still alive, but he’s not very forthcoming about these things. He's a private man. I don’t recall anyone having anything specifically neurological, no. But I can’t say with absolute certainty. I haven't really discussed health much with either of them, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm, you're not currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid them if I can. I had a bad experience with some antibiotics when I was a teenager, so I'm quite wary of taking anything unless absolutely necessary. Just… over-the-counter painkillers occasionally, for headaches, but nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: If you could just sit here, please. I'll start with your reflexes. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here we go. I'll do my best to follow your finger. Just let me know if I'm doing anything wrong.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. A little weaker than I'd expect. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Those are… sluggish. And as I suspected, some noticeable ptosis. Let’s check your muscle strength. Can you push against my hands when I say so?
PATIENT: Alright, yes, I’ll try my best. Push when you say so. I’ll do my best, but as you’ve already noticed, I’m not feeling very strong.
DOCTOR: Yes, as expected. 4 out of 5 in all extremities. That’s… concerning. Alright. Given your symptoms – the weakness, the drooping eyelids, the diminished reflexes, and the decreased muscle strength – I’m concerned about a possible neuromuscular junction disorder. It's a preliminary assessment, of course, and we’ll need further testing to confirm.
PATIENT: Neuromuscular… junction? That sounds… serious. What does that mean, exactly? Is it something… curable? And what kind of testing are we talking about? I have to admit, Doctor, this is quite worrying. I just want to understand what’s going on, and what the next steps are.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, yes. Neuromuscular junction disorders affect communication between your nerves and muscles. Myasthenia Gravis is one possibility, but there are others. It’s not necessarily uncurable, but it is often manageable with medication. We need to confirm with blood tests to check for specific antibodies, and an electromyography, or EMG, to assess nerve and muscle function. This will help determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment. I’m going to order those tests now. And I'm referring you to a neurologist for further evaluation. They’ll be best equipped to manage this.
PATIENT: An EMG? That sounds… unpleasant. And a neurologist… right. Okay. Blood tests and… the EMG. I suppose that’s what needs to be done. How long will it take to get the results of the blood tests? And… what does the neurologist do exactly? Do they… inject things? I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: The blood tests should take approximately 3-5 business days. As for the neurologist… they specialize in disorders of the nervous system. They will review your test results, perform a more detailed neurological examination, and determine the best course of treatment. Some treatments may involve injections, yes, but that will depend on the diagnosis. We'll discuss that if and when we get to that point. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. Here are the orders. Please schedule an appointment with the neurologist as soon as possible. I’m going to write you a short prescription for pyridostigmine to see if it helps with your symptoms, but it’s just a trial. Do not adjust the dosage without consulting the neurologist. Any questions?
PATIENT: Pyridostigmine… right. A trial. 3-5 business days for the blood tests… and then the neurologist. It’s a lot to take in. So, if this pyridostigmine… helps, it would suggest this Myasthenia Gravis is the problem? And if it doesn’t… what then? It’s just… so many possibilities, and I’m not sure I understand what they all mean. And… is this something I should be worried about? Could it… get worse quickly? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor, but I'm quite anxious.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Schaust, I understand you're anxious. It’s a lot of information, and it’s natural to be worried. If the pyridostigmine helps, it strengthens the possibility of Myasthenia Gravis, yes, but it's not a definitive diagnosis. And if it doesn't… well, then we’ll investigate other possibilities. Neuromuscular disorders can progress, but that varies greatly depending on the specific condition. We’ll monitor your symptoms closely and manage them accordingly. The neurologist is the specialist who can give you a more detailed prognosis and treatment plan. Frankly, I’ve given you what initial assessment I can. I recommend you focus on scheduling that appointment. Do you have any further questions for me specifically, before I move on to other patients?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all for now. I suppose I just need to… schedule the appointment. And wait. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Right. Very well. Good day.
