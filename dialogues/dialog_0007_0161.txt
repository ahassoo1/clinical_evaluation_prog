DOCTOR: Hi Helaina, welcome. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me – what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Thanks for having me. Um, well, a friend of mine mentioned I should come talk about… something to help prevent HIV. She said it's a pill you can take, even before anything happens. That's why I'm here, I guess. To learn more about it. It’s… a bit embarrassing to talk about, honestly, but better safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No need to be embarrassed at all, Helaina. It’s very responsible of you to be proactive about your health. You’re right, “better safe than sorry” is a great way to put it. Your friend is referring to pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. It's a medication taken to prevent HIV infection. Before we get into the details of PrEP, could you tell me a little bit more about why you’re interested in it now?
PATIENT: Well… I’m single, you see. Been that way for a while. And, I… date. Occasionally. It’s not always easy meeting people, and sometimes… you just don’t know the other person, you know? I try to be careful, of course, but… things happen. My friend said this pill would give me peace of mind. And honestly, I could really use some peace of mind these days. It just feels…smart. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Helaina. Being proactive about your health, especially in dating situations where you might not know someone well, is very smart. It’s good you’re thinking about this. To see if PrEP is right for you, I need to ask a few questions, just like I would for any new medication. We'll go through your medical history, some lifestyle factors, and make sure there aren't any reasons why it wouldn't be a good fit. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Ask away. I don't have any big secrets, thankfully. I’ll try to remember everything, but… sometimes my mind wanders, you know? But I’ll do my best. Just let me know if anything isn’t clear.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Helaina. We can take things at your pace. I’ll try to keep things clear and concise. I’ll also be documenting everything as we go. Let's start with your general health. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or liver problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, nothing like that. I had a bit of a scare with my cholesterol a few years back, but it came down with diet and exercise. Doctor said I was good to go then. Besides that… just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I suppose! Nothing serious. I get regular check-ups with Dr. Khalil, my primary care physician, if that helps? He'd have a full record, if you need it.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Helaina. No major health concerns is excellent. And knowing you see Dr. Khalil is helpful – we can certainly get records if needed. We'll start with what you recall, though. Okay, how about past surgeries?
PATIENT: Let's see… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. And… oh! I had a minor knee surgery a long time ago, after I tripped and fell… maybe fifteen years ago? It was just to repair a torn meniscus. They scoped it, nothing major. I haven’t had any problems with it since. Honestly, that's pretty much it for surgeries. I’ve been lucky, really. Avoided anything serious, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Helaina. No recent or major surgeries is helpful. Now, let’s talk about family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, kidney problems, or HIV?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tough one. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had heart problems, I think. He died when I was young, so I don’t remember a lot of the details. My sister, she’s healthy as a horse, thankfully. No cancer that I know of on either side of the family. And… no HIV, to my knowledge. We don’t really talk about those sorts of things much, if you understand what I mean. It's not a common conversation in my family.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Helaina. It's very common for those topics to be difficult to discuss. Knowing about a few key conditions is helpful, and what you've shared is a good start. Next, I’m going to ask about your social history. This includes things like smoking, alcohol use, and drug use. It's all confidential, of course.
PATIENT: Okay, go ahead. I don't smoke, never have. Tried it once when I was younger, didn’t like it. As for alcohol… I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing excessive, I promise. And… definitely no drugs. Never been interested. I’ve always been a bit of a rule-follower, I suppose. Not proud of it, but it's true.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Helaina. Moderate alcohol use is fine. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I’m not allergic to penicillin or any common medications. I’ve had a few itchy reactions to mosquito bites, but that's about it. And no food allergies, thankfully. I love to cook, so that would be a disaster! I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction to anything, to my knowledge. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I guess I’m pretty lucky in that department too.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Helaina. No known allergies is great. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… just a multivitamin, really. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but that's it. Nothing regular. Oh! And I have some eye drops for dry eyes, but again, I don't use them every day. Definitely nothing prescribed by a doctor. Just the basics, really. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Helaina, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I'm not squeamish or anything. I've had physicals before, of course. Just let me know if anything feels… odd.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular. I’ll also take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears are clear, throat looks normal. No signs of infection. Finally, I'll palpate your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are normal, no swelling or tenderness. Everything appears normal so far. Now, to determine if PrEP is right for you, we’ll need to do some blood work. This will check your kidney function, liver function, and screen for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood work is fine. I figured that would be necessary. As long as it doesn’t involve too many needles… I'm not a huge fan, but I’ll manage. And… just to be clear, will this test definitely tell me if I’m a good candidate for this pill? Is there a chance it could say no? I guess I'm just… preparing myself for either outcome.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Helaina. The blood work will give us a comprehensive picture of your overall health and help us determine if PrEP is a safe and effective option for you. There is a chance the results could indicate that PrEP isn't suitable for you at this time. For example, if your kidney function isn’t optimal, or if you have an existing medical condition that could interact with the medication, we would need to address that first. It doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t take PrEP in the future, but it might mean we need to do some further investigation or explore other prevention options. It’s also important to remember that PrEP requires regular follow-up appointments and STI screening. We would need to monitor your health closely while you're on the medication. I’ll have the lab technician draw a few vials of blood. It shouldn’t take long. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a decision together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It's good to know what to expect. Regular check-ups and STI screening make sense, of course. I wouldn’t want to be reckless. Okay, let's get the blood work done. The sooner we know, the better, right? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Exactly. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can make an informed decision. The lab is just down the hall to your left. You'll check in with the receptionist, and they'll let the technician know I've requested blood work for you. They’ll also need your insurance information. It shouldn’t take too long. Once you’re done, you can come back, and I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just down the hall, check in, give them my insurance… got it. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful and… reassuring, actually. I feel much better prepared now. I’ll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the meantime. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day. .
