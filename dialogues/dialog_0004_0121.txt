DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Dry eyes. That’s why I’m here. Been feelin’ like sand in ‘em for a while now. Makes lookin’ at things… hard.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Sand in ‘em,” you say. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… a good few months, I reckon. Maybe six? Hard to say for sure. Time kinda… blurs these days. It’s not somethin’ that came on fast. Just… got worse and worse. Mostly when I’m workin’.
DOCTOR: Right. And what kind of work do you do, Mr. Pipolo?
PATIENT: Cement work. Concrete, mostly. Been doin' it a long time. Out in the sun a lot, you know? Dust, wind… that kinda stuff. Makes a mess of everything, it does.
DOCTOR: So, prolonged exposure to dust and wind while doing cement work. I see. Do you typically wear any eye protection when you're on the job?
PATIENT: Eye protection? Sometimes. Not always. I got some goggles, but they fog up real quick. And they’re… uncomfortable. Hard to see good when they’re all steamed up, y’know? I usually just try to blink it through. Not the smartest thing, I guess.
DOCTOR: No, it isn't. Alright. And aside from the feeling of sand in your eyes and the fogging goggles, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my eyes feel… tired. Real tired. Especially at the end of the day. And a little… blurry. Not all the time, just when I’m really strained. And sometimes they water up a bit, then feel scratchy again. It's a whole mess, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tired eyes, blurry vision with strain, and some watering followed by scratchiness. Have you noticed any redness, discharge, or any pain in either eye?
PATIENT: Nah, no pain. And not much redness, not that I've seen. Maybe a little bit after a long day, but nothin’ bad. No… stuff comin’ out of ‘em, neither. Just dry. Real dry and scratchy. Like someone’s rubbin’ sandpaper on ‘em.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything to alleviate the dryness – any over-the-counter eye drops, ointments, or home remedies?
PATIENT: Eye drops… yeah. Bought some at the store, the kind for dry eyes. Didn't seem to do much, honestly. Helped for a minute, then it was right back to scratchy. And I try to blink more, but that’s about it. Not much else I can do when I’m workin', y’know? Gotta keep my eyes open to see what I'm doin'.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, over-the-counter drops provide minimal relief. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions – diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… nothin’ major, not that I know of. Doc always said I was a tough old bird. Blood pressure was a little high a few years back, but they gave me a pill for that. Take it every day. Other than that… no, can’t think of anything. And I don't take much medicine. Don’t like it.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure managed with medication. Good. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Had my appendix out when I was a kid. Long time ago. And… oh! Had a little somethin’ on my knee, a while back. Doc fixed it, but that was years and years ago. Nothin' else, far as I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendectomy as a child and a knee surgery, unspecified. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. And I haven’t had any trouble with pills, if that's what you mean. Never been one to be real sensitive. Folks always said I was too stubborn to even feel sick.
DOCTOR: Right. Very good. And finally, is there anyone in your family with similar eye problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my sister, she had trouble with her eyesight when she got older. Needed glasses, real thick ones. And my grandpa… he had somethin’ with his eyes, but I don’t rightly remember what it was. Old age, probably. Everyone in my family lived a long time, but nobody talked much about what was ailin’ ‘em. Didn’t believe in doctors much, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a look at your eyes. Could you please sit up and face me?
PATIENT: Alright. Just tell me what you need me to do. I’m ready when you are. Hope it doesn’t take too long. Gotta get back to work, you know. Still got a slab to pour this week.
DOCTOR: Okay. Please look straight ahead. I’m going to check your visual acuity first. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: E… F… P… T… O… …Can’t see the next one. It's all blurry. Is that the big 'E' chart? My eyesight ain't what it used to be, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Right. Noted. Your visual acuity is reduced. Now, I’m going to check the external structures of your eyes. Your eyelids appear normal, though slightly dry. The conjunctiva is a bit pale, but no significant redness. Your corneas appear clear, though they are also dry. Pupil response is normal in both eyes. It's as I suspected. You have significant dryness of both eyes, and a mild reduction in your visual acuity. Your occupation clearly exacerbates this condition.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Is it somethin’ serious? And what can I do about it? I gotta keep workin', you know. Can’t just… stop.
DOCTOR: It's not serious in the sense of an immediate threat to your vision, but it's certainly something that needs to be addressed. The dryness is causing irritation and likely contributing to the reduced acuity. You're essentially causing micro-abrasions to the surface of your eyes with every blink. It's a fairly common issue with people in your line of work, especially those who don't take proper precautions. The immediate plan is to aggressively lubricate your eyes. I'm going to prescribe you a stronger artificial tear, to be used four times a day. But that's merely a symptomatic treatment. You absolutely need to start wearing proper eye protection at all times when you’re working. Goggles, a full face shield – whatever it takes to prevent dust and debris from entering your eyes. And I strongly recommend you limit your exposure as much as possible. Perhaps consider asking your employer for accommodations.
PATIENT: Accommodations? That ain't gonna happen. Old Man Hemlock ain't the accommodatin' type. He expects us to just… get on with it. And those goggles fog up, remember? I can't see nothin' when they’re fogged up. So… just use the drops, and try to wear the goggles, even if they're no good? Is that it? What if that don’t work? What if my eyes get worse?
DOCTOR: Look, I can only give you the best medical advice. If the drops and goggles don’t alleviate the symptoms, then the condition will worsen. Persistent dryness can lead to corneal damage, and potentially affect your vision long-term. If the artificial tears aren’t sufficient, we can consider a more potent lubricating ointment to use at night. But that’s a temporary measure. You really need to address the root cause, which is your exposure. And frankly, given your age and occupation, I would also recommend a consultation with an ophthalmologist. They can perform a more comprehensive evaluation and determine if there’s any underlying pathology contributing to the dryness. I’m writing a referral now. And, to be blunt, if your symptoms continue to worsen despite these measures, you may need to consider a different line of work. Here’s the referral. It’s to Dr. Evelyn Reed. She’s a good doctor. And don't delay, Mr. Pipolo. Ignoring this could have serious consequences.
PATIENT: Another doctor... Great. More time wasted. Look, I appreciate your… advice. But I gotta go. Got a slab to pour. I'll try the drops, I guess. And I'll try to wear those goggles. But don't hold your breath. Just… hope it doesn't come to havin' to find a different job. Can't see myself doin' much else at my age. .
DOCTOR: Some people just don't listen. .
