DOCTOR: Hi Lilyanna, welcome! I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet lately. Like I might fall. It’s been happening for… a while now, I think. I apologize, my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all about the memory – it happens. “Unsteady on your feet” is a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about when you notice it?
PATIENT: When…? Hmm. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific, truthfully. Sometimes it’s when I’m just walking, other times when I’m… standing still. Or even when I try to sit down. It’s rather unpredictable. I work with… drills, you see. Rotary drills. Oil and Gas. It’s concerning when it happens there, naturally. But it's hard to say if the work makes it worse, or if it’s just… always there. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. So it’s pretty consistent, happening with different activities, not just when you're at work. And you're worried about it impacting your job, with the drills?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It is concerning at work. A great deal, actually. It’s… a precarious situation, to put it mildly. And… well, my husband… he passed away a few years ago now. I’ve been… managing on my own since then. I don’t have anyone to… assist me, if something were to happen. Which makes the unsteadiness all the more frightening, if you understand. It’s just… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That sounds incredibly stressful, Lilyanna. Losing your husband must have been devastating, and navigating this on your own is a lot to handle. Let’s focus on this unsteadiness for now. Besides the feeling of falling, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Not that I can recall, no. No dizziness, or… blurred vision. No headaches, thankfully. I haven’t been feeling nauseous, or anything like that. It’s… mostly just the feeling of being off-balance. Like my feet aren’t quite… connected, perhaps? It’s a peculiar sensation. I do have… private insurance, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the insurance, thank you. And "not quite connected" is a helpful way to describe it. Okay. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, I don't think so. Everything seems to be… functioning, as it were. I’m still able to do my work, though with increasing… caution. It's hard to explain. It’s not a noticeable weakness, precisely. More of a… fragility, maybe? Like I could lose my balance at any moment. I'm very tall, Doctor, if that matters. One-ninety-three centimeters. It might be related?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know you're still able to function at work, even with caution. And yes, your height could be relevant – we'll keep that in mind. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… difficult. My memory is quite patchy, I’m afraid. I haven’t been seriously ill, not that I recall. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing major. I did… twist my ankle once, years ago, working on the rig. But it healed fully, I believe. And… I’ve had the standard vaccinations. Beyond that, I’m afraid I can’t offer much assistance. It's just… a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all. Childhood illnesses and a twisted ankle – that’s good to know. How about any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. I’ve always been… relatively healthy, all things considered. Until recently, of course. This unsteadiness… it’s rather unsettling. I’m starting to worry it’s something serious, and… well, I don’t really have anyone to discuss it with. My husband… he would have known what to do. I apologize for rambling. It’s just… it’s a lot to process.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Lilyanna. It's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed and to miss having someone to lean on. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… another difficult question, I’m afraid. I didn’t know my parents well – they passed away when I was very young. And I don’t have any siblings, or close relatives that I’m aware of. So, I have very little knowledge of my family’s medical history. If there were any conditions that ran in the family, I wouldn’t know what they are. I apologize for being unhelpful. It’s frustrating to not be able to provide more information.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It's not your fault that you don't have that information. We'll work with what we have. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I don’t smoke. I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine on a special occasion, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’ve always been a very… temperate person. My work requires me to be alert and focused, and I wouldn’t risk jeopardizing that. I apologize, I hope I’m not being… difficult, but I find these questions rather personal.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Lilyanna. I understand your concern, and I apologize if any of these questions feel intrusive. We just need to gather as much information as possible to get to the bottom of this. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any allergic reactions to medications in the past. I'm not allergic to any foods, or… anything else, as far as I know. I’ve always been… rather robust, in that regard. But… I will admit, my memory is a bit hazy. If I were to experience an allergic reaction, I might not even realize it. It’s just… a bit of a concern, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for that information. Now, Lilyanna, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’d like to check your balance and coordination, and do a basic neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I’m… ready. Though I apologize in advance if I stumble, or… prove uncooperative. It’s just the unsteadiness, you understand. But I will do my best to assist you in any way I can. I just hope you can determine the cause of this… problem.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just relax, and I’ll guide you through everything. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not concerningly so. Pulse is 72, regular. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, could you please stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: There… that was a bit… difficult. As you can see, Doctor. It’s… rather challenging to maintain my balance. I’m trying my best, but… I feel as though I might fall. Perhaps I should sit back down? It’s just… a precaution, you understand. I don’t want to… complicate matters.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Let’s take it slow. No need to push yourself. I see what you mean about the balance. Now, could you try walking a few steps for me, like you normally would?
PATIENT: Oh! Excuse me. As you can see, Doctor… it’s… not ideal. I’m trying, truly I am. But the unsteadiness is… quite pronounced. I apologize for the… disturbance. Perhaps a chair would be… advisable? It's becoming increasingly difficult to maintain my equilibrium. I feel a little… dizzy now, perhaps?
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Lilyanna. It’s good that you let me know. And yes, it sounds like you are experiencing some dizziness. Let’s have you sit back down. Okay. And a quick Romberg test shows some instability. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal, but your coordination is a little off. Overall, your exam suggests some balance and coordination issues. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions. Do you have any trouble with your vision?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. My vision seems… perfectly normal. I can see clearly, both near and far. I haven’t noticed any blurriness, or… double vision, or anything like that. I have had my eyes checked recently, and the results were… satisfactory. But I will admit, my memory isn’t what it once was. Perhaps I should consult with an ophthalmologist, just to be… certain? It's just... a precaution, you understand. I want to ensure there are no underlying issues that are contributing to this… problem.
DOCTOR: That's a good idea, and we can certainly write a referral if you'd like. But right now, based on your history and exam, several possibilities come to mind. It could be a problem with your inner ear, which controls balance. Or it could be related to your nervous system. We can also consider vitamin deficiencies or even certain medications, though you haven’t mentioned any. To get a clearer picture, I recommend some blood tests to check for vitamin levels and rule out any other underlying causes. I'd also like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any neurological problems. And a referral to an audiologist for a hearing and balance test would be beneficial. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds rather comprehensive, Doctor. And… a little daunting, if I’m honest. But if it’s necessary to determine the cause of this… unsteadiness, then I suppose I have no objections. Blood tests, an MRI… and a visit to an audiologist. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed with whatever tests you deem necessary. I just hope we can find an answer soon. It’s… unsettling to feel so unstable, and I would like to regain my equilibrium, if that’s possible. I apologize for rambling. It’s just… a bit much to process.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Lilyanna. It is a lot to take in, and I understand your anxiety. Okay, I'll order those tests right away. The lab work can be done here at the clinic. We'll schedule the MRI and audiologist appointment for you. The results will take a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and being extra cautious with your movements. If the unsteadiness worsens or you experience any new symptoms like headaches, vision changes, or weakness, please come back immediately. I'll also give you a referral for physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you some exercises to improve your balance and coordination. And I’ll send you home with a list of fall prevention tips. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A plan of action is… reassuring. Blood tests, an MRI, an audiologist… and physical therapy. And a list of fall prevention tips. I will… heed your advice, and avoid strenuous activity. And I will come back immediately if the unsteadiness worsens. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your… patience. I apologize for being such a… difficult patient. But I truly hope we can determine the cause of this… problem, and I can regain my equilibrium. Perhaps with a little assistance, I can return to my work, and… live a more stable life. If you’ll excuse me, Doctor, I believe I need to sit down for a moment. It’s all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You're not a difficult patient at all, Lilyanna. It's my job to help you, and I'm glad we have a plan in place. Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have the nurse come in and review the paperwork with you, and schedule your follow-up appointments. Please take your time, and rest as much as you need. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Lilyanna. We'll be in touch soon.
