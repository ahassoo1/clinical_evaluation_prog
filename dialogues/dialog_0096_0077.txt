DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger, good morning. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Good morning to you too, Doctor. They tell me I gotta come. Something about the place I work… the mine. Been working there a long time, you know. Never had trouble before. They just… want to check things. Seems a waste of time, if you ask me. But here I am.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's always best to be thorough, even if everything seems fine. And a long work history is important information. So, the mine… how long have you been working there exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think now. A long time. Started… after I came back from the war. That was… sixty years ago, maybe more? A very long time. Still loading and moving things, same as when I started. Strong back, you know. Still is. Not like these young folks these days.
DOCTOR: Sixty years… impressive. And you said loading and moving things?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Big machines, mostly. Digging things out of the ground. Rocks, mostly. And… dust. Lots of dust. Always dust. They give us masks, but… well, they don't always fit good, you know? And it gets hot. Can't breathe good with all that on.
DOCTOR: Dust, you say. And the masks aren’t a perfect fit. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your breathing recently?
PATIENT: Changes? No. Not really. I breathe. Always have. Always will. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s just from the work, you know? Old age catching up. Not from dust. I tell you, these young doctors, always looking for something wrong. Back in my day… we just got on with it.
DOCTOR: I understand. But it's still important to rule things out. Now, besides the tiredness, have you had any coughing?
PATIENT: Coughing? Sometimes. A little tickle in my throat. Everybody coughs, Doctor. Especially when the weather changes. It’s… normal. Not a bad cough, mind you. Just a little one. Nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Now you’re talking nonsense, Doctor. I work in a mine! It’s hard work, of course it gets you puffing sometimes. That’s just… being out of shape. It goes away when I rest. You think I can’t handle a little work? I’ve been loading rocks since before you were born!
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I'm not questioning your strength. I'm simply trying to get a complete picture of your health. Has this… puffing, as you call it, been getting worse over time?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm… maybe a little. But that’s just the age, I tell you. Everything gets harder when you get old. It’s not the mine. It’s… life. You can't expect to be young forever. I'm not complaining. Just… getting older.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's just do a quick listen to your lungs, just to be certain. It won't take long. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Listen to my lungs? What for? They're fine! I'm breathing, aren't I? This is a waste of time. But... alright. If you insist. Don't go poking around too much, though. I don't like being fiddled with.
DOCTOR: Just a routine check, Mr. Bigger. Deep breath in… and out… again… deep breath in… and out… Hmm. I do hear some… decreased air entry in the lower lobes, and some faint crackles. It's not dramatic, but it’s something we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Crackles? Decreased… what now? What does that mean? You're scaring me now, Doctor. Is it something serious? All this poking and listening... I told you I was fine! Just old. It's just… old age!
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Mr. Bigger. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but given your long history of working in the mine, and the dust exposure, we need to rule out something called pneumoconiosis – a lung disease caused by inhaling dust. It’s a common risk for miners. We'll need a chest X-ray and some breathing tests to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Pneumo… what-now-sis? A lung disease? From dust? You mean to tell me all these years of working… I've been getting sick from the dust? Why didn't they tell us this before? Masks weren’t good enough? I should have… This is… this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: It’s not always immediately apparent, Mr. Bigger. And masks can only do so much. We’re simply being thorough. The X-ray and breathing tests will give us a definitive answer. I'm going to write you a referral to the radiology department and the pulmonary function lab. They'll schedule the appointments for you. It's best to get this checked out promptly, just to be safe. It's likely nothing serious, but it’s better to know for certain.
PATIENT: Promptly? You mean I have to go to more places now? More poking and prodding? I just want to go home. I've been working hard my whole life, and now you're telling me I might be sick from it? This is… not how I expected my day to go. Give me the papers. I’ll… I’ll see what I can do. But I’m telling you, Doctor, I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Here are the referrals. The radiology department is located at… and the pulmonary function lab is… . It's best to schedule these appointments as soon as possible. And please, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or a persistent cough, go to the emergency room immediately. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Emergency room? You think I’m that sick? No, no. I just want to go home. All this worry... for nothing. Thank you, Doctor. I think. I'll… I'll see about those appointments. .
DOCTOR: .
