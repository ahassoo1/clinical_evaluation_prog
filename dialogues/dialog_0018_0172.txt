DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Honestly, it's just this…visit. My husband insisted. New to the area, you know. Medicare requires these…check-ins. It's all rather bothersome, if you must know. I’m perfectly fine, thank you. Just trying to get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Engelhaupt. It's quite common to have routine check-ups required by insurance, and it can sometimes feel unnecessary when you're feeling well. However, these visits are important for preventative care and to establish a baseline for your health, especially as you settle into a new area. Let’s proceed with a standard assessment, if you don't mind. It will allow us to ensure everything is as it should be. To begin, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Heavens. Well, I’ve lived a long life, haven’t I? I suppose that says something. I haven’t been seriously ill…not for decades. A touch of arthritis now and then, but nothing a bit of sensible living can't manage. Really, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Are we going to be here all day? I have luncheon plans.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that, Ms. Engelhaupt, and it’s wonderful to hear you’ve maintained good health for so long. We certainly won't be here all day; I assure you. I simply want to gather a bit of information to get a comprehensive understanding of your health history. Could you tell me about any past medical conditions you have experienced, even if they were many years ago?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Past…medical conditions. That's a long list, I suppose, if one goes back far enough. Childhood illnesses, naturally. Measles, mumps…the usual things. Later on…let me think. There was a touch of pneumonia, perhaps, in my thirties. Very unpleasant. And I had my tonsils out. That’s all I can readily recall. Honestly, I don't spend much time dwelling on such things. It doesn’t do to worry, you know. Are we finished yet?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. Measles, mumps, pneumonia and a tonsillectomy – thank you for sharing that. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: Surgeries…let me see. No, I don't believe so. Perhaps a minor procedure on my hand, decades ago, when I caught it in a…a machine, I think? But nothing major. A local anesthetic, that was all. Really, I’ve been remarkably fortunate, haven’t I? I’m not one for hospitals or doctors, generally. This is quite enough poking around, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Indeed, you have been fortunate. A minor procedure on the hand, noted. Now, thinking about your family, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – perhaps heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that has affected your parents, siblings, or children?
PATIENT: Family… oh, dear. That’s a rather gloomy topic, isn’t it? My mother…she had something…with her heart, I believe. Weakness, mostly. Spent a lot of time in bed. My father was…sturdy. Lived to be a very old age, thankfully. My sister…well, she wasn't particularly healthy, if I recall correctly. A nervous disposition, mostly. I try not to dwell on such things. It doesn't do to compare oneself to others, you know. Honestly, I’m quite bored with all these questions. Can we get on with whatever it is you do here?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to dwell on difficult topics, Ms. Engelhaupt. We'll move on shortly. Just a few more general questions, and then we can proceed with a brief physical exam. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What an odd question. I live a quiet life. I have a lovely home, a devoted husband, and… well, that is it, really. I enjoy reading, a bit of gardening when the weather permits, and spending time with friends. I don’t go in for all this…exercise nonsense. Sensible living, that’s my motto. And a good book. Honestly, I think I’ve answered quite enough questions. I’m beginning to feel rather faint. Are you quite finished?
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions are making you uncomfortable, Ms. Engelhaupt. It’s important for me to have a complete picture of your health. Now, just to clarify, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor prescribed it last year. A small white pill. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take… ibuprofen, I believe. The over-the-counter kind. Nothing drastic. Honestly, I manage perfectly well on my own. This is becoming quite tiresome, you know. I really must insist, if this is going to continue, I’ll need a cup of tea. And perhaps a biscuit? I’m feeling terribly weak. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Engelhaupt. I'll have the nurse bring you a cup of tea and a biscuit immediately. And let's proceed with a quick physical exam, if you are agreeable. We can start with your blood pressure, just to confirm your medication is effective. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief examination of your abdomen. How does that sound?
