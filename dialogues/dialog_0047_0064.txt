DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's my chest... it's been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. Feels like... a tight squeezing, you know? Like someone is sitting on it.
DOCTOR: Right. A squeezing sensation. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... about two weeks, I guess. Maybe a little longer. It started after I helped my son move some heavy boxes. He doesn't think, you know? Always wants me to help, even when I tell him not to. But that's not the point. The pain... it comes and goes. Sometimes when I walk, sometimes just sitting.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And would you say it radiates anywhere – down your arm, perhaps, or to your jaw?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Sometimes it goes down my left arm. Not always, but when it’s really bad, definitely. And… now that you mention it, a little bit in my jaw too. Not a sharp pain, just… feels uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see... I get a little short of breath sometimes, especially when I’m walking up the stairs. And… I feel tired, more tired than usual. I thought it was just getting older, you know? But maybe it's something else. I haven't really told anyone, just my husband, and he says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, I see you have a history of high blood pressure. Is that currently being managed with medication?
PATIENT: Oh yes, Doctor. I take a pill every morning. A little white one. My doctor back home, he gave it to me. Keeps it mostly okay, but sometimes… when I get stressed, it goes up. My husband checks it. He worries too, you know? He's a good man.
DOCTOR: And do you know what the medication is called, or the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh dear... that's a good question. I just take the little white pill. It's... Lisinopril, maybe? Yes, I think that's it. Lisinopril. And it's... ten milligrams, I believe. He tells me everything, but I don't always remember. It's a lot to keep track of, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years for little aches and pains, but nothing bad ever happened. I think I'm pretty lucky, honestly.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Chelberg, given your symptoms and your history, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then we can discuss further testing, likely an EKG and some bloodwork. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Go ahead, please. I want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… good. Lungs sound clear, but I do hear a slight murmur. Not terribly concerning at this point, but we'll investigate further. Blood pressure is elevated, 150/90. Not ideal. I'm going to order an EKG and some routine blood work, including a complete blood count and a lipid panel. We’ll also check your thyroid function. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds... sensible. Whatever tests you need to do, please do them. I just want to know what's going on and get it fixed, you know? I have to keep up with my grandchildren! I hope it's not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: It's no trouble at all, Ms. Chelberg. We'll get these tests ordered right away. The nurse will draw your blood and do the EKG. It’ll take about thirty minutes. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a slightly higher dose of Lisinopril. We'll see if that helps control your blood pressure. While we wait for the results, I want you to take things easy. Avoid strenuous activity, and try to reduce your stress levels. Easier said than done, I know, but it’s important. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Higher dose of the pill, take it easy… and less stress. Easier said than done, you’re right! Will the blood work tell you… if it’s my heart, seriously? That's what I'm most scared of, you know. My father... he had heart trouble.
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us a broader picture of your overall health, Ms. Chelberg. It won’t definitively tell us if it’s “your heart,” as you put it, but it will rule out other potential causes and help us determine the best course of action. The EKG is more specific for heart issues. It measures the electrical activity of your heart and can detect abnormalities. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible. And frankly, given your age and history, it’s prudent to investigate this thoroughly. The nurse will be in shortly to start the tests. Just try to relax, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Relax… you're right. I'll try. It's just… worrying. Thank you for taking the time, and for explaining everything. I appreciate it. I hope the nurse doesn't poke too much!
DOCTOR: The nurse is very skilled, Ms. Chelberg. It’ll be a quick and relatively painless procedure. Alright, I'll leave you to it then. We'll discuss the results as soon as they're available. If you feel any chest pain worsening, or develop any shortness of breath while waiting, please notify the nurse immediately. .
