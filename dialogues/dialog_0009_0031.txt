DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen. It's been botherin' me a bit, and I know I have… a funny heartbeat sometimes. The doctor back home told me about it, somethin' about it flitterin'. I just wanted to get it checked out, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nixon. It's good you’re getting this checked out. A swollen leg and what sounds like palpitations – that “flittering” sensation – are worth investigating. Let’s start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe a week ago? It wasn’t much at first, just a bit bigger than usual at the end of the day. But it's gotten worse each day, I reckon. It's mostly in my calf, I think. It's… uncomfortable, is the best way to put it. Not terribly painful, just… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling gradually worsening over a week, mainly in the calf, and feeling heavy rather than painful. That’s helpful. Has anything specific made it worse – like standing for long periods, exercise, or changes in activity?
PATIENT: Well, I do stand a fair bit at work, teachin' the computer classes and all. It might be worse after a long day, but honestly, I've been so busy I haven't really paid close attention. I haven't been doin' much exercise, not lately. I usually walk a bit, but… not this week. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Nixon. Both standing for prolonged periods and a decrease in activity can contribute to swelling in the legs. Now, you mentioned a “funny heartbeat” that feels like a “flittering.” Can you describe that sensation a bit more?
PATIENT: Aye, well… it’s hard to explain. It just feels like it’s… jumpin' about a bit, not steady like it should be. It doesn’t happen all the time, just comes and goes. Sometimes I can feel it in my chest, other times it’s just… there. It doesn’t last long, usually only a few seconds, maybe a minute. Does that make sense? I don’t really know much about hearts.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Nixon. A fluttering sensation, intermittent, sometimes in the chest, lasting seconds to a minute. We call those palpitations. Before we move on, let's do a quick review of other things. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or lightheadedness associated with either the leg swelling or the palpitations?
PATIENT: No, not really. No shortness of breath, no chest pain at all. I… might have felt a bit dizzy once or twice, but I put that down to bein' tired, honestly. I've been workin' quite long hours gettin' the courses ready for the new term. I don’t think it was anything to do with my leg or my heart. It was just… a bit wobbly, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. No shortness of breath, no chest pain, and dizziness you attribute to fatigue. That's good information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything related to your heart?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor back home told me about the… atrial fibrillation, that’s what he called it. That’s why my heart flutters, he said. He said it wasn’t too serious, but I needed to keep an eye on it. Apart from that… nothin’ really. I've been generally healthy, touch wood. I don’t take any regular medication, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, atrial fibrillation diagnosed previously, and no other medical conditions or regular medications. That is very important to know. Do you know if you've ever had any blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Hmm… I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never been told I’ve had one. I… had my appendix out when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Does that count? I’m not sure what a blood clot even feels like.
DOCTOR: No, your appendix removal wouldn’t be related to blood clots. And it's good you haven't been told you've had one. Let's quickly touch on family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any history of heart problems, blood clots, or significant leg swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had a bad heart. He was poorly for a long time before he passed. I don’t remember much about it, I was just a wee girl. And my aunt, she had a deep vein thrombosis once, in her leg. She was stuck in hospital for a bit. That was a long time ago now, though. I don't think anyone else has had any trouble with their heart or legs, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, a grandfather with heart problems and an aunt with a history of deep vein thrombosis . That’s helpful information. Finally, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. I find the smell dreadful, if I'm honest. I do enjoy a wee dram of whisky now and then, but just one or two on a special occasion. I don't drink much, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I can take most things without any trouble, as far as I know. I’m not allergic to any food, either. I can eat pretty much anything, touch wood.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No allergies. Okay, Nixon, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also need to examine your left leg carefully to assess the swelling and check for any tenderness or signs of blood clots. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you need. I'm just a bit worried about what you might find, if I'm honest. But I suppose it's best to know, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You are right, it is best to know. I understand your worry, Nixon, and we'll take things one step at a time. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically. Your heart rhythm is irregular, which is expected given your history of atrial fibrillation. Now, let's examine your leg. Alright, Nixon. Your left calf is significantly swollen, warmer than your right leg, and tender to the touch. Your pulse in your left foot is a bit weaker than in your right. This raises a concern for a possible blood clot – a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. However, it could also be due to other causes, like muscle strain or venous insufficiency. To be certain, we need to order some further tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A blood clot? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. So, you’re not sure it is a blood clot, but you need to check? That's... alright. Yes, please check. I'd rather know for certain, even if it’s bad news. What sort of tests will you be doin'? Will they hurt? I'm a bit nervous now, I confess.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Nixon. It’s good we're checking, and I’ll explain everything as we go. The most important test we need to do is a D-dimer blood test. This test measures a substance released when a blood clot breaks down. A high D-dimer level suggests a clot may be present. It doesn't confirm it definitively, but it will help us decide if we need to do further imaging. If the D-dimer is elevated, we would then need to do a venous ultrasound of your left leg. This is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to visualize the veins and check for any clots. It doesn’t hurt at all – it’s just like a pregnancy scan. We'll apply some gel to your leg and move a probe over the skin. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… manageable. A blood test and an ultrasound. No hurtin’, you say? That’s good. A blood test I can handle, and an ultrasound… well, I suppose I can lie still for a bit. I had a scan when my sister was pregnant, so I know what to expect. So, you'll take the blood first, then do the scan? Will I need to do anything special beforehand? And… how long will I have to wait for the results? I suppose I should cancel my afternoon classes. This sounds like it might take a bit.
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll start with the blood test, and then do the ultrasound. No special preparation is needed for either test. You don't need to fast, and you can wear comfortable clothing. The results for the D-dimer usually come back within a few hours. The ultrasound will take a little longer, perhaps a day or two to schedule and get the results back. Canceling your afternoon classes is a very good idea, Nixon. It's best to be prepared. I’ll get the lab order for the D-dimer right away, and then we can discuss scheduling the ultrasound. Here’s the lab order. The phlebotomist in the lab will draw a sample of your blood. They’re very good, and will make you comfortable. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Not right now. Just… a bit worried, to be honest. But you've explained everything very clearly, Doctor, and I appreciate that. I'll go and get the blood test done, and then I'll… wait. Thank you for your time, and for not makin' me feel too foolish. It's good to know someone is takin' this seriously. Alright. You take your time, and if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
