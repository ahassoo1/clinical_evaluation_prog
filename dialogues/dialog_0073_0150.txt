DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, honestly, I don’t have time for this, but my…ex-husband keeps saying I need to "get checked out" if I want things to be different. I’m 51, and I want to be sure if I can have a baby without…complications. Is that clear enough? I don’t need a lecture on my age, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. A fertility evaluation, then, prompted by your ex-husband. I understand you're not looking for a lengthy discussion on the…factors involved. Very well. Let's start with some basics. Have you had any children previously?
PATIENT: No. Never. And frankly, it’s none of your business why. But let’s just say…it wasn’t a priority. Now, are we going to do tests, or are you going to ask me about my life story all day? I have a bicycle shop to run, you know. People depend on me.
DOCTOR: Of course. We will get to tests. But I assure you, I’m simply gathering information that could be relevant to your evaluation. It’s standard practice. Very well. Have you been attempting to conceive recently?
PATIENT: Attempting? Honestly, Doctor, do I look like I've been spending my evenings... "attempting"? No. Not unless you count a fleeting thought last Tuesday. But I want to know if it's even possible before I waste any more time. Is that so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no active attempts. And you'd like to determine feasibility. Fair enough. To start, can you tell me about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly? They’re…cycles. They happen. What do you need to know? Regular? Irregular? What’s the difference, really? It's not like I keep a calendar for them. I’ve got enough to manage. Just tell me if they’re a problem.
DOCTOR: I understand this isn't your favorite topic. But the regularity and characteristics of your cycles can indicate a lot about hormonal function and potential issues. Roughly, how often do you get your period?
PATIENT: Roughly? It's... variable. Sometimes it's every few weeks, sometimes longer. A month? Six weeks? I honestly haven’t kept track. And before you start lecturing me about tracking, I told you, I have a business! I fix bicycles, Doctor, not calendars. Is that a problem? Just tell me if it’s going to be a huge obstacle, alright?
DOCTOR: Variable cycles can sometimes indicate hormonal imbalances which could affect fertility. Alright. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any bleeding between periods, or unusually heavy or painful periods?
PATIENT: No. Not particularly. A little cramping, but who doesn't have a little cramping? I mean, I'm not made of iron, Doctor. And no extra bleeding. Everything’s…normal, as normal as it gets, considering. Look, can we just skip to the tests? I’m starting to feel like I’m at a job interview, not a doctor’s appointment. And I’m not very good at small talk.
DOCTOR: Very well. We can proceed to a physical exam and some basic lab work. It will involve a pelvic exam and some blood tests to assess your hormone levels and overall health. Before we do that, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I rarely take anything. I believe in fresh air and hard work, not pills. But… I did have a bad reaction to some dye once, years ago, when I got a new pair of gloves for the shop. Does that count? Honestly, it was probably just the smell. And it was decades ago. Can we please get on with it? I have a repair waiting for me. A very important repair.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll note the remote dye sensitivity. Let's proceed with the exam then. I'll need you to change into a gown in the room over there. I'll be right back with the necessary equipment. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No. Just... how long is this going to take? And please be quick. My customers are probably wondering where I’ve disappeared to. It's bad for business to be unreliable, you know. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please take your time getting changed, and I will meet you back in here.
PATIENT: .
