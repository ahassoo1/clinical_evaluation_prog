DOCTOR: Hi Westly, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather a bothersome thing, really. I seem to be… going to the lavatory quite frequently. More than usual, you understand. It's been going on for a little while now, though I can't precisely when it started. My memory isn't what it once was, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Not to worry, we'll figure out what's going on. When you say "frequently," could you give me a rough idea – how many times a day would you say you’re going, and how does that compare to, say, a few months ago?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. A few months ago… I suppose it was… normal? Yes, normal. Perhaps two or three times a day, if I recall correctly. Now… oh dear. It feels like every couple of hours. Possibly more. I do enjoy my tea, you know. Perhaps it’s the tea? Though I’ve always had tea… It’s difficult to say, really. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Westly. It is helpful to get a sense of things, and it's common to be unsure. The tea is good to keep in mind. Besides the increased frequency, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I do feel rather thirsty, I suppose. More so than usual. And… now that you mention it, I believe I’ve been getting up once or twice during the night to… attend to the matter. It doesn’t keep me entirely awake, but it’s… disruptive. I can’t recall if I was doing that before, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst and getting up at night to urinate – that's helpful information. Do you experience any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning, thankfully. It’s just… the volume, you understand. And the frequency, of course. It’s… inconvenient, more than anything. I don’t feel unwell otherwise. No fever, no chills, nothing like that. Just… this.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, no fever, just increased frequency and volume, with some nighttime urination and increased thirst. Do you have any difficulty starting your stream when you go to the bathroom, or is it a strong, steady flow?
PATIENT: A steady flow, I believe. Yes, a good, strong stream. No difficulty starting, no hesitation. It’s not that, thankfully. It just… happens more often, and in larger quantities. It’s… rather like a tap that isn’t quite turned off properly, if you understand my analogy.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Westly. That's a good way to describe it. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. That’s a name I’ve heard, of course. I don’t believe so, no. I haven’t been specifically told I have it. I’ve seen doctors periodically over the years, for the usual check-ups, but nothing serious ever came up. My heart… well, I get a little breathless when I climb the stairs, but I attribute that to my age, and perhaps the weight. I was a bit more active in my younger days. I'm Medicare eligible, if that's of any consequence.
DOCTOR: That's good information. Being Medicare eligible is helpful to know. And the occasional breathlessness is good to be aware of. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… surgeries. Ah, yes. I had my appendix removed, many years ago. Perhaps forty years ago now? It was a straightforward procedure, I recall. Nothing complicated. And… I was hospitalized once for a bout of pneumonia, when I was in my thirties. But that was a very long time ago. I’ve been quite healthy otherwise, all things considered. I don’t believe I’ve had any other major illnesses or operations.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal about 40 years ago and pneumonia in your thirties. Good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My father… he had heart trouble, I believe. Yes, he was quite ill towards the end of his life. He needed… medication, and spent some time in hospital. My mother, she was… fairly robust, as I recall. No major illnesses that I’m aware of. And my sister… she had high blood pressure, I think. But beyond that… I’m afraid my family history isn’t terribly clear. We weren’t much for discussing such things, you see. It wasn’t considered polite, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Alright, heart trouble in your father and high blood pressure in your sister. That’s helpful. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of that, thank you very much. Never smoked a day in my life. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week, but nothing excessive. And recreational drugs… absolutely not. I’m a fairly quiet man, you see. I prefer a good book and a cup of tea. I assure you, my habits are quite… temperate.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a small tablet for my blood pressure, prescribed by my previous doctor. Just one a day, a very small dose. And… occasionally, I take a paracetamol for a headache, if needed. But that’s it. No supplements, no vitamins, nothing like that. I prefer to rely on a good night’s sleep and a healthy diet, when possible. I believe that covers everything, Doctor. Unless you have any further questions, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a small tablet for blood pressure and occasional paracetamol. Thank you, Westly, that’s very thorough. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief abdominal exam. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Please proceed. I trust your judgment implicitly. I’m quite happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Westly. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your heart and lungs sound good. I did feel a slightly full bladder during the abdominal exam. Based on what you've told me – the increased frequency and volume of urination, the thirst, getting up at night, and the mildly distended bladder – and taking into account your age and blood pressure, my initial thought is that you may be experiencing symptoms of an overactive bladder, possibly alongside some mild benign prostatic hyperplasia , which is common in men your age. The BPH could be contributing to the bladder fullness and frequency. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities, such as a urinary tract infection or, less likely, diabetes. I'd like to order a urine analysis to check for infection and a blood sugar test to rule out diabetes. We should also repeat your blood pressure measurement to see if it’s consistently elevated. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. I’m happy to undergo any tests you deem necessary. A urine analysis and a blood sugar test… very well. And repeating the blood pressure measurement… of course. I trust your professional assessment entirely. It’s reassuring to know we’re taking a thorough approach to this matter. What will happen next, if you don’t mind me asking?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll take a quick urine sample now, and I'll have the lab run a blood sugar test as well. That usually takes about 15-20 minutes to get the results. Once we have those results, we’ll discuss them. If the urine analysis comes back clear and your blood sugar is normal, we can proceed with exploring the possibility of an overactive bladder and BPH. This might involve keeping a bladder diary for a few days to track your fluid intake and urination patterns. If your blood pressure remains elevated on repeat testing, we may need to discuss starting medication to manage it. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable indeed, Doctor. A bladder diary… yes, I can certainly manage that. And medication for the blood pressure, if necessary… very well. I appreciate your thorough explanation and your sensible approach. Let us proceed with the urine sample and the blood sugar test, then. Please let me know when you have the results. I’m in no particular hurry.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Westly, I’ve sent the samples to the lab. It should only be about 15-20 minutes. I'll go check on a few other patients and will be right back with the results as soon as they're available. Please just relax, and I'll be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. I shall await your return.
