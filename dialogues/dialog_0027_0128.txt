DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning! It’s my joints, you see. They get so…stiff in the mornings. It’s a bother, really. Not awful, just…uncomfortable. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A while now, I think.
DOCTOR: Hmm, stiff joints in the mornings… Alright. And where are these joints bothering you the most?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, a little? My hands, definitely. And my knees…and my back sometimes. It's not sharp pain, more like…old. You know? Like they haven’t been used properly. Or maybe just…old. I used to do a lot of gardening, a long time ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Gardening… yes, that could be relevant. So, it's a general stiffness, not focused on one particular spot, and it's worse in the mornings?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Much worse in the mornings. It takes a bit to…loosen up, I guess. Coffee helps a little, but not much. And it's…well, it's just been getting a bit harder to do things. Simple things, you know? Lifting things, getting out of a chair… not a big deal, but annoying. I don’t remember if it was always this bad. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. So, gradual onset, worse in the mornings, affecting multiple joints. Any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling…? I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little puffy sometimes, but I just thought it was…well, I carry a little extra weight, you know? I don't remember seeing any red, though. Nothing obvious.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the joint stiffness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm… let me think. I get tired, sometimes. But I think everyone gets tired, don’t they? And… oh! My hands sometimes feel a little numb, especially in the mornings. But I thought that was just from sleeping on them funny. I really don’t remember anything else being…different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I trust your judgement. It's not a big problem, I don’t think, but it would be nice to know what’s causing it. I just don’t want it to get worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just going to gently feel around your joints and check your range of motion. Please let me know if anything causes pain. Okay. Your hands… there’s some mild tenderness around the base of your knuckles on both hands, and a slight reduction in range of motion when you make a fist. Your knees have a bit of crepitus – that’s a grating sensation – when you bend them, and also some limitation in their full extension. No significant swelling or redness. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That’s a little sore, yes. But it’s not bad pain, doctor. Just…uncomfortable. And the knees…yes, they do make noises. They’ve always done that. Listen to my heart and lungs, you say? Go ahead, doctor. I used to be quite active, you know. Before… well, before my husband passed. It's all a bit of a blur now.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, given your symptoms – the stiffness, the tenderness in your hands, the crepitus in your knees, and the gradual onset – it sounds like you may be experiencing early stages of osteoarthritis. It’s a common condition, especially as we get older, and it's caused by wear and tear on the joints. However, to be certain, I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out other possible causes, like rheumatoid arthritis. Also, we could consider getting an X-ray of your hands and knees to see the extent of the wear and tear. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Osteo…arthritis? Wear and tear…? Oh dear. Well, I suppose that makes sense. I have used them a lot over the years. Blood tests and…X-rays? Well… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don't like needles much, but… if it will help to know what’s going on, then yes. Do I need to make another appointment for those? I don't have a car, you see…
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll need to schedule a separate appointment for the blood tests and X-rays. The blood tests will only take a few minutes, and we can arrange for them to be done here at the clinic. The X-rays can also be done here, but it may take a bit longer. I’ll have the receptionist schedule those for you. In the meantime, while we’re waiting for the results, I recommend some over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with the discomfort. Also, gentle exercise, like walking or swimming, can help to keep your joints mobile. Avoid activities that put a lot of stress on your joints, and try to maintain a healthy weight. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible. Ibuprofen… yes, I think I've used that before. Gentle exercise, you say? I do enjoy a walk, when the weather is nice. I try to stay active, but it’s harder now, with my knees. I…um… is it going to get worse? That’s probably a silly question. Will I…will I need a wheelchair eventually?
DOCTOR: That’s not a silly question at all, Lilliana. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about that. The progression of osteoarthritis varies greatly from person to person. Some people experience only mild symptoms, while others may need more aggressive treatment. It’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen in your case. However, with early diagnosis and appropriate management – things like pain relief, exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight – we can often slow the progression and help you manage your symptoms effectively. A wheelchair is not necessarily inevitable. The goal is to keep you as active and independent as possible for as long as possible. We’ll monitor your condition closely, and if your symptoms worsen, we can discuss other treatment options, such as physical therapy or injections. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… that’s good to know. Not inevitable. That’s a big relief. No… I think that’s all for now. Just the blood tests and X-rays, and try to walk a bit more. Thank you, doctor. You’ve been very kind. And patient. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I worry about forgetting things. I’ll let the receptionist schedule everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. I understand about the memory – it’s something many people experience as they get older. Don't worry about forgetting things, we’ll make sure you have all the information you need. The receptionist will be happy to help you schedule the tests, and we’ll follow up with you as soon as the results are available. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. .
