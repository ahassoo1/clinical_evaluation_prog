DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I… need check for referee. For fitness. I want to keep doing games. It’s… important for me.
DOCTOR: A referee check, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. For basketball. I… I do high school games. Need to make sure I'm still okay to run, you know? It’s… for the season. It starts soon.
DOCTOR: I see. A fitness assessment for officiating basketball games. While my specialty is internal medicine, I can certainly perform a general health evaluation. However, a specific “referee check” isn’t a standard medical procedure. I can assess your cardiovascular health, musculoskeletal system, and overall fitness, but it will be a comprehensive exam, not geared specifically to the demands of officiating. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. Comprehensive… is good, I think. I just need… someone to say I can still do it. My wife… she would want me to keep going. I… don't want problems during a game, you know? Is that okay? I don't need… special tests if it's just to see if I can run and not… fall over.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with a general assessment. It is prudent to ensure your health can withstand the physical demands, regardless of whether it's a “special” test or not. To start, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had a physical examination recently?
PATIENT: No. Not recently. Maybe… five years ago? I… I don't remember exactly. Everything is… a little blurry since my wife… passed. Sorry. I… try not to think about it too much. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Shanor. Perfectly understandable. We’ll just gather some information, and you only need to provide what you are comfortable sharing. Let's begin with any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with. Do you have any chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No. I think not. I… never been sick much. Maybe… cold sometimes. My wife always took care of me. She said I was strong. But… no big sicknesses. Blood pressure… I don't know. I never checked. Sorry. Is… is that bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known chronic illnesses, and haven't had your blood pressure checked recently. We will certainly address that today. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No surgery. And… no hospital. I… broke my arm when I was young. Playing basketball! But it… healed good. No problem now. Just… a little scar. Is that all you need to know? I… want to finish quickly if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: We're making progress. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: My… mother, she had… something with her heart. I don't know what, exactly. She… passed away when I was young. My father… he was okay. Worked hard, never sick. But… my wife’s family… they were healthy, I think. She talked about it all the time. Is that enough? I… it's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked. Maybe… one beer sometimes with dinner. Very little. And… no drugs. I… I need to be strong for the games. Is that okay? My wife… she didn’t like any of that. So… I don’t.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, no drugs. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I think not. I… eat everything. Never had a problem. My wife always made… different foods. She liked to cook. Is… is that all the questions? I… want to get this done if possible. I… have games to think about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. That provides a reasonable starting point. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and assessing your general physical condition. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Blood pressure… I want to know if I'm okay. Please… be quick, if you can. I… have to be ready. Games… are important.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, if you'll step over here and have a seat. We'll start with your blood pressure. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and lie back. I will need to auscultate your heart and lungs, so I’ll need to listen with my stethoscope.
PATIENT: Okay. It's… cold in here. I hope it doesn't take too long. Please… be careful.
DOCTOR: It is a bit cool, I apologize. Let’s begin. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. …lungs are clear bilaterally. 140 over 90. Slightly elevated. Heart sounds regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Pulse is regular at 78. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I'd like you to stand and walk a few steps so I can assess your gait and balance.
PATIENT: Okay… It's… a little hard to balance. I… haven't been moving much lately. Is something wrong? Please… tell me straight. I need to know if I can still do this.
DOCTOR: Your gait is slightly unsteady, and your balance is somewhat diminished. The murmur I detected, combined with the elevated blood pressure, warrants further investigation. While it’s unlikely to be an immediate emergency, these findings suggest there may be underlying cardiovascular issues. I cannot definitively clear you for officiating games without further work-up. I recommend an electrocardiogram and a consultation with a cardiologist. These tests will allow us to assess the health of your heart and determine whether it’s safe for you to engage in strenuous activity. Would you be amenable to those recommendations?
PATIENT: Uh… a… cardiologist? ECG? I… don't understand. Is it… bad? Will I… not be able to referee anymore? My wife… she would be so sad. Please… can’t you just… say it’s okay? Just tell me I’m fine.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand your concerns. I’m not saying you aren’t fine, but as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your safety and well-being. I cannot disregard these findings. The ECG is a simple, non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. A cardiologist is a specialist in heart health who can interpret the results and provide a definitive assessment. It is possible everything will be perfectly normal. But we must rule out any potential issues before you resume strenuous activity. I will provide you with a referral to a cardiologist and order the ECG. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any intense physical exertion. Would you like me to explain the referral process?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Referral… ECG… I guess. My wife… she always said to get a second opinion. Just… please. Please make it quick. And… can you write down the names? I… forget things easily these days. Just… please help me. I don’t want to disappoint her.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Shanor. I understand completely. I’m happy to help in any way I can. Here is the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly respected cardiologist at St. Jude's Hospital. Her number is 555-1234. And here is the order for an ECG, which you can schedule at any local imaging center. I’ve included a list of recommended facilities nearby. I will also send copies of these documents to your primary care physician, should you have one. And I will document all of our findings and recommendations in your chart. It's important to remember that getting these tests done is a proactive step towards ensuring your health and well-being, not a sign of anything being definitively wrong. Please schedule these appointments as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I… think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I… just want to be able to keep doing this. I need to go now. I… have to think.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Shanor. I wish you all the best, and please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you. Take care, and I hope you receive positive news. .
