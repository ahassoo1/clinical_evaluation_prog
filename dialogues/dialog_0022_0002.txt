DOCTOR: Good morning, Zoie. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what brought me in? Let me think… It’s my… my water. It’s hard to… to get it all out, you see? Like it’s stuck. It’s been… a little while now. I don't remember exactly how long. A few weeks, maybe? My husband, he notices more than I do, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re having some difficulty with urination – feeling like you’re not emptying your bladder completely, and it’s been going on for a few weeks. Your husband has also noticed it. That’s helpful to know. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's right. Not emptying… feels like there’s still some left in there. And it… takes a little effort, you know? Not painful, exactly… just… slow. And I have to… push a little. Sometimes I go back to the bathroom not long after, and… a little more comes out. Does that make sense? I get confused easily, so tell me if I'm not explaining it right.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Zoie. You’re explaining it very clearly. So, it feels like you don’t fully empty your bladder, it takes effort to start and maintain the stream, and sometimes you have to go back to the bathroom shortly after thinking you’ve finished. And you don’t describe it as painful, just… slow and requiring effort. Have you noticed any other changes, like increased frequency of urination – needing to go more often than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm… increased… more often? Oh dear. I… I think so. Maybe. I do go… a lot during the day. But I always have, really. I drink a lot of water, you see. My husband says I should cut back, but I like my water! It keeps me… regular, you know? So, is more often… bad? I’m not sure if it’s different than usual, just… a lot. I get so mixed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you drink a lot of water, and you go frequently throughout the day. It's difficult to tell if the frequency has changed, which is perfectly alright. We can work through this. Now, have you noticed any burning or discomfort while you’re urinating?
PATIENT: Burning…? No, no burning. Not that I recall. It’s not… hot or anything. Just… slow. And a little bit of pushing. Sometimes, after I’m done, it feels… a little weak, you know? Like it doesn’t… finish properly. But not painful, never painful. I had a little bit of trouble with my back a few years ago, but that's all better now. Is that important? I forget what's important sometimes.
DOCTOR: No pain or burning, just the slowness, effort, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. You mentioned some back trouble a few years ago, and that’s good to know. Back problems can sometimes affect bladder function, so thank you for mentioning that. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… Let me think. I… I was a psychiatric technician for many, many years. Does that count? I helped a lot of people, you know. As for… illnesses… I had the flu a few times, I suppose. And my knees bother me sometimes, but that’s just old age, I think. My husband handles most of the doctor stuff, honestly. He keeps track of everything. I take something for my… blood pressure, maybe? I forget the name. It's a little white pill. Medicare pays for it. Is that helpful? I don't remember much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you worked as a psychiatric technician for many years, which is wonderful. You've had the flu, some knee discomfort, and you take a white pill for your blood pressure. It sounds like your husband manages most of your medical appointments and medications, which is very helpful. Since you’re unsure of the medication name, would you be comfortable with me taking a look at your electronic health record to see what’s listed?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, Doctor. Yes, please do. I always forget everything! My husband would know, but he’s at his bowling league right now. He's very good, you know. Always gets a strike. The electronic… record, you say? That sounds much easier than me trying to remember. Yes, please. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie, I’m looking at your record now. It looks like you’ve been diagnosed with hypertension – high blood pressure – and you’re currently taking Lisinopril 10mg daily. There's also a note about some mild osteoarthritis in your knees. No other significant medical history is listed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril! That’s the one! Thank you, Doctor. You have a good memory. Surgeries…? Hmm… Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was very young, a long, long time ago. And… I think I had a little… something… on my appendix once, but it wasn't too bad. I was in the hospital for a few days. But that was… oh, goodness… maybe fifty years ago? I can't remember exactly. My husband always says I'm not very good at remembering dates. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had your tonsils removed as a child and a mild appendicitis about fifty years ago. That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has had similar problems with their bladder, or any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she had… trouble with her water when she got older, yes. She always complained about it being… weak. And my brother, he had… something with his heart, I think. He didn’t take very good care of himself, you see. Smoked too much. And my father… he was very strong. Never sick a day in his life! So, yes, my mother had trouble with her water. Does that help? I always worry about my family. They all had such hard lives.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother experienced similar bladder issues as she aged, and your brother had heart problems. Now, just a couple more questions before we do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Oh, let me think. No, I don't think so. I've never had any trouble with… anything. I eat everything. My husband always says I have too much appetite! No, no allergies. I'm very lucky, I think. Well, except for my knees, but that's just old age. I always get a little sniffle when the flowers bloom in the spring, but that's just… springtime, you know? Not an allergy, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Just a little sniffle in the springtime. That's good to know. Alright, Zoie, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'll do a gentle pelvic exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam… Alright, Doctor. If you think it's necessary. I always get a little nervous, but you seem very nice. Gentle, you said? Yes, please be gentle. My husband always says I'm a bit of a… delicate flower. Listen to my tummy, you say? And… the other thing? Yes, alright. Do what you need to do. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. I will be very gentle. Okay, I'm listening to your abdomen now. Everything sounds normal so far. The pelvic exam reveals some mild laxity of the pelvic floor muscles, which is common with age. I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. Your bladder feels normal in size and position. Overall, the exam doesn’t reveal any obvious cause for your symptoms, but the laxity of the pelvic floor muscles could be contributing to the incomplete emptying you’re experiencing. Now I'd like to check your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear it doesn't sound too bad. Laxity… muscles…? That sounds… complicated. Pelvic floor… Is that important? My husband always says I worry too much about things I don't understand. So, the muscles might be the problem? Alright. Check my blood pressure, you say? Yes, alright. That's easy enough. I take my pills every day, you know. Just… don't tell my husband if it's too high! He gets so worried.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 138/82. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your history of hypertension and the fact that you may be a little anxious right now. Based on everything you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing urinary retention – difficulty emptying your bladder completely – likely due to a combination of factors, including the laxity of your pelvic floor muscles, potentially a slightly enlarged prostate, and potentially some nerve weakness. It's important to rule out a urinary tract infection as well. To get a more definitive answer, I recommend a few things. First, a urine test to rule out a UTI. And second, a post-void residual test, which measures the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. I'd also like to order a urodynamic study to assess bladder function. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Retention… laxity… Urodynamic… I'm getting a little confused now. You said… tests? Urine test… that's easy enough. And the other one… measuring the water left inside? Is it painful? And the other, long one… the one with the long name… Is it… necessary? My husband always says I don't need so many tests. He says I worry too much. So… is it really necessary, Doctor? I don't want to be a bother. I just want to be able to… go to the bathroom properly. Is there a pill for this?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Zoie. It does sound complicated, and I apologize for the medical jargon. I’ll explain everything as clearly as I can. The urine test is very simple – just a sample of your urine. The post-void residual test is also non-invasive. A small handheld device is used after you urinate to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It doesn’t hurt at all. The urodynamic study is a more in-depth test that assesses how well your bladder and urethra function. It involves inserting a small catheter into your bladder to measure pressure and flow. It can be a little uncomfortable, but it’s generally well-tolerated, and it provides valuable information. I understand your husband’s concern about unnecessary tests. However, these tests are important to rule out any serious underlying causes and determine the best course of treatment. While there are medications that can help with urinary retention, they may not be appropriate for everyone, and it’s important to have a clear diagnosis first. Let’s start with the urine test and the post-void residual test. We can discuss the urodynamic study further after we have the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Urine test… and the other one… measuring the water. Yes, let's start with those two. No hurry, you know. I don't want to rush anything. My husband always says I'm too impatient, but I just want to feel better. And… no rushing. Yes. And… if those two tests don’t show anything, we’ll talk about the other one later. Yes. That sounds… alright. Are we finished for today, Doctor? I'm getting a little tired now. And my knees are starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoie, we’re finished for today. I'll have the nurse come in to collect a urine sample, and we’ll schedule you for the post-void residual test. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Thank you for coming in today. I understand this is a little concerning, but we’ll work through this together. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take it easy on your knees!
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I appreciate that. Yes, kind… that's good. My husband always says I worry too much. But you've made me feel better. Yes, better. And thank you for being gentle. Yes, gentle. I think I can manage. Yes. .
