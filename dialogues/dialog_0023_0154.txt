DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s...Claudene Wease, yes. Well, it’s my…waterworks. They bother me. A lot. Seems to be happening again and again. I don’t…remember exactly when it started, but it's unpleasant.
DOCTOR: "Waterworks," you say. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh dear. It’s…when I go to the little girls’ room. It burns, Doctor. And I have to go so often. It’s…distracting, you understand? And uncomfortable. I just want it to stop repeating. Is that specific enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's… marginally more helpful. Burning with frequent urination. How long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s…a difficult question. A long time, I think. Months, maybe? It comes and goes. It’s hard to remember exactly. I had it… last fall, I believe. And then it went away for a bit, and now it’s back. It feels…worse this time, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Months, intermittent, possibly worse now. Do you have any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh…sometimes. A dull ache, low down in my back. Not always, though. Mostly just when I…when I’m trying to ignore the other thing, if that makes sense? It's not a sharp pain, just…annoying.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, low back, associated with… attempting to ignore the urinary symptoms. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or a strong, foul odor?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood? No, I don’t think so. I haven’t…looked, if you don't mind me saying. And odor… well, I am getting older, Doctor. Things smell different sometimes, you know? I couldn't say for certain if it’s…worse than usual.
DOCTOR: No reported hematuria, subjective change in odor. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear, medical history… Let me think. My…ex-husband always said I was a healthy woman. I don’t recall any…big problems. The doctor used to tell me my blood pressure was a little high once, years ago, but he put me on a…a little pill for a while. I stopped taking it, though. Felt better without it. And diabetes? I don’t think so. I like sweet things, but I’m not…sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. Hospital… well, I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… I broke my arm once, falling off a bicycle. Other than that… I don't believe so. No surgeries that I recall. My ex-husband needed his appendix out, but that wasn't me.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Oh… my mother… she was a very strong woman. Always complaining about her joints, if I recall correctly. And my sister… she had trouble with her…stomach, years ago. Nothing serious, I don’t think. And my brother… he liked to drink. That’s about all I remember. They’re all… gone now, sadly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I try to avoid pills as much as possible, you know? They never seem to do much good. I take a little something for my…aching joints sometimes, an herbal remedy my friend sells. But that’s it. Just that. And sometimes a little something for my indigestion. But not regularly.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh… not that I know of. I can eat most anything. I get a little…itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s not a real allergy, is it? Just a little…uncomfortable. Nothing serious. I don’t think I've ever had a bad reaction to anything, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. I’m going to need to perform a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’ll need to check your abdomen, and I will need a urine sample. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh…a physical exam? And a sample? Well… I suppose. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I’m not fond of…being poked and prodded, if you don't mind my saying. But if it will help me get rid of this…problem, then yes. Yes, that’s acceptable.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you'll follow me, we can get started. I'll have you use the restroom to collect a sample first, then we'll proceed with the abdominal exam. Please be advised I'll need you to lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh… examination table? Well. Alright then. Lead the way, Doctor. I hope it's not too…cold. And please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: This way. And I assure you, I will be as efficient as possible. Please undress from the waist down and place your sample cup on the provided tray when you are finished. I will knock before re-entering the room.
PATIENT: Oh… undress? Well. This is… rather quick, isn't it? Very well. I'll… do as you say. Please knock, as you promised. It feels a little…exposed, if you don't mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: .
