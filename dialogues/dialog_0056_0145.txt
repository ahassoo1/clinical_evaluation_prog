DOCTOR: Hi Lonell, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Amussen. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. I am here, if I understand correctly, to discuss if my situation qualifies for assistance at home. My…ex-wife arranged this visit. She thinks it might be useful.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, your ex-wife feels you might benefit from some assistance at home – that’s perfectly alright. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little bit more about why she thinks that might be helpful?
PATIENT: Well. It is…difficult to explain simply. I am a surgeon, you see. Pediatric. I have been practicing for… thirty-two years, I believe. But my hands… they are not as steady as they once were. It impacts my ability to…perform delicate operations. I retired six months ago. It is…frustrating. I miss it greatly, but it is unsafe to continue. The shaking, it began gradually, but it has…accelerated. It makes simple tasks…challenging.
DOCTOR: I see. So you’ve recently retired from a very demanding career due to hand tremors that have worsened over time. That sounds incredibly difficult, especially after dedicating so much of your life to pediatric surgery. It's completely understandable that you'd be frustrated. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the shaking a little more?
PATIENT: It is not constant, Doctor. It comes and goes. Mostly when I am trying to do something precise. Like…writing, or buttoning a shirt. Sometimes even holding a cup of coffee. It is more noticeable when I am tired, or stressed. It is a…fine tremor, not a large shaking. But enough to make me…drop things, or miscalculate during an operation. I stopped driving six weeks ago, for safety reasons. My ex-wife…she worries. She says I need help with things around the house, and possibly with…personal care. I am…resistant, naturally. But she is…persuasive.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a fine tremor that’s exacerbated by precision tasks, fatigue, and stress, and you've proactively stopped driving. It sounds like it’s impacting your daily life in several ways. And your ex-wife is concerned about you needing help with activities at home and potentially with personal care. Before we discuss potential assistance options, I'd like to get a bit more of your medical history. Have you seen a doctor about this tremor before?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I saw Doctor Dubois, my general practitioner, for approximately eight months. He ran several tests – bloodwork, neurological exams, an MRI of the brain. He concluded…essential tremor, he believes. He prescribed medication, but it…provided limited relief, and the side effects were…unpleasant. I stopped taking it two months ago, after discussing it with Doctor Dubois. He said we could revisit the idea later, if necessary. He recommended physical therapy, which I attended for six weeks. It helped a little, but the improvement was…marginal. He is the one who suggested exploring home health options.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. So you've been diagnosed with essential tremor by Dr. Dubois, you’ve tried medication and physical therapy with limited success, and he recommended looking into home health. He's a good doctor to be thinking along those lines. Just to be thorough, do you have any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am, thankfully, quite healthy. My blood pressure is normal, as is my cholesterol. I have no history of diabetes, and my heart is…strong. Doctor Dubois always commented on my excellent health. I eat a sensible diet – mostly fish and vegetables – and I walk every morning, weather permitting. I used to play tennis, but that is…no longer possible, unfortunately. I had a mild bout of pneumonia three years ago, but recovered fully. Otherwise, I am in good health, despite this tremor.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Lonell. It sounds like you've been very proactive about your health overall. Now, let's talk about your family history. Has anyone else in your family experienced tremors or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That is a…difficult question, Doctor. My mother's side of the family… they were not forthcoming with medical details. My mother herself was…reserved. My father's side… his brother, my Uncle Jean-Pierre, he did experience a similar shaking later in life. He was a watchmaker, a very precise profession. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, I believe, though it was many years ago. It is…distant family, but it is relevant, perhaps. My ex-wife…she believes it runs in the family. She is quite insistent on genealogy, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. A family history of tremors, particularly with your Uncle Jean-Pierre’s Parkinson’s diagnosis, is helpful information. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have Parkinson's, but it’s good to be aware of. Now, just a few more questions about your current situation. Can you tell me about your living situation?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I live alone in a small house in the suburbs. It is a two-bedroom, with a garden. I have lived there for twenty-five years. It is… manageable, but maintaining it is becoming increasingly difficult. I used to enjoy gardening, but it is…challenging now. I have a housekeeper who comes once a week for cleaning. I manage my own cooking, but…simple meals mostly. I do not have any pets. My ex-wife… she frequently offers to help with the upkeep of the house, but I… prefer to maintain my independence. For now, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone in a two-bedroom house, manage with a weekly housekeeper, and generally maintain your independence. You're understandably wanting to keep it that way. Before we discuss potential home health services, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, coordination, and look for any other neurological signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly acceptable. I understand the necessity of a physical examination. Please proceed when you are ready. I shall cooperate fully. I trust your professional judgement.
DOCTOR: Great. Thank you. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Okay, good. Both reflexes are present and symmetrical. Now, could you please extend both of your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I have extended my arms, as requested. Please observe. The tremor is…more noticeable when I am attempting to remain still. It is…frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a slight tremor in both hands, more pronounced with stillness, as you described. It appears to be a resting tremor, which is consistent with essential tremor. I'm also going to check your coordination now. Could you touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger, then repeat?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have touched my nose, and your finger. It required…effort. It is… not as easy as it once was. The…precision is diminished.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I also want to check your gait – how you walk. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am walking, as requested. I am…careful. I do not wish to fall.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lonell. That was helpful. Okay, based on the physical exam and the history you've provided, the findings are consistent with essential tremor, potentially with some mild functional impact on coordination and gait. It's important to remember that this isn't a diagnosis I can make definitively without further testing, but it aligns with Dr. Dubois’ assessment. Given your desire to maintain independence and the challenges you're facing, I think exploring home health services would be a reasonable step. We can discuss options ranging from assistance with daily tasks – cooking, cleaning, gardening – to potentially a home health aide for personal care, if needed. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I concur with your assessment. Dr. Dubois also suggested home health. I… remain hesitant about accepting assistance with personal care. I am… independent, as you know. However, I recognize the need for help with some tasks around the house. The gardening, for example, is becoming increasingly difficult. And perhaps assistance with cooking…occasionally. I would prefer to maintain control over the situation, and choose the services myself, if possible. I do not wish to feel…burdened.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Lonell. It’s completely reasonable to want to maintain control and choose services that align with your comfort level. We can absolutely work with that. I can provide you with a list of reputable home health agencies in the area. They’ll send someone to your home for an assessment to determine your specific needs and develop a care plan that fits your preferences. You’ll be able to interview potential aides and choose someone you’re comfortable with. Would you like me to also discuss referral options for occupational therapy?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A list of agencies would be most helpful. And yes, please. Information regarding occupational therapy would also be appreciated. I recall Doctor Dubois mentioning it briefly. Perhaps it could assist with…fine motor skills. The gardening…and buttoning my shirts. It is…a small detail, but a significant one. A practical detail.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll print out a list of agencies and information on occupational therapy options for you now. Here you go. This list includes agencies with good reviews and a range of services. The second sheet has information about local occupational therapists, including their specialties and contact information. Do you have any questions about these resources or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. This is…most helpful. It is a comprehensive list, and I appreciate your thoroughness. I do not have any further questions at this time. I shall review these materials carefully. Thank you for your time and assistance. It has been…reassuring. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lonell. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I'll make a note to follow up with you in a couple of weeks to see how things are going. Have a good day, and please take care. .
