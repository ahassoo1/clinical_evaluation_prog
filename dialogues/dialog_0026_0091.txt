DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, things not quite right, you see. I does be feeling awful thirsty, all the time. And hungry too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just...don't stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds…uncomfortable. Thirsty and hungry all the time, even after eating. Hmm. And about how long have you been feeling this way, Bianca?
PATIENT: Let me see now...it start, maybe...three, four months ago? At first, I think it was just the heat, you know? We had that real bad spell of weather. But it didn't go away when the weather cool off. It just get worse, slowly. I does have to drink so much water, even at night! And I still feel dry.
DOCTOR: Three or four months…and it hasn’t improved with the cooler weather. That is a bit concerning. And you said you're still thirsty even after drinking a lot of water?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Exactly! I drink a whole glass, maybe two, and I feel a little better for a short while. But then it come back. Like it don't even fill me up. And the hunger…oh, the hunger. I could eat a whole chicken and still feel like I need something more. It's just...not normal, you know?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound normal at all. We need to get to the bottom of this. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Let me think... well, I does be going to the bathroom more often, you see. Especially at night, which is not good for an old woman like me! I have to get up two, three times sometimes. And I feel a little tired, yes. Not sick tired, but just...low energy, you know? Like I could sleep all day. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Going to the bathroom more often, particularly at night, and feeling tired…those are important things to know. We call frequent urination “polyuria,” by the way. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, Bianca?
PATIENT: Poly…what did you say? Too much doctor words for me! But yes, the bathroom thing…it does bother me. Vision…hmm. Now that you mention it, things does seem a little blurry sometimes. Not all the time, but especially when I try to read the newspaper. I have to hold it real close to my face. I thought it was just my age catching up with me!
DOCTOR: Polyuria just means you’re urinating frequently. No need to worry about the big words! And blurry vision…okay. That, combined with the thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue…it's starting to paint a picture. Now, have you had any unexplained weight loss recently, Bianca?
PATIENT: Weight loss…let me see. I haven’t been stepping on the scale much lately, truth be told. But my clothes does feel a little looser, yes. I thought it was a good thing! But maybe…maybe it’s not so good after all. My husband, he say I look a little thinner, but he always say nice things. He don't want me to worry.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weight loss, even if unintentional, is another important piece of the puzzle. Now, before we go further, can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… hmm. Well, I haven't had any serious sicknesses, thank God. I does have a little arthritis in my hands, that’s all. And my blood pressure sometimes runs a little high, but I don’t take any medicine for it. Doctor tell me to watch my salt, so I try. That's about it, really. I never been one to complain, you see. I always try to stay strong.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Staying strong is important! Alright, Bianca, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No problem, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just tell me what you're doing, okay? I don't like surprises. Old woman like me, easily frighten!
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll explain everything as I go. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse, just to confirm what you told me. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I'll take a look at your feet and do a quick neurological exam. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, as you mentioned, 145 over 90. Your pulse is good and steady, at 78 beats per minute. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your breathing sounds a little rough, and I hear a slight murmur in your heart. Nothing to be alarmed about yet, but we’ll need to investigate further. Now, let's take a look at your feet. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your feet?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. I does sometimes feel a little tingling in my feet, yes. Not all the time, but especially at night. And they does feel cold, even when the rest of me is warm. It’s just a little thing, I never paid it much mind. My mother used to say it was the cold air coming through the floorboards!
DOCTOR: I see. And I notice decreased sensation in your toes, and your pulse feels a little weak in your feet. Let's check your reflexes quickly. Your reflexes are a little slower than they should be. Okay, Bianca. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, I'm concerned about the possibility of diabetes. The excessive thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, blurry vision, fatigue, tingling in your feet, and slow reflexes are all consistent with that diagnosis. However, we need to confirm this with some blood tests. Would you be willing to have some blood work done?
PATIENT: Diabetes… oh dear. My cousin Esme, she had diabetes. It was… not a good end. But if that's what it is, I want to know. I don't want to be surprised. Yes, Doctor, I’ll take the blood tests. Whatever you think is best. Just tell me it won't hurt too much! Old woman don’t take needles very well.
DOCTOR: It’s a small prick, Bianca, just a tiny bit of discomfort. We’ll be quick and gentle. And we’ll get the results back as soon as possible. We'll need a fasting blood glucose level, an A1C test, and a basic metabolic panel. This will give us a clear picture of what's going on. While we’re waiting for the results, it’s important to try to manage your symptoms. I recommend drinking plenty of water, but maybe not excessively until we know more. Also, try to eat smaller, more frequent meals. And most importantly, try not to worry too much. We’ll figure this out together. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you explained everything real good. Small meals… I can do that. My husband is a good cook, he make lovely little portions. And yes, I’ll try not to worry. Easier said than done, though! But thank you, Doctor Finco. You does seem like you know what you’re doing. When will I get the results, you think? A long wait is the worst part, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. A long wait is the worst part. The lab usually gets the results back within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as we have them, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes, like dizziness, confusion, or severe thirst, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any allergies or are you currently taking any medications, Bianca?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Thank God for that, too! And no medicines, like I said. I try to stay away from them if I can. Just a little arthritis cream sometimes, for my hands. But that's it. I try to manage on my own. Is that alright? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Bianca. You’re not a bother at all. Managing on your own is admirable. Okay, so no allergies and no medications except for the arthritis cream. Alright. I’ve ordered the blood tests, and the nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you. In the meantime, please take care of yourself, drink plenty of water in moderation, and try not to stress. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. You explained everything real good, and I feel a little bit better now, even if I am a little worried. Thank you for taking the time to listen to an old woman like me. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. It was my pleasure. And please, don't think of yourself as "just an old woman." You're a valuable patient, and I’m glad you came in. We'll get to the bottom of this together. The nurse will be with you in a moment to draw your blood and schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
