DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Good morning to you too. Look, I don't have all day, ya hear? I'm Kern Trendler. What I want is... well, I look in the mirror, and things ain't where they used to be. Everything's… droopin’. I want it fixed. Simple as that. Don't need a long story. Just fix what's droopin’.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. You're concerned about some changes you've noticed in your appearance. We’ll certainly address that. To help me understand what’s going on, could you be a little more specific about where you’ve noticed things “drooping”?
PATIENT: Where? Honestly, you askin' me to point out the obvious? It's everywhere! Under my chin, for one. And around my eyes… all saggy. Used to be tight skin, now it's… well, look at me! I don't need a lesson in anatomy, ya know? I'm an old man, not a student. Just… fix it. Is that so hard to understand? You got tools, I got money. Let’s get on with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you’re concerned about changes in the skin around your chin and eyes – some looseness and sagging. You’re right, it doesn’t sound like it should be complicated. However, to determine the best course of action—and to ensure we choose the safest and most effective approach—I do need to gather a bit more information. It’s not about questioning you, it’s about ensuring I understand the underlying cause and your overall health. To start, have you noticed this change happening gradually over time, or was it more sudden?
PATIENT: Gradually? Sudden? What kinda question is that? It's been... years, I suppose. I ain't keepin' track of every wrinkle! It's just… one day I looked, and I didn't like what I saw. I used to be a strong man, workin' hard, pile drivin' all day. Didn’t have time to worry about… this. It just… happened. Slowly. Now it's botherin' me. Look, are you gonna ask me about my childhood next? Just tell me what you can do about it. Time is money, ya know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. You're right to want to get straight to solutions. I assure you, I'm not going to ask about your childhood. But a few more questions will help me determine the best options for you. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently – either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: Weight? Humph. Maybe a few pounds here and there. I used to be solid muscle, always workin'. Now, not so much. I eat what my wife used to cook – bless her soul – and I ain't exactly runnin' marathons these days. It's not like I'm starvin' myself, or stuffin' myself, neither. Just… livin'. Does it matter? Everything's goin' south anyway. Fix the droopin’, that's what matters. You got them fancy machines, right?
DOCTOR: It does matter a little, Mr. Trendler, but I understand your impatience. Weight fluctuations can sometimes contribute to changes in skin elasticity. Now, have you noticed any weakness or numbness in your face at all?
PATIENT: Weakness? Numbness? What are you thinkin', doctor? I can feel my face just fine! I shave every mornin', don't I? And I yell at the TV when the cricket's on. Plenty of feelin' there! Look, I'm a practical man. I break rocks for a livin'. I don't do… feelin' things. Is this gonna take all day? Just tell me if you can fix it, or if I need to find another doctor. I ain't got all the time in the world.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I'm not questioning your ability to feel, simply ruling out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these changes. It’s a standard part of the evaluation. Alright. Let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications, or have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medications? Just the usual aches and pains stuff. A little somethin’ for my back. And my wife used to make me take somethin’ for my blood pressure, but she passed away last year, and I haven't bothered gettin' a refill. Diabetes? No. Never had that. I eat a good plate o' food, and I’m a strong man, always have been. I work with my hands. Real work. Not sittin' around pushin’ papers. Look, is this gettin’ us anywhere? I’m payin’ for your time, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. You take something for back pain, and previously took medication for blood pressure but stopped after your wife passed away. Thank you for sharing that. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical examination. I’ll just take a look at the skin around your face and neck. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Finally! A look. Good. Yes, yes, look all you want. Just be quick about it. I got things to do. And don't poke too hard. I'm a tough man, but I don't need unnecessary pain. Just tell me what you see, and if you can fix it. That's all I care about. No need for fancy words, just a straight answer.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. As I suspected, there is some laxity in the skin around your jawline and neck, as well as some mild sagging around the eyes. The skin has lost some of its elasticity, which is common with age. I also notice some textural changes, likely from sun exposure over the years. Based on my examination, and what you've told me, several options could be considered. These include a facelift, a neck lift, or potentially some non-surgical options like dermal fillers or skin tightening procedures. However, a facelift or neck lift would likely provide the most significant and long-lasting results. Before we discuss those options in detail, I would like to get a better sense of your overall health. Would you mind if we check your blood pressure and heart rate?
PATIENT: Blood pressure again? Look, I told you my wife used to make me take somethin' for that. I ain’t worried about it. I feel fine. If you can fix the droopin’, do it. I don’t need a full medical workup. I’m a practical man, remember? I just want results. Skip the tests. Let's talk about fixin’ it. What’s this “facelift” you mentioned? How much is that gonna cost? And how long am I gonna be out of commission? I got things to do, ya hear? Important things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Trendler. You're right, you’re a practical man, and you want to get straight to solutions. However, a facelift is a surgical procedure, and it’s essential to ensure you are a good candidate and that there are no underlying health conditions that could increase the risk of complications. Checking your blood pressure and heart rate is a simple precaution. It will only take a moment. But let's talk about the facelift. It involves surgically lifting and tightening the skin and underlying tissues of the face and neck. The cost can vary depending on the extent of the procedure and the surgeon’s fees, but it typically ranges from $10,000 to $20,000. Recovery time is usually several weeks, during which you’ll experience some swelling, bruising, and discomfort. You will need to take time off work and avoid strenuous activity. Before we proceed further, I strongly recommend a consultation with a cardiologist to assess your overall health. It’s a small step, but it could save you a lot of trouble down the road. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Now you're talkin' nonsense! I ain't got no heart problems. I work hard every day! I pile drive rocks, ya hear? That takes strength! I don't need to see a heart doctor just to get my face fixed. Look, I'm payin' you for your expertise. If you can't fix the droopin' without sendin' me to a bunch of specialists, I'll find another doctor. I’m serious. I don’t have time for this. Tell me straight: can you do it, or can't you? And how long will I be out of commission? That’s all I want to know. No tests, no specialists. Just a straight answer.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your directness. However, as a physician, my primary responsibility is to ensure your safety and well-being. A facelift is a surgical procedure, and proceeding without a thorough assessment of your overall health would be irresponsible. I am concerned about your previously managed blood pressure and the potential risks associated with surgery, especially given your active lifestyle. While I can technically perform the procedure, I cannot in good conscience do so without at least a basic medical clearance. It’s not about questioning your strength or your ability to work; it’s about minimizing the risk of complications. I understand you are reluctant to see a cardiologist, but I strongly recommend it. A simple EKG and blood pressure check would provide me with the information I need to proceed safely. If you are unwilling to do that, I am afraid I cannot perform the facelift. I apologize for this inconvenience, but I must prioritize your safety above all else. Perhaps another doctor would be more willing to proceed without this precaution. However, I believe strongly that a medical clearance is essential in your case.
PATIENT: .
