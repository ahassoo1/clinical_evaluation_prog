DOCTOR: Hi Christen, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it simply, I’ve been… remarkably thirsty, and hungry, lately. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it's becoming quite bothersome, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of increased thirst and hunger. That is bothersome. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not just a little more, Doctor. I find myself constantly reaching for water, even after having a substantial amount. And the hunger… it’s not like a normal craving. It feels…empty, if that makes any sense. It doesn’t matter if I’ve just eaten a full meal; the feeling persists. It's rather unsettling, actually. I’ve also noticed I'm going to the restroom more frequently, but I assumed that was just… related to the water intake.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant thirst, persistent hunger even after eating, and increased urination. That does sound concerning, and the connection you’re making with the increased water intake is smart thinking. Before we jump to conclusions, I'd like to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any other changes—like unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurry vision, or any skin changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Weight loss… now that you mention it, my trousers have been feeling a bit looser. Not a dramatic amount, but noticeable. And perhaps a touch more tired than usual, but I put that down to the general stress of… things. No blurry vision, and I haven’t paid much attention to my skin, if I’m honest. I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss and increased fatigue alongside the thirst, hunger, and frequent urination. That’s helpful. Now, let's go through some basics. Do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… yes, my mother’s side. My grandmother, and an aunt, both had it. Type 2, I believe. It wasn’t… a pleasant situation. It's why I'm taking this seriously, to be frank. I wouldn't want to end up like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of Type 2 diabetes is significant. And you're right to take this seriously. Let’s quickly run through your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing diagnosed, at least. I had a bout of… rather severe indigestion a few years back, but it cleared up on its own. Otherwise, I'm fairly… robust, generally. I try to stay active, though work keeps me tied to a desk more than I'd like. I've never been hospitalised, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And what about medications?
PATIENT: No regular medications, Doctor. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing ongoing. I prefer to avoid them if possible. I'm not one for relying on pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I can eat anything, thankfully. No reactions to bee stings or anything of that nature, either. I've always been fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I don't smoke, haven't touched a cigarette in my life. Very occasional glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once a month, but that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I have no interest in such things. I'm a rather straightforward sort, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’d like to check your weight and do a basic blood glucose test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand it’s necessary. Please proceed. I’d like to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible, to be frank. I have… commitments.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90, a little elevated, and your pulse is 88, regular. Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds are normal. Okay, your weight is 93 kilograms, which is… a bit higher than you mentioned. And your height is 170 centimeters. Now, just a quick prick of the finger for a blood glucose test. Okay… your blood glucose level is 220 mg/dL. That’s significantly elevated. Now, this is just one reading, but it does suggest the possibility of diabetes. We'll need to do some further testing to confirm. I'd like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel and a hemoglobin A1c test. We also need to repeat the fasting glucose test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: 220… significantly elevated, you say? Good heavens. Yes, Doctor, that sounds… concerning. Please do order those tests. The sooner we know, the better, to be frank. I would appreciate that immensely. Fasting glucose test, comprehensive metabolic panel, and… what was the other one? Hemoglobin A1c. Yes. Please. I have… arrangements to make.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm ordering those tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They'll need a blood sample. I’ll also give you a form for scheduling a follow-up appointment once the results are in. In the meantime, I’d recommend trying to limit sugary drinks and carbohydrates as much as possible, just in case. And stay hydrated. I understand you have commitments, and I want to get you answers as quickly as possible. We'll review the results at your follow-up appointment and discuss a plan of action. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate your efficiency. Just… when can I expect the results? And is there anything immediately I should be worried about? Aside from the obvious, of course. .
DOCTOR: Okay. The lab typically takes 24-48 hours to return results. So, you should have them within a couple of business days. As for immediate concerns... the elevated blood glucose suggests that your body is having trouble regulating sugar, which can lead to symptoms like increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue. While a single reading doesn’t define a diagnosis, it’s important to be aware of those symptoms and to monitor them. I don't want to cause undue alarm, but it's good to be proactive. If you experience any sudden changes, such as blurred vision, dizziness, or confusion, please seek immediate medical attention. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. .
