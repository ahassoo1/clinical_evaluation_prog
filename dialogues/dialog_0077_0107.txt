DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I… my heart, it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s… skipping, but fast. Not always, but it worries me. It started maybe… two weeks ago?
DOCTOR: Hmm, a skipping or fast heartbeat… I see. And it’s been happening for about two weeks now, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Two weeks, maybe a little more. Not every day, though. Some days I don't feel it at all. It’s… hard to explain. Like a flutter. A quick flutter. And then it stops.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quick flutter that comes and goes. And it doesn’t seem to be constant. To help me understand a bit better, can you describe when you notice this happening?
PATIENT: Um… when? It doesn't seem to be after I eat, or when I walk. Maybe… when I am trying to sleep? Or just… sitting. It’s not like I’m doing something. That’s why it’s strange. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m watching TV.
DOCTOR: So, it appears to happen at rest, or during relatively calm activities like watching television or trying to fall asleep. And not necessarily related to exertion or eating. Do you feel any other symptoms with this fluttering?
PATIENT: No… not really. Sometimes I feel a little… tired. But I always feel a little tired, you know? Nothing… special. No pain, no… dizzy. Just the heart thing. And the tired. I don’t think the tired is from the heart, though. Just… life, maybe?
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. Now, let’s see… have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing before. I go to the dentist, of course. And… I had a cut on my hand last year, but that’s it. Never been to a heart doctor before this.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. Everything… normal, I think. Until this heart thing. My father… he had problems with his stomach, but not his heart.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your mother?
PATIENT: My mother… she is very old now. She has… old people problems. I don’t really know. She lives in Yemen. We don’t talk every day. I think… maybe high blood pressure? But I’m not sure. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache. But not every time. Just… when it’s really bad. It’s… ibuprofen, I think? The white pills. Not a lot. Maybe once a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for headaches. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. I eat everything. I’ve never had a problem with… anything. Except maybe spicy food, but that’s not an allergy, just… my stomach doesn't like it. But not a real allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… I work. I’m a chemical equipment operator. I’m married. We live in the city. I don’t… smoke. I don’t drink a lot of alcohol. Maybe a beer sometimes with dinner. I try to walk sometimes, but… work is busy. It’s… normal, I think. I don’t do any… sports. I like to watch soccer on TV.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It will just take a few moments.
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds… good. Whatever you need to do. I hope you find out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mr. Puder. Your blood pressure is 128/82, which is a little elevated but not concerning at the moment. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I am hearing a slightly rapid heart rate, and I do hear a few… extra beats occasionally. Not alarming, but something we should investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to order an EKG to get a better reading of your heart’s electrical activity. And perhaps a blood test to check your thyroid and electrolyte levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG? And… a blood test? Yes, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Is it… expensive? I don’t have… insurance.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. I’ll see what we can do to keep the costs as low as possible. We have some programs to assist patients without insurance. The EKG should be relatively inexpensive, and we can order only the essential blood tests to start. Let me make a note of that. In the meantime, I want you to try and keep a log of when these episodes happen. What you’re doing, how you’re feeling, and for how long they last. It will help us to get a better understanding of the situation. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. I write it down. When it happens, what I’m doing… everything. And if I feel bad, go to the hospital. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a little… better. When will I get the results? From the tests?
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Puder. The lab usually takes about 24 to 48 hours to process the results. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss them. Is next Tuesday afternoon alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday afternoon is… good. That works for me. Thank you, Doctor. I hope… it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Puder. We’ll do our best to figure out what's going on. We’ll get those tests ordered and schedule that follow-up for next Tuesday. In the meantime, try not to worry too much, and keep that log. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very well. Thank you again, Doctor Pirl. I will see you next week.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright then, I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood. Please let them know if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Puder, and please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will.
