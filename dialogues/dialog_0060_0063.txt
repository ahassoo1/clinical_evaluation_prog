DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my back. It’s been really, really bad. Worse than usual, I think. It started… hmm… maybe three days ago? It hurts to move, even just to sit up.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days ago. And you say it’s worse than usual… can you describe what “usual” is like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I… I had cancer a few years back. They got most of it, I think. But ever since, my back just… aches. Like a dull pain, most of the time. I can usually work through it, you know? I work at the factory, packing boxes. But this… this is different. It’s sharp, and it shoots down my leg sometimes. It makes me feel weak.
DOCTOR: Right. And you had cancer… what kind of cancer was it, if you recall?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. The doctor told me a lot of things. It was… kidney cancer. They had to take one of my kidneys out. It was a long time ago. Dr. Alvarez was my doctor then. He moved away. I remember that much, for sure. He was a good doctor. This pain… it doesn’t feel like the pain after the surgery, though. It’s… different. It feels deeper.
DOCTOR: Okay, kidney cancer, surgery with Dr. Alvarez… I see a few notes here, but not a lot of detail about the surgery itself. And you said this pain is different from what you experienced post-operatively. Can you pinpoint exactly where the pain is located?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my lower back, right here. But it goes all the way down my left leg, sometimes. Like a burning feeling. And when I try to stand up straight, it feels like something is stuck. It’s hard to explain. It’s not just one spot. It kind of… spreads. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, radiating pain down the left leg. And a feeling of being “stuck.” Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you lie down on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Just let me know if I need to move a certain way. It’s a little hard getting up there.
DOCTOR: Take your time. Just lie flat on your back, and I’ll take a look. I’m going to gently press on different areas of your back to see where it’s tender. And I'll check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Just let me know if anything is particularly painful. Okay… any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, right there! That’s where it hurts the most. It’s like a sharp, stabbing pain when you push. Not all the time, just when you press. And… a little bit when I move my leg that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your reflexes?
PATIENT: Reflexes? I don't know... I don't think I've ever paid attention to my reflexes. Are you going to tap my knee with that little hammer thing? I've seen that on TV.
DOCTOR: Yes, something like that. It’s just a quick check to see how your nerves are functioning. It shouldn’t be painful, just a little tap. Okay, let’s start with your left leg. Just relax your leg, and I’ll do the rest. Hmm… that’s a little weak. And when I ask you to lift your left leg against resistance… it's noticeably weaker than your right. Alright. Let's try that again.
PATIENT: Okay… It’s harder than it used to be, I think. It feels like it’s not working right. Not like it’s completely gone, but… weaker. I’ve been feeling tired a lot lately too. Maybe that’s why? I don’t know. It’s hard to tell what’s what anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue, and diminished strength and reflexes in your left leg. Given your history of cancer, and the nature of the pain and weakness… I’m a little concerned about possible nerve compression or, frankly, recurrence. Now, I want to be clear, I’m not making a diagnosis right now. But we need to investigate further. I’m going to order an MRI of your lower back to get a better look at your spine and the surrounding nerves. Would you be able to schedule that?
PATIENT: An MRI? Okay… I don’t really like those things. They’re so loud and… closed in. But… if you think it’s important, then yes. I can schedule it. I just… I get really anxious in small spaces. Is there anything I can do? Maybe take something to calm down? And… what if it is the cancer back? I don't want to think about that right now.
DOCTOR: We can discuss medication to help with the anxiety before the MRI. It’s a common concern. And look, I understand your apprehension. But we need to rule things out, and the MRI is the best way to do that. To be frank, it could be a number of things, and jumping to conclusions isn’t helpful. It could be a pinched nerve, muscle strain, or something else entirely. But given your history, we need to be thorough. I'll write you a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication. The radiology department will also have headphones available during the scan. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. And okay, no heavy lifting. That’s good. I haven't been doing much of that anyway, with my back hurting. Headphones sound good. I just… it’s hard to worry about this stuff. I just want it to be something simple. But you’re right, I need to know. When can I schedule the MRI? And will the insurance cover it? I have private insurance, but… you never know.
