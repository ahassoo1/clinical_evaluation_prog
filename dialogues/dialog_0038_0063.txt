DOCTOR: Good morning, Larin. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It's my back. It's been really bad lately. Hurts to move, hurts to sit… pretty much hurts all the time now. It's the same back that... well, you probably see on the paper, the cancer. It’s just… worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Yes, I do see your history of cancer here. And you're saying this back pain is a recent worsening of pain you've experienced before?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It started maybe two weeks ago, just a little ache. I thought it was from helping my sister move some boxes. But it hasn’t gotten better, and now… now it’s really hard to do anything. Even getting out of bed is tough. I'm taking the pills the other doctor gave me, but they aren't helping like they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been progressively worsening over two weeks, despite taking medication. And you mentioned you've been taking pills prescribed by another doctor – do you remember the name of the medication or the doctor who prescribed it?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. The doctor was… Doctor Hayes, I think. She was at the clinic in Weno. And the pills… they’re little white ones. Round. I’m not good with names, sorry. I just know they used to help, and now they don’t. I have a bottle here if that helps?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, no need to apologize. Having the bottle would be very helpful, thank you. While you're getting that, could you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Okay, here. The pain… it’s mostly in my lower back, right here. It feels like… a really bad ache, but sometimes it shoots down my leg. And it’s worse when I bend over, or try to stand up straight. It’s… hard to explain. It's not just pain, it's like… everything feels tight and stuck.
DOCTOR: Thanks. Okay, so lower back pain radiating down your leg, worse with bending and standing, and you describe a tightness as well. Does the pain feel constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty much constant, yeah. It never really goes completely away. But it gets worse at certain times. Like, first thing in the morning it’s really bad. And if I try to do too much – even just washing dishes – it gets much, much worse. Then I have to lie down for a while. It’s just… tiring. And worrying, you know? With the… everything else.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Larin. It’s completely reasonable to be concerned, especially with your history. Okay, so constant pain, worse in the mornings and with activity. Have you noticed anything that makes it feel better, even a little?
PATIENT: Hmm… lying down helps, like I said. And… sometimes a hot shower. It doesn’t take the pain away, but it makes it a little easier to move. And… if I sit just right in my chair, it’s not as bad. But it’s hard to find that spot, and then I can’t move without messing it up! It’s a bit of a puzzle.
DOCTOR: It sounds frustrating, like you're constantly trying to manage it. Okay, so heat and finding a specific position offer some relief. Now, just to get a better picture, have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. No numbness or tingling. It’s just… ache. A really bad, deep ache. Sometimes it feels like something is pulling, but mostly just ache. And… sometimes I feel a little weak in my legs, but I don’t know if that’s just from not moving much because of the pain. It's hard to tell.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the lack of numbness or tingling. And it’s understandable that weakness could be related to decreased activity. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just have you lie down on the examination table and we’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and sensation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. I trust you, Doctor. I’m not very fast, sorry. Old bones, I guess. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, take your time. Alright, Larin, let's start with your range of motion. Can you gently bend your knees up towards your chest, one at a time?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little sore. It doesn’t go up very high. It feels… tight. Okay, I did it. But it’s not comfortable. Is that okay? Should I stop?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Yes, that’s helpful to know. It’s alright to stop if it’s too painful. Now, let's try the other side. How does that feel compared to the right?
PATIENT: It’s still hard to get it all the way up. It feels… stuck, almost. Like something is blocking it. It's not easy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I'll gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. This will just help me see how your nerves are functioning. It might be a little uncomfortable, but shouldn't be painful. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds okay. A little tap won't hurt, I guess. Just let me know if it's too much. I'm a bit… jumpy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your legs. Alright, that was your right side. Now, let's try the left. Okay, reflexes are a little bit diminished on both sides. Now, I’m going to do some straight leg raises. This helps check for any nerve irritation. Can you lie flat on your back with your legs straight?
PATIENT: Okay, lying flat. It's hard to keep them perfectly straight with my back hurting. Just let me know if it hurts too much.
DOCTOR: I understand, just do your best. Okay, stop there. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Ooh, that hurts. Right in my back, and down my leg. Not a sharp pain, but a really bad ache. I can feel it pulling. It's not good, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, let’s try the other side. And how does that feel on the left side?
PATIENT: It's… better. Still a little ache, but not like the right side. I can feel it stretching, but it's not painful. I can feel it in my leg, but it's not shooting down like the other one. Is that… good?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Alright, Larin, that's all the physical exam for now. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you may have a pinched nerve in your lower back, likely causing sciatica – that's the pain radiating down your leg. Your history of cancer certainly adds to the concern, and we need to rule out any involvement there.
PATIENT: A pinched nerve… sciatica… Is that… serious? And what about the cancer? Is it… getting worse? I just want to know what's going on, you know? And what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Larin. It’s good you’re asking these questions. Sciatica itself isn’t usually a life-threatening condition, but it can be very painful and debilitating. It’s often caused by a herniated disc or spinal stenosis, which can put pressure on the nerve. Now, regarding your history of cancer, it's crucial to rule out any recurrence or spread. The pain radiating down your leg could be related to the cancer, or it could be something completely separate. We need to get some imaging done – an MRI of your lumbar spine – to get a clear picture of what's going on. In the meantime, we can manage the pain with some conservative treatments. I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help ease the spasms and inflammation, and I'll recommend some physical therapy to strengthen your core and improve your posture. We can also discuss some over-the-counter pain relievers. However, if the pain worsens, or if you experience any new symptoms like weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or numbness in the groin area, you need to seek immediate medical attention. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: An MRI… muscle relaxants… physical therapy… So, you don't know for sure if it's the cancer? That's… scary. And what about the pills I'm already taking? Are those okay to keep taking while I start these new ones? And what about… when should I call you? If the pain gets worse? It's just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a lot to take in. And it’s perfectly reasonable to be scared. No, I can’t say for sure if it’s the cancer right now. That’s why the MRI is so important. It will allow us to see exactly what's going on in your spine and determine the cause of your pain. Regarding your current medication, the Tramadol… I’d like you to hold off on that for now, as we want to see how you respond to the muscle relaxant. We can reassess that later if needed. As for when to call, please call the office immediately if you experience any of the following: worsening pain that doesn't respond to the muscle relaxant, new weakness in your legs, numbness or tingling in your groin or buttocks, or loss of bowel or bladder control. Those could be signs of a more serious problem. I’m also going to order a referral to physical therapy, and I'll have the nurse schedule the MRI for you. She'll also give you a prescription for the muscle relaxant and some instructions on how to take it. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Okay… hold off on the Tramadol… call if it gets worse… MRI… physical therapy… Um… will the MRI… will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't like being in small spaces, if that makes sense. And what if… what if it is the cancer? What then? It's just… I'm scared about what we might find.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Larin. It's completely understandable to be anxious about the MRI and what the results might show. The MRI itself isn't painful. You'll lie on a table, and the machine makes a loud knocking sound. It's a bit claustrophobic, as you are in a narrow tube, but we can give you a mild sedative if you're very anxious about it. The technician will be able to communicate with you throughout the procedure, and you'll have a button to press if you need to stop. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the results, it usually takes about 24-48 hours for the radiologist to read the scan and send the report to me. I will then schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. And if it is the cancer… we will discuss all of your options. That could include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery, depending on the location and extent of the cancer. We have a wonderful oncology team here, and we will work together to provide you with the best possible care. I know it’s scary to think about, but we will face it together. Right now, let's focus on getting the MRI done and seeing what the results show. In the meantime, try to stay as active as possible without overdoing it, and remember to take the muscle relaxant as prescribed. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: Okay… a sedative… that’s good. And you’ll explain everything… Um… what kind of muscle relaxant is it? Will it make me sleepy? I have to take care of my grandkids sometimes… And… thank you. For explaining everything. And for not… not rushing me. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. It's important to me that you feel comfortable and informed. The muscle relaxant I'm prescribing is called cyclobenzaprine. It can cause some drowsiness, especially when you first start taking it. It's best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how it affects you. It's also best to start with a lower dose, especially before bedtime, and see how you feel. We can adjust the dosage if needed, to minimize any side effects. If you find that it makes you too sleepy, let me know, and we can try a different medication. The nurse will give you detailed instructions on how to take it, including potential side effects and precautions. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Cyclobenzaprine… start low… No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor Auelua. You’ve been very patient with me. I guess I’ll just… wait for the nurse then? And try not to worry too much? .
DOCTOR: Okay, Larin. You’re very welcome. Just take things one step at a time, and try to focus on taking care of yourself. Yes, just wait for the nurse. She’ll be in shortly to go over the instructions and schedule the MRI. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Larin. And I’ll see you again soon. .
