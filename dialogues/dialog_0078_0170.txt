DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know? Gotta get a medical okay for the policy. Hope it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: I understand. A life insurance physical – perfectly reasonable. We’ll do our best to make this as efficient as possible. To start, let's go through some general health questions and then do a brief physical exam. First, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall… okay, I guess. I work a lot, managing that hotel. Keeps me on my feet. Not much time for, you know, hobbies or anything. Been feeling a little tired lately, but that’s probably just the work. Nothing major, really. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a while. Honestly, I don’t remember when.
DOCTOR: Okay, hotel manager – that can be a demanding job. And it’s good you're being proactive about this, even if it's been a while since your last check-up. You mentioned feeling tired lately. Can you describe that fatigue a little more?
PATIENT: Just… worn out, you know? Like I don't get enough sleep, even when I do. It’s not a sick feeling, just… heavy. And sometimes I feel a little short of breath when I walk up the stairs at work. It’s not terrible, just… noticeable. Happens maybe once or twice a week.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy fatigue” and “shortness of breath with exertion” – specifically stairs. That's helpful. Has anything changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Work's been the same. Maybe a little busier this summer, now that tourism is picking up. And… my divorce was finalized a few months ago. That was… stressful. But it's over now, so… I don't know if that’s still affecting me. It was a long process.
DOCTOR: I understand. A long and stressful divorce certainly can have lasting effects, even after it’s finalized. We'll keep that in mind. Let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. My feet ache a little at the end of the day, from being on them so much. But that's just normal, I think. Old age, you know? Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Fair enough – hotel work is hard on the feet. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I mean, doctors haven’t told me anything. I haven't really been to the doctor, like I said. My mom had… something with her heart, I think, when she got older. But I don't know what exactly. I wasn’t really paying attention then. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Family history is often difficult to recall precisely. We'll make a note of “mother with possible heart condition”. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital. And no surgeries either. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Just trying to get this done, you know? Gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We’ll move through this as quickly as we can. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. Mostly when I remember to buy them. Nothing else. I try to eat okay, but it's hard with the work schedule. Mostly just grab something quick when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And lastly, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. I can eat anything. I mean, I don’t like everything, but I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything. Is that… all the questions?
DOCTOR: That’s the majority of them, thank you. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, please? Gotta get back to the hotel. Tourists, you know? They don't wait.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That's a little elevated. I'm listening to your heart now… I do hear a slight murmur. It's not very loud, but it's present. Lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Okay, everything else seems normal. Now, based on what you've told me and the exam findings, I would like to order some blood work and an EKG to get a better understanding of what's going on. The elevated blood pressure and murmur warrant further investigation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and… an EKG? What's an EKG? And what does all this mean? Is something wrong? I just wanted a quick checkup for the insurance. This sounds… complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us see if there are any irregularities in your heart rhythm or evidence of previous heart issues. The blood work will give us information about your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function, among other things. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong, but given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur I heard, it’s best to be thorough. The murmur could be completely harmless, but we need to rule out anything serious. Think of it as a precaution. Would you be comfortable with me ordering these tests?
PATIENT: I guess so. If you think it's important. But… how long is this gonna take? And who pays for all this? I just got divorced, you know. Money’s kinda tight. Is this covered by Medicare?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s a valid concern. The blood work and EKG should only take about 30-45 minutes each, and we can do both right here in the clinic. As for the cost, Medicare should cover both tests, especially given your age and the findings during the exam. We have a billing department here that can verify your coverage and provide you with an estimate of any potential out-of-pocket costs. They can also discuss payment options if needed. I’ll have them come in and speak with you after we order the tests. Would you like me to proceed with ordering those tests now?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Just… get it over with. Hopefully, it's nothing. I gotta get back to work, you know? Tourists… they won’t understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, I've ordered the tests. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and get you set up for the EKG. It's a very quick and painless procedure. In the meantime, I’m going to write a brief note summarizing our conversation and the findings so far. It’s important to document everything clearly. “Patient presented for life insurance physical. Reports fatigue and shortness of breath with exertion. No significant past medical history. Blood pressure elevated at 148/92. Mild heart murmur auscultated. Ordered blood work and EKG to rule out underlying cardiac issues…” Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No… I think I covered everything. Just… tell me if something’s really wrong, okay? Don’t beat around the bush. I need to know. And… thanks, I guess. For not making me feel too stupid.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Putney. I will be completely honest with you and explain everything in a way you understand. We'll review the results as soon as they're available. And you're not stupid – everyone has questions and concerns, and it's my job to address them. The nurse should be with you any moment now. In the meantime, if you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to let me or the staff know.
