DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Oh, um... my joints. They’re just… stiff in the mornings. It takes a while to get moving, you know? It's been... a little while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long, though. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiff joints in the mornings. And you said it’s been going on for a little while… when you say “a little while”, can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a rough estimate? Hmm. Maybe… six months? Or was it longer? It's hard to say. Time just… slips away. I mostly just notice it when I get out of bed. It's not painful, exactly, just… hard to move. Like an old door needing oil, you know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. “Like an old door needing oil” – I appreciate the description. So, it's stiffness primarily in the mornings, not so much pain?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Not really pain. More… creaky. And it gets better as the day goes on. By afternoon, I'm mostly fine. It's just… getting started is the problem. I do a lot of bending and lifting with the little ones at work, so maybe that has something to do with it? I don't know. I used to be able to do anything, but... things change, don't they?
DOCTOR: They certainly do. You mentioned lifting at work – what kind of work do you do, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I work with children. Childcare, you know? Little ones. I help them with everything – playing, eating, changing… and lots of lifting! Picking them up, putting them down. It's a good job, I like the kids, but it can be hard on your back and… well, everything. My husband, God rest his soul, always said I was too strong for my own good.
DOCTOR: I understand. Childcare is very physically demanding. And I'm sorry for your loss. Now, let’s focus on your joints. Besides the stiffness and difficulty moving in the morning, have you noticed any swelling in your joints?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. I haven’t really looked for swelling, to be honest. I just notice the stiffness. Sometimes my fingers feel a little… puffy, maybe? But I just thought that was… well, getting older. I don't know if that's swelling or not. I'm not very good at noticing things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And have you noticed any redness or warmth in your joints?
PATIENT: Redness or warmth… no, I don’t think so. They just feel… old. Like they need a good rest, but then I have to go pick up little Timmy and… well, you know. It’s hard to explain. I don't think they're red or warm, no. I would have noticed that, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You would likely have noticed. Okay. Have you experienced any other symptoms – things like fatigue, fever, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Fatigue… oh, yes, a little. But who doesn't feel tired these days? I'm getting older, I work hard… But it’s not a bad tiredness, just… normal tiredness, I think. No fever, and my appetite is fine. I like to cook for myself, and I still enjoy a good meal. No changes there, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any past medical problems you’ve had, any surgeries, or what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a tricky one. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I think. And… I had a bad fall a few years ago, broke my wrist. But that healed up fine. As for medications… nothing regularly. Just over-the-counter things now and then for headaches. I really don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I don't have insurance, so I try to stay healthy and avoid the doctor when possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you've been managing. No regular medications, just as-needed for headaches. Now, have you had any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm usually okay with everything. I used to help my mother in her garden, and I never had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I don't think I have any allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll just take a look at your joints, check your range of motion, and listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I'm not really sure what you're looking for, but I'm happy to cooperate. Just… be gentle, if you don't mind. My old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I'm just going to move your fingers up and down, and side to side. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful or uncomfortable. Okay, I'm noticing a little bit of crepitus – that’s a bit of a grating sound – when I move your wrists and fingers. And your range of motion is slightly limited, especially in your right wrist. There's also mild tenderness to the touch in the base of your thumb on both hands. No visible swelling or redness at this time.
PATIENT: Crepitus…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is that bad? And my right wrist… yes, that’s always been a bit weaker, I think. I used to lift heavy bags of groceries for my husband… maybe that did something. And my thumb… yes, I do a lot of gripping with the little ones. It feels… achey sometimes. Is it arthritis?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned. Crepitus isn’t necessarily serious on its own, it just means there's a bit of roughness in the joints. It's very common as we age, and can be a sign of wear and tear. The limited range of motion and tenderness do suggest some degree of joint inflammation, but it's not enough to make a definitive diagnosis of arthritis right now. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it could be osteoarthritis - wear and tear arthritis - or possibly some form of tendinitis, given your history of gripping and lifting. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some x-rays of your hands and wrists. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays…? Oh dear. That sounds… expensive. I don't have insurance, you know. Is it really necessary? Could we not just… try something else? Maybe a cream or something? I really don't want to get into a lot of trouble with bills.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost. X-rays will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on in your joints, which is important for figuring out the best treatment. We can discuss options for minimizing the cost - some facilities offer discounted rates for cash-paying patients, and we can explore whether a mobile x-ray unit is available, which might be less expensive. However, without x-rays, it’s difficult to rule out other potential causes of your stiffness and tenderness, or to determine the severity of any joint damage. In the meantime, while we explore the x-ray options, we can start with some conservative measures. I recommend trying over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen or naproxen, following the instructions on the label. Also, applying heat or ice to your joints can help relieve discomfort. And it’s important to avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms. Would you like me to write you a prescription for a topical cream like diclofenac, which can help reduce inflammation?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… better. A cream would be good. I don’t want to take pills if I can avoid it. And heat… yes, I like a warm bath. I do that sometimes when my joints are sore. I’ll think about the x-rays… maybe if I can find somewhere that isn’t too expensive. But let’s start with the cream and the heat, okay? And maybe try to take it easy with the little ones… but they need so much lifting!
DOCTOR: Alright, that sounds like a reasonable plan. I'll write you a prescription for diclofenac topical cream. Use it twice a day for two weeks and see if it provides some relief. Remember to wash your hands thoroughly after applying it. I'll also give you a handout with some exercises you can do to maintain your joint flexibility and strength. And I want you to monitor your symptoms closely. If your stiffness worsens, you develop any new pain, or you notice any redness or swelling in your joints, please contact me right away. Here’s the prescription and the handout. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you not pushing me for the expensive tests right away. I'll try the cream and the exercises and see how it goes. I think that’s everything. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or if your symptoms don’t improve. Take care of yourself, and enjoy your time with the little ones.
