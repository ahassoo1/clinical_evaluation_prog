DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Pandolfi, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… DeCHENE, is it? Yes, DeCHENE. It’s… a delicate situation, really. I’m starting to date someone new, and I want to be absolutely certain I’m… sound. You understand. One doesn’t simply leap into things these days. There are…considerations.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. "Sound," as you put it. I suppose that’s fair enough. We'll run some standard tests, then. Though, frankly, at your age, it’s probably nothing. Still, best to be thorough, I suppose. Can you elaborate on what specifically prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Prompted it? Honestly, Doctor, it’s common sense. He’s… younger. A good deal younger. And one hears such stories, doesn’t one? About…things. I need to know everything is as it should be. I’ve always been meticulous about my health, you see. Regular check-ups, proper diet. One must maintain standards. It wouldn’t do at all to… surprise him, later on. Do you understand what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand you want reassurance. And that you are…concerned about potential issues arising in a new relationship. Very well. Let’s start with a brief medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, I had my tonsils out as a child, naturally. And… let me see. I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia when I was thirty-two. Nearly lost a week of work, it was dreadful. Aside from that, nothing truly significant. I’ve always been blessed with good constitution. Though, my mother… she had high blood pressure. And her sister, Aunt Beatrice… she had… something with her joints. Rheumatism, I believe it was called. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know. Pneumonia is noted. And a family history of hypertension and possible rheumatoid arthritis… acceptable. Any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A little thing, really. A fibroid, years ago. They said it was small, harmless. I had it checked regularly for a time, and then… well, my previous physician said not to worry about it. It’s been years. And honestly, Doctor, I don’t recall the exact diagnosis. Something to do with the uterus, naturally. It wasn’t painful, you understand. More… a nuisance, really. Is that… worrisome?
DOCTOR: We'll need to review those records. A history of uterine fibroids requires documentation. And frankly, "not painful" is not a diagnosis. Do you take any medications currently, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I pride myself on not taking medication. I believe in natural remedies, proper rest, and a balanced diet. Though… I do take a daily vitamin D supplement. My previous physician suggested it. Something about the lack of sunlight. And… sometimes, when my joints ache – and it’s been happening more lately, now that you mention it – I take ibuprofen. Just a little, you understand. Only when absolutely necessary. It's over the counter, of course. Do you think that’s… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen… noted. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Penicillin. Dreadful rash, years ago. I avoid it like the plague. And…dust. I have a slight sensitivity to dust. It makes me sneeze. A very minor allergy, of course. Nothing serious. I manage it with a good housekeeper. I can't abide a dusty home, you see. It's simply…uncivilized. Do you need to know anything else, Doctor? I have an appointment with my hair stylist later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Let’s move on to a brief physical exam. We'll start with your weight and blood pressure. Then we'll listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, we will palpate your abdomen. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Palpate my abdomen? Really, Doctor? Is that absolutely necessary? I assure you, I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. And my weight is perfectly…adequate. But, very well. If you insist. I trust this won’t take long.
DOCTOR: Hmm. 93 kilograms. And your blood pressure is 142/90. Elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit rapid. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, but…there's some tenderness in the lower quadrants. I recommend a pelvic exam to rule out any abnormalities. And a blood workup. Complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a CBC.
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Doctor, I assure you, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that area! I've told you, I maintain a very respectable lifestyle. And blood work? For a simple dating situation? This is… excessive, frankly. I'm starting to feel quite uncomfortable. I came here for reassurance, not a full-blown investigation. Is there truly no other way? Perhaps a simple urine test would suffice? This is all rather… upsetting. I think I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, with all due respect, "respectable lifestyle" does not preclude medical issues. Your blood pressure is elevated, and you report tenderness upon palpation. I am recommending standard diagnostic procedures to rule out potential causes, not conducting an “investigation.” A urine test will not provide the necessary information. I understand you are anxious, but proceeding with a pelvic exam and blood work is in your best medical interest. I can refer you to another physician if you prefer, but I strongly advise against delaying a proper evaluation.
PATIENT: Another physician? Absolutely not. I chose you, Doctor. But… I suppose… if you insist. Blood work, then. Very well. But the pelvic exam… I still feel strongly it is unnecessary. And I expect a full explanation of all results, in layman's terms, of course. I will not be subjected to medical jargon. And I need this done as quickly as possible. I have a standing appointment this afternoon. This whole situation is… most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order the blood work now. The lab is down the hall. The nurse will provide the necessary paperwork and instructions. I will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. It may take a few days for the lab to return them. And while I respect your concerns, I still strongly recommend the pelvic exam. We can discuss it again at your follow-up. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that will be all for now. Just… please hurry with the results. And do ensure everything is… discreet. This is a delicate matter, as you understand. I'm sure the nurse will find me. Thank you, Doctor.
