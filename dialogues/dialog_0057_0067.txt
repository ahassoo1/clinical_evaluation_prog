DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. It's good to meet you. My name is Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It's been… a while, I think. Not sure exactly how long. Everything's a little fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain with deep breaths. I understand. “A while” is alright – we can try to narrow it down. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. More when I… do stuff. Like, moving things around. Working. Used to be a lot of working, you know? Construction. But not so much anymore. Does that make sense? It's not always there, just… when I push myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So it's worse with activity and improves with rest, generally?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Rest helps. Sitting down... not lifting heavy things. Though I still try sometimes. Old habits, you know? My daughter, she tells me to stop. But… well. It's just a pain. Not a bad pain, usually. Just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, “annoying” pain that’s worse with activity, and better with rest. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… a ache, I guess? Deep in my chest. Not like a sharp thing. More… spread out. Hard to explain. Like someone’s sitting on my chest sometimes. Though I haven’t been lifting anything too heavy lately. Really. Mostly just… little things. Around the house.
DOCTOR: Okay, a deep ache, spread out in your chest, sometimes feels like pressure. And you said it comes and goes, but isn't a bad pain. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes I get a little… short of breath. But I always figured that was just… getting old. I don’t know. And I cough a little, now and then. But everyone coughs, right? It's probably nothing. I’m not sure. Honestly, I just want this pain to go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath and a cough along with the chest pain. It's good you're telling me everything, even if you think it might be nothing. When you cough, is it a dry cough, or do you bring anything up?
PATIENT: Oh… um. A little bit of… stuff comes up. Mostly just… clear stuff, I think. Sometimes a little bit white. Nothing bad, though. Not like… blood or anything. I don't smoke, if that matters. Never have. I just want to get back home, if you don't mind. My daughter's making dinner.
DOCTOR: No, of course, and thank you for sharing all of this, Mr. Ruocco. It’s helpful. And I completely understand wanting to get home for dinner. Just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Has this cough been getting worse lately?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Maybe a little. It feels like it takes me a little longer to get over it when I do cough. But I just figured… it’s the weather. Or something. It’s been hot, you know? Everything feels harder when it’s hot. I really don't know. Is this going to take much longer, Doctor? I'm just a little worried about the roast. My daughter's not a very good cook.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the roast, and we will be as efficient as possible. Just a few more quick questions, and then we'll do a brief physical exam. Has the pain ever radiated to your back, shoulder, or arm?
PATIENT: Radiate… you mean… spread somewhere else? Sometimes… I get a little ache in my shoulder. My left shoulder, I think. But that could be from… I don’t know… sleeping funny. I sleep on that side sometimes. Everything aches when I wake up these days. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good at remembering things. I just want to feel better. Is this something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, some ache in your left shoulder. We’re gathering information to figure that out, Mr. Ruocco. And I assure you, we'll do our best to get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. One last question for now: Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… no. Not that I know of. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothing bad. No chills, and I definitely don’t sweat much at night. I sleep with the fan on, you know? It gets hot. Can we just… get this over with? I really need to get home. My daughter’s expecting me to help with the potatoes. She always burns them.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing chest pain that's worse with activity, sometimes with shortness of breath and a cough, and some shoulder discomfort. No fever, chills or night sweats. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, and feel your chest. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be quick, please? I really don’t want to be a bother. And try not to make it hurt. Everything hurts already. And… could you explain what you’re doing as you go? I get nervous when I don’t know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Ruocco. I’ll explain everything as we go, and we’ll go as slowly as you need. First, I’m going to listen to your heart. I’ll place the stethoscope on your chest here and here, and listen to the rhythm and sounds of your heartbeat. This helps me check for any unusual sounds or patterns. Everything sounds… regular so far. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs, both front and back. I'll ask you to take some deep breaths as I listen.
PATIENT: Okay… deep breath… it's… a little hard. Feels like I'm not getting enough air. This… isn't very comfortable, Doctor. Is everything alright? I'm starting to feel a little anxious. My daughter said I should have gone to the doctor a long time ago. She's probably right. Just… please hurry.
DOCTOR: I hear some wheezing in your lungs, Mr. Ruocco. That means there's some narrowing in your airways. This, along with the cough, could be a sign of several things. We’ll need to investigate further. I’m going to gently feel your chest now, to check for any tenderness or unusual lumps. This shouldn't be painful, but please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. There doesn't seem to be any significant tenderness. Your heart rate is a little elevated, which is understandable given your shortness of breath. And your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a blood test to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: It… feels a little sore. Not bad, but… sensitive. X-ray and blood test? I… I don’t like needles. And I don’t like being stuck in those machines. But… if you think it’s necessary. My daughter said I have to do whatever the doctor says. She's a very bossy girl. Is it going to take long? I have to help with dinner. What are you looking for with the tests? Is it something serious, Doctor? Please… just tell me straight. I don’t want to be kept in the dark. I'm just an old man.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco. It's okay to be nervous. And I will definitely explain everything and won’t keep you in the dark. The chest X-ray will allow us to see your lungs and heart more clearly, to check for any signs of pneumonia, fluid buildup, or other problems. The blood test will help us check for infection, inflammation, and your overall health. Given your symptoms – the chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing – we need to rule out several possibilities, including pneumonia, bronchitis, and possibly even a heart problem. It's too early to say definitively what's going on, but these tests will help us get a clearer picture. The tests themselves shouldn't take too long – the X-ray will be a few minutes, and the blood test will be quick as well. We can get the results relatively quickly. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: Allergies… um. Not that I know of. Never had much trouble with medicines. My daughter gives me all sorts of pills for my arthritis, and I usually don't have any problems. But… I did have a bad reaction to a bee sting when I was a boy. Swelled up something awful. Does that count? Honestly, Doctor, I’m just scared. This is all very overwhelming. Can my daughter come in here with me? I feel a little lost. And… will I be able to eat dinner tonight? She’s making roast. It’s my favorite. But she burns it every time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bee sting reaction is important to know – we’ll make a note of that allergy. We’ll be extra cautious with any medications we administer. And you’re right to feel overwhelmed, Mr. Ruocco – it’s a lot to take in. Absolutely, your daughter can come in with you. Would you like me to call her now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Call my daughter. Her name is May. May Ruocco. Tell her I’m here… and I’m a little scared. And tell her to bring her good smelling hand lotion. My hands are so dry. And… could she maybe bring a sweater? It's always cold in these doctor's offices. Oh, and tell her to remind me to ask about the potatoes. She always forgets the seasoning. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I’ll call May right now. Hello, May Ruocco?
