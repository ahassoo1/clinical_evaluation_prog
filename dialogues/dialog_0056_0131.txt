DOCTOR: Hi Mykeisha, nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Amussen, nice to meet you too. Well, the nurse told me you wanted to talk about my blood pressure being a little high. It’s been…well, a little all over the place lately, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little all over the place. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It feels fine most of the time, honestly. But sometimes, especially if I've been running around doing things – grocery shopping, cleaning, you know, life stuff – I get a bit of a headache, right in the back of my head. And my face feels a little flushed. That usually happens in the evenings, I think. It doesn't last long, though. Maybe an hour or so. I haven't really paid it too much mind until the nurse called.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches in the back of the head and flushing, especially with activity. And it’s happening in the evenings. That's helpful. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings were when the nurse checked them, or have you ever had your blood pressure checked before?
PATIENT: Oh, um…the nurse said something like 140 over 90? Something like that. It didn’t really stick with me, I’m sorry. And yeah, I had it checked at the pharmacy a couple times last year when I was getting my flu shot. It was okay then, I think…normal, the pharmacist said. But that was a while ago. I don’t really remember the numbers, though. I’m not good with numbers, to be honest.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, numbers can be tricky! 140/90 is a little elevated, which is why we’re talking about it. It’s good you’ve had it checked before, even if you don't remember the exact readings. Okay, let's get a better idea of what's going on now. Aside from the headaches and flushing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I mean, I get tired, but who doesn't? And sometimes my vision feels a little blurry, but I wear glasses anyway, so I just figured that was my prescription needing updating. Nothing new that I can think of. Oh! Wait… sometimes my feet feel a little swollen at the end of the day, but I’m on my feet a lot. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, blurry vision with existing glasses, and some foot swelling at the end of the day. Those are all things we'll want to consider. Foot swelling can sometimes be related to blood pressure, but it can also be caused by other things. Just to get a more complete picture, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I don’t really have a lot of medical problems, thankfully. I had the flu really bad a couple times, and I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, but that healed up fine. My mom has diabetes, but I don’t. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything serious. And I don't take any regular medication. Just over-the-counter stuff for headaches sometimes. I had a really bad bout of bronchitis a few years back, but that’s about it. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. No major medical problems, mom with diabetes, no regular medications. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Like I said, pretty healthy, knock on wood! Nothing major ever needed fixing, thankfully. Just the broken wrist when I was a kid, and that didn't need surgery, just a cast.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about your family history – besides your mom’s diabetes, are there any other health problems that run in your family – things like high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My dad had high blood pressure, I think. He was on medication for it for years. And…my grandma on my dad’s side, she had a stroke a long time ago. But other than that, not really. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Everyone always says I'm the one who inherited all the worry genes!
DOCTOR: Okay, so dad with high blood pressure and grandma with a stroke. That's useful information. And finally, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I work as a…well, it’s a little of everything, really. Personal care work, mostly helping people with things around their house, sometimes running errands. So, I’m on my feet a lot, moving around. I don’t really have a set schedule. As for diet… I try to eat healthy, but it's hard when you're always on the go. Lots of fruit and vegetables when I can, but sometimes it’s easier to grab something quick. I don’t drink a lot of alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don't smoke. I used to, a long time ago, but I quit years ago. I try to walk when I can, but I don’t really have time for a lot of exercise. Does that give you a picture?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good picture, thank you. Okay, so active job, variable diet, occasional wine, no smoking. Alright, Mykeisha, it sounds like we have a good starting point. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your pulse and take your blood pressure again. Then, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture of things. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Amussen. Just let me know if it's going to be cold! I always get chilly when they use those things on my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. I’ll make sure the stethoscope is warmed up. Okay, everything sounds clear on your heart and lungs. Now, let's check your pulse. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, blood pressure… Okay, it’s 142 over 92. Okay, reflexes are normal, eyes look good, throat is clear. No swelling in your legs. Everything seems normal on a basic exam, but your blood pressure is still elevated.
PATIENT: Okay…so it’s still high, huh? Even after all that? Is that…bad? What does it mean? I don’t want to have to take pills if I don’t need to. I’ve heard they have side effects.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad right this moment, but it’s definitely something we need to address. Repeatedly elevated blood pressure, what we call hypertension, can increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems over time. And you’re right to be concerned about medications and side effects. We won’t jump straight to pills right away. Usually, the first step is to try lifestyle changes to see if we can get it under control that way. Given your history and what we’ve discussed, it’s likely this is a combination of genetics – your dad having high blood pressure – and your active lifestyle. Sometimes, even with healthy eating, consistent activity can put a strain on your cardiovascular system. Before we talk about specific changes, let’s get some blood work done to rule out any other underlying causes. I also want to check your kidney function and make sure there aren’t any other issues contributing to this. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds…reasonable. Checking for other things makes sense. I don’t want anything else going on, hidden. Yes, blood work is fine. What all do they need to take? And how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too much poking.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It's usually just a standard panel – cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, electrolytes – it's mostly just to get a baseline. It will involve some poking, unfortunately, but it shouldn't take too long. The phlebotomist is very good, and they’ll make it as comfortable as possible. The results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. While we’re waiting, I’m going to give you some information about lifestyle changes you can start implementing now. We’ll discuss them in more detail when we have the blood work results. In the meantime, I want you to start keeping a blood pressure log. You can get a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Take your blood pressure twice a day – morning and evening – and write down the numbers. That will give us a better picture of what's going on throughout the day. And finally, I’m going to give you a handout on a DASH diet – Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. It’s a healthy eating plan specifically designed to lower blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, a blood pressure log, the DASH diet…and wait for the blood work. Yes, that sounds manageable. I can do that. I can definitely get a monitor from the pharmacy. I’ll try to remember to take it twice a day, morning and evening. I'm not always good at remembering things. Will the nurse remind me? And what exactly is the DASH diet? Is it expensive? I don't have a lot of extra money for fancy foods.
DOCTOR: That’s a great question. Don’t worry, the nurse can definitely remind you when you come in for your follow-up appointment. The DASH diet is actually quite affordable. It focuses on eating a lot of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. It's about reducing your sodium, saturated fat, and sugar intake, rather than buying expensive foods. We have some resources in the handout that include budget-friendly meal ideas and shopping tips. It's also about portion control. You don't have to drastically change what you eat, just how much of it. I’m going to write down your blood work orders and give you a referral to a nutritionist who can help you create a personalized meal plan. We'll discuss everything in more detail when your results come back. Do you have any questions for me right now before we finish up?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think that covers most of it. No, I don’t think so. Just…thank you, Dr. Amussen. It’s good to finally have a plan. It was starting to worry me. And thank you for not jumping straight to pills. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I will try my best to do everything you said.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. I understand your concerns, and we'll work through this together. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns along the way. Okay, you have a good day, and I’ll see you in a week or so once your results are back.
