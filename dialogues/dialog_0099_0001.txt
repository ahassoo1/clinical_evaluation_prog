DOCTOR: Right. Johney Knoch, 74. Good. Well, Mr. Knoch, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… the smoking, you see. I’ve been… indulging for a very long time, and I believe it’s time I attempt to cease. It’s become rather… bothersome, both to my health and… well, the general discomfort it causes others. I’ve tried, of course, a few times, but… not with much success.
DOCTOR: “Indulging”?
PATIENT: Yes, well. That is… perhaps an imprecise term, Doctor. A habit, then. A long-standing habit. It’s just… difficult to break, you understand? Sixty years is a considerable amount of time to… cultivate such a practice. I apologize for the… colourful phrasing.
DOCTOR: Sixty years. Unremarkable. And you've tried to quit…when, exactly?
PATIENT: Let me see… There was a concerted effort in 1987, after my mother… passed. And again in 1996, when the factory downsized and several colleagues… took up the habit with me, in solidarity, you might say. And… a smaller attempt in 2012, prompted by a particularly stern letter from my niece. None of them lasted more than a fortnight, I’m afraid. Each time, the… cravings would return with renewed vigour.
DOCTOR: A fortnight. Right. And how much do you smoke now, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Approximately… twenty cigarettes daily, Doctor. Though it fluctuates, naturally. More when… agitated. Less when… occupied. Mostly Marlboro Reds, if you need to know the specific brand. I purchase them at the corner shop, two packs at a time, usually. It's a… routine, you see. A rather unpleasant routine, but… a routine nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Twenty a day for…well, a very long time. Have you noticed any…physical symptoms, besides the obvious?
PATIENT: Well, there's a… persistent cough, naturally. Especially in the mornings. And a certain… shortness of breath when ascending stairs. I attribute that to age, mostly, but… perhaps it is exacerbated by the habit. I also find myself… more easily fatigued than I once was. And the taste, you see. Everything tastes… muted, somehow. Not as vibrant. But I’ve always had a… weak constitution, so it’s difficult to say what is attributable to the smoking and what is merely… the inevitable march of time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Let’s not delve into your “inevitable march of time,” Mr. Knoch. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No, Doctor, not that I recall. A few… minor ailments, naturally. A touch of arthritis in my left hand. And the occasional… indigestion. But nothing… serious. The local doctor always said I was… remarkably resilient, considering my… lifestyle. Though I suspect he merely wished to be rid of me quickly. A busy man, you see. Very busy.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: My father… he suffered from… bronchitis, I believe. Towards the end of his life. And my maternal grandmother… she passed away from… something involving her lungs, though I never knew the specifics. It was a long time ago, you see. Before the… modern medical advancements. We didn’t discuss such things openly. A very stoic family, we were. Mostly farmers, you see. Not prone to… complaining.
DOCTOR: Stoic. Right. Alright. Let’s do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. Whatever you deem necessary. I am… quite prepared. Though I must warn you, my circulation isn’t what it once was. My feet tend to… get cold easily. I apologize in advance for any… inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Just sit there, Mr. Knoch. Take a deep breath…and again. Decreased breath sounds bilaterally, with some wheezing. Not surprising. Blood pressure is… elevated. Pulse is regular, but a little fast. No significant lymphadenopathy. Oxygen saturation…92%. Borderline. Alright, Mr. Knoch. The exam confirms what we already knew. Your lungs aren’t happy. We need to get some imaging done—a chest X-ray, to rule out anything serious. And then we’ll talk about options. Not a lot of options, frankly, at your age and with your history. But we’ll discuss them.
PATIENT: Imaging, you say? A chest X-ray… Is that… serious, Doctor? I confess, I had hoped to avoid such… invasive procedures. I am not particularly fond of hospitals, you see. And the thought of… uncovering something… unpleasant… is rather unsettling. I understand it’s necessary, of course, but… I do hope the results aren’t… too alarming. What precisely are we looking for, Doctor? Perhaps a simple explanation would… alleviate my concerns.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knoch, with sixty years of smoking under your belt, "simple" isn't exactly the word I'd use. We're looking for signs of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia…possibly even cancer. It's a standard procedure, not an "invasive procedure." And frankly, at your age, preventative measures are far less effective. The imaging will give us a baseline, and then we can discuss palliative care options. Though, realistically, quitting now won’t magically undo the damage. It might slow it down. But don’t expect miracles. I’ll write you a referral to the imaging center down the street. They're efficient enough. Go tomorrow. And try to… not agitate yourself unduly before the appointment. It won't help. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Palliative care… you mean… to manage the… inevitable, you’re saying? I… I see. It's… rather disheartening, Doctor. I had hoped… foolishly, perhaps… for a more… optimistic prognosis. To think sixty years of… indulgence… has led to this. Yes, Doctor. I understand. I will… endeavor to remain calm before the appointment. And I will… go to the imaging center tomorrow. May I… inquire as to the… costs involved? I am… not insured, you see. And finances are… somewhat limited. I apologize for the… practical question, but… it’s a concern.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Knoch, I'm a physician, not a financial advisor. I can tell you the imaging center offers a discount for cash patients, but I don't know the exact amount. You'll need to inquire with them directly. And frankly, at this point, worrying about the cost of an X-ray seems… rather insignificant. The real concern is the potential findings. Here. Take this. Go tomorrow. And if you’re concerned about the cost, perhaps you should have quit smoking sixty years ago. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I believe that is all. Thank you… for your… candor. It is… not what I wished to hear, but… I appreciate your honesty. I will… attend the imaging center tomorrow. And I… I apologize again for… wasting your time. .
