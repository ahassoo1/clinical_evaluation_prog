DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a while now, I guess. Don’t water much anymore.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Real dry,” you say. And how long has this been going on for, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. A while. Maybe… six months? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda slips away when you get to be my age, you know? It’s not like a sudden thing, just… slowly got drier.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Six months, slowly progressing. And would you describe it as burning, gritty, or just… uncomfortable dryness?
PATIENT: Uncomfortable. Not much burnin', not much grit. Just… feels like there's nothin' in 'em, if that makes sense. Like they're… empty. And everything kinda blurry. Not real bad blurry, just… not sharp.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Empty” and blurry vision. Do you notice it more at certain times of day?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. Worse in the mornin', usually. And when it’s windy out. Workin' outside doesn't help, I reckon. I’m a cement mason, so I’m out in the sun and wind a lot.
DOCTOR: A cement mason, you say. Exposure to the elements, naturally. Do you routinely wear eye protection when you’re working?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not always. Should I be? I always figured a little dust never hurt nobody. Old habits, I guess. Mostly just try to blink it away.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Pipolo, “a little dust” can certainly cause problems over time. Alright. Let’s move on. Besides the dryness and blurriness, have you noticed any pain, redness, discharge, or double vision?
PATIENT: No pain, no. Not much redness either. No… stuff comin' out. And I don't see double, thankfully. Just… dry. That's it, mostly. I just want it to feel better, you know? Makes it hard to see what I’m doin’ with the concrete.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, redness, or discharge. Just the dryness and blurry vision. Have you tried any over-the-counter remedies for this, such as artificial tears?
PATIENT: Artificial… tears? No, I haven’t. Never heard of ‘em, Doc. What are those? Do you get ‘em at the drugstore? I mostly just try to close my eyes for a minute when they bother me. That helps a little, I guess.
DOCTOR: Artificial tears are lubricating eye drops you can purchase over the counter. They help to supplement your natural tear production. They are a reasonable first step. But given the duration of your symptoms and your occupation, I’d like to examine your eyes more closely. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Examine ‘em. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. Just want to get this fixed if we can. Long summer for cement work, you know. Don't want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and look straight ahead. I’m going to check your visual acuity first, then I’ll take a closer look at the surface of your eyes. I'll start with the vision chart.
PATIENT: Okay. Do whatever you need to do. I'm ready. Hope I can still read the letters. My eyesight ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pipolo. Your visual acuity is 20/30 in both eyes uncorrected. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. I do observe some mild conjunctival injection, but no significant corneal abnormalities. The lack of significant findings suggests a likely diagnosis of dry eye syndrome exacerbated by your occupation. However, given your age, I want to rule out other possibilities. Have you had a comprehensive eye exam recently?
PATIENT: Comprehensive…exam? Jeez, Doc. Not for… a long time. Maybe… ten years ago? Something like that. I figured as long as I could still see, I was okay. Never really bothered with the doctor much. I'm a tough old bird.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pipolo, with respect, simply being able to “see” is not sufficient. A comprehensive exam assesses not only your vision but also the health of your eyes, including glaucoma and macular degeneration. Given your age and the duration of these symptoms, it’s prudent to get one. I am going to refer you to an ophthalmologist for a full evaluation. In the meantime, I'll prescribe some artificial tears to use four times a day. And, I strongly advise you to wear safety glasses at all times when you're working. Do you have any allergies to eye drops?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any trouble with nothin' like that. Safety glasses… okay. I'll try to remember. Artificial tears… four times a day. Got it. Where do I get these… drops? And where do I go for this… eye doctor? I don't like goin’ to a lot of different doctors, you know. It’s a hassle.
DOCTOR: Here is a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a reputable ophthalmologist in the area. Her office is located at 14 Oak Street, and you can reach them at 555-1212 to schedule an appointment. The artificial tears are a brand called Systane Ultra. You can purchase them at any pharmacy; no prescription is needed for those. Now, regarding your reluctance to see multiple doctors, I understand. However, your vision is a precious sense, and it’s important to ensure there aren’t any underlying issues that require specialized care. I am recommending this as a precautionary measure, and I trust you will take it seriously. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: Okay, Oak Street, 555-1212. Systane. Got it. I guess… no harm in seein' another doctor. Just seems like a lot of bother. Alright, Doc. I think that’s all my questions. Thanks for the drops. Hope they help. I wanna get back to work, you know? .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Pipolo. I’ll document everything in your chart. Please follow up with Dr. Reed as soon as possible. And remember the safety glasses. Good day.
