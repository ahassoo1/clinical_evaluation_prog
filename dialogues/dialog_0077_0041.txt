DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, things just...getting harder. My legs, mostly. Not strong like they used to be. It started slow, but now… I have trouble walking even with my cane sometimes. It worries my wife, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in, and it’s very thoughtful of you to consider your wife’s concerns as well. When you say “harder,” can you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s not pain, not usually. More…heavy. Like trying to lift something very, very heavy with each step. And sometimes…wobbly. Like the legs just don’t want to hold me up. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a sudden thing, it just... builds up over the day.
DOCTOR: Alright, "heavy" and "wobbly," building throughout the day... that’s helpful. And it's not consistently painful, you said?
PATIENT: No, not always pain. Sometimes a little ache, but mostly just… tired. The legs feel so tired, even after sitting for a long time. And it gets worse if I try to do too much, you know? Like helping with the garden, or walking to the store.
DOCTOR: I see. So, exertion definitely makes it worse. And sitting doesn’t necessarily relieve it completely. Have you noticed it affecting anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my hands are not as steady as they used to be either. Makes it hard to button my shirts sometimes. And my vision… it gets blurry from time to time. Not all the time, but… enough to worry me. My wife helps with things now.
DOCTOR: Alright, some difficulty with hand steadiness and occasional blurry vision… We’ll certainly want to explore those as well. Before we continue, could you please tell me about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, a long time ago, maybe twenty years now, a doctor told me I had… Multiple Sclerosis, I think it was called. I don't remember all the details, to be honest. They gave me some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them after a bit. They didn't seem to do much, and I didn't like the way they made me feel.
DOCTOR: Multiple Sclerosis… Okay. And has anyone ever told you about any problems with your heart, blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My blood pressure, the doctor said it was a little high once, a long time ago. He put me on a pill for that too, for a while. But I think I stopped that one as well. Never been told anything about my heart, and I don’t think so about sugar. I eat too much fruit, maybe!
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries or hospital stays I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long, long time ago. And I broke my arm once, playing football. Other than that… no, nothing I can remember. Mostly just little things.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my wife’s family, they have…heart trouble. Her father had it, and her brother too. My side… I don’t know so much. My parents passed a long time ago, and I didn’t keep in touch with all my cousins. I know one aunt had something with her bones… osteoporosis, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart trouble on your wife’s side, and possible osteoporosis in your family… Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not anymore. Like I said, I stopped the pills years ago. I don’t take anything. My wife sometimes tries to get me to take vitamins, but I forget!
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, and then I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all kinds of food. My wife makes good food!
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam to assess your strength, balance, and reflexes. It shouldn’t take too long. Can you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds alright. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m a little slow getting up, you see.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Astores. No rush at all. I'm here to help. Let's just get you settled on the table, and we’ll take it from there.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. There. That's better. It's just getting up and down is the hard part these days.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is 76 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath for me. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Do you have any history of shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any trouble breathing. Even when I played football, I could run all day!
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might be a little uncomfortable, but please let me know if it causes any pain. Reflexes are a little diminished in your legs, but present. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I'm trying my best. It's not as strong as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Strength is 4 out of 5 in your arms, and 3 out of 5 in your legs. That means you have some weakness in your legs. Now, let's check your balance. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, careful now... it's a little wobbly. There. But I need to hold on, you see. Don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's alright. Holding on is perfectly fine. You have some unsteadiness, which is likely contributing to the difficulty with walking. Okay, Mr. Astores, based on my examination and your history, it sounds like you’re experiencing progressive weakness in your legs, accompanied by balance issues. Given your history of Multiple Sclerosis, it's possible this is a flare-up. However, the diminished reflexes and weakness also raise some concerns about other possible causes, such as peripheral neuropathy or even a spinal issue. I'm going to order some blood tests and an MRI of your spine to help us determine the cause of your symptoms. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: MRI, you say? Is that the one where I have to lay in a long tube? I don't like small spaces, Doctor. But… if you think it's important, I guess I can try. I just… get a little anxious. Blood tests are fine, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the one. I understand your concerns about the MRI. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious in that situation. We can discuss options to help manage your anxiety, such as medication or a mild sedative. And you won’t be completely enclosed; the machine is open at both ends. The MRI will help us rule out any issues with your spine that could be contributing to your weakness. The blood tests will check for vitamin deficiencies and other underlying conditions. Before we proceed, I want to be upfront: given your symptoms and the possible causes, I think it's also prudent to get a consultation with a neurologist. They specialize in conditions affecting the nerves and brain and can provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Would you be open to that as well?
PATIENT: A neurologist, you say? Another doctor? Well, I suppose if you think it’s best. I just... I like to keep things simple. But if it helps find out what’s wrong… yes, alright. Do what you think is best, Doctor. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little better, knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. I understand your reluctance to see another specialist, but I believe it's the best course of action in this situation. I'll write a referral for you to see Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected neurologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I'm going to order the blood tests and schedule you for the MRI. I'll also give you a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication to take before the MRI if you feel you need it. We’ll discuss the results of the blood tests and the MRI at your follow-up appointment. And remember, if your symptoms worsen, or you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. Here are the instructions for the blood tests…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you very much. You've been a big help. I'll try not to worry too much. I just want to be able to walk around without feeling like I'm going to fall.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Astores. We’ll do everything we can to find out what’s causing your symptoms and get you back on your feet. Please, take your time getting dressed. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call my office. Take care now. And I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you again. You have a good day.
