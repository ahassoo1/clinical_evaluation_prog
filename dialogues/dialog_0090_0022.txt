DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good morning to you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, my tummy… it feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to, you see. It just doesn’t… feel right. It's been a little bit now, maybe a week or so? It's hard to say, time goes by so fast these days.
DOCTOR: “Big,” you say. Can you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. How to explain… It’s not painful, exactly. More… full. Like I ate a very big dinner, but I didn’t. And… harder, maybe? Like there's something… inside. I don't know if that makes sense. Everything feels a bit… wobbly, too. I just feel… off. I used to be so strong! I worked as a sociologist, you know. Lots of walking, lots of thinking. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: So, a feeling of fullness, even without eating much, and some hardness you’ve noticed. And you mention feeling “wobbly.” Any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes… Let me think. No, I haven’t… thrown up. No. And… the other thing? Bowel… movements? I… I go to the bathroom, yes. It's not… different, I don't think. Maybe a little… less? But I don't keep track, you see. Old lady problems, probably. Everything slows down when you get old. I don’t worry about those things much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Oh, dear. I used to weigh more, I think. But I haven’t… stepped on a scale in ages. Maybe? I don't know. My clothes… feel a little loose, but I lost some weight a long time ago when… when my husband passed. It's hard to say if it's more now. Everything is just… a blur these days, you know? I'm sorry, I'm not very helpful.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It does appear there’s been some weight loss over the last six months, approximately ten pounds. Now, let’s do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. Just going to listen to your tummy, and feel it a little bit. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, ten pounds? Goodness gracious. Well, that doesn’t sound good, does it? Yes, yes, of course. You can listen and feel, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. It’s just… I don’t want any poking and prodding if you can help it. Old bones, you see. They get a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be very gentle. Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Okay. It is a bit firm down here, and a little tender. Not acutely painful, but definitely something to investigate. I’m also noticing some mild bloating. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite at all?
PATIENT: Oh, that does feel… a little strange. Not painful, but… different. Like a hard lump. And my appetite… well, it's just gone. Not hungry much anymore. I try to eat, for my health, you know? But it doesn’t feel good. Just… sits in my tummy. I used to love to cook, all sorts of Russian dishes… borscht, pelmeni… now I don't even bother. It feels… pointless, I guess. I just drink tea mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And no fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don’t think so. I haven’t been feeling hot. And… night sweats? No, no. I sleep pretty well, actually. Sometimes I wake up, but just to use the bathroom. Old lady things, you see. I don't get fevers or chills. Not usually. I had a bad cold once, a long time ago… but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your weight loss, decreased appetite, abdominal fullness and firmness, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something relatively benign, like constipation or diverticulitis, but we need to rule out anything more serious. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. And I think we need to get a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Blood work and a… a scan? That sounds… serious. What are you looking for, Doctor? I don't want anything… awful. I'm an old woman, you see. I’ve lived a long life. I just want to feel a little better, that’s all. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe some medicine? I don't like the sound of a scan… are they safe?
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, I understand your concerns, and I assure you, we're taking a cautious approach. The blood work will give us a baseline of your overall health, and the CT scan will allow us to see what's going on inside your abdomen. It's a standard procedure, and the radiation exposure is minimal. We need to investigate this properly to determine the cause of your symptoms. As for medicine, we can discuss some options for appetite stimulation and discomfort, but we need to know what we’re treating first. It could be something simple, but we can't know without these tests. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies? Let me think… No, I don’t think so. Not to anything. I used to eat everything. Berries from the forest, mushrooms… everything! But I haven’t been eating much lately, so I haven’t tested anything new. Okay… blood work and a scan. If you think it’s necessary. But promise me it won’t be too… frightening. And not too much poking and prodding, please. I'm a very delicate old lady, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. We’ll do everything we can to make it as comfortable as possible. No excessive poking and prodding, I assure you. The blood work is just a small sample, and the CT scan is mostly lying still. I'll write the orders now, and the nurses will schedule the appointments for you. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids and eat small, frequent meals if you can. And if you experience any worsening pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before I finish?
PATIENT: Oh… fluids and small meals. Yes, I can try that. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don't think I have any more questions right now. Just… please be gentle. And… thank you again. I appreciate you looking after me. It’s just… scary, being old. Everything feels… fragile.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurses will be in shortly. I'll see you again once we have the results of the tests. Try not to worry too much. .
