DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Reisig, you say? A…Dutch name, isn’t it? Well. I suppose I’m here about a…delicate matter. It’s rather embarrassing, truthfully. An…unpleasant discharge. Yes. That’s the word. Been going on for a bit now, and my wife insisted I come. She worries unnecessarily, that woman. Still, here I am. I haven’t the faintest idea what causes such a thing, mind you. Old age, I presume. Everything’s falling apart, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok, “unpleasant discharge” is a perfectly acceptable way to describe it. And it’s very good of you to come in, and even better that your wife encourages you to seek care. It takes courage to discuss these things, and it’s certainly not something to be embarrassed about. Many conditions can cause this, and we'll work to figure out what’s going on. To help me understand, could you tell me a little more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, courage had very little to do with it, Doctor. It was more…avoidance of a lecture. My wife’s lectures are quite thorough, you see. As for the discharge itself…well, it’s…slippery. And a bit…yellowish, I suppose. Not terribly copious, thankfully. It’s not flooding, if you understand my meaning. Just…there. Been happening for, oh, a week or so now, maybe a little longer. It’s difficult to keep track, you know. Things blur as one gets older. And there’s no…pain, thankfully. Just…uncomfortable. Is that…sufficient detail? I’m not accustomed to discussing such…anatomical matters.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mr. Krok. "Slippery, a bit yellowish, not copious, and uncomfortable" – I appreciate you describing it so clearly. And no pain is good to know. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms alongside this discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think. My knees ache, of course. That's always present. But that's just…old age again. And I've been a bit more…tired, perhaps. Though truthfully, I’ve always been rather fond of a good nap. I suppose I’ve been visiting the lavatory a bit more frequently, but I attribute that to the tea. My wife insists on strong tea. And…no, I don’t think that’s it. No fever, no burning sensation, no…other unpleasantness. Just the discharge, and the general feeling of being…worn out. Is this…sufficient? You’re asking very specific questions, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Krok. Knees aching and increased tiredness are good to know, and I understand attributing those to age and tea respectively. Increased frequency of urination is also noted. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a rather lengthy list, if you’re asking. I had a touch of the flu in ’78, a rather nasty bout it was. And my prostate, yes, that’s been…troublesome for years. Enlarged, the doctor said. Required some…attention, several years ago. And I suppose my blood pressure isn’t what it used to be. They gave me some pills for that, but I stopped taking them. Didn’t seem to make much difference, and I dislike taking pills. As for diabetes…I don’t think so. My wife is very careful about my sugar intake. She wouldn’t allow it, you see. Is that…adequate? I’m not particularly good at remembering these things. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Krok. Enlarged prostate with previous treatment and history of high blood pressure are important. It’s good you mentioned the history of high blood pressure even though you’re no longer taking medication for it. And thank you for letting me know about your wife’s care regarding your sugar intake. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my appendix removed when I was a boy. A rather frightening experience, that was. And…oh, yes. They did something to my knee, years ago. A sports injury, when I was much younger. Football, it was. A foolish pursuit, in retrospect. And… I believe they removed a mole from my back, a few years ago. Seemed benign, the doctor said. No, I don’t think there’s been anything else. Just the appendix, the knee, and the mole. Nothing…major. Is that…complete? My memory isn’t what it once was, you know. I’m likely forgetting something. Perhaps a wisdom tooth, years ago. But that hardly seems…significant.
DOCTOR: That’s very good, Mr. Krok. Appendectomy, knee surgery, and mole removal are noted. Don't worry about not remembering every detail; we can always review your records if needed. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… ah. A rather gloomy topic, truthfully. My father… he passed away young. Heart trouble, they said. My mother lived a long life, but suffered terribly from arthritis. My brother… well, he had some sort of…nervous condition. Spent a good deal of time in the hospital. And my wife’s family… her father had diabetes, I believe. And her sister… she had breast cancer, a few years ago. A terrible ordeal. No, not a particularly healthy lineage, I’m afraid. Is that…sufficient? A rather depressing list, isn’t it? I don’t like dwelling on it. It’s best not to think about these things. Everything falls apart eventually, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Krok. It’s helpful to know about the family history of heart trouble, arthritis, nervous condition, diabetes, and breast cancer. It is a lot to carry, and you are right, it can be difficult to think about. Now, to get a complete picture, I’d like to ask about any allergies you have. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Never had any trouble with medications, thankfully. I can eat anything, or at least I used to. My wife always said I had an iron stomach. No, no allergies. None whatsoever. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. Though I do get a bit of a sniffle in the spring, but that's just the pollen, I presume. Nothing serious. Is that…complete? My wife is rather meticulous about these things, so if I did have an allergy, she would certainly know about it. She’s very protective, that woman. Always has been.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Krok. No known allergies noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, not really. As I mentioned, I dislike taking pills. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but I stopped. And occasionally I’ll take an aspirin for a headache, but that’s about it. And sometimes, if my knees are particularly troublesome, I take a bit of that…glucosamine, I believe it’s called. My wife buys it for me. Something to do with cartilage, she says. But that’s all. Just the occasional aspirin and the glucosamine. Nothing…regular. Is that…complete? I try to avoid medication whenever possible. It always makes me feel…foggy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. Just occasional aspirin and glucosamine noted. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam, you say? Well… I suppose so. I’m not particularly fond of being poked and prodded, truthfully, but I understand it’s necessary. Just…please be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And…try to be quick about it? I don’t have all day, you know. Though I suppose I do, now that I’m retired. Still. Best to be efficient, wouldn’t you agree? Where…where do we begin?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. We'll start with checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and gently examine your abdomen. Finally, I’d like to do a quick examination of the genital area to assess the source of the discharge. I understand this may be sensitive, and I will explain everything as I go and ensure your privacy. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Well… that sounds rather thorough, doesn’t it? Examining the…genital area… yes, I suppose it’s necessary, given the circumstances. Though I must admit, it’s rather…undignified. As long as you’re…discreet, and explain everything as you go, I suppose I can tolerate it. And please, be gentle. As I mentioned, my bones aren’t what they used to be. And…do try to be quick about it? It’s not a particularly comfortable subject, you understand. And… perhaps some small talk? To distract me? Anything to avoid dwelling on the…proceedings. What’s the weather like today?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I will be as respectful and efficient as possible. I completely understand your discomfort, and I will explain everything before I do it. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72 and your temperature is 98.6, both within normal limits. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling. Now, to assess the source of the discharge, I'll need to gently examine the genital area. I'll be using a gloved hand, and I'll explain each step as I go. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes… alright. Just…please be quick about it. And…discreet. It’s rather…embarrassing, you know. As I mentioned, I'm not accustomed to such…intimacy with strangers. And…perhaps don’t comment on anything you see? I’d prefer not to know the specifics. Just…get it over with, quickly and efficiently. And…gloves, you said? That’s…reassuring, I suppose. Very well. Proceed. But quickly, please. My patience isn’t what it used to be. And…what is the weather like today? You asked about that, didn't you?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. As I gently examine the area, I’m noting some mild redness and a small amount of yellowish discharge from the urethral opening. There doesn’t appear to be any significant swelling or pain to the touch, although you did mention discomfort. Based on this initial examination, it appears to be urethritis – inflammation of the urethra. This can be caused by several things, including bacterial infection, irritation, or, less commonly, sexually transmitted infections. To determine the exact cause, I recommend we send a urine sample for testing. This will allow us to identify any bacteria present and guide appropriate treatment. Would you be able to provide a sample for me?
PATIENT: Urethritis… that sounds rather unpleasant. And a urine sample, you say? Well, I suppose so. Anything to get to the bottom of this… predicament. And to be rid of this… discomfort. Yes, I can provide a sample. Though I must warn you, I had a rather large glass of tea this morning. Will that affect the results? And…what sort of…treatment are we talking about? Pills, I presume? I dislike pills, as I mentioned. Is there no alternative? Perhaps a… cream? Or some sort of… herbal remedy? My wife is quite fond of herbal remedies. Yes, a urine sample. Lead the way, as it were. But quickly, please. And no poking and prodding, if you please. This is all rather… undignified, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok. A large glass of tea can dilute the sample somewhat, but we can still get useful information. We may ask for a second, more concentrated sample if needed. If you could collect a mid-stream urine sample for me, that would be ideal. I’ll give you a sterile cup and instructions. Treatment typically involves antibiotics to clear any bacterial infection. Unfortunately, antibiotics are usually the most effective treatment for bacterial urethritis. There are some herbal remedies that may offer some supportive care for inflammation, but they are unlikely to resolve the infection on their own. I can discuss some options with you after we get the results of the urine culture, but I want to be upfront – the most effective course of action is usually antibiotics. Would you like me to leave the room while you collect the sample, so you can have some privacy?
PATIENT: Privacy… yes, that would be… preferable. I’m not accustomed to such… procedures, you understand. Antibiotics… well, I suppose it can’t be avoided. If it’s the only way to rid myself of this… discomfort. Very well. Leave me to it. And… don’t comment on the specifics, if you please. I’d prefer not to know the details. And quickly, if you please. This is all rather… undignified, you know. Yes, leave me. And… thank you. For your… discretion.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I’ll give you some privacy. I’ll be just outside when you’re finished. Please take your time.
