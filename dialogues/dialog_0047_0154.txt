DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my water. Keeps bothering me. Again. I don’t… I don't rightly remember all the details, but it’s been happening a bit. It’s… uncomfortable. Is that enough for a start? I'd like to get this sorted quickly, if we can.
DOCTOR: "Uncomfortable" is… vague, Ms. Wease. We’ll get it sorted, but I need specifics to do that. When you say "again," how long has this been happening on and off?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specifics… right. Well, it’s been… a while. Years, I suppose. Not constantly, you understand. Comes and goes. Maybe… six months at a time, then okay for a bit? Honestly, it’s hard to say. My memory… isn’t what it used to be. I just know it’s happened enough that it’s bothering me now. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Six months on, six months off… that is something. And it’s perfectly alright that remembering exact dates is difficult. Let’s focus on what’s happening now. Can you describe how your water is bothering you?
PATIENT: Well… it burns, when I go. And I have to go often. More often than I used to, certainly. And sometimes… it feels like it doesn’t all come out, if you understand. Like there's still some left. It’s… embarrassing, really. I don't like talking about this.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination, increased frequency, and a sensation of incomplete emptying… right. I understand this isn’t a comfortable topic, Ms. Wease, but it’s important we discuss it. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness. I… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It hasn’t been… bright red, if that makes sense. Everything's a bit cloudy sometimes, but no, I haven’t seen actual blood. My eyesight isn’t what it was, either, so maybe I would miss it. But no, I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Cloudy urine… alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or side?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t felt hot, and no shivering. My back aches a bit, like it always does when I bend over, but that’s just my age, I suppose. Not a sharp pain, more of a dull… ache. Is that what you mean? I really don't want to be a bother, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are not a bother, Ms. Wease. But it's important to distinguish between everyday aches and something new. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, kidney problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical conditions… let me think. My… my first husband, bless his soul, he had something with his heart. But me? I don't rightly recall. The doctor… they used to give me pills for my blood pressure, years ago, but I stopped taking them. I can't remember the name of it, and I haven't been back regularly since… divorced, you see. Things get… forgotten. I'm afraid I'm not much help.
DOCTOR: Right. No known medical conditions, previously treated for high blood pressure but currently not on medication. And any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a girl, a very long time ago. And… and I broke my arm once, when I was a teenager. Fell out of a tree, chasing a cat. Silly thing to do. No… I don’t think I’ve been in the hospital for anything else. No, not that I recall. I’m trying, Doctor, but it's all a bit… foggy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy as a child, broken arm. Let’s move on to family history. Do either of your parents have any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she… she died when I was young, from something with her chest, I think. Pneumonia, maybe? It was a long time ago. My father… he was a strong man, worked on a farm all his life. He lived a long life, but he did have… trouble with his water when he got older. Similar to what I'm having, now that I think about it. Not that he ever went to the doctor much. Men don't, you know.
DOCTOR: Mother died young, cause unknown. Father had similar urinary issues, but no formal diagnosis. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not me. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I have a small glass of sherry with my dinner sometimes, that’s all. Just to help me sleep. And drugs? Heavens, no. A respectable woman doesn’t. I do hope I don't look like that sort of person.
DOCTOR: Of course not. Alright. Finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. I get a bit of a rash if I touch poison ivy, but that’s about it. And… and I think I was a bit stuffy when I took penicillin as a child, but it was so long ago, I can’t rightly remember. It didn’t make me terribly sick, just a bit… uncomfortable. Is that all? Can we be finished now, Doctor? I have a casserole in the oven.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. Based on what you've told me – the burning with urination, increased frequency, sensation of incomplete emptying, family history of similar issues – it sounds like a urinary tract infection, or perhaps an overactive bladder, or even just age-related changes. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a urine analysis to check for infection and a basic kidney function test. And I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just a quick look and a listen.
PATIENT: Oh. Tests… and an exam? I… I don’t know. I don’t like tests. And… I’m not sure about an exam. Is it absolutely necessary? I really do have that casserole… And I am a bit… sensitive. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. Can’t we just give me something for the water?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wease, I understand your reluctance, but I cannot prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. It would be irresponsible. The urine analysis is a simple test, and the physical exam – a quick listen to your abdomen and a brief check of your reflexes – is standard procedure. It will allow me to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure I prescribe the correct treatment. And frankly, dismissing potential issues because of a casserole is not a sound medical practice. It will take just a few moments.
