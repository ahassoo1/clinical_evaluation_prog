DOCTOR: Hi Maribeth, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Hernandez, it’s good to meet you too. I’m here because… it’s my breathing. When I lie flat, it gets… difficult. Like something is sitting on my chest. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, maybe a month. I don’t know the exact date, I don’t keep track of those things so closely anymore. But it’s enough to wake me up at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty breathing when lying flat that's been waking you up at night for about a month. That definitely warrants a closer look. Can you tell me a little more about this difficulty?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a wheezing sound, if that’s what you mean. It’s more like… I have to work to get air in. And it feels tighter when I’m trying to sleep. I usually sleep with an extra pillow, propped up, and that helps a little. But it’s still not comfortable. I don’t get dizzy or anything, just… short of breath. Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Maribeth. No dizziness is good to know. So, it’s a sensation of effort to breathe, tightness, and it’s relieved somewhat by propping up with extra pillows. And no wheezing. Okay. Have you noticed this shortness of breath at any other times, like when you're walking or doing light activity?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. When I'm up and about, I'm fine. I walk to the library every day, and I haven't had any trouble with that. It’s always when I lie down. And it seems worse if I’ve eaten a big meal. Though, I do enjoy my supper, so I try not to think about it too much. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That is important, Maribeth. The fact that it’s only when lying flat and is worse after eating gives me a few ideas. Let's go through some other things quickly, and then I'll want to listen to your lungs and heart. Do you have any pain in your chest with this, or any swelling in your ankles or legs?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Not at all. And my ankles… well, they sometimes feel a little puffy at the end of the day, but I thought that was just from being on my feet at the library. I don’t know if that’s related. I’ve never had any problems with swelling before, not that I recall. I suppose it could be the heat, too. It’s been quite warm lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain, some mild ankle swelling you attribute to being on your feet, and possibly the heat. Good to know. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes, Doctor. Years ago. But the doctor put me on a pill, and it seemed to keep it under control. I stopped taking it a few years back when I moved here, and my new doctor said it was fine. Diabetes, no. And no heart problems, as far as I know. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. Just this breathing trouble now. It’s… inconvenient. Would you like me to list all the medications I used to take?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Maribeth. Knowing about the past high blood pressure is important. And no, no need to list all past medications right now. Let’s focus on what you're currently taking. Are you taking any medications at all right now, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. Every morning. And sometimes, if my knees bother me, I take ibuprofen. But that’s only when I need it, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly. They never seem to do much good.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin daily and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. That’s good to know. Alright, Maribeth, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart now. Can you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm not very good at holding still for long, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and exhale slowly… good. And again… in… and out… Okay. Your breathing sounds a little diminished on both sides, but not significantly. I'm also listening for any unusual sounds like wheezing or crackles. Your heart sounds regular, but a little… distant. I also want to check your ankles for swelling and your legs for any signs of fluid retention. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. It’s… reassuring to hear you’re checking everything so thoroughly. I’ve been to doctors who barely listened at all, just wrote a prescription and sent me on my way. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel some mild swelling in both ankles and a little bit of fluid retention in your lower legs. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing something called orthopnea, which is shortness of breath when lying flat, and the mild swelling in your legs suggests some fluid buildup. This could be related to a few things, including your past high blood pressure or potentially something affecting your heart. I want to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh dear. No, I don't think I have any allergies. I haven't had many tests done in my life, honestly. Just the usual bloodwork, and maybe an x-ray once when I fell and hurt my wrist. I don't recall anything about dye. What kind of tests are you thinking of, Doctor? I’d like to know what I’m getting into. And how long will they take? I have a book club meeting on Thursday, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about no allergies. I understand wanting to know what’s involved and keeping your book club meeting in mind. I'm thinking we'll need a chest x-ray to see if there's any fluid buildup in your lungs. And I'd like to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Finally, a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any other potential causes. The x-ray and EKG are quick – the x-ray takes just a few minutes, and the EKG is even faster. The blood test will take a little longer to process, results usually come back in a few days. We can schedule those for tomorrow morning?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning sounds… acceptable. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my afternoon. I have to pick up some yarn for my weaving. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? And will they be painful? I don’t do well with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: No, nothing special to prepare for the chest x-ray or EKG, Maribeth. And no, neither test should be painful. The EKG involves placing small stickers on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity – it doesn't involve any needles. The x-ray technician will just ask you to stand still for a few moments while the machine takes a picture. We'll get the results sent to me, and I'll give you a call as soon as I have them to discuss what they mean and what the next steps are. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. No needles is a relief. And if you call me with the results, that’s good. I don’t like being kept in the dark. Alright, Doctor Hernandez. I suppose that’s all for now, then? I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I've been worrying about this breathing for weeks. I really hope we can figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, Maribeth. I’m glad I could listen. I understand your worry, and we will figure out what's going on. I’ll have the receptionist schedule those tests for you tomorrow morning. In the meantime, if your breathing gets significantly worse, or you experience any chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve answered all my questions, really. Just… thank you. I suppose I’ll see you again when the test results are back. I do hope it’s nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Maribeth. You take care, and I’ll be in touch soon. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day.
