DOCTOR: Right, Noelani. Step right in. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hello Doctor… Osga, is it? Yes. Well, it’s a bit…difficult to explain. It’s my… down there, it’s been hurting. A pain. It’s not…comfortable, and it’s a little concerning. I wasn’t sure who to see, exactly.
DOCTOR: “Down there”?
PATIENT: Yes. Well… my… testicles. That’s what they call them, isn’t it? I’m terribly sorry, it feels rather awkward discussing this. It’s a pain in… well, there. It’s been on and off for a few weeks now, I think. It's hard to keep track of time, truthfully. Is this… the right place to be discussing this? I just… I wasn’t sure where else to go.
DOCTOR: Testicles. Right. Look, I'm a family doctor. I handle a lot of things. But usually, men see a urologist for… those complaints. Are you sure you're not mistaken about which specialist you need?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A urologist? I… I don’t think so. No one specifically told me to see a urologist. I just… called the clinic, and they gave me this appointment with you. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding? I'm just trying to figure out what's going on with the pain. I haven’t been feeling well generally, and this has added to my worry. I don’t know much about doctors, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s just get this over with. Look, I'll ask a few questions, but honestly, I’m not the ideal person for this. How long exactly have you been experiencing this "pain," and can you describe it?
PATIENT: Um, okay. As I said, a few weeks, maybe longer. It comes and goes, and it’s… dull, mostly. Not sharp, exactly, but… uncomfortable. Like a heavy ache. Sometimes it feels like a pulling sensation. And sometimes… well, sometimes I feel a little nauseous with it, but I don't know if that's connected. It’s difficult to say. It’s worse after I’ve been… working, I think. I do a lot of woodworking. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Woodworking. Right. And how would you rate the pain, on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Oh, my. A scale? Um… well, when it’s bad, it’s maybe a… six? Not debilitating, but definitely noticeable and unpleasant. Most of the time, it’s more like a three or four. Just… bothersome. It’s more the idea of it that worries me, if I’m honest. I don’t usually bother doctors, and I’m not good at describing these things. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And have you noticed any swelling, redness, or any changes in the… texture, for lack of a better word, of the testicles?
PATIENT: Oh dear… well, I haven’t… specifically looked, if you don’t mind my saying so. I try not to. It’s just… awkward. But I don’t think so. No redness, no. Maybe… a little bit of… firmness? But I honestly couldn't say for sure. It's hard to tell, and I haven’t compared them recently, if that makes any sense. I’m really not good at self-exams. I mostly just try to ignore it until it gets too bothersome. Is that a bad thing to do?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. Look, I’m going to need to examine you to get a better idea of what’s going on. I understand it’s…awkward, but I can't properly assess the situation without a physical exam. Do you consent to a physical examination?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. A physical exam… yes, I suppose I have no choice, do I? If you think it’s necessary. Yes, I consent. But please… be gentle? And… perhaps explain what you’re doing as you go along? I’m really not accustomed to this sort of thing, and I’m a bit nervous, if I’m honest. Is there… a gown or something?
DOCTOR: There’s a gown in the changing room. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and then…examine the area in question. I’ll try to be quick and…thorough. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Right… other patients. Yes, of course. Thank you, Doctor. I… I’ll go and change, then.
DOCTOR: This is going to be a long day.
PATIENT: Um… I’m ready, Doctor. I… I hope I’ve done this right. It feels rather…exposed. But please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just… warn me if it’s going to be uncomfortable, if you would be so kind.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie flat, please. I'm going to listen to your abdomen first. Just breathe normally. Alright, everything sounds normal there. Now, I need to examine your testicles. I'm going to gently palpate each one to check for any abnormalities. Hmm. The right testicle feels slightly enlarged and firm. Not dramatically so, but noticeable. Is there any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. That’s… a little uncomfortable. Not terrible, but… yes, definitely a pain there. A dull ache, like the one I’ve been describing. Is that… bad? It feels… different from the other side. Definitely firmer, as you said. And… a little warm, perhaps? I don’t know if that’s helpful. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any recent trauma to the area?
PATIENT: Trauma…? No, not that I recall. I haven’t… fallen or anything. I’ve been doing a lot of woodworking, as I said, but nothing… dramatic. Just the usual bumps and scrapes, I suppose. I’m very careful, usually. I can’t think of anything that would have caused… trauma, no. Does that mean anything? Is it possible it just… happened?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, based on this quick examination, it could be several things. It could be an epididymitis, an inflammation of the tube connecting your testicle to the vas deferens. Or it could be a hydrocele, fluid around the testicle. Less likely, but possible, it could be a varicocele, enlarged veins in the scrotum. Or… it could be something more serious. I'm going to order a scrotal ultrasound to get a better look. And a urine test to rule out any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… and a urine test? Oh dear. More tests. Yes, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. It all sounds rather… alarming, to be honest. But yes, please do whatever you need to do to find out what's going on. An infection sounds… unpleasant. And what if it is something more serious? Will I need to see a specialist, then? A urologist, as you mentioned earlier? And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m terribly sorry for all the questions. I just… I’m very anxious.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will likely need to see a urologist, depending on the results of the tests. I'll send the results directly to them, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. The ultrasound shouldn't take more than 20 minutes, and the urine test is quick as well. You should have the results within a few days. Look, I'm a family doctor, not a specialist. I can only provide a preliminary assessment. It’s best to get a professional opinion from someone who specializes in this area. I'll get the lab orders printed for you now. And here's a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a urologist in town. Does that cover everything?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramirez… right. Yes, I think so. A referral… and the tests. It all seems rather… a lot. I suppose I should schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate your help, even if… even if it’s not very good news. One last question, if you don’t mind. Is there anything… anything I should be doing in the meantime? Should I be avoiding certain activities? Or… is there anything I can do to make myself more comfortable? I'm terribly sorry to bother you, but I’m just very worried.
DOCTOR: Avoid strenuous activity for now. And if you experience any severe pain, fever, or nausea, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just…try to relax. I have other patients waiting. Thank you for your cooperation. .
