DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh. Doctor, eh? Versace… sounds Italian. Anyway. I’m here 'cause... well, it's hard to breathe sometimes. And my mouth feels like the Sahara Desert, ya know? And my eyes… they itch. Feels like sand in ‘em. It’s been gettin’ worse, I think. Not sure exactly when it started though. Old age, probably. Everything starts fallin' apart.
DOCTOR: Right. “Hard to breathe sometimes,” “dry mouth,” and “itchy eyes.” And you said it’s been getting progressively worse, though you don’t have a specific timeframe. I see. Let’s start with the breathing difficulty. Can you describe when you experience this?
PATIENT: When…? Hmph. That’s a good question. Not always. Sometimes when I walk... up the stairs, maybe. Or if it’s a really hot day. Like today. I used to be able to walk all day, ya know? Worked outside for years, directin’ traffic. Hot sun, didn’t bother me none. Now… just a little walk and I gotta stop and catch my breath. Doesn't make sense. It ain’t like I’m doin’ anything hard. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: So, exertion seems to be a key factor. Walking, particularly uphill or in the heat, brings it on. And you’ve noticed a change from being able to walk all day without issue. Do you experience any chest pain or tightness with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain…? Nah. Not really. Maybe a little… uncomfortable. Like somethin’ heavy’s sittin’ on my chest sometimes. But no pain, ya know? Not like a heart attack or somethin’. I had a cousin… now he had chest pain. Ended up bad, that one. But me? Just… tired. And uncomfortable. Is that makin’ sense? I don't always describe things good.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Guilds. “Uncomfortable,” a heaviness in the chest, but not sharp pain. I appreciate you clarifying. Now, about this dry mouth and itchy eyes… do those occur at the same time as the breathing difficulty, or are they separate issues?
PATIENT: Separate, mostly. The breathin’ thing happens when I do somethin’. The dry… everything? That’s just… all the time now, it feels like. Especially in the mornin’. I gotta drink a whole glass of water just to get my mouth wet. And my eyes… always feel gritty. Like I haven’t slept in days. I use drops, but they don't help much anymore. Cheap drops, probably. Everything's cheap these days.
DOCTOR: So, the dry mouth and itchy eyes are persistent, more noticeable in the morning, and the eye drops provide minimal relief. Hmm. Do you have any allergies that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? You mean like… to pollen? I don't think so. Lived in Cuba for a long time, didn’t have allergies there. Came here… a few years ago, I guess. Maybe somethin' in the air here? I don’t pay much attention to that kinda stuff. Never been one for sniffles or sneezes. I'm a tough guy. Used to work in the sun all day! Everything’s different now. This air just feels… dry. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. No known allergies, and you’ve noticed the symptoms seem to have started after relocating here. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications…? Hmph. Let me think. The doctor gave me somethin’ for my… waterworks. Prostate, I think he called it. Small blue pill. Take it every day. And sometimes I take a little somethin’ for my blood pressure. When it gets high. But I forget sometimes. Old age, ya know? Forgetful. And the eye drops, of course. That's it, I think. Maybe some vitamins… my niece gave me a bottle, but I don’t remember what they're for. Probably nothin' important. Everything feels foggy these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a medication for prostate issues, something as needed for blood pressure, eye drops, and some vitamins of unknown composition. Can you recall the name of the prostate medication?
PATIENT: Name…? Ugh. That’s… a tough one. The bottle’s at home, I think. Little blue bottle… says something… starts with a "T," maybe? Or an "F?" I don't know! The doctor just told me to take one every day. I don't bother with names, too much to remember. And everything looks the same anyway. Little blue pill… that's all I need to know. I ain't no pharmacist! It helps me sleep, mostly. Though I still wake up a lot. Foggy...everything is foggy.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll try to obtain a medication list from your pharmacy. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides prostate issues?
PATIENT: Diagnosed…? Hmph. Let me think… I had a bad knee once. From playin' baseball. A long time ago. Doctor said somethin' about cartilage. Fixed it, though. And I got a little somethin’ with my heart a few years back. Not serious, just… high blood pressure, I think. They put me on pills, and that was that. I used to be a strong man! Workin' outside, directin’ traffic... that's a lot of work. Everything hurts now. Old age, ya know? Foggy brain…can’t remember everything. I think I told you about my cousin... bad heart... chest pain…
DOCTOR: Alright. History of knee injury, and a diagnosis of hypertension. Let’s talk about family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
