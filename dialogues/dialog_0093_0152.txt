DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. That’s what this visit is about, I guess. Hyperlipidemia, it said on the paper. I don’t really know what that means, exactly.
DOCTOR: Yes, hyperlipidemia. It simply means you have higher than optimal levels of cholesterol in your blood. It’s quite common, Ms. Geho, and often manageable. We’ll certainly get to the bottom of it today. To start, could you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, no. I feel… fine, really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t these days? I haven’t been feeling sick or anything like that. I walk every day, about three miles, and I eat… reasonably well, I think. Lots of vegetables. Not much fast food. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Geho. It's good to hear you're active and mindful of your diet. Often, high cholesterol doesn’t present with noticeable symptoms, which is why routine screenings are so important. To get a clearer picture, let's delve a little deeper into your medical background. Do you have any history of heart disease in your family – perhaps a parent or sibling who's had a heart attack or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father… he had a heart attack when he was maybe 68, I think. He smoked, though. A lot. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had a stroke about ten years ago. She wasn’t very healthy, if I’m honest. Didn’t take care of herself. So, yes, there’s some of that in the family, I suppose. It’s good to know if that matters, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, Ms. Geho. Family history is a significant factor. Thank you for sharing that. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was… oh, maybe 40? But that was just a surgery. And I get a yearly flu shot, of course. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I see my dentist regularly, too! Does that count?
DOCTOR: That certainly counts, Ms. Geho! Maintaining good dental health is important overall. And having your gallbladder removed doesn't typically relate to cholesterol levels, so that's good to note. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every day. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, if I need it. But that’s it, really. Nothing else. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in letting my body do its own healing, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your proactive approach to your health, Ms. Geho. That’s excellent. And a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen aren’t typically a concern. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I’ve never had any problems with that. I can eat anything, take most anything. I’m pretty lucky, I think. Is that all the questions, Doctor? It feels like a lot!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Geho. And no, those were the main questions. Thank you for your patience and thoroughness. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of your overall health. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I don’t mind at all. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Again… deep breath in… and exhale. Good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 138/82. Slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this time. Finally, I’ll palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly noted. Everything appears within normal limits, Ms. Geho. Now, I have access to your lab results from August 1st. Your total cholesterol is 245 mg/dL, LDL is 160 mg/dL, HDL is 45 mg/dL, and triglycerides are 150 mg/dL. These results confirm elevated LDL cholesterol. Would you like me to explain what those numbers mean?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. I appreciate you going through everything so thoroughly. Those numbers… they all sound very high! I don’t really understand what LDL and HDL are, to be honest. And what does it mean if my triglycerides are high too? It’s all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Geho. It can be confusing, so I’m happy to explain. Think of cholesterol as a type of fat that travels through your bloodstream. There are different types, and they have different jobs. LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, is often called “bad” cholesterol. High levels of LDL can build up in your arteries, forming plaque and increasing your risk of heart disease and stroke. Yours is at 160 mg/dL – we ideally want it below 100 mg/dL. HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, is considered “good” cholesterol. It helps remove LDL from your arteries, so higher levels are better. Yours is at 45 mg/dL – we ideally want it above 60 mg/dL. Triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood. High triglycerides can also contribute to heart disease. Yours is at 150 mg/dL – ideally, we want it below 150 mg/dL, so it’s borderline elevated. So, your LDL is elevated, your HDL is a bit low, and your triglycerides are borderline high. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… clearer, thank you. So, the LDL is the one I need to worry about the most? And the HDL is good, so I want more of that? It sounds like a balancing act, almost. It's good to know what they are, at least. What happens next? Do I need medication? I really don't want to take pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: You’ve described it perfectly, Ms. Geho – it is a balancing act. And yes, the LDL is the primary concern, but improving your HDL and lowering your triglycerides is also important. Now, regarding medication, it’s not necessarily the first step. We can often make significant improvements with lifestyle modifications. I recommend a heart-healthy diet – reducing saturated and trans fats, increasing fiber intake, and incorporating more omega-3 fatty acids. Regular exercise is also crucial – aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. I’d like you to start a food diary for two weeks, documenting everything you eat and drink. We’ll review it together to identify areas for improvement. I also recommend increasing your physical activity gradually. I'd like to recheck your cholesterol levels in three months to see if these changes are effective. If your LDL remains elevated, we can discuss medication options at that time. Would you be agreeable to that approach?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable, Doctor. A food diary, I can do that. And I’ll try to walk a little more each day. I already walk three miles, but maybe I can add some hills or something. Three months… that gives me time to try and get things under control. Do you have any handouts or anything about heart-healthy diets? Or websites you recommend? I like to do my own research, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Geho. Here's a handout outlining a heart-healthy diet, including a list of foods to focus on and foods to limit. And on this card, you’ll find links to the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health websites – both are excellent resources with reliable information. I encourage you to do your research, but please keep in mind that everyone’s situation is unique. It’s best to discuss any significant changes with me before implementing them. So, to summarize, we’ll focus on lifestyle modifications – a heart-healthy diet and increased physical activity. We’ll recheck your cholesterol levels in three months. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very helpful. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing what I need to do. I'll start the food diary right away. And I'll try to get more exercise. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Geho. I’m glad I could help. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. I have confidence that you can achieve your goals. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I look forward to seeing you in three months. Have a wonderful day, and take care.
