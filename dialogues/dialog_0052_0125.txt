DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Belan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's August 2nd, 2025. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, to be honest, my wife thought it was a good idea. I mean, I’m perfectly healthy, but she keeps reading things online… about everything. She suggested I get tested for… you know… the HIV thing. Just to be safe, she said. Honestly, I think it’s a bit much, but here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Belan. It's quite common for spouses to encourage preventative health screenings, and it's good that you’re here to discuss this, even if it wasn’t initially your idea. It’s always better to be informed. To clarify, you're concerned about the possibility of HIV infection, prompted by your wife's concerns. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Concerned is a strong word. Let’s just say I’m humouring her. And yes, that’s right. She keeps going on about… risky behaviour. Honestly, I haven’t done anything risky. I’ve been married for ten years, for goodness sake. But she reads these things… about people not even knowing they have it. It's a bit dramatic, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your wife's concerns stem from general information she's read online regarding HIV transmission and the potential for asymptomatic carriers. It's understandable that you find it a bit unsettling given your long-term, monogamous relationship. To proceed with a comprehensive assessment, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, not much to tell. I get a check-up every couple of years, usually just blood pressure and cholesterol. I had the flu once, badly, about five years ago. That’s it. I’m generally a very healthy person. I eat alright, I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially. I have Medicare, of course, being my age. Is that what you need to know? It feels like a lot of fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Belan. That’s helpful. It's good to hear you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Knowing you have Medicare is also important for billing purposes. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Broken a bone when I was a kid – fell out of a tree, typical boy stuff. But that was… decades ago. And a tonsillectomy, I suppose. When I was little. But that’s it. Honestly, I’m very robust. I work as a Compliance Officer, you know. Lots of stress, but I handle it well. I don’t get sick. It’s a waste of time, if you ask me, worrying about all these things.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Belan. It's excellent that you've been healthy throughout your life. The tonsillectomy is good to note. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any infectious diseases?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother, on my mother's side, had… something with her stomach. Cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago, I wasn’t very close to her. Honestly, we don’t really talk about these things in my family. It’s considered… bad luck, I suppose. My wife is always asking about these things, but I don’t know much. She'd probably know more than I do, to be fair. She’s very thorough, that one. But I doubt there’s anything relevant.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Belan. It's not uncommon for families to avoid discussing medical history. Knowing about your father’s high blood pressure and your grandmother’s potential stomach cancer is helpful, even if the details are limited. To continue, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t believe in taking pills unless absolutely necessary. Maybe some paracetamol if I get a headache, which is rare. And occasionally, a vitamin C tablet if I feel a cold coming on, but that’s it. Honestly, I’m very careful about what I put into my body. I eat a lot of ginger and garlic, that’s my medicine. I don’t trust these pharmaceutical companies, if you ask me. They just want to make money. My wife keeps trying to get me to take something for my cholesterol, but I refuse. I’m perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Belan. It's good you prioritize a natural approach to health. And I understand your skepticism regarding pharmaceutical companies. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I’ve never had an allergic reaction in my life. I can eat anything, go anywhere. I’ve travelled quite a bit, you know, Nepal, India, Thailand… never had a problem. I’m a very hardy person. Honestly, I think all this worrying about allergies is a bit overblown. People used to eat all sorts of things without any trouble. It’s all this modern food processing, if you ask me. Makes people weak and sensitive.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Belan. No known allergies is very helpful to know. Now, to address your wife’s concerns about HIV, I’d like to ask about your sexual history. This is a confidential part of your medical assessment, and I assure you, it will be kept strictly private. Have you ever had any unprotected sexual contact with someone whose HIV status you were unaware of?
PATIENT: Now see, this is what I was afraid of. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’ve been married for ten years! I told you, I haven’t done anything! My wife is really letting her imagination run wild, isn’t she? This is… insulting, frankly. I’m a loyal husband. To even ask me these questions… I think I’m wasting my time here. It's perfectly obvious I don't need this test. I’m healthy. End of story.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Belan, and I sincerely apologize if my questions have caused offense. It was not my intention to imply anything negative about your relationship. As a physician, I have a duty to gather a complete medical history to ensure accurate risk assessment and provide appropriate care. Even in long-term monogamous relationships, it's important to discuss potential risks, however small they may seem. However, I respect your wishes and will not pursue this line of questioning further. Given your strong assertion of consistent monogamy and your overall excellent health, and considering your wife's concerns are the primary driver for this visit, we can proceed with a basic HIV antibody test if you wish, simply to alleviate her anxiety and provide peace of mind. Would you like to proceed with the test, or would you prefer to end the consultation here?
PATIENT: Fine. Just to get her off my back. Yes, let's just do the test. The quicker this is over, the better. Honestly, I'm convinced it's a waste of time and money, but I'm tired of arguing about it. Just… get it done. And please, no more questions about my personal life. It's really quite unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. I understand. We’ll proceed with the HIV antibody test. It involves a simple blood draw, which our nurse, Maria, will perform. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes. While we wait for Maria, I'd like to briefly explain the testing process and what a positive or negative result would mean. A negative result, which is the most likely outcome given your history, would simply confirm you are not infected with HIV. A positive result would require further confirmation and discussion of treatment options. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No. Just… tell me when it’s done. I don't need a lecture on HIV. I understand it's a serious disease, I’m not an idiot. I just want a quick result and to be able to go home. Honestly, this whole thing has been rather stressful. And tell Maria to be gentle with the needle, if you would. I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. I will let Maria know to be gentle with the needle. It’s understandable that you’re feeling stressed, and I assure you we’ll make this as quick and comfortable as possible. Maria, could you please come in and draw blood for Mr. Belan?
