DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this feeling of being full after just a little bit of food. It's been botherin' me for a while now, honestly. Can't seem to eat a proper meal without feelin' stuffed right quick.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds quite uncomfortable, Mr. Obarr. “Feeling full quickly” – can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. Not fun at all. Let me think… it’s not like a pain, exactly. More like… pressure, I guess? And it doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Soup, a sandwich, even just a few bites of fish… doesn't matter. It feels like my stomach's fillin' up way too fast. It started maybe a month or so ago, slow at first, but it’s gettin’ worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure rather than pain, and it’s happening with all types of food. And it’s been progressing over about a month. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting with this, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, nothin' like that. No sickness or throwin' up. Just… full. And it kinda stays with me for a while, even after I stop eatin'. Not bad bad, just… there. Makes it hard to enjoy a meal with my wife, you know? She likes to take her time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating to have this interfere with your enjoyment of meals, especially when sharing them with your wife. And the persistent feeling of fullness is certainly worth investigating. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… hmm. Now you’re askin’ somethin’. Let me think… not really, no. Pretty much the same as always, if you want to know the truth. Regular, you could say. No trouble there, thankfully. I’ve had enough troubles with my stomach as it is.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I haven't been weighin' myself regularly, to be honest. But… now that you mention it, my clothes have been feelin’ a little looser. Just a little, mind you. Not a lot. But I reckon I might’ve lost a pound or two. It could just be the summer heat, though. Hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible slight weight loss. We'll need to keep that in mind. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions that I should be aware of, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Not much, thankfully. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, that was about it. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing serious, never been a big hospital man. Take good care of myself, mostly. My wife always makes sure of that. She's a good woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy in your youth and some age-related vision changes. That's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries other than your appendix removed?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the appendix, that was it. Never had cause for anythin’ else, knock on wood. Always been pretty lucky, health-wise, until this started happenin’ with the fullness, of course. It's just… odd. Doesn't feel right, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's good to know it's been mostly uneventful. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a tough one. My mother lived to be a good old age, but I don't rightly recall her havin' anythin’ major. My father… he had some trouble with his heart in his later years, I believe. And my brother… he had some stomach issues, now that I think about it. But nothin' like this. He just… always had a sensitive stomach, you know? Got heartburn easy. It's hard to say if it's connected. We weren't close, him and I.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some heart trouble with your father and a sensitive stomach in your brother. We'll keep those in mind. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your social history, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean by that, Doctor? You mean… do I go to bingo? I mostly keep to myself these days. Spend time with my wife, read the newspaper, watch a bit of TV. Never been a big drinker, never smoked. Pretty quiet life, all things considered. I used to work with the radio, back in the day, doin' some communication work. But I’m retired now.
DOCTOR: Okay, quiet life, retired, no smoking or excessive alcohol use. That’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a one. Never been much of a pill man, if you get my drift. I believe in lettin’ nature take its course, mostly. A bit of tea when I'm feelin’ under the weather, that's about it. My wife always tells me I should be takin’ somethin’ for my eyesight, but I just can’t stand the thought of relyin’ on pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I know. Not to shellfish, not to bee stings, nothin’. Lucky that way too, I suppose. My wife's the one with the allergies, poor thing. She has to be careful about pollen and such. But me? I can eat just about anything. Though I don’t much want to eat much these days, with this fullness botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Mr. Obarr, that's a very thorough history. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. We’ll start by listening to your abdomen and checking for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. Just hope you don't find anythin' too worryin'. Let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. Okay, Mr. Obarr, I’m not finding any significant tenderness to the touch, and your bowel sounds are present, although they’re a little… quiet. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. I don’t feel any masses or organs that are obviously out of place. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like we need to investigate this fullness further. It could be a number of things, from something relatively benign like slowed gastric emptying to something that requires a little more attention. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel, to start. I’d also like to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your stomach, gallbladder, and other organs. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Sounds… thorough, Doctor. Blood work and an ultrasound. Alright, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. Just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? Makes it hard to enjoy life when you're worryin' about what you can eat and what you can't. When can I get these done? And… will it be expensive? I'm not insured, so...
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Obarr. We’ll do our best to keep things as affordable as possible. I’ll have the receptionist check on the cost for you before we proceed, and we can discuss options if needed. As for when we can get these done, the lab is just down the hall, so we can do the blood work right away. The ultrasound will need to be scheduled, but we can usually get you in within a few days. I'll have my assistant schedule that for you as well. In the meantime, try to eat smaller, more frequent meals, and avoid foods that seem to trigger your fullness. And if you experience any new symptoms – such as nausea, vomiting, fever, or severe abdominal pain – please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. Smaller meals, avoid trigger foods. I can manage that. And I will call if anythin’ gets worse. I appreciate you lookin’ after me, Doctor. And checkin’ on the cost, that’s mighty kind of you. I reckon it's good to get things sorted out. Just… hope it’s nothin’ too serious. When should I expect to hear back about the test results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this together. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back, and the ultrasound report usually takes a day or two after the scan. My assistant will call you as soon as we have the results, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again for listenin’ and takin’ the time. I appreciate it. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. That's what I'm hopin’ for.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It was my pleasure. My assistant will be in shortly to schedule your ultrasound and answer any remaining questions you may have. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
