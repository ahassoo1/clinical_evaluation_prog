DOCTOR: Hi Carla, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It's driving me a little crazy, to be honest. Not all over, but mostly on my arms and my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, itchy skin… that can definitely be disruptive. And you said mostly on your arms and back?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. My legs are okay, and my stomach hasn't bothered me. It started maybe a week or so ago? It’s hard to say exactly, things just…started feeling a little off and then got itchier.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not really. I haven't started using any new soaps or lotions, and I haven't been traveling. Oh! Well, my grandson visited last week, and he brought me some mangoes from his garden. I ate a few... could that be it? I don't usually eat a lot of mangoes.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Carla. Mangoes can cause a contact dermatitis in some people, especially if you’re not used to them. It's worth considering. But let's get a bit more detail, just to be thorough. Is the itch constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. It's not always itchy, thank goodness. It’s worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. And it’s not like a painful itch, just… really annoying and makes me want to scratch all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse at night, and more of an annoyance than pain. Do you notice any rash accompanying the itch?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, a little. It's not big or anything, and it’s not raised, but there are some little red bumps where I’ve been scratching. Mostly on my upper arms, I think. Not a lot, but they’re there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Those look consistent with excoriations from scratching. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history, just to make sure there’s nothing else going on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. Not to any medications, I don’t think. And like I said, I haven’t changed anything I’m using. I used to have a little bit of a reaction to certain perfumes, but I stopped using those years ago. No food allergies that I know of, except maybe… I don’t handle shellfish very well, but that’s more of a stomach thing than a skin thing, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no major allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. It's called… hmm, let me see if I can remember the name. Ibuprofen, mostly. But I don’t take it every day, just when my joints are really bothering me. And sometimes a little Tylenol for headaches.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen and Tylenol as needed. Now, have you had any other skin problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had eczema when I was a little girl, but that cleared up a long, long time ago. And I get a little dry skin in the winter, but nothing major. Mostly just use lotion.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had sensitive skin, she always used a lot of creams. And my aunt, on my father’s side, she had some sort of rash when she was younger, but I don’t remember exactly what it was. Nothing too serious, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What do you need to know? I live alone, since my divorce many years ago. I keep busy, mostly with my church and spending time with my grandchildren. I don't smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, you live alone, active in your church, see your grandchildren, no smoking, occasional glass of wine. Now, let's take a look at your skin more closely. The rash is fairly mild, mostly small red bumps and some excoriations from scratching. It’s mostly concentrated on your upper arms and back, as you mentioned. Given your history and the examination, it’s most likely a mild contact dermatitis, possibly triggered by the mangoes. However, we should rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a basic skin scraping to check for fungal infection, just to be sure. It's a quick and painless procedure. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A scraping, you say? As long as it doesn't hurt, that's fine. I’m just glad it's probably not something serious. Those mangoes were delicious, though!
DOCTOR: Okay. Great. It’ll just involve gently scraping a tiny sample of skin from the affected area. It might feel a little like a light scratch, but it shouldn’t be painful. It’ll only take a few minutes. While I do that, I'll also check your vital signs. After we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. Do you have any questions before I begin?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Sounds perfectly alright to me, Doctor. Go ahead, when you’re ready. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s done. It'll take a few minutes to examine the sample under the microscope. While we wait, let’s talk about some things you can do at home to relieve the itch. Avoid scratching as much as possible – that’s the hardest part, I know. Cool compresses can help soothe the skin, and I recommend an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to reduce inflammation.
PATIENT: Oh, I know scratching makes it worse, it's just so tempting! Cool compresses, okay, I can do that. And hydrocortisone cream… is that the one for bug bites?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the one. It helps calm the inflammation and relieve the itch. It’s available at any drugstore. Okay, the results are back… and it doesn’t show any evidence of fungal infection. That's good. So, it’s even more likely to be a contact dermatitis. I recommend continuing the cool compresses and hydrocortisone cream. Also, avoid eating mangoes for a while to see if that helps. If the itch doesn’t improve within a week, or if it gets worse, please come back and see me, and we can consider other options, like a stronger topical steroid. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. No mangoes for a while, okay. I can do that. It’s probably worth it to get some relief. Thank you for your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. I'm glad we could figure out a plan. And just to be clear, if you develop any signs of infection – like pus, fever, or increased pain – please seek medical attention immediately. I'll write you a brief summary of our discussion and recommendations, and a note for your primary care physician. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough and kind, Doctor. Thank you again. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Carla. It was my pleasure. I hope you feel better soon! And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Here's that summary. Have a good day.
