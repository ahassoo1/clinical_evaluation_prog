DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Denis. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor Renzi. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Well, I received some results back from a test… a test of my insides, if you will, and the doctor who ordered it suggested I come speak with someone about them. He said something about it being… abnormal. I must admit, I wasn’t entirely certain what that meant, and I’d appreciate it if you could explain it to me in simpler terms.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Abnormal can certainly sound worrying. Let's see… Dr. Alvarez sent these over, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Doctor Alvarez is my primary care physician. A very kind man. He's been looking after me since… well, since my husband passed, actually. He was the one who ordered the GI endoscopy, and then sent these results to you. I believe he suspected something wasn't quite right with my stomach, but I don’t recall the specifics. Would you mind telling me what exactly the test was looking for? Perhaps that will jog my memory.
DOCTOR: Of course. A GI endoscopy… right. That’s a procedure where they use a thin, flexible tube with a camera on it to look inside your esophagus, stomach, and the first part of your small intestine. Dr. Alvarez likely ordered it to investigate… well, often it's to look for the cause of things like persistent indigestion, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, or bleeding. He suspected something was going on, yes. Now, the results… let me pull those up here. It says here there were some… polyps found during the endoscopy. Have you heard of those before?
PATIENT: Polyps… the name sounds vaguely familiar. I believe Doctor Alvarez mentioned something about growths, but honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Are they… dangerous, Doctor? Should I be concerned? I confess, I’ve been a bit anxious since receiving the letter. It’s just… my health hasn’t been the best lately, and this feels like another worry to add to the list. Though, to be frank, I’ve always been a bit of a worrier. It's an old woman's habit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Denis. Receiving results like this can be unsettling. And you’re right to ask about whether they’re dangerous. Polyps are growths that form on the lining of the colon or, in your case, the stomach. Most of the time, they aren’t cancerous, thankfully. But some can be precancerous, meaning they have the potential to turn into cancer over time. That’s why it’s important to investigate them further. The good news is, we can usually remove them during a procedure called a polypectomy. And then we send the removed tissue to a lab to be examined under a microscope to see if there are any cancerous cells present. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. A polypectomy… removing them sounds… sensible. I suppose it’s better to be proactive and take care of things before they become… more serious. So, what happens next? Will I need another procedure soon? And… forgive me for asking, but how much would something like that cost? I… I don’t have insurance, and my pension doesn’t stretch very far. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, trying to manage everything on my own these days.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the cost, Denis, and it’s completely understandable to be concerned. We’ll definitely talk about that. As for what happens next, yes, a polypectomy is usually the recommended course of action. It's a relatively quick procedure, usually done with sedation, so you'd be comfortable during it. The gastroenterologist would use a scope similar to the one used for the endoscopy to remove the polyps. I’m going to recommend a consultation with Dr. Ramirez, a gastroenterologist at City General. He's excellent, and he can discuss the procedure in detail, answer your questions, and assess the size and location of the polyps to determine the best approach. Before you see Dr. Ramirez, I'd like to get a more complete picture of your medical history. Could you tell me a bit about any other health issues you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’d be happy to. Let me see… well, I’ve always had a bit of trouble with my digestion, even when I was younger. Lots of heartburn, bloating… nothing too serious, usually managed with some over-the-counter remedies. But it’s gotten worse in the last few years, especially after my husband passed. Stress, I suppose. I also had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. And… oh, yes, I was diagnosed with mild arthritis a few years back. It mostly affects my hands, makes it difficult to do some of the crafts I used to enjoy. Metalwork, mostly. I used to make beautiful jewelry, but it's become quite painful. Other than that… I haven’t had any major illnesses, to my knowledge. I’ve always been quite careful about my health, trying to eat well and stay active. Though, as I said, things have been a bit more difficult lately. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? Perhaps you have a form I can fill out?
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful, Denis. Thank you. Yes, this form will just help me organize everything. It asks about past surgeries, medications, allergies, and family history. Take your time, and if you're unsure about anything, just ask. You mentioned arthritis and gallbladder removal – good to know. And metalwork... that sounds lovely. It's important to note hobbies like that, especially if they might affect your hand strength or overall well-being. While you're filling that out, I'm going to quickly review your chart for any existing records. It'll also help me get a better idea of your current medications and any previous tests you've had.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’ll do my best to be thorough. It might take me a few minutes, as my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. And honestly, keeping track of everything has become quite a chore since… well, since my husband passed. He always took care of the paperwork. Do let me know if anything seems unclear, though. I wouldn’t want to provide incorrect information. It’s important to be accurate, isn’t it? Especially when it comes to health matters.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Denis. Accuracy is key. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if anything is confusing or difficult. That’s what I’m here for. Take all the time you need. And it’s perfectly understandable that keeping track of things has been more difficult since your husband passed. It takes time to adjust to new routines, and it's alright to ask for help when you need it. Don't feel pressured to rush.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you to say. It is difficult, adjusting to everything. He was always so organized, so meticulous. I miss him terribly. But, I suppose one has to keep going, doesn’t one? Here you are, Doctor. I believe that's everything. Please let me know if you need any further information.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Denis. This is very helpful. It seems you’re not currently taking any medications, which is good. No known allergies – excellent. And I see your father had some history of heart disease, and your mother had arthritis… that’s useful information. So, to summarize, we've got these polyps found during the endoscopy. We're going to recommend a consultation with Dr. Ramirez, a gastroenterologist, to discuss a polypectomy. He’ll be able to assess the situation and determine the best course of action. Before you leave today, I want to make sure you understand the importance of follow-up care. It’s crucial to see Dr. Ramirez as soon as possible, and to let me know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or unexplained weight loss. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A consultation with Dr. Ramirez… I’ll certainly make an appointment as soon as possible. And I understand the importance of follow-up care, of course. Actually, yes, I do have one question. You mentioned the possibility of cancer… is that a likely outcome, in your opinion? I understand it's impossible to say for certain, but… it's been weighing on my mind, I confess. I’ve lost several friends to cancer in recent years, and… well, it’s a frightening thought. And… what if the procedure… what if something goes wrong during the polypectomy? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m a bit anxious, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid question, Denis, and I’m glad you asked. It's completely natural to be anxious about these things. Let’s address the possibility of cancer first. The majority of polyps are not cancerous. However, some have the potential to become cancerous over time, which is why they need to be removed and examined. Dr. Ramirez will be able to assess the size, shape, and location of the polyps to determine the risk. He’ll also take a biopsy during the polypectomy to look for any cancerous cells. As for the procedure itself, polypectomies are generally very safe. Dr. Ramirez is an experienced gastroenterologist, and he takes all the necessary precautions to minimize the risk of complications. The most common complications are minor, such as bleeding or discomfort. Serious complications are rare. I understand that you've lost friends to cancer, and that makes this even more frightening. But please remember that every case is different. We’re going to take all the necessary steps to ensure your safety and well-being. And I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other concerns I can address?
PATIENT: That is… very reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. Knowing that Dr. Ramirez is experienced, and that the procedure is generally safe… that does ease my mind somewhat. And your support… it means a lot. No, I believe that answers all of my questions, for now. I suppose I should schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez, then. Do you have a contact number or website for his office? Or perhaps someone here can assist me with scheduling? I appreciate your patience and kindness, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, and I feel much better informed now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. I'm glad I could help. Here is Dr. Ramirez's contact information. His office is located at City General Hospital, and you can reach them at 555-123-4567. They also have a website at [fictional website address]. The receptionist can assist you with scheduling an appointment. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any further questions or concerns before your appointment. We're here to support you. Before you leave, I'm going to have the nurse give you a summary of our conversation and a list of resources for cancer support, just in case. Do you have any trouble getting around?
PATIENT: That's very kind of you, Doctor. I appreciate the resources, and the offer of assistance. No, I manage alright getting around, thank you. I still drive, though not as much as I used to. I believe that’s everything, then. I’m very grateful for your time and attention. You’ve put my mind at ease, and I feel much more prepared now. Thank you again, Doctor Renzi. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a good day as well, and I wish you all the best with your appointment with Dr. Ramirez. .
