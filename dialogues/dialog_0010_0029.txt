DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit… strange, really. I just don't seem to be able to eat much these days. I get full awful quick, even if it's just a little bit of food. It's been happening for a while now, maybe a month or so. It's not painful or anything, just… unsatisfying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Loss of appetite and feeling full quickly… that’s certainly something we should look into. A month is a good amount of time to notice a change. To get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about what you've been trying to eat?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, usually I have oatmeal for breakfast, just a small bowl. But even that, I can only manage half of it now before I feel stuffed. Lunch is usually a sandwich, maybe some soup, but I've been leaving a lot on the plate lately. And supper... well, my wife, Elsie, makes a lovely salmon sometimes, but even a small piece is too much. It’s everything, really. Not just one thing. I used to have a good appetite, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s not specific to any particular food, which is helpful to know. And it sounds like it’s gradually gotten worse over the past month. Have you noticed any other changes along with this – any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain, for instance?
PATIENT: No, not really. No sickness at all, thankfully. My… well, my regularity’s been fine, if you don’t mind me saying so. And no pain, not a bit. Just… full. Too quickly full. It's just… frustrating, you know? Elsie worries about me not getting enough to eat. I’m a bit worried myself, to be honest, but I don't want to cause a fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good you’re not experiencing any pain or nausea, and it’s perfectly normal to be concerned when your appetite changes. And it’s very thoughtful of you to mention your wife’s worries. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And the doctor said I had a touch of arthritis in my hands a few years back, but it doesn’t bother me much. Just a little stiffness in the mornings. Apart from that, I’ve been pretty lucky, I suppose. Nothing major, ever. And I don’t take any regular medications, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendix removal in your youth and some arthritis in your hands, but otherwise you’ve been quite healthy. No medications currently. And have you had any surgeries other than your appendix?
PATIENT: No, just the appendix. Never needed anything else, thankfully. Elsie always said I was too stubborn to let a doctor near me! She's probably right. I try to stay active, you know? Walk the beach most days, weather permitting. It keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Good, staying active is excellent. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family... Well, my Elsie and I have been married for 62 years now. We have two grown children, a boy and a girl. They both live in Vancouver, busy with their own lives. And five grandchildren, all wonderful kids. My mother… she lived a long life, passed away in her nineties. My father… he had a bit of trouble with his stomach when he was older, but I don't know exactly what was wrong with him. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life, Doctor. Elsie wouldn’t allow it! She always said they were a terrible habit, and she’s a very persuasive woman. I do enjoy a little bit of beer with supper sometimes, though. A couple of glasses, nothing excessive. And I used to fish a lot more, but my old boat… well, she’s seen better days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, a couple of beers with dinner. Good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you allergic to anything – medications, foods, insects, anything at all?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Elsie's always giving me new foods to try, and I haven't had any trouble with anything yet. A few mosquito bites in the summer, of course, but who doesn't? Never had a bad reaction to any medicine either. I’ve been lucky, like I said. Very lucky.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking a few reflexes. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind at all. I've had doctors poke and prod me before, it's all part of getting old, I suppose. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Obarr… and exhale. Good. Now another deep breath… and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Nope, not a bit. Feels the same as always, I suppose. A little… soft, maybe? Elsie always says I need to watch my weight. But it doesn't hurt or anything. Just feels normal, really. Although, now that you mention it, sometimes I feel a bit… bloated, after I eat even a small amount. But it goes away after a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, a bit of bloating after meals. And no pain with this?
PATIENT: No, not pain. Just… fullness. Like I said, it doesn't last long. It's just… uncomfortable for a bit, then it goes away. It's hard to explain. Like a balloon, maybe? Inflating a little bit, then settling down. But it happens even with a small meal. Elsie is starting to worry, you know? She keeps trying to feed me little bits all day. It's sweet, but… I just wish I knew what was going on.
DOCTOR: I understand. Bloating without pain, and it happens even with small meals. Alright, Your abdomen is soft, no masses or tenderness. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes quickly. Everything seems normal there as well. Based on what you've told me and the exam, there are a few possibilities. It could be something as simple as changes in digestion with age, or it could be something more. To rule out anything serious, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These will check your thyroid function, liver and kidney function, and look for any signs of inflammation. I'd also like to order a stool test to check for any hidden blood or infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible, Doctor. If it can help figure out what’s going on, then yes, that’s fine. Blood tests and… a stool test. Never thought I’d be talking about that with a doctor. But if that's what you think is best, then go ahead. When will I know the results? Elsie is going to want to know as soon as possible, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your wife is concerned. We'll get these tests done as quickly as possible. The lab usually takes about 3-5 business days to return the results. I'll have the nurse call you as soon as we have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Try to avoid anything overly fatty or greasy, as that can sometimes worsen bloating. And try to stay hydrated. I'm also going to give you a referral to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health. It's always good to have a specialist’s opinion, even if everything turns out to be normal. They can do further testing if needed. Does that sound like a reasonable plan, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. And yes, it sounds good. Smaller meals, stay hydrated, and see a specialist. Elsie will be relieved to hear we’re doing something. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to me and not just dismissing it as old age. So, the nurse will call me with the results… about a week, then? And she'll arrange the appointment with this… gastroenterologist? It’s a lot to take in, but I feel better knowing we’re trying to figure it out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I'm glad I could help. Yes, the nurse will call you within 3-5 business days with the results. She'll also be happy to schedule an appointment with the gastroenterologist for you. It's often best to get a specialist’s opinion, even if things turn out to be minor. I'm writing up a summary of our conversation, the test orders, and the referral information now. I’ll also include some general advice on managing bloating and loss of appetite. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've covered everything. I appreciate your patience and kindness. Elsie will be so pleased. Just… thank you. I suppose I should be getting home, let her know I'm alright.
