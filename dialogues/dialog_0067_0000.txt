DOCTOR: Good morning, Sharifa. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…fine. Honestly, I don’t usually bother with doctors unless something’s really wrong, and this is…inconvenient, to say the least. I had a bad cold last week, just a normal one, and now my legs feel like jelly. Both of them. It started yesterday, and it hasn’t gotten any better. It’s just…weakness, I guess. Hard to explain. Makes getting around a bit of a nuisance, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds frustrating to have weakness develop after a cold. We'll definitely try to figure out what's going on. Just to be clear, you had a cold last week – typical cold symptoms, like runny nose, cough, maybe a sore throat?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Runny nose, awful cough, the whole thing. Achy, you know? Nothing major, I thought. I just bundled up, drank a lot of tea, and tried to ignore it. I didn’t bother with over-the-counter stuff, those things never really work anyway. And then, yesterday, I just noticed…well, my legs just felt…gone. Like I’d been walking for miles and miles. It’s not painful, just…unreliable. I nearly stumbled getting out of the chair this morning. It's a bit alarming, honestly.
DOCTOR: I see. So the weakness developed after the cold symptoms started to subside?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. The cold was mostly gone by Sunday, just a little stuffy nose, really. And then yesterday, boom. Weak legs. It wasn’t gradual, it just…happened. I really don’t have time for this, you know? I have tours scheduled, people are relying on me. I can't just cancel everything because my legs decided to take a vacation. It's just...bad timing, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know – a fairly sudden onset after the cold resolved. And you mentioned you give tours – is that a physically demanding job?
PATIENT: Physically demanding? Well, it can be. It’s mostly walking, standing, pointing things out, keeping people together. Sometimes it’s uneven ground, cobblestone streets, a few hills. It’s not like I’m scaling mountains, but it requires being on your feet for hours. I’m usually quite fit, to be honest. That’s why this is so strange. I'm not normally one to complain about being tired, but this isn't tired, it's…like they're not mine anymore. It's quite disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, have you had any fever, chills, any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet, or any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. Definitely no numbness or tingling, just weakness. It feels like…like trying to walk through thick mud. And no, nothing has changed with…well, you know. Everything's perfectly normal down there. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for dwelling on these things. I just want to know what’s wrong with my legs so I can get back to work. This is costing me money, you understand? I have a reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about getting back to work and maintaining your reputation, Sharifa. We’ll do our best to figure this out. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, arthritis, or any neurological problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been healthy, remarkably so, if I may say so myself. My mother always said I had strong bones. Medicare covers my check-ups, of course, but those are always perfectly normal. Blood pressure's fine, cholesterol's good, everything's always…textbook. I don't take any regular medication, either. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed. This is…completely out of the blue. It’s rather unsettling, frankly. I really don't appreciate surprises, and this is certainly a nasty one.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No prior medical problems and you don’t take any regular medications. And you said you've had regular checkups with normal results. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been very careful, and thankfully, never needed anything like that. I avoid hospitals whenever possible. They’re…germ factories, aren’t they? And I simply don't like being poked and prodded. My mother always said it weakened your spirit. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to think this is just some strange after-effect of the cold. Perhaps I just need to rest? Though, as I mentioned, I really don't have time for that. Perhaps a strong cup of tea and a good lie down would be sufficient. But if that doesn't work, I suppose I'll have to endure whatever tests you deem necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And you've had regular check-ups with normal results. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 92, remarkably healthy all her life, but she did have…arthritis, I suppose, in her later years. A bit of stiffness in her hands, nothing serious. And my father…he had heart trouble, eventually. Needed a pacemaker, I believe. He wasn’t one for talking about his health, always thought it was a sign of weakness. As for neurological problems…not that I’m aware of. No one in the family was ever…eccentric, if you catch my drift. Mostly just sturdy, practical people. This weakness is really quite…an anomaly, wouldn’t you agree? It simply doesn’t fit the pattern.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother and heart trouble in your father. And you’ve said you don’t have any allergies, is that correct?
PATIENT: Correct. No allergies whatsoever. I can eat anything, touch anything, breathe anything. I've always been remarkably robust, as I've mentioned. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to suspect that this weakness is…psychological. Perhaps I’m simply stressed about my tours, and it’s manifesting physically? I do have a lot on my plate, keeping everything organized, making sure my clients are happy… It’s a demanding job, as you know. Perhaps a vacation is what I truly need, not a battery of tests. Though I certainly can’t afford that right now.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies. It’s good you’re thinking through potential causes. While stress can certainly contribute to physical symptoms, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, especially with a sudden onset of weakness like you described. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Tests. I was hoping to avoid that. I suppose… I suppose it's unavoidable, isn’t it? Very well. But please, be gentle. And don’t take too long, I have a schedule to maintain, even with my…affliction. Just get it over with quickly, and tell me what you think. I really haven’t the patience for drawn-out procedures. And please explain everything in plain English, I don’t understand all that medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sharifa. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I’ll explain everything clearly. We’ll start with your reflexes. Please relax and let your legs dangle freely. Okay. And now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you please push your feet against my hands like you're trying to push something away?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this feels rather…demeaning. But very well. There. Is that sufficient? It’s…not as easy as it looks, you know. My legs really are quite unreliable. It feels like there's no…power behind the push. More like…wiggling, than pushing. And frankly, this is rather unsettling. I’m starting to feel quite anxious now. Is something terribly wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And now, I'm going to check your sensation. I'm going to lightly touch different parts of your legs with this cotton ball. Just tell me when you feel it. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel it. Perfectly normal sensation. I haven’t lost all feeling in my legs, you know. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to suspect this is all a waste of time. I can feel things, I just can’t…do things with them. It’s a very frustrating distinction. Perhaps a strong cup of tea and a good lie-down would be the best course of action. You're poking and prodding, and I’m no closer to understanding what's wrong. Are you sure you can’t just prescribe something? A muscle relaxant, perhaps? Or…something? I really haven’t the time for lengthy investigations.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your sensation is indeed normal, and the reflexes are diminished, but present. The strength is reduced in both legs. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing this. Given the sudden onset after a cold, and the weakness without other neurological symptoms like numbness or tingling, a few possibilities come to mind. One potential cause could be post-viral weakness – sometimes a virus can temporarily affect the nerves and muscles. Another possibility could be a nutritional deficiency, although you haven’t mentioned any changes in your diet. To rule out other causes and get a clearer picture, I would recommend some blood tests. We can check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, and rule out any inflammatory conditions. I also think an MRI of your spinal cord would be helpful to evaluate the nerves. Would you be open to those tests?
PATIENT: An MRI? Blood tests? Honestly, Doctor, this is precisely what I was hoping to avoid. It sounds…expensive. And time-consuming. And frankly, rather frightening. I’ve never had an MRI before. Are you sure it’s necessary? Can’t we just…try something else first? Perhaps a course of physical therapy? Or…a strong vitamin supplement? I really don’t want to be subjected to all those…machines and needles and whatnot. This is all becoming terribly inconvenient. Perhaps I’m simply overdoing it with the tours. Perhaps I should just…retire. Though I certainly can’t afford to retire. Honestly, Doctor, I’m at a loss. I just want my legs to work again. Is there anything else we can try?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sharifa. An MRI and blood tests are not things anyone looks forward to. However, given that we don’t have a clear diagnosis yet, they’re the best way to rule out serious causes and get to the bottom of this. I want to assure you that the MRI is a painless procedure. You’ll lie on a table, and a machine will take images of your spinal cord. It’s a bit noisy, but it doesn't hurt. While physical therapy and vitamins can be helpful, they won't address the underlying cause if there is one. If you’re hesitant about both tests right away, we could start with the blood tests. They’re less invasive and can give us some valuable information. If the results are normal, then we can discuss the MRI further. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Very well. Blood tests. Just blood tests, for now. But I want you to explain the entire process to me in excruciating detail. What will they be testing for? How much blood will they take? Where will they take it? And how long will it take to get the results? I need to know everything, Doctor. Everything. And I expect a clear, concise explanation. No medical jargon, please. I'm not a doctor, you know. I simply want my legs to work again, and I’m willing to endure a few needles if it means getting closer to that goal. But I want this done quickly and efficiently, and I expect a full explanation of the results. And if the results are normal, I’m not subjecting myself to any MRI machines. Do we have an understanding?
DOCTOR: Yes, we absolutely have an understanding, Sharifa. I’ll explain everything in detail, and we'll take things one step at a time. The blood tests will check for a few different things. We'll check your complete blood count to look for signs of infection or inflammation. We’ll also check your vitamin levels, particularly vitamin B12 and vitamin D, as deficiencies can sometimes cause weakness. We'll also check your electrolytes, like potassium and sodium, and kidney function, to rule out any imbalances. The phlebotomist—that’s the person who draws the blood—will take a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm, usually. It usually takes just a few minutes. You might feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. The results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll review them together, and I’ll explain what they mean in plain English. And as you requested, we won’t discuss an MRI until we’ve thoroughly reviewed the blood test results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable. For now. But I expect prompt results, Doctor. And I expect a thorough explanation. And if the results are inconclusive, I'm blaming you. Honestly, this is all rather…stressful. Very well. Let's get it over with. Where do I go? And what do I need to bring? I don't want to be running back and forth unnecessarily. And please, make sure they’re gentle. I have a reputation to maintain, you know. I can’t be walking around with a bruised arm.
DOCTOR: Here is the address and phone number for the lab. You don’t need to bring anything with you, just your insurance card and a photo ID. The lab is just down the street, about a 5-minute drive from here. They are very experienced and gentle, and they will take good care of you. If you have any concerns while you’re there, don’t hesitate to let them know. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, once the results are back. We’ll discuss them then and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, try to rest your legs as much as possible and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Rest? Strenuous activity? Honestly, Doctor, that's hardly helpful advice. But very well. No, I don’t think so. Just…please, make sure those results come back quickly. And if they’re inconclusive, I’m demanding a second opinion. I have a schedule to maintain, you know. And I can’t afford to be sidelined indefinitely. Very well. Thank you. I suppose. I’ll see you in a week. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Sharifa. We’ll do our best to get you answers as quickly as possible. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try to take it easy. .
