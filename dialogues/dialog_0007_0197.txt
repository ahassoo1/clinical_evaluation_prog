DOCTOR: Hi San, welcome to San SCIARROTTA clinic. I'm Dr. Valerie Hernandez. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. You know, like Uber or… those taxis. I just want to make sure I’m allowed to do it, legally. I don’t want any trouble with the law, and I’d like to get this done quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need a medical certificate to drive for ride-sharing services like Uber. That's perfectly reasonable. It's good you're being proactive about it. To make sure I get everything right, let's go through a quick check-up and some questions. It's fairly standard, and we'll see if you meet the requirements. First, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Overall health… hmm. Well, I’m 70, so things aren’t perfect, you know? I have a little bit of trouble with my knees sometimes, and my back aches if I stand too long. But I get around okay. I walk every day, try to, anyway. I had a divorce a while back, so I mostly keep to myself these days. I’m on Medicare, if that matters. I think that’s the biggest stuff. I don't really go to the doctor much unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Knee and back pain, walking daily, and Medicare – good to know. It does matter, as it can give us some background information. Just to clarify, when you say knee and back pain, is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It’s worse when the weather is bad, you know? Damp weather really gets to my joints. And if I overdo it with the walking, it'll bother me for a day or two. But it’s not… crippling, or anything. I can still manage. I just have to listen to my body, that’s all. I’ve lived a long life, so a few aches and pains are to be expected, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. So, it’s more of a discomfort that fluctuates with activity and the weather. Okay. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe 20 years now? And I was told I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but I don't take any medicine for it. The doctor said it wasn’t bad enough to worry about, just to watch my salt intake. Oh, and my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, of course. I wear glasses. But other than that… I don't think so. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal years ago, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure without medication, and you wear glasses. That’s good information. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I used to have a lot of trouble with pollen when I was younger, but that’s gotten better with age, thankfully. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything at all, really. I'm pretty simple, you know? Don't take much, don't need much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a calcium supplement sometimes, for my bones, but that’s it. And maybe an aspirin now and then if I have a headache, but very rarely. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly. I don’t like the way they make me feel. I prefer to just rest if I’m not feeling well. That usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a calcium supplement occasionally and aspirin very rarely. That’s helpful to know. Alright, San. To get a better picture of your overall health for this certificate, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, heart, lungs, and a look at your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a few errands to run this afternoon, so I'd like to get this over with quickly if possible. But yes, go ahead. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s start with your blood pressure. If you could just sit here and relax for a moment, that would be perfect. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 140 over 85. It's not drastically high, but it's worth noting. We'll need to factor this into our assessment. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Is that bad? I don't usually go to the doctor, so I don't know what's good or bad. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables… I haven’t been overly stressed lately. Maybe it’s just nerves being here? I do get a little anxious at the doctor’s office, to be honest. Just breathe, I tell myself. Just breathe.
DOCTOR: It's okay to be anxious, San. Doctor's offices can be stressful. It's possible that being here is contributing to a slightly higher reading. Your heart sounds good – regular rhythm, no unusual noises. And your lungs are clear. Now, let's just check your reflexes. This will just involve a quick tap on your knee. Ready?
PATIENT: Alright. Just a quick tap, you said? Yes, go ahead. I hope I don’t flinch. I always feel silly doing these tests.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but still present. That’s not necessarily a cause for concern, especially at your age. It could just be normal age-related changes. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright. There. Is that alright? I try to be careful, you know? I don't want to fall. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine, San. It's good you're being cautious. Your gait is a little slow and wide-based, but stable. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Thank you. So, to summarize, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, your reflexes are a little diminished, and your gait is a bit slow, but overall, you’re stable. Given your history and these findings, it's a bit complicated. The certificate requires a certain level of health to ensure safe driving.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Complicated? What does that mean? Will I be able to get the card or not? I really need to be able to drive. It would make things so much easier for me. I don't want to cause trouble, I just want to be able to do things on my own. Is there anything I can do to fix it? Should I get more tests? Tell me straight, Doctor. I don't like beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: You're right, you deserve a straight answer. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes, I'm hesitant to issue the medical certificate immediately. It's not a definitive 'no', but it requires further evaluation. To be safe, and to ensure you meet the requirements, I recommend a visit with a cardiologist to assess your blood pressure more thoroughly. They may want to do an EKG and potentially a 24-hour blood pressure monitor. Also, a neurological consult might be helpful to evaluate your reflexes and gait in more detail. They can determine if there’s anything underlying causing the diminished reflexes. It's possible that with proper management of your blood pressure and a neurological evaluation, you will be able to get the certificate. But we need to rule out any underlying issues first. I don’t want to put your safety, or the safety of others, at risk. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds like a lot. A cardiologist and a neurologist? That’s… a lot of appointments. And I don't want to spend a fortune on tests, you know? Medicare covers some things, but not everything. Is it… serious? Is something really wrong with me? I just want to drive, Doctor. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. I just thought a simple check-up would be enough. Are there any… alternatives? Is there anything else I can do besides see all those specialists?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, San. It does sound like a lot, and I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it was necessary. It’s not necessarily that something is “wrong” with you, it’s more about ensuring you meet the safety standards for commercial driving. Let’s talk about alternatives. We could try a trial period of blood pressure monitoring at home, and you could continue to focus on a healthy diet and regular exercise. If your blood pressure consistently remains within a safe range, that could improve your chances. However, the diminished reflexes are still a concern, and a neurological evaluation is the best way to address that. Another possibility – and this is something you'd have to discuss with the ride-sharing company – is to see if they have any restrictions for drivers with certain medical conditions. Perhaps they allow drivers to operate with some limitations. Here, let me give you a list of cardiologists and neurologists in the area who accept Medicare. I'll also provide you with some resources on home blood pressure monitoring. It’s ultimately your decision, San, and I want to support you in whatever you choose. I can write a note to your primary care physician explaining my findings, if that would be helpful.
PATIENT: Okay. A note to my primary care doctor… that sounds good. And the list of doctors… yes, please. I suppose I should call them and see who takes Medicare. It's just… a lot to deal with. I think… I think I’ll try the home blood pressure monitoring first. And maybe call a neurologist and see what they say. But I’m not promising anything, you know? I just want to see what my options are. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for the list of doctors. That will be very helpful. I think that’s all for now. If you don't mind, I'd like to take this list and think it over. I don't want to rush into anything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I completely understand wanting to take your time and consider your options. It’s important to make the right decision for yourself. Here’s the list and the pamphlet. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or need further assistance. We’re here to help. Take care, San. And please, let us know how things go. Don’t be a stranger.
