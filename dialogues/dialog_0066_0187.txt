DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… chest hurt. And heart… flutters. Old man problems, you know? Doctor, I don't have all day. Just tell me what's wrong, quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're experiencing chest pain and heart palpitations. We'll try to be as efficient as possible, but it’s important to get a good understanding of what's going on to make sure we address everything properly. When did this chest pain start?
PATIENT: Start? Hmm… a few days, maybe? Not important. It comes and goes. Like a little… pinching. Not big pain. But the heart… that worries me more. Always feels like it’s gonna jump out. You know, I used to be strong. Now… old.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few days of intermittent chest pain that feels like a pinching sensation. And the palpitations are your biggest concern. I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about when these palpitations happen?
PATIENT: When? Anytime! Walking, sitting, even when I’m… resting. Doesn’t matter. It’s just… random. Makes me nervous. My wife says I get all red in the face. She worries too much, that woman. But still… heart shouldn't do that. You check it, right? With the… machine? Get this over with.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We'll definitely check your heart. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, then we can do an EKG—that’s the machine you’re referring to—to get a better look at the electrical activity of your heart. Before we do that, just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you ever had chest pain like this before?
PATIENT: No. Never like this. I had… something once. Long time ago. When I was young, fighting in the war. But different. This is… old man thing. Not war thing. Just… weak heart now. You think it's bad? Don't tell me I need surgery, okay? I don't want surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new type of chest pain for you, and it's different from anything you experienced in the past. And you’re understandably concerned about the possibility of needing surgery. I want to reassure you that we’ll gather all the information first before discussing any treatment options. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain and palpitations?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… sometimes I get… short of breath. When I walk up the stairs. Not so good anymore, those stairs. And… a little dizzy. Maybe. My wife says I’m more forgetful. But she always says that. Probably just old age. What else… no, I think that’s it. Just tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath with exertion, some dizziness, increased forgetfulness – your wife has noticed that – and overall fatigue. That's helpful information. Let's get some basic measurements and then we'll do that EKG. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we'll listen to your heart and lungs, and finally get you hooked up to the EKG. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. I have things to do. And make it quick with the… cuff thing. It always squeezes too tight. Just don't take all day, doctor. Old man doesn't have all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. We’ll be as quick and comfortable as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148 over 85. I also hear a slightly irregular rhythm when listening to your heart. Now, let's get you hooked up to the EKG. It's just some stickers we’ll put on your chest to record your heart's electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all. Would you like me to explain where I'm putting them?
PATIENT: Explain? Just put them. I don't need a lecture on stickers. Just… be careful. My skin is old and fragile. And hurry! What does “irregular” mean anyway? Is it bad? Just tell me straight, doctor. No beating around the bush. Old man doesn't have time for games.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’m being as gentle as possible. "Irregular" just means your heartbeat isn't perfectly consistent. It can be caused by a lot of things, some harmless, some that need attention. That’s what the EKG helps us figure out. Okay, the EKG is running. It’s showing… atrial fibrillation. That means the upper chambers of your heart aren’t contracting in a coordinated way. It’s the cause of the irregular heartbeat I heard.
PATIENT: Atrial… what? What does that mean? Is that bad? You said irregular, now this… fancy word. Just tell me. Is my heart broken? Am I gonna die? Stop with the words, doctor! Just… simple English! Is it fixable? Do I need… that surgery? I knew it! I knew something was bad. My wife… she'll be so worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz, please try to stay calm. Atrial fibrillation—AFib—is a common heart rhythm problem, especially as people get older. It means the electrical signals in your heart are a little disorganized, which causes the upper chambers to quiver instead of contracting normally. It's not the same as your heart being broken, and it doesn’t mean you are going to die. However, it can increase your risk of stroke. We need to talk about ways to manage this. It might require medication to slow your heart rate and prevent blood clots, which is what increases the stroke risk. We can discuss those options. Surgery is not necessarily the first step, and we'll explore all other possibilities first. I want to be very clear: we have options, and we’ll work together to find the best one for you. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Medication? Pills? I don't like pills! I take enough already for my… everything! And stroke? You're talking about me being… paralyzed? Oh, this is terrible. Just… terrible. My wife… she'll be taking care of me then, won't she? She's not strong enough. Wait. Slow down. Stroke… pills… surgery… This is too much. Maybe I just need to rest. Maybe it will go away. Just… stop talking about pills and surgery! I need… water. And to sit down. This is making my chest hurt worse. You said rest helps, right? Just rest? Maybe I just need a long nap. . I don't want to hear any more right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. You're right. Let's slow down. I apologize if I overwhelmed you with too much information at once. It's understandable to feel anxious and want to take things slowly. Rest is good, and we’ll definitely factor that into your plan. However, because of the atrial fibrillation, it’s important that we address it proactively, to minimize the risk of complications. I won’t push you to make any decisions right now. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment so you can discuss this further with your wife, and we can go through all your options in more detail. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a short course of medication to help control your heart rate. It’s not a long-term solution, but it will help us get things under control while we plan. Would that be alright?
