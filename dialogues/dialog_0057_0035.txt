DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Sieh. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Oh, goodness, it’s these hiccups! They just won’t stop. Started yesterday, and they’re still going strong. It's a bit silly, really, coming to a doctor for hiccups, but they’re really bothering me. I’ve tried everything my daughter suggested – holding my breath, drinking water upside down… nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: I see. It's not silly at all to seek medical attention when something is persistent and bothersome, Mirriam. Hiccups that last this long can be a sign of something else going on, so it’s good you came in. Yesterday, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, yesterday. Started right after lunch, actually. I was having a little bit of fish – not much, just a small fillet. And then hic! There it started. It’s been pretty much constant since then, though they do come in waves, you know? Sometimes they’re really strong and frequent, and then they’ll ease up a bit for a little while before starting again. It's just...tiring.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant hiccups are tiring. And it’s helpful to know they started after lunch. Can you tell me a little more about that fish?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It was…snapper, I believe. My daughter brought it over, she got it fresh from the market. It was cooked with lemon and a little bit of garlic, nothing fancy. She’s a good cook, usually. I ate it with a side of rice and some steamed vegetables. Everything tasted normal, I didn't notice anything strange at all. It wasn't like, old fish or anything, definitely fresh. It’s just…they started shortly after I finished eating, that's all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And have you experienced any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Let me see…other symptoms? Not really, not that I’ve noticed. No heartburn, no indigestion, no trouble breathing. My stomach feels alright, a little bit gassy maybe, but that's not unusual for me. I've been a bit tired, but that's probably just because the hiccups keep me awake at night. Oh, and I think I had a bit of a headache yesterday afternoon, but that could just be from being frustrated with the hiccups, you know? Nothing major, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant other symptoms. Let’s do a quick examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look in your ears and throat. Then we can talk about possible causes and what we can do. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Yes, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I’ve had a lot of doctors over the years, you know, working with people in the hospital, and you seem very thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds clear in your lungs, and your heart sounds regular. Your ears look fine, no signs of infection. Throat looks a little dry, but nothing alarming. I’m not feeling any unusual lumps or tenderness in your neck. Blood pressure is 140/90, a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Let’s check your reflexes. They are good and equal on both sides.
PATIENT: Alright, that's good to hear. I am glad everything sounds okay. My blood pressure is usually a bit high when I'm at the doctor's office, to be honest. I get a little nervous, I suppose. But I’m glad you checked everything. What do you think is causing these hiccups? Is it something serious? I’m hoping it’s just…a temporary thing.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness can raise your blood pressure, and it’s good we’re aware of that. As for the hiccups, persistent hiccups like yours can have a number of causes. Most of the time, they’re benign – meaning not serious. Sometimes they’re related to irritation of the nerves that control the diaphragm, which is the muscle you use to breathe. This can be caused by things like a full stomach, carbonated beverages, or even stress. However, since they’ve lasted for a full day, we need to consider other possibilities. Rarely, persistent hiccups can be a sign of something more serious, like an issue with the esophagus or even the central nervous system. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a couple of blood tests to check your electrolytes and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also want to order a chest X-ray to make sure everything looks normal in your lungs and esophagus. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That sounds…sensible, Doctor. Yes, definitely. If that’s what you think is best to rule things out, then please do. I’d rather be safe than sorry. Blood tests and an X-ray, alright. I’m not a fan of X-rays, but if it will help, then I’ll do it. Are these tests done here, at the clinic? Or will I need to go somewhere else?
DOCTOR: You're very right to be cautious, Mirriam. We can do both tests right here at the clinic. The blood draw will just take a few minutes, and the X-ray technician is very good and efficient. It shouldn’t take long at all. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a medication called Baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help calm down the diaphragm and stop the hiccups. We'll start with a low dose, and if it doesn't work, we can adjust it later. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Here at the clinic is much better. I’m glad to hear it. And Baclofen, alright. A muscle relaxant. That sounds…reasonable. No, I don't have any allergies to medications, thankfully. I’ve taken a few different things over the years, working in the hospital, and haven’t had any reactions. Although… …my daughter always says I forget things, so maybe I should ask her to double-check just in case? She has a better memory than I do. But as far as I remember, no allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good idea to have your daughter double-check, Mirriam. It’s always best to be certain. We’ll just note that you're unsure and we can confirm with her later. Okay, I'll write the prescription for Baclofen and send it electronically to your pharmacy. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood for the tests. After that, we’ll get you scheduled for the chest X-ray. In the meantime, try to relax and take slow, deep breaths. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you. You've been very thorough, and I feel much better knowing we're getting everything checked out. Let me think… …how long do you think it will be before we get the results of the blood tests? And is there anything I should avoid doing while I'm taking the Baclofen? Like, driving or…anything? I don't want to do anything that could be dangerous. Also, what about food? Should I avoid anything specific?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mirriam, and it’s smart to think ahead. The blood test results usually come back within 24-48 hours. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. Regarding the Baclofen, it can sometimes cause drowsiness or dizziness, so I recommend avoiding driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how it affects you. Start with a low dose, as prescribed, and see how you feel. As for food, there aren’t any specific restrictions, but I generally advise against large meals or carbonated beverages, as those can sometimes trigger hiccups. Stick to smaller, easily digestible foods for now. We'll also want to avoid alcohol while you're taking the medication. Is there anything else I can address for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. That's very helpful to know. No large meals, carbonated drinks, or alcohol. And be careful driving. I can definitely manage all of that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience with an old woman who forgets things easily. I suppose I'll just wait for the nurse now? And then we'll schedule the X-ray?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mirriam. And please don’t apologize for anything. It’s my job to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. Yes, just wait for the nurse, and she will take you to the lab for the blood draw. After that, she’ll help you schedule the chest X-ray. I’ll check in with you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, try to rest and take it easy. If you experience any concerning side effects from the Baclofen, like severe dizziness, confusion, or difficulty breathing, please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m all set. Severe dizziness, confusion, difficulty breathing… I’ll remember that. Thank you again, Doctor Sieh. You’ve been wonderful. I feel much better knowing we’re getting this sorted out. I suppose it’s just a waiting game now. .
