DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. Please, have a seat. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, and I thought it best to get it checked out. Honestly, I don’t recall exactly when it started, or how it began. It just… appeared, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. “Just appeared,” you say. Right. And where exactly is this swelling located, Mr. Tomassoni?
PATIENT: It’s… around my neck, mostly. Though, it feels a little… widespread, if that makes sense? It’s not a sharply defined area, more… general. Perhaps on the sides, a bit under my jaw? It's hard to say for certain, truthfully. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Widespread,” you say. And has this swelling been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. I… I don't believe so. No pain, really. No difficulty breathing. Perhaps a little fatigue, but I often feel tired, so it’s hard to say if that’s related. I haven’t noticed any changes in my voice, or… or anything else, come to think of it. It’s mostly just… the swelling. It doesn’t hurt, which is… reassuring, I suppose.
DOCTOR: No pain, no difficulty breathing, just the swelling and some fatigue. Alright. And has this swelling changed in size at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I really can’t be certain. It might be a little larger now? Or perhaps it’s the same? It’s very difficult to gauge, Doctor. I wish I could offer a more precise answer, but my recollections are quite… hazy. I apologize for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: It’s… acceptable, Mr. Tomassoni. We’ll do our best to ascertain the cause. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical history… I've seen doctors, of course, but I don't have any… significant diagnoses, as far as I know. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing major. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything, and I don’t take any regular medication. I’ve always considered myself quite healthy, generally. Though… now, of course… I suppose that’s changed a bit. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… difficult to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… That's… a complicated question, Doctor. My mother… she passed away some years ago. I don’t recall any major illnesses on her side. My father… we aren’t close. I haven’t spoken to him in quite some time. I’m afraid I don’t have much information about his medical history, either. I apologize again for my lack of detail. It’s… not something I’ve ever looked into, truthfully. I’ve always been… rather independent.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Mr. Tomassoni?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t experienced any reactions to anything, as far as I remember. I enjoy a wide variety of foods, and I haven’t had any issues with medication in the past. I recall taking antibiotics as a child, and perhaps some pain relievers for headaches, but nothing serious. But… honestly, it’s been so long, I can’t be entirely certain. It’s possible I’ve forgotten something. Would it be helpful to check my records with a previous physician? Perhaps they would have more information?
DOCTOR: No, that won't be necessary. Let's proceed. Now, regarding your lifestyle… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke, nor do I drink alcohol. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I maintain a very… moderate lifestyle. I focus on my work, and I enjoy quiet evenings at home. I prioritize my health, and I believe in… responsible living. I find those sorts of things… detrimental, generally. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s have a look at your neck. Please, sit up straight and extend your neck slightly. I’m going to palpate the area to assess the swelling. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. It feels… slightly enlarged, and there is some… firmness to the left side. Not acutely tender, however. I do not detect any obvious masses, but it warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. No pain, not at the moment. It feels… a little strange, perhaps. A bit of pressure, but nothing unpleasant. I suppose it’s not entirely surprising, considering the swelling. Is it… concerning? I apologize for my continued inquiries, but I do tend to worry. I just want to understand what’s happening, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: It’s… unusual, Mr. Tomassoni. Not immediately alarming, but it does require further assessment. Given your vague recollection of the onset and the lack of accompanying symptoms, and the palpable firmness… I'm going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and an ultrasound of your neck. This will help us determine the cause of the swelling. Do you have any questions regarding these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… I see. A complete blood count, a TSH test, and an ultrasound. No, I don’t believe so, not at the moment. What exactly will these tests reveal, Doctor? Will they tell us if it’s something serious? And… how long will it take to get the results? I apologize for my numerous questions, but I am rather anxious. It’s just… the uncertainty is unsettling. I trust your judgment, of course, but I would appreciate any clarification you can offer.
DOCTOR: The complete blood count will check for any signs of infection or inflammation. The TSH test will assess your thyroid function, as thyroid abnormalities can sometimes cause neck swelling. And the ultrasound will provide a detailed image of the structures in your neck, allowing us to identify any masses or other abnormalities. The results should be available within 3 to 5 business days. I understand your anxiety, Mr. Tomassoni, but it's important not to jump to conclusions. We need to gather more information before we can determine the cause of the swelling. In the meantime, if you experience any difficulty breathing, pain, or fever, please seek immediate medical attention. I'm going to refer you to a radiologist for the ultrasound. Here is the order. You can schedule the appointment at your convenience.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. No jumping to conclusions. Three to five business days… Very well. I will schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your… patience with my questions, and my… forgetfulness. I will be sure to contact you if I experience any of the symptoms you mentioned. Is there anything else I should be aware of at this time? Perhaps… any specific things I should avoid?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Tomassoni. Just avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results of the tests. And if anything changes, or your symptoms worsen, contact the office immediately. That will be all. .
