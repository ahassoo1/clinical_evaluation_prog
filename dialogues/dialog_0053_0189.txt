DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Doyle Pitmon, Doctor of Internal Medicine. So, you’re 88, haven’t bothered with insurance… fine. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Insurance is for people who break things, young man. I maintain things. And what’s with the questioning tone? Anyway… well, it’s… unpleasant. Blood in my stool. Happened twice now. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. It’s not right, is it?
DOCTOR: "Maintain things," right. Well, even well-maintained things… sometimes have issues. Blood in the stool isn't something to ignore, certainly. Twice, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, twice. Yesterday and the day before. Bright red, not… mixed in or anything. Just… there. Looked like I'd eaten a beet, frankly. Though I haven't touched a beet in… oh, decades. Probably. It’s probably nothing, but my father… he had problems. Down south, you know. Different kind of problems, but still. A man gets worried.
DOCTOR: “Different kind of problems,” hmm?
PATIENT: Different doctors, different… climates. Let's just say the food wasn't as regulated. And the medical attention was… lacking. Never you mind. It wasn’t serious, just… uncomfortable. This is what I’m worried about now. Is it… serious? Don’t tell me it’s one of those things that requires… poking and prodding. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I don’t need any new indignities.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Rowbottom, to determine if it's "serious" – as you put it – requires… assessment. I understand your reluctance, truly. But bright red blood is typically indicative of lower intestinal bleeding. That could be something relatively minor – hemorrhoids, a small fissure – but it could also be something more significant. We need to rule things out. First, let’s go over a bit of your history. Have you experienced any abdominal pain alongside this bleeding?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? Not really. A little discomfort, a rumble now and then, you know, old man stuff. But no pain, no cramping, nothing like that. Just… surprised. I've always been regular, if you catch my drift. This is… unsettling. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being asked about my… regularity. It's private.
DOCTOR: “Regularity” is, unfortunately, quite pertinent to this situation, sir. It helps determine the source. Fine. No pain. Any changes in your bowel habits besides the blood?
PATIENT: Habits? What do you mean, habits? I go when I need to go! I haven't been keeping a ledger, Doctor! It's not as if I'm timing myself, you know. Perhaps a little… thinner lately, the stool. Not watery, just… less substantial. Could be the weather. Everything’s thinner these days. Except the taxes, of course. They seem to be getting thicker. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Sir, I am attempting to ascertain if there have been any changes in the consistency of your stool. Thinner stools, as you mentioned, are relevant. Along with the blood, it suggests we need to investigate further. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. Well, Agnes – my ex-wife, God rest her soul, though I doubt she’s resting – always said I was too hefty. Perhaps I’ve lost a little. But that could just be the scales. They’re old, you know. And I haven’t been eating as much steak lately. It’s expensive, what with everything going up. Are you implying I’m wasting away? Because I assure you, I’m still quite robust. For my age. Mostly.
DOCTOR: No, sir, I am not implying you are “wasting away”. I am simply gathering information. Let’s move on. Any nausea, vomiting, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Sometimes. But that's just getting up too fast, you know. Old age, again. Nausea… no. And certainly no vomiting. I haven’t vomited in… well, decades. Not since that bad oyster at the church picnic in ‘78. That was a disaster. No, just the blood. And the slightly thinner… output. And the unsettling feeling that something isn't quite right. Which, frankly, is putting it mildly. Is it cancer? Is that what you’re thinking? My cousin Beatrice… she had cancer. It was awful.
DOCTOR: Sir, let's not jump to conclusions. It could be a number of things. We need to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll also need to perform a digital rectal exam. I understand your apprehension, but it’s a necessary step to rule out serious causes. Will you permit me to proceed?
PATIENT: Digital… rectal… Exam. Really? At my age? Honestly. Well… I suppose if you insist. But be quick about it, young man. And for goodness sake, be gentle. I haven't been poked and prodded like this since… well, never. And don't tell me you've never done this before. I expect a certain level of… proficiency. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. If you could lie on your side...and please, try to relax. This won't take long. Alright. I'm feeling some… tenderness in the lower abdomen. And there appears to be a small amount of occult blood present. Not alarming in itself, but consistent with what you've described. I also feel a small external hemorrhoid, which may be contributing to the bleeding. However, we can't rule out other possibilities without further investigation. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a stool test to check for more significant bleeding and any signs of infection. I also recommend a colonoscopy to visualize the entire colon and identify any potential issues. Do you understand?
