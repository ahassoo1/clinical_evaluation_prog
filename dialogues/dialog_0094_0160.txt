DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it's about this tiredness. It's just…getting worse. And it’s not a normal tired, if you know what I mean. It’s…deep. And then there’s this…habit I’ve gotten into. It’s embarrassing, really. I just…eat dirt. Clay, mostly. Don't look at me like that. It helps, okay? It's just…I need it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Candis. It takes courage to talk about things that feel embarrassing. And I assure you, I’m here to listen without judgment. You mentioned a deep tiredness that’s getting worse. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it started a few months ago, just feeling a bit run down. I thought it was the weather, you know? Old age. But it hasn’t gone away. Now, I can barely make it through the day without a nap. And even with naps, I’m exhausted. It’s not like I’m doing anything strenuous! I mostly just…sit. I used to be so active, always cleaning, gardening…now, forget it. It’s a waste of energy even thinking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when it’s impacting your ability to do things you enjoy. So, it’s been several months of this increasing fatigue, even with rest. Can you describe what the tiredness feels like?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's…heavy. Like someone put weights on my eyelids and my limbs. Not just sleepy, but…drained. Like all the life has been sucked out of me. And it's not just physical, it's…mental too. I can't focus. I forget things constantly – not important things, thankfully, but little things. Where I put my glasses, what I was just saying…it's irritating. And the dirt…it helps a little with that fuzziness. Not much, but a little. Honestly, I’m surprised I haven’t gotten sick from eating it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a heavy, draining fatigue, both physically and mentally, with some difficulty with concentration and memory. And you've found that consuming clay provides a small amount of relief. That’s…unusual, and we’ll definitely need to explore that. Before we get further into that, let’s get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and memory issues?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… Well, I get a bit breathless sometimes, just walking around the house. Not like I’m gasping for air, but…winded. And my skin feels…dry. Like sandpaper. And, oh! I've been more irritable than usual. Snapping at people for no reason. My neighbor asked if I was alright last week. It’s embarrassing. And…I haven’t really been hungry. Food just doesn't appeal to me. I mostly just pick at things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we're looking at shortness of breath with exertion, dry skin, increased irritability, and a decreased appetite. That gives us quite a bit to work with. Now, Candis, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, don't get me started. I’ve lived a long life. I’ve had the usual things. A bad flu here and there, a broken wrist when I was a child, arthritis in my hands, that's about it. Nothing serious. I haven’t been to a doctor in…well, a long time. I don’t believe in running to the doctor for every little thing. I've always been healthy, mostly. Until this. And honestly, I think it’s just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, and it’s admirable that you’ve been able to maintain your health for so long. It’s good that you’ve generally been well. Even if you haven't been to the doctor recently, do you recall if you’ve ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, nothing like that. The doctor always said my blood pressure was a little high, but he never put me on any medicine. Just told me to watch my salt intake. And no diabetes, no heart problems. I always ate pretty well – lots of vegetables, not much junk food. Though, I did enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Don't tell anyone. And I definitely don't remember being diagnosed with anything "chronic" as you put it. I’m a simple woman with simple needs. This tiredness is just…a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Candis. That’s helpful to know. And don’t worry, your wine consumption will remain confidential. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the broken wrist you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Just the wrist when I was a little girl. Fell out of a tree, trying to get a kite. Silly thing. And no hospital stays, other than that. I’ve always been lucky, I guess. I’ve always taken care of myself, even if I do indulge in a bit of dirt now and then. Can we just get this over with? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll get through this as quickly as possible. Now, Candis, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? My mother lived to be 95, but she had…well, she was a bit forgetful in her later years. Not like me, though. She didn't eat dirt! My father died young, heart attack, I think. And my brother…he had high blood pressure. That's about all I remember. It's been a long time. We weren't a very close family, to be honest. Mostly kept to ourselves. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand it’s not always easy to recall family history, and it’s alright if you don’t have all the details. Knowing about potential predispositions can be helpful. So, your mother had memory issues, your father died of a heart attack, and your brother had high blood pressure. One last question about your background, Candis. Could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? I live alone. Always have, really. Never married. Didn't have children. I have a few neighbors, but we don't see much of each other. I mostly keep to myself, read books, watch television. I used to volunteer at the church, but I haven't been going much lately. I just haven't had the energy. Is that what you wanted to know? Honestly, it’s a very…unremarkable life.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s important for me to understand your lifestyle. So, you live alone, are retired, and haven't been as active socially recently. Now, Candis, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any problems with medications. I can take pretty much anything. And I eat everything. Except maybe snails. Never liked snails. This is getting ridiculous. I'm telling you, I'm just tired and I eat a little dirt. Isn’t there a test you can give me or something? I don’t have all day to answer questions about snails and my nonexistent social life.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candis. You’re right, we’ve covered a lot of background information. And you’re absolutely correct, let’s move towards some testing. Before we do that, just one last quick question about medications. Are you currently taking any vitamins, supplements, or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Just a multivitamin. The cheap kind. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take ibuprofen. That’s it! Nothing fancy. Honestly, I don’t understand why you need to know all this stuff. It doesn't change the fact that I'm tired and I crave dirt. Can we please get to the tests now?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You are taking a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Okay, Candis, I’m going to do a physical exam now. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn't take too long. Your breathing sounds a little diminished, especially in the lower part of your lungs. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/85. I'm going to palpate your abdomen now... do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little. Not terrible, just…tender. It’s been a bit uncomfortable lately, sort of a dull ache. I just thought it was old age. Is that bad? And what did you say about my breathing? Is something wrong with my lungs? Honestly, I don’t like this. It’s making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in your abdomen and diminished breath sounds. It’s good you’re letting me know about the discomfort. It’s important to investigate these things. I’m going to order some blood work and a chest X-ray. The blood work will help us look for things like anemia, infection, and kidney or liver problems. The chest X-ray will give us a better look at your lungs. I also want to ask you one more question, Candis. Regarding the dirt – how much are you eating, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly. A handful, maybe, a couple of times a day. When I feel particularly…weak. It’s not like I’m shoveling it down, if that’s what you’re thinking! It's just… a small amount. It helps with the fuzziness, the tiredness. It’s the only thing that does, really. It’s embarrassing to admit, I know. People will think I’m crazy. But I just...need it. Is that so wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s not wrong to seek things that provide relief, Candis. And I’m not judging you. However, eating dirt can be very dangerous. It can contain bacteria, parasites, and toxins that could make you very sick. We need to find a safer way to address your tiredness and the “fuzziness” you’re experiencing. The blood work and X-ray will help us understand what’s going on and determine the best course of action. I’m also concerned about possible iron deficiency given your diet and craving for clay . In the meantime, I want to strongly advise you to stop eating the dirt. I know that might be difficult, but it’s important for your health. I’ll have the lab order sent over right away, and you can go get the X-ray done at the imaging center across the street. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Stop eating the dirt? That’s easy for you to say. You don’t feel the way I do. It’s the only thing that helps! But…fine. I’ll try. But if I start feeling really terrible, I’m coming back here, and you’re going to have to do something about it. And what if the tests show something bad? What if it's something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Candis. It’s perfectly natural to be anxious about the possibility of a serious diagnosis. We’ll take things one step at a time. We’ll get the test results as quickly as possible, and I’ll explain everything to you in detail. And I promise you, we’ll work together to find the best possible solution, whatever the results may be. If the tests do reveal something concerning, we may need to consult with a specialist—perhaps a hematologist or a pulmonologist . I’ll refer you to the appropriate specialist if necessary. In the meantime, are you able to make an appointment for the blood work and X-ray today?
PATIENT: Fine. I’ll go get the tests done. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And if I start feeling worse, I’m coming back here, and you’re going to have to listen to me. This whole thing is ridiculous. Alright, I’m going. Just tell me where to go. And make it quick. I have errands to run. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candis. The lab is just down the hall, room 102. And the imaging center is across the street at 123 Main Street. The lab order will be sent electronically. Please call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms. Thank you for coming in today, Candis. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. .
