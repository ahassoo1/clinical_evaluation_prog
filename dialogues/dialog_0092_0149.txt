DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Dr. Giganti, is it? Well, I’m here because… honestly, I don't quite understand why everyone's making such a fuss. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. She says I need to… talk about things. I just want to be left alone, really. It's all a bother.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. It can be frustrating when family members are concerned and you feel perfectly alright. However, sometimes a little check-up can be helpful just to put minds at ease. Could you tell me a little more about what's been going on that prompted your daughter to bring you in?
PATIENT: Prompted? Honestly, she’s always prompting. She worries over everything. I think she read something online, some article about…old people, I suppose. She’s convinced I’m falling apart. I feel fine. A little stiff in the mornings, maybe, but who isn’t at my age? I've been a podiatrist for… well, a long time. I know my body. It’s just… people making mountains out of molehills. Honestly, it's ridiculous. What exactly are you trying to find out?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Wynell. It sounds like your daughter has some concerns, and you feel quite capable and independent, which is wonderful. I want to assure you I’m not trying to find anything specific; I simply want to understand what’s been happening from your perspective. To help me do that, could you tell me a bit about your typical day?
PATIENT: My typical day? Heavens. That's a silly question. I used to have a typical day. I had a practice, you know. A very successful practice. But that was… a long time ago. Now? I mostly keep to myself. I read. I watch television. I try to avoid my daughter as much as possible. I used to garden, but my knees… well, you know. It's all very… quiet. I don’t do much, if that’s what you want to know. It’s not exactly a thrilling life, but it suits me. And frankly, I’d like to keep it that way. Why does it matter what I do all day, anyway?
DOCTOR: It matters because even small changes in your routine or energy levels can be important. Knowing what a typical day looks like for you helps me understand if anything has changed recently, even if it doesn’t seem significant to you. You mentioned your knees. Are they causing you pain?
PATIENT: Oh, the knees. Yes, they bother me. Not constantly, you understand. Just… a dull ache, mostly when I get up from a chair. And sometimes, if I walk too much. My daughter keeps telling me I need… something done about them. Injections, or surgery, or… I don’t even listen anymore. I’ve always been able to manage. Rub some cream on them, take a little nap. It's just… getting old, I suppose. It's not something you can fix with a pill, is it? Honestly, it’s not the end of the world. I've lived a long life. A good life. I don't need poking and prodding now, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Wynell. It sounds like you've been managing the pain for quite some time and have your own methods for dealing with it. Just to get a clearer picture, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say the pain in your knees is on a typical day when you're getting up from a chair?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale now? Honestly. You doctors and your scales. It fluctuates, you know? Some days it's barely there, maybe a 2 or 3. Other days… well, when I’ve been sitting for too long, it can be a 6, maybe even a 7. But it doesn't last! I just need to get moving. It's a nuisance, that's all. A bothersome little ache. I really don't see what all the fuss is about. And I certainly don't want to spend the entire appointment talking about my knees. Is this what you do all day? Ask old ladies about their aches and pains?
DOCTOR: It’s important for me to understand the level of discomfort you’re experiencing, Wynell, so I can provide the best possible care. And no, I don’t spend all day asking patients about aches and pains. I want to get a complete picture of your health. Besides your knees, have you noticed any other changes in your body recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Goodness. Where do I even begin? I'm eighty-three years old! Things change. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, obviously. My hearing… well, let’s just say I sometimes miss things. I’m slower, naturally. I get tired more easily. It’s all perfectly normal, isn’t it? I’m not falling apart, you know. I just… I'm aging. And frankly, I find all these questions rather… intrusive. Are you trying to find something wrong with me? Because if you are, you're wasting your time. I’ve lived a long, full life. I don’t need fixing. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Wynell, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. That’s certainly not my intention. You’re right, changes happen as we age, and it's perfectly normal to experience those. I’m just trying to rule out anything that might be causing those changes to be more pronounced or affecting your quality of life. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Weight? Honestly. You’re asking me about my weight now? Is that really necessary? I eat when I’m hungry. Sometimes I don’t have much of an appetite, sometimes I do. It depends on the day. I haven’t been weighing myself, and frankly, I don't care if I've gained a few pounds. I'm not obsessed with numbers, you know. It's all very… superficial. My daughter is always fussing about what I eat, telling me I need more protein, less sugar, this and that. It's exhausting. I just want to be left alone to enjoy my life, whatever's left of it. And frankly, I’m starting to think this appointment was a terrible mistake. I'd like to go now. Can we just… end this?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. It sounds like you’re feeling quite overwhelmed and that you feel your daughter is overly concerned. I assure you, I'm not trying to upset you. I'm simply trying to gather information. Let's try a different approach. You mentioned you've been feeling tired more easily. Is that new, or has that been ongoing for some time?
PATIENT: Oh, the tiredness. Yes, well, it's been creeping up on me, I suppose. It wasn't sudden. It just… gradually got worse. A few years ago, I could still do things. Go shopping, visit friends… Now, I mostly just sit. I get winded easily. It's embarrassing, honestly. I used to be so active. I took walks every day. Now, just getting up the stairs is a chore. And it's not just physical, you know? I feel… drained. Mentally. I don’t have the energy for much anymore. It's just… part of getting old, I suppose. I'm not expecting you to fix it. I just… I wish people would leave me alone. And I really think I’ve had enough of this interrogation for one day. I'm going home.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant decrease in your energy levels, and it's affecting both your physical and mental well-being. Before you go, I would like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart and lungs and listen to your breathing. It will only take a few minutes. And if you're not comfortable with that, that's perfectly alright. Would you be willing to let me listen to your heart and lungs?
