DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Just not hungry, you know? It’s been… a little while, I think. Hard to say exactly how long.
DOCTOR: I understand. A feeling of fullness and decreased appetite… and you said this has been going on for a little while. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about this “big” feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It's not pain, not really. Just… full. Like I ate a big dinner, but I didn't. And it feels… hard, sometimes. Not always, but sometimes. It’s strange. I don’t remember anything like this before, but my memory… well, it doesn’t work so good these days.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a sensation of fullness, even when you haven’t eaten much, and sometimes a feeling of hardness in your abdomen. And you're right to mention your memory, we can take things slowly. It’s good you're telling me all this. Has anything specifically changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Hmm… changed? Let me think… Oh! My neighbor, little Timmy, he started helping me with the garden. He’s a good boy. But… no, that’s not it. Everything feels… the same, mostly. Except for the tummy. And not wanting food. I used to love my borscht, you know. Now… not so much. I don’t know… everything is a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant changes other than the abdominal discomfort and decreased appetite. And you’ve noticed a change in your enjoyment of food, specifically your borscht. That’s helpful information. Now, I'm going to ask some more questions, just to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh… dear. What does that mean? I… I don’t know. Do you mean… going to the bathroom? I go… when I need to. Is that what you want to know? It hasn’t been… different, I don’t think. Maybe a little less often? It’s hard to say. Everything feels a bit… mixed up.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I meant – going to the bathroom. And it’s perfectly alright if it’s difficult to remember. You said perhaps a little less often than usual?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Not a lot less, but… not as regular, maybe. And sometimes… it’s harder to go. Not always, but sometimes I have to… push more. I’m sorry, this is silly, isn’t it? Old ladies talking about… this.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Soila. These are important questions, and it’s very helpful that you’re sharing this with me. Any changes in bowel habits are worth discussing. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Oh, I don’t know about that. I haven’t been weighing myself. I think… maybe I’m a little thinner? My clothes feel… looser, perhaps? But I haven’t been on the scale. I used to weigh myself, but… it just made me sad. I don't pay attention to that anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Clothes feeling looser, but no recent weighing. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea… is that feeling sick to your stomach? No, not really. I haven’t thrown up. Sometimes I feel a little… weak, but that’s just getting old, I think. And I don’t eat much, so maybe that’s why I feel weak. No throwing up, though. Never that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea or vomiting. Just a feeling of weakness. Now, one more question before we move on. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood? I… I don’t think so. I don’t remember seeing any blood. That sounds… scary. No, I haven’t seen any blood. I hope not. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven't noticed any blood. It’s always best to ask. Now, Soila, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your abdomen and feeling your tummy, to get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just be gentle, please? My tummy is… sensitive. And don’t mind if I flinch a little. Old ladies are… easily startled.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Sounds are a bit… diminished, but that isn't necessarily a cause for concern, given your age. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or masses. Please tell me if anything feels painful. How does this feel?
PATIENT: Oh… That’s… a little uncomfortable. Not pain, exactly, but… pressure. It feels… full, like a balloon. And… a little hard, right there. It's not all over, just that spot. And… it makes me feel a little… shaky.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. Tenderness in the lower right abdomen. That's helpful information. I'm not going to press further at this point. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam findings, it's important to investigate this further. The fullness, decreased appetite, changes in bowel habits, and the tenderness in your lower right abdomen could be due to several things. Given your age and the fact that you haven’t been feeling well for a while, I want to order some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out any infections. I also think we should get an imaging scan, like a CT scan, of your abdomen to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… scans and tests… That sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? I’m just an old woman. I don’t want a lot of trouble. Can’t it just be… indigestion or something? I don't like hospitals or tests. It all sounds so… frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. It is frightening to think about tests and scans, and I wouldn’t suggest them if I didn’t think they were important. It’s not necessarily something bad, and we need to rule out all the possibilities. It could be something simple, like indigestion, but given your symptoms and the tenderness I felt, it’s important to be thorough. The blood work and scan will help us get a clear understanding of what’s going on, and then we can decide on the best course of action. I'll explain everything very carefully, and we will take things one step at a time. We can also discuss your concerns with a specialist, if that would make you feel more comfortable. I promise, we’ll do everything we can to make you feel safe and comfortable. Would you like me to call someone to be with you during the scan?
PATIENT: Oh… well… if you think it’s necessary. Yes, maybe call little Timmy. He’s a good boy, very patient. And… yes, please explain everything very carefully. I don’t understand much of the medical talk. And… thank you, Doctor. You seem very… kind. I’m still scared, but… I trust you.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll call Timmy. And I promise to explain everything in a way that’s easy to understand. I’ll also have the radiology technician explain the scan process to you before it begins. I'm glad you trust me, Soila. We're going to take good care of you. Let me get the order for the blood work and scan, and then we can schedule them. I’ll also have my nurse come in to draw the blood now, before you leave. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Blood first, then the scan. And please… tell Timmy to come right away. I don’t like being alone. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll let my nurse know to come in right away. And I’ve already contacted Timmy, he’s on his way. While we wait for the nurse, do you have any questions for me at all before we begin?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I think. Just… tired. I’m sure I’ll think of something later. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old lady.
