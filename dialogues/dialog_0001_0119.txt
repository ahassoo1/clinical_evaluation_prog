DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it’s… rather embarrassing, Doctor. But I suppose that’s what doctors are for. It’s… a gentleman friend. And… well, he’s having a bit of… discharge. It’s not pleasant, you understand. And I felt it my duty to come and get it checked, as I’m the… more responsible one in the arrangement.
DOCTOR: A gentleman friend, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Though “gentleman” might be… generous. He’s perfectly adequate, of course. It’s just… not something one boasts about. And frankly, I find the whole situation rather… unhygienic. I mean, a man should know these things. Really.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s not get into manners. Tell me about this discharge. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… it was… probably about a week ago now. He hadn’t mentioned anything, naturally. I only… discovered it myself, while… tidying up. It wasn't immediately obvious, you understand. Just a… dampness, really. A rather unsightly dampness.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what color was this “unsightly dampness”?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Honestly, Doctor, I try not to look at these things. It was… yellowish. A sort of sickly yellow, I suppose. Not a bright, cheerful yellow, certainly. More the color of… old wallpaper, if you follow me. And it smelled… unpleasant, of course. It wasn’t a fresh smell, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. Sickly yellow, not fresh…Okay. Is there any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: Well, he complained of a bit of burning, now that you mention it. Though, to be perfectly honest, he complains about everything. His back, his knees… the price of tea. But yes, he did mutter something about a stinging sensation when… well, when using the facilities. I assumed it was just his general fussiness, but perhaps it is related.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is he running any fever, or chills?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. He’s always a bit… warm-blooded, if you know what I mean, but no fever that I’ve noticed. And no shivering or anything dramatic like that. He’s rather… robust, generally. It's just this… problem. It's terribly uncouth, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Has he had anything like this before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. He’s… not the sort. Well, that is to say, he’s not the sort to be… afflicted with these things. He prides himself on… regularity, if you take my meaning. This is quite out of character, truly. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Well, he’s been a bit… distracted lately. More than usual, anyway. And he keeps going to the lavatory. A lot. More often than is strictly necessary, I suspect. He just keeps… disappearing. It’s terribly inconvenient, frankly. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Frequent urination could be. Has he been sexually active recently?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor! Really! Must you ask such… indelicate questions? Of course he has! That is… a natural function. Though, I prefer not to dwell on the particulars. It’s hardly polite conversation, is it? And frankly, I doubt he'd tell me anything of that nature. He's a rather… private individual.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Fine. Has he had any recent injuries or illnesses?
PATIENT: No, nothing of the sort. He’s quite… sturdy, as I mentioned. Not prone to sniffles or bumps. He did complain about his gout last month, but that’s a chronic condition, you understand. He treats it with… rather strong drink, mostly. But no recent injuries or illnesses. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like we’re dealing with a possible case of urethritis. But I need to examine him to be sure. I'm not going to be able to properly diagnose this just by talking to you.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That is… awkward. I hadn’t quite anticipated having to… facilitate that. I suppose it’s necessary, though. Honestly, the whole situation is… undignified. Is it terribly… invasive? I do hope he won’t fuss. He's awfully particular about his personal space.
DOCTOR: It will involve a urine sample and a physical exam, Ms. Wartick. It's standard procedure. I'll need his full cooperation. And I'll need to speak to him directly. Do you think you can… encourage him to come in?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Encourage him? That’s… a challenge, Doctor. A considerable challenge. He does not take kindly to being told what to do. But I suppose I can… appeal to his sense of… civic duty. And perhaps mention the possibility of… long-term complications if it’s left untreated. Yes, that might work. Though, he’ll probably complain the entire time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, tell him to come in as soon as possible. And please, Ms. Wartick, try to get him to actually cooperate. This is going to be… difficult enough as it is. I’ll schedule an appointment for him. I need to get to my next patient, though. Anything else I need to know right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… please be gentle with him, Doctor. He’s a bit… sensitive. And do try not to ask too many… personal questions. He’s a proud man, you understand. And perhaps have a comfortable chair in the waiting room. He’ll be complaining about his back, no doubt. Thank you, Doctor. I do appreciate you seeing to this… unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tell him to be prepared for a urine sample and a quick examination. That’s all for now, Ms. Wartick. Have a good day. And please, encourage him to come in soon.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall do my best. Though, I make no promises about the complaining. Thank you again for your time. This is going to be… a day.
