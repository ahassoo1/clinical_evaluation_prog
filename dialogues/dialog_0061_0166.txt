DOCTOR: "Bula and welcome, Tarin. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Kimm. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s become… concerning enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It's mostly in my left leg, though sometimes it feels a bit strange in my right as well.
DOCTOR: "Okay, numbness in your leg. That is good you came in to get it checked out. It’s always best to be proactive. Mostly in your left leg, you said, and sometimes in your right. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It isn’t a complete loss of feeling, if that makes sense. More like… pins and needles, and a sort of… dull ache. It comes and goes. It seems to be worse after I’ve been standing for a long time, or if I’ve been focusing intently on my work – animation tends to have me in a specific position for hours. I can still move my leg perfectly fine, and there's no pain when I do move it, just the numbness. It doesn't radiate, it's pretty localized to the leg itself.
DOCTOR: "Okay, that's helpful. Pins and needles, a dull ache, comes and goes… worse with standing or focused work, no pain with movement, and localized to the leg. So it doesn’t shoot up your back or anything?
PATIENT: No, it doesn’t shoot up my back at all. It stays entirely within the leg, from my hip down to my foot. Though, now that you mention it, my foot does sometimes feel a little cold, even when it isn’t particularly cold in the room. It's subtle, but I have noticed it coinciding with the numbness a few times.
DOCTOR: "Okay, so localized to the leg, hip to foot. And you've noticed some coolness in your foot when the numbness is present. That's good information. Let’s talk a bit more about your history. Have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. This is entirely new to me. I’ve had the usual bumps and bruises from being… clumsy, and the occasional muscle strain from working, but nothing like this numbness. I’ve always been fairly healthy, if that helps. I try to eat well, though admittedly sometimes convenience wins out with my schedule. I don’t have any chronic conditions that I know of, and I’m not on any medications currently.
DOCTOR: "Okay, that’s good to know – no prior history, generally healthy, no medications. And I understand the convenience factor – it's tough to eat perfectly all the time. Let's move on to some other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, to my knowledge. My family isn’t prone to allergies either, as far as I know. I can eat pretty much anything without issue, and I haven’t ever had a skin reaction to plants or anything like that. I should probably clarify, though - I don’t spend a lot of time outdoors, so my exposure is limited.
DOCTOR: "Okay, good. No known allergies, limited outdoor exposure. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, neuropathy, arthritis, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My maternal grandmother had… well, she had something with her hands and feet, a tingling and numbness, when she got older. I don’t recall the exact diagnosis, my mother said it was something to do with her nerves. She was diagnosed fairly late in life, though, in her 80s. My father’s side of the family is mostly healthy, as far as I know, though they aren’t particularly forthcoming with medical information. So, it’s a bit difficult to say definitively. I do know my uncle has arthritis, but it’s mostly in his knees and hips.
DOCTOR: "Okay, maternal grandmother with tingling and numbness in her hands and feet – that's potentially relevant, we'll keep that in mind. And your uncle with arthritis. Thanks for that information. Finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, I do not. Never have. I’m not a fan of the smell, frankly. And I generally avoid situations where I'm exposed to secondhand smoke. I do occasionally drink, but very moderately – a glass of wine with dinner maybe once or twice a week, nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: "Okay, great. Non-smoker, very moderate alcohol consumption. That's all helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. We’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed at your convenience. I’m happy to cooperate in any way that will help determine what’s going on. I appreciate you taking the time to thoroughly assess the situation.
DOCTOR: "Excellent. Okay, if you could sit on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: "Alright, first I’m going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax your legs. Let’s start with your knee… Can you point your leg straight out for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. This is… not the most comfortable position, but I’m managing. Please, proceed when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: "Okay, good response there… Now the right… Good response on that side as well. Now I'm going to check your ankle reflexes… Just relax your feet. I’ll tap the back of your heel. Both sides responding normally. Now, I’m going to use this tuning fork to check your sensation. Close your eyes for me, and tell me when you feel the vibration stop.
PATIENT: Okay, I’ve got my eyes closed. I’m ready. ...No, I don’t feel it anymore... Yes, I can feel it now... Still feeling it… No, that’s gone…
DOCTOR: "Okay, thank you. That was helpful. Now, I'm going to check the strength in your legs and feet. Can you push your foot against my hand like you're trying to push the gas pedal?
PATIENT: I’m pressing down as hard as I can. Just let me know when you want me to stop.
DOCTOR: "Good strength on both sides. Alright. Now, can you wiggle your toes for me?
PATIENT: I’m wiggling them as much as possible. It's a little awkward, but I'm doing it.
DOCTOR: “Okay, good. And finally, can you stand on your tiptoes?
PATIENT: I’m standing on my tiptoes now. It’s a bit wobbly, but I’m holding it.
DOCTOR: "Okay, thank you. Alright, that’s all the physical exam for now. Everything seems relatively normal, though I did notice a slight decrease in sensation in your left foot, and you were a little less stable on your tiptoes on that side. Not dramatically so, but enough to warrant further investigation. Based on what you’ve told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some peripheral neuropathy." "It's not always serious, and there are many potential causes. But it's important to figure out what’s causing it."
PATIENT: Peripheral neuropathy… I’ve heard of that, but I don’t really know much about it. A slight decrease in sensation… is that concerning? And what kind of causes are we talking about? Is it something to do with my grandmother's condition? I’m trying not to jump to conclusions, but it’s hard not to worry when you hear something like that. What’s the next step?
DOCTOR: "I understand your concern, it's perfectly normal to be worried when you hear something like that. It could be related to your grandmother’s condition, but we need more information to be sure. Peripheral neuropathy simply means there’s some damage or dysfunction of the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. There are many possible causes. Sometimes it's due to diabetes, vitamin deficiencies – particularly B vitamins – exposure to toxins, certain medications, or even infections. In some cases, it can be hereditary like what your grandmother experienced. In other cases, we can't find a specific cause, which is called idiopathic neuropathy." "The next step is to run some tests to try and pinpoint the cause. I’d like to order a blood test to check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, kidney function, and look for any signs of inflammation. I also want to order a nerve conduction study, which will measure the electrical activity in your nerves to see how well they’re functioning. It's a painless test, just involves some small electrodes on your skin. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes… a little more sense. So, it’s not necessarily a dire situation, just something we need to investigate. The blood test sounds straightforward enough. A nerve conduction study… that sounds a bit more involved, but if it’s painless, I’m willing to do it. Would the results of these tests give us a clearer picture of what might be causing it, and what, if anything, needs to be done? And roughly how long will it take to get the results back? I suppose it depends on the lab, but a general timeframe would be helpful.
DOCTOR: "Exactly. These tests will help us narrow down the potential causes and determine the best course of action. The nerve conduction study will give us information about the extent and location of any nerve damage. It will help us understand if it’s a localized problem or something more widespread." "The blood test results usually come back within 3-5 business days. The nerve conduction study might take a little longer, around a week to ten days, depending on the lab schedule and how busy they are. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Depending on the cause, treatment could range from simple vitamin supplementation to physical therapy, medication, or lifestyle changes. In some cases, it might just require monitoring the condition. " "Do you have any allergies to latex or contrast dye, just in case?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies to latex. As for contrast dye, I haven't had any procedures requiring it before, so I'm not aware of any allergy. I’m generally pretty good with medications, but I don’t have a long history of needing them. Should I avoid any activities while we’re waiting for the results? Like, is it safe to continue my work, or should I take a break? I wouldn’t want to exacerbate the problem if it’s something like nerve compression.
DOCTOR: "That's a good question. Since we don’t know the exact cause yet, it’s best to be cautious. You can continue your work, but I recommend taking frequent breaks to stretch and move around. Avoid any activities that significantly worsen your symptoms, like prolonged standing or repetitive motions. Listen to your body – if something feels uncomfortable, stop. We don’t want to aggravate it unnecessarily. Gentle stretching and range-of-motion exercises are fine, but avoid anything strenuous. " "I’m going to go ahead and order these tests for you now. The lab is located at [Lab address and phone number]. You can walk in anytime during their business hours. Once you've had the tests done, please let the lab know to send the results directly to my office. Do you have any questions about the lab or the testing process?
PATIENT: No, that address and phone number are perfect, thank you. And I understand about letting the lab send the results directly to your office. Everything seems pretty clear. I think that covers everything for now. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, Dr. Kimm. It's definitely reassuring to have a plan in place. I'll schedule the tests as soon as possible and let you know if anything unexpected comes up.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and please take care.”
