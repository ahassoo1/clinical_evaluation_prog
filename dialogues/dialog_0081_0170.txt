DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just need this life insurance thing done. The company needs a medical check, that’s all. Trying to get it over with quick, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: A life insurance physical, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. It’s… complicated. Ex-wife stuff, mostly. They need proof of… well, you know. Just want to get it done and be finished with it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll certainly do our best to be efficient. Let’s start with a bit of background. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual check-ups when I have to. Nothing regular. I try to stay healthy, you know? Mostly just aches and pains from work, nothing a little rest doesn’t fix.
DOCTOR: “Try to stay healthy,” you say. And what sort of work do you do that causes “aches and pains”?
PATIENT: I manage a small hotel. A lot of lifting, moving stuff around, dealing with… everything that breaks. It's a lot of being on my feet all day, if that makes sense. Small place, so I gotta do a bit of everything.
DOCTOR: So, physical labor then. And have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past – anything that required a hospital stay, surgery, or a long course of treatment?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Years ago, I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. Nothing serious since then, honestly. A bad flu here and there, but nothing that kept me down for long. I don't really remember being in the hospital for anything. Does a twisted ankle count? Probably not.
DOCTOR: A twisted ankle does not count, Mr. Putney. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history... that's tough. My side of the family… it’s a bit spread out, you know? Lots of people back on the islands. Heart trouble, I think? My mom had it, but she lived a long life. And diabetes, maybe? I’m not sure exactly. It wasn’t something we talked about much. Sorry, I’m not much help there.
DOCTOR: It will suffice. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty lucky like that, I think.
DOCTOR: Very good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements... anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a multi-vitamin sometimes, if I remember. Old habit, really. Nothing else. No prescriptions, no nothing. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's proceed with a physical examination. We'll start with your vitals, then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. And I'll need you to remove your shirt, Mr. Putney.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. Just the shirt, huh? Trying to keep this quick, Doc. Just let me know if you need anything else.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart rate is regular, but there's a slight murmur. Nothing that’s immediately concerning, but we’ll note it. Take a deep breath for me... and another one. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay. Ouch. That's a little tender. Right there. Not terrible, but yeah, it’s a bit sore. Sometimes feels a bit off after I eat, too. Just thought it was… something I ate.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Do you experience any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Not really vomiting, no. Sometimes a little… off, you know? Like my stomach is upset. And yeah, my… bowel habits, they aren’t always regular. Sorry to be so vague. It comes and goes. Haven’t really bothered getting it checked, figured it was just stress from work.
DOCTOR: "Stress from work" is rarely a comprehensive explanation, Mr. Putney. We'll need to investigate this further. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. I also recommend a CT scan of your abdomen to rule out any underlying pathology.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Look, Doc, I really just need this life insurance thing done. Is a CT scan really necessary? I mean, it's just a little stomach trouble. Can't we just… skip that part? This is getting complicated and expensive. I'm just trying to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I understand your desire for expediency. However, as a physician, my primary responsibility is to your health and well-being. Dismissing potential medical concerns based on a preference for lower cost is… irresponsible. Your symptoms, combined with the tenderness in your lower right quadrant, warrant a thorough investigation. A CT scan is not simply a matter of convenience; it's a crucial diagnostic tool. I strongly advise you to proceed with the recommended tests. If you decline, I will be unable to complete the medical examination for the life insurance policy, and I will document your refusal in your medical record.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, Doc. Do the scan. Just… let’s get it over with. I guess… I guess you’re right. I just don’t want any more hassle. When can I do it? Just tell me when and where, and I’ll be there.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ve sent the orders to the radiology department at St. Jude's Hospital. They can accommodate you tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. You'll need to fast for at least six hours beforehand. I'll have my nurse provide you with detailed instructions. While we await the results of the scan, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and maintaining a bland diet. Should you experience any fever, severe abdominal pain, or changes in your bowel movements, proceed to the nearest emergency room immediately. In the meantime, we'll consider this a preliminary evaluation for your life insurance application. The results of the scan will determine our next course of action. Do you have any questions, Mr. Putney?
PATIENT: No, Doc. No questions. Just… when will I get the results? And can I just… get dressed now? This has been… a long morning.
DOCTOR: The radiology department estimates the results will be available within 24 hours. My nurse will contact you as soon as they are received. You may get dressed now, Mr. Putney. I will review the results and contact you to discuss them further. And please, Mr. Putney, prioritize your health. Ignoring symptoms rarely leads to a favorable outcome. .
