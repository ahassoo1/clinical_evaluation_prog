DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's my back, mostly. It's been really painful lately. Not all the time, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: "Back pain." Right. And how long has this "pain lately" been occurring, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. Maybe...about three weeks now? It started kinda gradual, just a little ache after working in the garden, but it's gotten worse since then.
DOCTOR: Gardening, you say. And can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It's...hard to explain. It's not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, you know? But sometimes, when I bend over or try to lift something, it really stings. It feels like it's lower back, right across where your belt would be. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Adequate, I suppose. Does the pain radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate? You mean...does it spread? Sometimes, yeah, a little bit down my leg. Not all the way to my foot, thankfully, just kinda in the upper part of my thigh. It’s not constant, though.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: No, not really. No numbness or tingling. Just the ache and sometimes that pain down my thigh when I move a certain way. It doesn't keep me up at night, but it's definitely annoying. I’m just hoping it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed with a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table, Mr. Way. We’ll start with palpation of the lumbar spine.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Here we go... hope this doesn't hurt too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. There is tenderness to palpation at L4-L5. Muscle spasm present bilaterally, though not severe. Straight leg raise is negative bilaterally. Reflexes 2+ and equal. Strength 5/5 in bilateral lower extremities. Now, stand up, please. Let me observe your gait.
PATIENT: Okay. Here I go... Is that okay? Do you see anything...off?
DOCTOR: Gait appears normal, albeit slightly guarded. No visible abnormalities. Given your history and the physical examination findings, it appears you are experiencing a musculoskeletal strain, likely exacerbated by your gardening activities. It’s not uncommon.
PATIENT: A strain… okay. That doesn’t sound too bad. What does that mean I need to do? Is it something that’ll just go away on its own, or do I need…medicine or something?
DOCTOR: Usually, it resolves with conservative management. I will prescribe a short course of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug – ibuprofen, 600 milligrams, three times daily with food. And rest, Mr. Way. Avoid strenuous activities, especially gardening, for at least two weeks. Over-the-counter pain relief can also be used as needed. Here. Now, are there any other concerns?
PATIENT: Okay, ibuprofen… got it. Two weeks, no gardening. That’ll be tough, but I can try. Um… no, I think that covers it. Just hoping it gets better soon. I’ve got a lot of weeding to do, you see. Is there anything I should be worried about? Like, if it doesn’t get better after two weeks?
DOCTOR: If the pain does not improve after two weeks, or if you experience any new symptoms—such as weakness, numbness, or bowel or bladder dysfunction—consult a specialist. A physical therapist or an orthopedist would be appropriate. Do not return to me. Any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. No weakness or numbness...got it. A physical therapist, not you. No, I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Good day, Mr. Way. .
