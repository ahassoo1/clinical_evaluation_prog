DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thank you. I need a letter, actually. Confirming I’m able to fly. It’s for…well, a trip I’m planning, and they need official confirmation from a doctor. Is that something you can help with?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We do those fairly often. It’s called a Fit to Fly letter. To make sure I can write one for you, I'll need to ask a few questions about your health, just to be sure everything’s okay for air travel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Ask away. I don’t really have any major health problems, but I’m happy to answer whatever you need. It’s just…a bit stressful planning this trip, and this letter is the last thing holding me up.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear you don’t have major concerns. Let's start with the basics then. Do you have any current medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had some…complications a few years back, after my husband passed, and was briefly hospitalized for exhaustion and grief-related issues, but I’ve fully recovered. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. Nothing a good night’s sleep doesn’t fix. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, exhaustion and grief-related issues a few years ago… that’s good information to have. And yes, your Medicare is relevant, it helps me access your records. Let me pull those up quickly… Alright, I see a brief admission a few years ago, as you mentioned. Anything ongoing related to that, or any other health issues since then?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I went to therapy for a while, which helped a lot, and I’ve been…managing. Truly, I feel very healthy now. No regular medications, no specialist appointments, nothing like that. I try to stay active, eat well, and just…keep busy. It's been a few years, and I've really moved on. Would knowing about my husband’s health history be useful? He had…some heart problems.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re doing so well. And yes, knowing about your husband’s health history would be useful, thank you for offering that. Any specific heart conditions, or just generally some problems?
PATIENT: He had… cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy, I think. It was genetic, the doctors said. He was diagnosed when he was in his early fifties, and it…progressed fairly quickly. He needed a pacemaker eventually. I don't know the specifics of the type, unfortunately. It was all very…overwhelming at the time. Does that information help? I’m happy to provide more details if you need it, though I don’t have any medical records with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, dilated cardiomyopathy... that’s helpful to know, thank you. Because it was genetic, it's good we're discussing this. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any cardiac testing done yourself?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. The doctors never recommended any testing for me specifically, after he passed. They said, at the time, it was unlikely to be a concern since I hadn’t shown any symptoms. I was…younger then, and grieving, so they probably attributed any fatigue or anxiety to that. I haven't experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or anything like that, ever. Just…the usual stress. Is that something you would recommend now? I'm not opposed to it, but I'd rather not if it's not necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s fair. Given your husband’s history, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to do a quick EKG just to get a baseline and make sure everything is looking good. It's a quick, non-invasive test, and it can give us some peace of mind. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that…sounds sensible. Peace of mind is good. If it’s quick and non-invasive, then absolutely. I don't want to cause any trouble, but I want to be sure I’m safe for this trip. When can we do it?
DOCTOR: Great. We can do it right here in the examination room. It will only take a few minutes. Let me just prep the equipment… While I'm doing that, just let me quickly review your allergies and current medications, just to double-check. Do you have any known allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, thankfully. And as I said, no current medications. Just a lot of tea, if that counts! Honestly, I’m usually very healthy. It’s just…this trip is important to me, and I want to be sure I can handle the travel. It's to visit some family I haven't seen in a long time.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. Travel can be stressful. No worries about the tea! Alright, if you could just lie back for me… We’ll just place these small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It doesn't hurt at all, just a little cool sensation. I'll explain what I'm doing as I go. We're just looking for the electrical activity of your heart.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds easy enough. Please do explain, I’m always a bit nervous around medical equipment, even when I know it’s harmless. It's silly, I suppose, but it reminds me of…well, never mind. Just tell me what you're doing, and I’ll try to relax. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, it's perfectly normal to feel a bit anxious. We'll take it slow. I'm just placing these small stickers – these are electrodes – on your chest, arms, and legs. They detect the electrical signals that make your heart beat. We're looking for a regular rhythm and no signs of any abnormalities. It's completely painless. Just try to breathe normally and stay still. Alright, here we go… Just a few moments…
PATIENT: Okay… I’m trying to relax. It’s just… this is a bit overwhelming, bringing up memories. But I’m fine. Just…doing my best to breathe. Is it… is it going to take long? I feel a bit silly being so anxious, but I can't help it. I just want to get this letter and go on my trip.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, completely understandable. You are not silly at all. And it's almost done. Just a few more seconds... Alright, all done. Let me take a look at the results... Okay, everything looks normal. Your heart rhythm is regular, and there are no obvious signs of any problems. It’s a good baseline reading. It’s a relief, honestly.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! That’s such a relief to hear. Thank you, Doctor. Truly, thank you. So… does that mean you can write the letter? I’m so glad everything looks normal. It took a weight off my shoulders, honestly. This trip is very important to me, and knowing I’m healthy enough to go is everything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Yes, I can definitely write the Fit to Fly letter for you. It just takes a moment to finalize it. I’ll include a statement that your heart rhythm is normal based on the EKG we just performed, and that you are generally in good health and able to travel. While I'm doing that, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. The letter is all I needed. Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. You were very patient and understanding, especially with my…anxiety. I really appreciate it. It's good to know there are doctors who listen. Just let me know when it's ready, and I’ll be happy to sign anything that needs signing.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. It’s my pleasure. Here's the letter. It’s one page, stating your fitness to fly. Please review it, and let me know if everything looks correct. There’s a section at the bottom for your signature. And honestly, it’s my job to listen and make you feel comfortable. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it’s good you’re taking this trip. I hope you have a wonderful time visiting your family. Is there anything else at all before you go?
PATIENT: Yes, this looks perfect. Everything is correct. Thank you so much! Here you go. No, that’s everything. Really. I appreciate your kindness and patience more than you know. You've made this whole process so much easier. I think… I think I can finally relax now. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. It was my pleasure helping you. Safe travels, and enjoy your visit with your family. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a wonderful day.
