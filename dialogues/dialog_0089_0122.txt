DOCTOR: Hi Venus, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is… a pleasure, I suppose. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, my memory. It is not what it was. I find myself… forgetting things. Small things, mostly. But it worries me. I am hypertensive, you see. And I have noticed this… recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus, it’s good to know your name and that you’re aware of your hypertension. It's smart to be proactive about changes, especially with that history. “Recently” is helpful, but could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. “Recently”… perhaps three months? No, maybe four. It is difficult to say precisely. It began… subtly. I would misplace my keys, for example. Or forget a name, someone I had just met. Now… now I sometimes forget what I was doing. I was making tea yesterday, and… I simply stopped. I stood there, unsure why I was holding a kettle. It frightens me, Doctor. I have always had a very good memory. I remember details… everything.
DOCTOR: That is concerning, Venus, and it's good you're paying attention to it. A change in memory, especially when it’s impacting what you're doing mid-task, definitely warrants a closer look. You said you remember details, which is good – that's helpful. Just to be clear, are these memory lapses associated with any difficulty with speech or understanding?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. My speech is… normal, I believe. And I understand everything perfectly. It is only the remembering. I can speak, I can listen, I can… think, I suppose. But the thoughts… they do not always stay. It is like… a wisp of smoke. There, and then… gone. And it is not confusion. I know I should remember something, but… I do not.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. No speech or comprehension issues is good. And you're describing a very specific type of memory difficulty. Let's go through some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. You mentioned hypertension – are you currently taking any medications for that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I take… Amlodipine, I believe it is called. Five milligrams, once daily. And… Losartan, fifty milligrams, also once daily. I have been taking them for… oh, perhaps ten years now? It is difficult to recall the exact time. My husband… he always managed the medications. But he is… gone now. So, I manage it myself. I try to manage it myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine and Losartan, both for hypertension. Ten years is a significant duration. And I understand it’s been a change managing things on your own. Good for you for taking the initiative. Besides the hypertension, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else, that I am aware of. I had… a gallbladder removed, many years ago. But that was… routine, I believe. And… arthritis in my knees, but it is… manageable with over-the-counter pain relief. I do not see a specialist for it. I had a… a full physical examination last year. The doctor said everything was… satisfactory. I do not recall anything significant being discovered.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, arthritis, and a satisfactory physical exam last year. That’s good to know. And you're taking over-the-counter pain relief for the arthritis. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions in your family?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we do not speak much of such things. My mother… she became… withdrawn in her later years. She would forget names, and… repeat herself. But we attributed it to old age, and… loneliness. My father… he was very healthy, until… the end. No, I do not believe there were any cases of dementia, specifically. But my grandmother… she was… confused, I recall. It was many years ago, and I was very young. I do not have precise details.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. A history of some memory issues and confusion in your mother and grandmother is worth noting. Now, let's touch on your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I do not drink alcohol. I have never smoked. And… recreational drugs? Heavens, no. I was raised… properly. I have always led a… quiet life. I prefer tea, and… reading. I spend much of my time… tending to my garden. It keeps me… occupied.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet life with tea, reading, and gardening. That's lovely. And good to know about no alcohol, smoking, or recreational drug use. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have no known allergies. None that I am aware of, at least. I have… eaten everything, throughout my life. I have never had a… a reaction, or anything of that nature. I am… quite careful with what I consume. I do not believe in… unnecessary risks. Is this… all you require?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Thank you for answering all those questions, Venus. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical and neurological exam, just to get a baseline and see if we can identify anything that might be contributing to your memory concerns. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. If it is necessary. I… I would prefer to be swift, if possible. I have… appointments later this afternoon. But I understand. If it will help… then please proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venus. We'll keep it as quick as possible. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 150/90. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Now, let's do a quick neurological exam. I'm going to check your reflexes. Those are normal. Now, I’m going to check your coordination. Could you please touch your nose with your finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that… satisfactory? I do not wish to waste your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very good. Your coordination seems fine. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat a few words after me. I’ll say three words, and I want you to remember them. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I am ready. Please proceed. I have a… good memory, you know. But I would prefer to be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Is that… correct? I believe I have them. Now, may we proceed?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your orientation. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date… It is… August 2nd, 2025. Is that correct? I believe so. It is… difficult to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: We are… in your office, Doctor. In the clinic. A suburban clinic, I believe. Is that… sufficient? I hope I am not… causing you too much trouble.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly fine, Venus. You're not causing any trouble at all. Now, one last thing. I'm going to ask you to copy this shape. Can you draw that on this piece of paper?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that… acceptable? I… I believe I have replicated it accurately.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Venus. Alright, based on this brief exam, and what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some mild cognitive impairment, possibly related to changes in blood pressure over time, or possibly something else. The drawing is a little off, and repeating the three words and recalling the date were perfect, but some difficulty with the drawing is a slight concern. I want to order some blood work to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. They can perform more detailed tests to determine the exact cause of your memory problems. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds reasonable. Blood work, and a neurologist. If it will help determine the cause… then please proceed. I trust your judgment. I simply wish to… understand what is happening. And… to regain my memory, if possible. May I ask… what is involved with the neurological assessment? And… how long will this process take? I have… commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The neurological assessment will involve a more in-depth review of your medical history, a detailed neurological exam, and a series of cognitive tests to assess different areas of your brain – memory, attention, language, and problem-solving. It typically takes about an hour to two hours. The neurologist will then discuss the results with you and recommend a treatment plan, if needed. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, she’s an excellent neurologist in the area. The blood work will be a standard panel, and we can get the results back within a week. I’ll also give you a list of resources for cognitive health and support groups. In the meantime, it's important to continue managing your blood pressure, get regular exercise, and maintain a healthy diet. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not believe so. This is… all very helpful. A neurologist, blood work, and… resources. I will follow your instructions carefully. Thank you for your time. And… for your patience. I believe… that concludes our visit? I wish you a pleasant day.
DOCTOR: Yes, Venus, that concludes our visit for today. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get the blood work ordered, and the referral sent over to Dr. Sharma. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to hearing from you. .
