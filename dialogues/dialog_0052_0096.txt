DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Arbin. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s this sun, really. I’m getting… sensitive to it. Not a burn, exactly, but it feels really uncomfortable when I’m out, even for a little bit. It’s been happening for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Arbin. Sensitivity to the sun developing over a few weeks. That is certainly worth investigating. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the discomfort in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s not painful, not really. More like… a really strong burning feeling, especially on my face and around my eyes. And sometimes my skin feels tight and itchy. It happens pretty quickly after I've been outside, even if it's cloudy. It feels worse if I’m looking at bright things, even inside sometimes. Like, staring at a computer screen for too long can make it feel… aggravated. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A burning sensation and tightness, particularly on the face and around the eyes, exacerbated by sunlight and bright screens… that gives me some initial thoughts. To get a clearer picture, let's go through a few questions. First, have you noticed any visible rash, blisters, or changes in skin texture along with this sensitivity?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No rash, no blisters, skin feels pretty normal to the touch, just… sensitive. It doesn't look different, if that makes sense. It's all just… feeling different, uncomfortable. I checked in the mirror a few times, worried about a burn, but I don't see anything obvious.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Arbin. No visible changes to the skin. Now, have you started any new medications, skincare products, or detergents recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… no new medications, no. And I’ve been using the same soap and laundry detergent for ages, so not that either. I did try a new face wash maybe a month ago, a recommendation from a friend… something with Vitamin C in it, I think? I stopped using it a couple of weeks back, when I started noticing this sensitivity getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information. A new Vitamin C face wash, stopped using it around the time the symptoms worsened. Vitamin C can sometimes cause irritation, but we’ll need to explore other possibilities as well. Now, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. I don’t really have a lot of history, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing major. No allergies that I know of. I lost my wife, Ama, two years ago, which was… hard. Other than that, I'm pretty healthy. I try to eat well, get some exercise. I haven't seen a doctor in a while, to be honest, everything's been pretty good until now. Oh, and I have Medicare.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Ama. It’s understandable that’s been difficult. And it's good to hear you generally maintain a healthy lifestyle. No known allergies and Medicare coverage, noted. Now, has anyone else in your family experienced similar skin sensitivities or eye problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had… some issues with her eyes when she was older, cataracts, I think. But not skin problems, not really. And my father… he didn’t really talk about his health much. I don't recall anyone else in the family having something like this, though. We weren’t really a family that went to the doctor a lot, if I'm honest. Mostly traditional remedies, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. Maternal history of cataracts, no known family history of similar skin sensitivities. Thank you for sharing that. Now, could you briefly describe your typical daily routine?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a dental assistant, so I’m mostly inside during the day, but I do walk to and from the bus stop, maybe fifteen minutes each way. When I get home, I usually try to do some gardening – I like growing vegetables. Evenings, I cook, read, watch a little TV. Weekends I volunteer at the community center. I try to stay busy. I guess I’m outside for an hour or so most days, depending on the weather.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. So, a mix of indoor and outdoor activities. Now, to get a better sense of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll need to check your eyes and skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever tests you need. It’s just… this feeling is making it hard to concentrate. So if you want to get on with it, I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Arbin. I understand. Let’s begin. First, I’m going to check your vision. Could you please read the letters on this eye chart, starting with the top row?
PATIENT: Okay. Let me adjust my glasses… squints at the chart … Okay, I can see the top one… it's… E? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. Now the second line, please. I point to the second line of the chart.
PATIENT: Okay… um… squints harder, tilting my head… HD…? Is that right? It’s a little blurry…
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. A little blurry. Now, let me shine a light into each of your eyes. I gently examine Arbin’s pupils with a penlight, observing their reaction and the appearance of his retinas. "Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. I don't see any immediate signs of cataracts or other major abnormalities in the retinas. However, there is some mild redness around the conjunctiva in both eyes." I verbalize my findings for documentation. “Now, let's take a look at your skin. I’m going to gently examine the affected areas – your face, primarily. Please let me know if anything is particularly sensitive." I put on gloves and begin to examine Arbin’s face, carefully noting any redness, texture changes, or other visible abnormalities.
PATIENT: Okay. It feels a little warm when the light is shining in my eyes, but not too bad. And yes, my face is a little sensitive, especially my cheeks, right here. I gently point to my cheekbones. It feels… tingly, almost. Not painful, just… aware. And around my nose too. Like a mild sunburn, but without the burn.
DOCTOR: “There is mild erythema – redness – on your cheeks and around your nose. Skin texture is normal. No palpable lesions or swelling. It does feel slightly warmer to the touch than the surrounding skin." I step back slightly. “Based on what you've described and my initial examination, it’s possible you’re experiencing photosensitivity – increased sensitivity to sunlight. Given the new Vitamin C face wash and the timing of the symptoms, that’s one possibility we need to consider. Another possibility is a mild form of dermatitis. However, to rule out other causes and get a definitive diagnosis, I recommend a few laboratory tests.” “I’d like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel, just to get a baseline. I also think it would be helpful to perform a patch test to see if you have any allergic reaction to common skin irritants.” “Does that sound alright, Arbin?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If the face wash might be the cause, it’s good to check. And I don't mind the blood tests if it rules things out. Patch tests too, if it helps. I just want to figure out what's going on, really. It's just… uncomfortable. So whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will write the orders for the blood work and patch test now. The lab is just down the hall; they should be able to accommodate you today. I’ll also provide you with a prescription for a mild hydrocortisone cream to help manage the discomfort in the meantime. It's over-the-counter, but I’ll write a prescription just to ensure you have the correct strength. "In addition, I recommend avoiding direct sunlight as much as possible until we have the test results. If you must go outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. " “We should have the blood work results back in a few days, and the dermatologist will contact you to schedule the patch test. I'll also want to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very good. The cream will be helpful, I'm sure. And avoiding the sun… I can do that. Two weeks sounds fine for the follow-up. Just… it's good to have a plan, really. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. I understand it can be unsettling when you're unsure of what's going on, so I’m glad we could formulate a plan. “Here are the prescriptions and the lab order. The nurses will give you instructions on where to go for the blood work. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.” “I’ll also send a summary of our conversation and the lab orders to your primary care physician. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor Shely. I appreciate you taking the time. I’ll go get the blood tests done. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. If anything changes or your symptoms worsen, please call us immediately. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Goodbye.
