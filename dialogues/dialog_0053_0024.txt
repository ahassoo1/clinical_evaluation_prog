DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, thank you, Doctor Pitmon. It’s… a bit of a strange one, actually. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. My travel insurance company requires it. I lost my husband six months ago, and I’m finally trying to go visit family overseas… they want this letter just in case. It’s… a formality, I guess, but they won't let me book anything without it.
DOCTOR: A letter for fitness to fly… Right. And you’re generally healthy, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I’ve always been quite healthy. I eat well, I try to walk every day… nothing major, but I don’t have any ongoing health problems. I have Medicare, if that helps? And, like I said, it’s just this one thing, the insurance company. It feels a little silly, honestly.
DOCTOR: Medicare is noted. Still, an airline can refuse transport if they deem you unfit, so we do have to cover all bases, even if it is a formality. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Not that I know of, anyway. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing… chronic. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything, haven’t had any surgeries… Really, I'm in good shape. I just... want to see my family. It's been a long time. Is there a form I need to fill out or something? I'm happy to provide any information you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no prior hospitalizations, no surgeries… and you say you’re generally healthy. Have you seen any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Not since… well, not since my husband passed. I had a general check-up with my family doctor about a year ago, just the usual things – blood pressure, cholesterol, that sort of thing. Everything was fine then, but I haven’t seen anyone since. Honestly, I avoided it for a while. It was… difficult. But I'm ready now, to travel, I mean. I just need this letter.
DOCTOR: I understand. Avoiding things is perfectly natural in your situation. So, a check-up a year ago, all normal. Have you been taking any medications at all – even over-the-counter things regularly?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not even vitamins, usually. I try to get everything I need from my food. Sometimes I take something for a headache if I need it, but that’s… very occasional. Like, maybe once or twice a month, if that. Just regular paracetamol. It's nothing consistent. Would knowing the brand name help?
DOCTOR: No, paracetamol is fine. We're just building a complete picture here. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. No reactions to anything I’ve ever tried. Food, medication, animals… nothing. I used to help my mother garden, and I never had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I always thought I was lucky, in that respect. It would be awful to find out something now, before a long flight.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to confirm, you've not experienced any recent changes in your health?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Honestly, I feel… normal. A little sad, of course, still grieving, but physically, I’m completely fine. No dizziness, no shortness of breath, no chest pain… nothing. I've been walking a lot more, actually, trying to keep busy. Just... wanting to feel like myself again. Is this taking too long? I’m happy to provide more detail if you need it.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not… taking too long. It's just… with a long flight, we need to rule out anything that could be exacerbated by the change in cabin pressure or prolonged sitting. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. A quick exam sounds fine. I just want to get this sorted so I can finally book those tickets. Should I… change into a gown or anything?
DOCTOR: No gown necessary. Just your usual clothes are fine. Let’s start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I’ll listen to your lungs and have a quick look in your ears. Simple routine check.
PATIENT: Okay, good. Sounds manageable. I'm ready whenever you are. I always worry about blood pressure readings though, they seem to go up at the doctor's office, even when I'm calm. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: It’s quite common for blood pressure to be slightly elevated in a clinical setting – it's called "white coat hypertension". But we'll take a few readings to get an accurate picture. 138 over 82… a bit on the higher side, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Rate is regular, no murmurs. Lungs sound clear. Ears look normal as well.
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds good. Is that… is that a good result? I’m not very familiar with those terms, “murmurs” and everything. Does that mean I’m okay to fly?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sayar, the physical exam was unremarkable. No obvious concerns. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Before I can write a letter confirming your fitness to fly, I'd like to repeat a blood pressure reading in a few minutes, and I'd recommend a simple ECG, just to rule out anything underlying that might be contributing. It's a quick, painless test. It's just a precaution, given the circumstances and your slightly elevated reading. It's better to be safe, especially with a long flight.
PATIENT: An ECG? Oh. That sounds… more complicated. Is it necessary? I mean, I’ve never had any heart problems. And I really just need this letter. It feels like it’s getting… drawn out. I just want to visit my family. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, with all due respect, “just needing a letter” is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. A flight can put stress on your cardiovascular system, and a slightly elevated blood pressure warrants investigation. The ECG is non-invasive and takes only a few minutes. It will give me peace of mind, and more importantly, ensure your safety during travel. I understand your eagerness to visit your family, but I won’t jeopardize your health for the sake of convenience. It’s a standard precaution. Think of it as a small step to ensure a safe and enjoyable journey. Do you agree to the ECG?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. If you think it’s necessary, I’ll do it. But I really hope it doesn't take too long. And it just feels… like a lot, after everything. But, yes. Please. Let's get it done. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: The technician is just down the hall, Room 3. They'll explain the procedure. It involves placing some electrodes on your chest. It won't take more than ten minutes. I'll review the results as soon as they're available. And Ms. Sayar, please try to relax. The more stressed you are, the higher your blood pressure will be.
PATIENT: Right. Electrodes… Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll just… go and find Room 3 then.
