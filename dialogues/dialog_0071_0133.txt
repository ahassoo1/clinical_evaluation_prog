DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I just need some papers signed. They’re health forms, and they need a notary, I think. Something about verifying them. I’m hoping you can help me with that, and get it done quickly if possible. I have a lot on my plate today.
DOCTOR: Health forms, right. Notary… yes, yes. I think we can manage that. Just let me pull up your file… Melvenia Tippens… Ah, here we are. And you said these are just for verification purposes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Just verification. It’s for… well, it's a long story, honestly. It's for some assistance I'm applying for. Nothing serious, just paperwork. Is there a form you need me to fill out, or should I just hand you the ones I brought? I have them right here in my bag.
DOCTOR: Oh, don’t worry about explaining the details, dear. No need to burden yourself. And let's see… just hand me the forms you have. I'll take a look and see if I can sign them for you. It shouldn’t take too long. Please, go ahead.
PATIENT: Here they are. Sorry for the mess, I haven’t had a chance to organize things lately. It’s all… rather important, you see. I really appreciate you fitting me in today. I’m not very good with all this official stuff.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, quite a stack… Now, these forms… they seem to be requesting a pretty thorough medical history. Just to be sure, and for my records, could you tell me a little bit about any health issues you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A thorough history… Well, that's a bit much, isn't it? I’ve lived seventy-six years, Doctor! It’s hard to remember everything. Let me see… I had a bad flu a few years back, and my knees ache something awful in the cold weather. And I had my gallbladder out when I was younger. But nothing serious lately. Honestly, I feel pretty good for my age. Is that enough, or do you need specifics?
DOCTOR: Flu, aching knees, gallbladder removal… alright. And you said the knees bother you more in cold weather?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Especially damp cold. It’s hard on them. It makes walking difficult sometimes. I mostly just try to stay warm and take it easy. I don’t really do much these days, so it’s not a huge problem. Do you need to know how much it bothers me? Like, on a scale of one to ten? I’m not sure I understand all this paperwork.
DOCTOR: No, no, don’t worry about a scale. Just trying to get a general idea. And you said you feel pretty good overall?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty good. I mean, I'm seventy-six! There's always something that aches, isn't there? But I don't have any major illnesses, I don't take a lot of medications, and I can still get around, even if my knees complain. I eat reasonably well, I sleep okay… I’m generally quite independent, you see. Is this information helpful? I’m starting to feel like I’m giving you my life story.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is all very helpful. Independent, eats well, sleeps okay… good. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, just a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes. But not every day. Only when it gets a bit high. And… oh, I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because I don’t get much sun. That’s it, really. A small pill for the blood pressure, and the vitamin D. Nothing fancy. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, as needed, and vitamin D. Good. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. You know, I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle when I’m around cats, but that’s it. Not a true allergy, I don’t think. Nothing serious enough to worry about, anyway. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. Is this almost done? I have to get going soon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more quick questions. Have you had any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Well, there was a small thing on my arm when I was a child, they removed a mole. And… oh! And I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, of course. That’s it, I think. Nothing else major. Just the gallbladder, the mole, and the… the other thing. I'm so sorry, it’s hard to remember everything after so many years!
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy, mole removal… alright. And finally, do you have any family history of serious illnesses – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s a tough one. My mother had heart trouble, I think. And my uncle died of something… cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to my family. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. There was a lot of sickness on both sides, if I remember correctly. But I couldn’t tell you specifics. Is this important? I really don't have a good memory for things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that gives me a general idea. Now, regarding these forms… they require a more detailed medical assessment than just a quick history. Given your age and the… vagueness of some of the information, I’m not comfortable signing them without a proper physical exam and some basic blood work. It's just to be safe, you understand. We just need to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: A physical exam? And blood work? Oh dear. That’s… that’s more than I expected. I just thought you could sign the papers. I don’t really… do doctors. And I don’t have insurance, you see. I was hoping to avoid all this. Is there… is there anything else I can do? I really just need these forms signed.
