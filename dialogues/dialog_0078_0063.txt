DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My back... it hurts really bad. It’s been hurting for a while, but it’s gotten much worse lately. I already told the lady at the front desk, but… I have cancer, you see. And this back pain… it feels different than before.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Meigs. It’s good you mentioned the pain getting worse, and thank you for sharing that you’re undergoing treatment for cancer. It’s important for me to know everything that’s going on with your health. When you say it feels different, could you describe how it’s different from the pain you’ve experienced before?
PATIENT: Hmm… before, it was like a dull ache, you know? Like I just worked too hard in the garden. I could take some pills and lie down and it would get better. But this… this is sharp. Like someone is stabbing me. And it goes down my leg now, all the way to my foot sometimes. It makes it hard to walk. It's not just when I move, either. It hurts even when I’m trying to rest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A sharp, stabbing pain radiating down your leg, even at rest, is certainly something we need to investigate further. So, to get a clearer picture, let’s talk a little more about this pain. First, can you tell me approximately when you first noticed this new sharp pain?
PATIENT: Let me think... it started about two weeks ago, I think. Maybe a little longer. Around July 20th, maybe? I was trying to lift a heavy box for my grandson, and I felt a pop in my back. Not a loud pop, but I felt it. Then the pain started, but it wasn't this bad right away. It got worse slowly, over the last week or so. It's really been awful the last few days.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 20th, with a feeling of a "pop" while lifting a box for your grandson… that’s helpful information. And it’s gradually worsened over the past week. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… right now? It's probably an eight. Maybe even an eight and a half. It’s hard to even get comfortable. And when I try to stand up… oof. It takes my breath away. I've been taking the pain pills the doctor gave me for the cancer, but they don't seem to be helping much with this pain.
DOCTOR: I see. An eight and a half, and the cancer pain medication isn’t providing sufficient relief. That’s concerning. Now, Ms. Meigs, I’d like to ask about other symptoms. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Yes! That happens. My foot feels… kinda numb sometimes, especially at night. And my toes tingle. It’s not all the time, but it's been happening more and more lately. And… it feels kinda weak, like I can’t wiggle my toes as easily as I used to. It scares me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness, tingling, and weakness in your foot and toes. That's important information. Now, let's briefly review some of your medical history. I see here you’re currently undergoing treatment for cancer. Could you tell me what type of cancer you are being treated for, and what treatments you are receiving?
PATIENT: It's breast cancer. They found it last year. I’ve been getting… chemotherapy, and radiation. I finished the radiation a few months ago, but I’m still getting the chemo, every other week. It makes me tired a lot, and sometimes sick to my stomach. The doctor, Dr. Ramirez, is really good, but… this back pain is different than anything I've felt from the chemo. It feels like something new is going on.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Meigs. Breast cancer with ongoing chemotherapy… I understand. And you're right to be concerned about something new happening. Now, have you had any previous back problems or injuries before this recent incident with the box?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I’ve had a sore back sometimes from gardening, like I said, but nothing serious. I never went to the doctor for it. I just rested and took some pills. This is the first time it’s ever been this bad, and the first time it's gone down my leg. I used to be really strong, you know? I could lift anything. Now… not so much. It just feels… different. Like something is really wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous significant back issues. It sounds like this is a very different experience for you. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table, if you're able. We'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. I’ll also gently examine your back to see where the pain is most intense. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. I can lie down. It might be a little hard, but I'll try. I just… please be gentle, okay? It really hurts. I’m worried about something being broken.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Meigs. I will be very gentle. We’ll take it slow, and you can tell me immediately if anything causes too much pain. If you could lie on your back for me, please. Okay, I’m just going to gently feel along your back. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. … Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right there. That spot… that hurts really bad. And when you push on it, it shoots pain down my leg. Not all the way to my foot, but down my thigh. Please be careful… it's very sensitive.
DOCTOR: I understand. Tenderness and radiating pain with palpation at L4-L5… That's helpful information. Now, I’m going to ask you to keep your leg straight while I gently lift it. Tell me if you feel any pain going down your leg with this maneuver. … Any pain with that?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes! Right down my leg! It’s that sharp pain again, like electricity. Not in my foot, but definitely down my thigh. And… it makes my back hurt more too. Please stop… it’s too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, I’m stopping right away. I apologize for that discomfort. That’s a positive straight leg raise test, which suggests nerve irritation. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your leg. … Your reflexes are a little diminished on the affected side. And finally, I’m going to ask you to resist my hand as I try to move your leg. Just try to hold it still. … Your strength is a little weaker on the affected side as well. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. I’ve documented my findings. Based on your history and the exam, it seems likely you have a nerve compression, possibly a herniated disc or sciatica. However, given your history of cancer and ongoing chemotherapy, we need to rule out other possibilities. I would like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… serious. But okay, if you think it’s necessary. I just want to know what’s going on and what we can do to make the pain stop. I'm scared it's the cancer, spreading to my back. Is that possible? Will the MRI show that?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Meigs. It’s absolutely possible for cancer to spread, and it’s right to ask those questions. The MRI will help us determine if there’s any involvement of the bone or surrounding tissues by the cancer. It will also show us if there’s a herniated disc, nerve compression, or any other structural issues causing your pain. While nerve compression is more likely given your description and exam findings, we need to rule out other causes, including potential metastatic disease. I’ll write the order for the MRI now. It will be scheduled at the imaging center across town. They'll contact you to set up an appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a stronger pain medication and a muscle relaxant to help manage your symptoms. I’ll also recommend physical therapy once we have the MRI results, to help strengthen your back and core muscles. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A stronger pain pill would be a big help. And physical therapy… okay. I’m willing to try anything. Will the MRI take a long time? And will it hurt? I don’t do well with being closed in, you know? It makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important concern to bring up, Ms. Meigs. It's completely understandable to be anxious about being in a closed space. The MRI itself typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes. The machine is fairly large and you will be lying inside a tunnel. However, it’s not completely closed in. There’s an opening at both ends, and you’ll be able to see out. To help with your anxiety, you can listen to music through headphones during the scan. The technicians are also very accommodating and can offer you a blanket or eye mask if that would help. If you are extremely claustrophobic, we can discuss a mild sedative to take before the scan. We’ll make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. If you start to feel panicked during the scan, you can let the technician know immediately, and they can stop it right away. I'll write a note to the imaging center regarding your anxiety, so they are aware and can provide extra support. In the meantime, do you have any questions about the medications I’m prescribing?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m okay with the pills. Dr. Ramirez explained them pretty well before. Just… the MRI sounds scary, but I guess I have to do it. Will they tell me the results right away? Or do I have to come back to see you? I don't like waiting for bad news.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about waiting, Ms. Meigs. It's never easy waiting for test results. The imaging center will not give you the results directly. They will send the images and a report to my office. Once I receive them, I will review them carefully and schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. I typically receive the results within 24 to 48 hours. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as I've had a chance to review them, so you don’t have to wait unnecessarily. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call my office if your pain worsens or if you have any new symptoms. We're here to support you. Do you have any questions about the follow-up appointment, or anything else before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. And you explained everything really well. I still feel worried, but… at least I know what's happening now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I’m glad I could help ease some of your worries. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in this situation, and I want you to know I’m here to support you every step of the way. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment once the MRI results are available. Please call my office if you have any concerns before then. Take care, and please try to rest.
