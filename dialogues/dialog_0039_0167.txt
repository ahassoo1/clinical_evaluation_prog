DOCTOR: Hello, Emiliano. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, hello Doctor. Good day to you. It’s… my foot. It’s been giving me trouble for a little while now. A sore, you see. A bad sore that won’t get better. It hurts to walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been bothering you and making it hard to walk. I see… Alright. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it started small, like a little cut. But it… it just stayed. And got deeper, I think. And now it’s red and… sometimes it feels warm. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It hurts when I put weight on it. I try to wear soft slippers, but still… it’s not good. I don’t know what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started as a small cut, hasn’t really healed, and now it’s red, warm, and painful when you walk. Near your toes on the bottom of your foot… Has it been getting worse steadily, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Steady, I think. Not so much come and go. Just… slow. Slow getting worse. Maybe a little better when I rest it, but it always comes back. It’s been maybe… two months now? Hard to say for sure, time goes so fast. But two months, I think.
DOCTOR: Two months, okay. And you said it feels warm to the touch?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. Not always hot, but… warmer than the rest of my foot. And… sometimes I feel a little tingle, like pins and needles. Not all the time, just now and then. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, warm and occasionally a tingling sensation. That's helpful to know. Let’s take a look at it, if you don't mind. We’ll need to do a quick exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Please be careful. It hurts a bit. I hope it's not… too bad. I haven't been able to do much walking lately, and I miss my garden.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see… Hmm. Yes, I see the sore. It’s located on the plantar surface, near the base of your fifth toe. It appears to be approximately 2 centimeters in diameter, and there is some surrounding inflammation and a bit of drainage. The skin around it is also quite calloused. Does this feel particularly tender when I press here?
PATIENT: Aie! Yes, very tender. That hurts a good bit. Like… a burning pain. And… a little bit of a deep ache, too. It’s been bothering me even when I’m not walking, just sitting here. Is it… infected? I worry about that. My wife… she used to say… well, never mind. But I worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your worry. It does appear there’s some inflammation, and the pain you’re describing, along with the drainage, is concerning for a possible infection. It's good you brought this to my attention. I’m going to document my findings here. "Plantar ulcer, approximately 2cm in diameter, with surrounding erythema and tenderness to palpation. Patient reports drainage and a burning sensation. Concerned for possible infection." To be sure, we need to do a quick test to see if there's an infection. A swab of the sore will help us identify the bacteria, if any. Would you be alright with that?
PATIENT: A swab… yes, Doctor. If that will help. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to get better. And to not… to not get worse. My wife… she always took care of my feet. I miss her very much. But yes, a swab, please. If it will help.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emiliano. I’m going to gently clean the area and then take a small swab sample of the sore. It might sting a little, but it shouldn’t be too painful. It will only take a moment. I'll send this off to the lab, and we should have results back within a few days. Okay, that's done. Now, while we're waiting for the lab results, I want to make sure we rule out any other underlying issues, like poor circulation. Have you ever been told you have diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. Well, the doctor… a long time ago, he said my sugar was a little high. But he said it was nothing to worry about, just watch what I eat. I try to eat healthy, mostly. But I do like my poi. And my wife… she always made sweet treats. But the doctor… he didn’t say it was diabetes, just… watch my sugar. Is that… important? Maybe I should have listened more closely. I forget things so easily now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood sugar. That's good to know. Even a little bit of elevation can contribute to poor circulation and slow wound healing, so it's important we check it now. I’m going to draw a quick blood sample to check your blood sugar, A1C levels, and also check for signs of infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: More blood… ah, well. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I’m not fond of needles, but I trust your judgment. Yes, please. Check everything. I just want to feel better. I miss walking in my garden. It’s been too long. And… my wife would want me to take care of myself. So, please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emiliano. Just a quick pinch. Okay, all done. I’ll send this off to the lab right away. While we wait for the results, I recommend keeping weight off your foot as much as possible. I also want you to keep the wound clean and dry. I’ll write you a prescription for some antibiotic ointment and bandages. I think it’s best we see a podiatrist to take a look at this wound, too. They specialize in foot care and can help manage the healing process. I can write a referral for you. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Antibiotic ointment… bandages… and a podiatrist… yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever will help. A podiatrist… I’ve never seen one of those before. But if you think it’s best… I trust you. And thank you. For everything. I just want this sore to get better. So I can walk in my garden again. And… remember my wife. She loved my garden, too. Write whatever you think is best. And thank you again, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emiliano. I'm happy to help. I’ll get the prescription and referral written up for you now. The lab results should be back within a few days, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and the podiatrist's recommendations. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any increased pain, redness, swelling, or fever. Here is the prescription and referral. Take care of yourself, and I hope you're able to enjoy your garden again soon. .
