DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s about this… thing. A little… adjustment, you see. I need a paper signed. Said I gotta get cleared 'fore I… do it. Don't rightly remember who said so, though. Just gotta get it done, quickly if possible. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: An “adjustment,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A… cosmetic thing. Makes me look… presentable. Important for my line of work. People don't trust a man who doesn't look the part. Now, about that paper… is it a long process? I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I need a little more information than “cosmetic thing” to sign off on anything. What exactly is this procedure?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t recall the precise name. Some kind of… lifting. Makes the face… tighter. Younger looking. It was recommended to me… by a professional. A very good professional. I just need you to say I’m healthy enough to… withstand it. Is that too much to ask? I don't have time for descriptions, believe me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're busy, but I need to know specifics. "Lifting" could mean any number of things, some quite serious. And I absolutely cannot sign off on a medical procedure without knowing exactly what it is, and why you're having it done. Have you had any medical evaluations done for this procedure already?
PATIENT: Evaluations? Doctor, are you questioning my judgement? This professional assured me it was safe! Look, I fix towers for a living. I climb things, I work with electricity. I’m a strong man! I don't need a bunch of tests. Just tell me what paperwork needs signing and let’s be done with it. This is… ridiculous. I haven’t got insurance, you know. Every little thing costs money.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, your profession is… irrelevant. And the lack of insurance doesn't change my ethical obligations. I cannot authorize a procedure without understanding the risks, your medical history, and ensuring it won’t harm you. Tell me, have you experienced any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? No, Doctor. Nothing important. Just… getting older, I suppose. A few aches and pains, but who doesn't? Look, I'm a practical man. I don't need a whole examination for a little… touch-up. I just want the paper signed. Is that so much to ask? I've got deadlines, you see. People are relying on me. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I’m going to need to perform a basic physical exam before I can even consider signing anything. This isn't about deadlines, it's about your safety. Let’s start with your weight and blood pressure. And then we’ll discuss your medical history, allergies, and any medications you’re taking. Do you understand?
