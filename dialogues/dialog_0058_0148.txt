DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. It’s… pain. Down there. It’s been going on for… well, I’m not quite sure how long, to be honest. A few weeks, maybe? It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: “Down there,” you say. Right. Well, a few weeks is…not terribly specific, is it?
PATIENT: No, you’re right. I… I’m not very good with dates, I’m afraid. Things just… blur together, you know? It wasn’t sudden, just a slow ache that… got more noticeable. I suppose that doesn’t help much, does it? I apologize. I truly do. It’s just… difficult to recall precisely.
DOCTOR: Look, I appreciate you trying to be helpful, but “slow ache” could mean a million things. Is it constant?
PATIENT: No, not constant. It comes and goes. Mostly when I’m… active. You know, working with the wood. Lifting, bending… things like that. It's not sharp pain, more of a dull… heaviness, I suppose. And sometimes… a bit of a dragging sensation. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: “Working with wood?
PATIENT: Yes. I’m a woodworker. I… I make furniture, mostly. Small things. Tables, chairs, that sort of thing. I enjoy it, when I’m not… feeling this discomfort. It’s a bit difficult to concentrate when you’re constantly aware of… well, that. I mostly work alone, in my workshop.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you’re a… craftsperson. And this happens when you’re doing… strenuous physical labor. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not that I’ve consciously noticed. Let me see… maybe a little… fatigue, but I attributed that to being tired from the work. And perhaps… a bit of swelling, but I wasn’t certain. It's hard to tell with all the… layers, you know? I wouldn't say it's significant swelling, if that makes sense. Just… a fullness. I really am sorry I can’t be more precise. It’s all rather vague.
DOCTOR: “Layers.” Okay. Well, let's try to narrow things down. Any changes in your bladder or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it? No, not that I’m aware of. Everything seems… normal, in that regard. Though, perhaps I’ve been going to the bathroom a little more frequently, now that you mention it. But again, I just assumed that was from drinking more water because of the heat. I’m not sure if that’s related, or if I’m simply… imagining things.
DOCTOR: Right. And any bleeding, discharge, or fever?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. Definitely no bleeding. And no fever, as far as I know. I haven't felt sick, if that makes sense. No chills, no sweating… just this… discomfort. I haven’t been noticing anything unusual, truly. It’s mostly just… this ache, and the slight swelling. It’s just… worrying, because it’s interfering with my work. And I enjoy my work very much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, I suppose we should do a quick exam. Just to rule things out. Could you hop up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. If you’ll excuse me… Just let me know what you need me to do. I… I hope it won't be too unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to do a quick abdominal exam, then a pelvic exam. I'll explain everything as I go. Please let me know if anything is painful. There’s some tenderness here, on your left side. And… yes, I do feel a bit of swelling. It’s not huge, but it’s definitely there. Okay. There's some discomfort with palpation of your uterus and ovaries, and… yes, I feel a mass on your left ovary. It’s small, but it’s definitely there. I'm going to need to order some imaging to get a better look.
PATIENT: A… a mass? Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? Imaging? What kind of imaging? Will it… will it hurt? Is it… is it serious? I… I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: Look, it's probably nothing, okay?
PATIENT: "Probably nothing?" But you said… you felt a mass. And now you want imaging? That doesn’t sound like “nothing,” with all due respect. What could it be? Is it… cancer? Please, tell me something. I just want to understand. I don’t have anyone… I don’t have family. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not going to speculate. It could be a cyst, it could be fibroids, it could be something else entirely. That’s why we need an ultrasound and possibly a CT scan. We need to see what we’re dealing with before we jump to conclusions. I'm going to order those tests for you now. The ultrasound will be done in the radiology department tomorrow morning. And the CT scan will likely be scheduled for next week. I'll have the radiology department call you to schedule the CT scan. And I’m going to give you a referral to a gynecologist. You’ll need to follow up with them once we have the results of the tests. Does that sound… acceptable?
PATIENT: A gynecologist… yes, that sounds… sensible. An ultrasound tomorrow… and a CT scan next week. And then the gynecologist… it’s a lot to take in. Will the ultrasound tell you… everything? Will it show you what this mass is? And what if it is something serious? What… what are the next steps then? I… I'm a bit frightened, if I'm honest. I don't really know what to expect. And I don’t have anyone to… to help me through this.
DOCTOR: Look, the ultrasound will give us a better idea of the size and shape of the mass. But it won't necessarily tell us exactly what it is. That's why we need the CT scan and the gynecologist's opinion. As for what happens next… it depends on the results of those tests. It could be as simple as monitoring the mass over time, or it could require further treatment, like medication or surgery. Here's the referral to the gynecologist. Their office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’m going to write you a prescription for some pain medication to help manage the discomfort in the meantime. Honestly, it’s probably just a cyst. But we need to rule out anything serious, and that’s what we’re doing. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A cyst… you keep saying that. That’s… reassuring, I suppose. But what if it’s not? What if it is something more serious? And what kind of surgery? What are the risks? I know you can't tell me everything right now, but… I just need to know something. And… will this affect my work? I’m a woodworker. It’s… it’s very physical. Will I be able to continue? I… I just don't know what to do.
DOCTOR: Look, you’re catastrophizing. We haven’t even seen anything yet. It’s likely a benign cyst, and most of those resolve on their own. If it is something more, then the gynecologist will discuss your options with you, including the risks and benefits of surgery. As for your work… that depends on the type of surgery, if it’s even necessary. Honestly, you’re getting ahead of yourself. Let’s just focus on getting the tests done first, okay?
PATIENT: "Getting ahead of myself?" You're telling me I’m getting ahead of myself when you’ve told me you found a mass and are ordering a battery of tests? I have no family. No one to explain things to. No one to drive me to appointments. And you’re… dismissing my concerns? I’m frightened. And I’m alone. And frankly, I feel like you’re not listening to me. .
