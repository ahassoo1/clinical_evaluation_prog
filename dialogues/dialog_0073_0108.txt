DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, it's…well, it's my stomach. Been bleeding. Not a good time for it, honestly. It started a few days ago, just thought it was something I ate, but it hasn't let up. And it’s…a lot. More than it should be.
DOCTOR: Bleeding, you say. And it’s been going on for a few days now, and it's…significant. Can you describe what the bleeding looks like?
PATIENT: Significant is putting it mildly. It's…dark. Really dark. Almost black, you know? And it's not just when I…use the bathroom. Sometimes it's just…there. Mixed in with…well, you get the picture. I'm not one for details, if you catch my drift. It's… unsettling. And frankly, weakens a man. Not ideal, not at all.
DOCTOR: Dark, almost black… that’s concerning. And it’s not solely with bowel movements. Right. I understand you’d rather not dwell on specifics. Has this ever happened before, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I've had stomach trouble, sure, plenty of it. Being Yemeni, you eat a lot of…spicy things. But this is different. This isn't just a bit of indigestion. This is…serious. I’ve never seen anything like it. And believe me, I’ve seen things.
DOCTOR: I see. No prior episodes of this particular type of bleeding. You mentioned stomach trouble previously, but nothing like this. Can you tell me about these prior stomach issues?
PATIENT: Well, mostly just heartburn. Bad heartburn. And sometimes… cramping. Like, really bad cramping. I used to just chalk it up to the food, honestly. My wife, God rest her soul, she always told me to eat less chili. But it wasn’t just the chili. It was…everything, sometimes. I didn't bother going to the doctor about it. What's a doctor gonna tell me? “Stop eating spicy food?” I figured I'd just deal with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, recurrent heartburn and cramping, but this dark bleeding is a new development. Are you currently taking anything for the heartburn?
PATIENT: Taking anything? Look, I don't go for all that pharmaceutical nonsense. Never been a fan. A little baking soda now and then, if it's really bad. But that's it. My wife, she had all sorts of pills… never did her any good. I prefer to just…tough it out. Honestly.
DOCTOR: No regular medications, just occasional baking soda. Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bleeding and cramping?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I’ve been tired, real tired. More than usual. And…weak. Like I said. And… everything tastes…off. Like metal, almost. I figured it was the stress, to be honest. Still getting used to being on my own. It’s…lonely. But I don’t expect you to need to know about that.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, weakness, and a metallic taste in your mouth… those are all relevant, Mr. Gentz. Now, I’m going to need to ask a few more personal questions. This is to get a full picture of your health, so please bear with me. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm… Now that you mention it, yeah, I guess I have. My clothes are a little looser than they used to be. Didn’t really think much of it, figured it was the… the grief. Not been eating much of an appetite, to be honest. Everything just feels… pointless, you know? But yes. Definitely lost some weight. Not a lot, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Weight loss, along with the fatigue and decreased appetite. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits other than the bleeding?
PATIENT: Changes? Well…it's been looser, if you want to know. More watery than usual. And…more frequent. I spend a lot more time in the bathroom these days, let me tell you. And… it’s hard to…push it out. Like something’s blocking it, sometimes. But it's not every time. Just… sometimes. It's embarrassing to talk about, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Looser, more frequent stools, with some difficulty passing them at times. We’re getting a clearer picture here. Now, just to rule things out, have you had any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. No chills. I haven't been running a temperature, if that's what you mean. I feel weak, like I told you, but not…hot. I wouldn’t say I’ve been sweating more either. Just…tired. Really, really tired. It’s… draining, if you understand. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Now, I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen, and I will need to check a stool sample to assess the bleeding. We may also need to run some blood tests. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, if you want to know the truth. But… I suppose I have no choice, do I? Fine. Do what you need to do. Blood tests, stool sample… whatever. Just…get it over with. And be quick about it, alright? I don’t like being fussed over.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with listening to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll need you to relax as much as possible.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. And try not to make a mess, alright? I’m not fond of hospitals. Or clinics. Or anything that smells like… well, you get the picture.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. I’m hearing some slightly diminished bowel sounds. There’s also some tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, specifically on the left side. It doesn’t appear to be a rigid abdomen, but it is sensitive. Now, I’m going to need to collect a stool sample. There’s a collection kit in the bathroom. Please follow the instructions carefully. It’s important to get a representative sample.
PATIENT: Diminished bowel sounds and tenderness… just what I needed. Wonderful. A representative sample, you say? What does that even mean? Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? Just tell me what to do, plain and simple. Bathroom, kit, sample… got it. Don’t expect me to be happy about this. This is… humiliating.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Thank you. I’ll send the sample to the lab for analysis. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d also like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. This will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help to rule out any underlying issues.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Complete blood count, basic metabolic panel… more tests. Wonderful. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a…a science project. Look, how long is this going to take? I’ve got things to do, you know. I can’t spend all day in this…place. And don’t tell me it'll be a few days. I want a timeline. A realistic timeline.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. However, given your symptoms, I will expedite the process as much as possible. I'll also need to ask about your family history. Have there been any cases of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or other gastrointestinal issues in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, don't even get me started. My side of the family, we don't talk about things like that. Superstitious bunch, you see. But… my mother, she had… stomach problems. Bad stomach problems. Couldn't eat anything without being sick. Spent most of her life in pain. Never knew what was wrong with her. And… my uncle, he died young. Something with his… insides. But nobody talked about it. It was…bad luck, they said. Honestly, it’s not something I like to dwell on. It’s bad enough dealing with my own troubles.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mother with unspecified stomach problems and an uncle who died young with… internal issues. Not ideal, but it gives us something to work with. Now, let's talk about your diet. I realize you mentioned not being fond of discussing personal matters, but it’s important. Besides the spicy food, what else do you typically eat?
PATIENT: Look, I eat what I want, alright? I’m a grown man. Mostly meat, rice, some vegetables. Yemeni food. Kabsa, Mandi, fahsa… you wouldn’t know it, you probably can’t even pronounce it. Not exactly health food, I admit. But it’s good food. And I like it. I used to eat a lot more, before… everything. Now, my appetite's gone, like I said. I force myself to eat, just to keep my strength up. But it's…pointless, really. It all tastes like ash anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a typical Yemeni diet with a decreased appetite. And you've mentioned fatigue, weight loss, dark stools, and tenderness in your abdomen. Given your family history and these symptoms, I’m concerned about several possibilities. We need to rule out more serious conditions. I’m going to order a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Are you serious? Look, I’ve never had one of those, and frankly, I don’t want one. What’s wrong with just…giving me some pills? Or telling me to lay off the chili? This sounds…invasive. And humiliating. I’m not sticking a tube up there. Absolutely not. There’s got to be another way. Surely. I’m not doing that. No way.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with all due respect, I am a physician. A colonoscopy is the gold standard for evaluating the colon and detecting potential abnormalities. It is necessary to rule out serious conditions like colon cancer. Pills and dietary changes will not provide a definitive diagnosis. While I understand your discomfort, your health is my primary concern. We can discuss sedation options to minimize any anxiety. But declining a colonoscopy is not a viable option. Are you refusing medical advice?
PATIENT: Are you telling me what to do? Look, I’ve lived a long life, alright? I’ve made my own decisions. And I’m not about to start taking orders from a…a young doctor. I don’t need a colonoscopy. I need some rest. And maybe a strong cup of tea. I’m perfectly capable of making my own choices about my body. I’m not sticking a tube up there. Absolutely not. You can write me a prescription for something, or you can just…let me go. I’m wasting my time here. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand you’re upset, but I must reiterate that refusing a necessary medical procedure can have serious consequences. I am documenting your refusal. Please understand that I am ethically obligated to advise you on the best course of treatment. You are free to seek a second opinion, but I strongly urge you to reconsider. I wish you well, but I cannot provide further care without your cooperation. .
