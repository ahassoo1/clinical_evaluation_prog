DOCTOR: Right, Emileigh Bonck. Twenty-one years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. Well, I just moved here, and I need to, like, get set up with a doctor. It’s for… the healthcare thing? I have Medicare. I don’t really know what I’m doing.
DOCTOR: Medicare, yes. Rural area… explains a lot. Look, I’ve got a waiting room full of patients. "Getting set up" isn't a medical complaint. Do you have any actual health concerns?
PATIENT: Oh! Right, sorry. Um… not really? I mean, I feel okay. I work with machines all day, so sometimes my back gets a little sore, but that’s just… work, you know? Nothing bad. Is that okay? I just… wanted to make sure I had a doctor nearby, in case.
DOCTOR: So, preventative care, essentially. Fine. Though, wasting a physician’s time with a “just in case” visit is… not optimal resource allocation. Still. Back soreness. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Um… a long time? Since I started the job, I guess. Maybe… two years? It comes and goes. Like, some days it's fine, and some days it hurts to bend over. I usually just take some ibuprofen, and it gets better. I don't remember ever actually seeing a doctor for it.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen. Of course. Alright. Any radiating pain?
PATIENT: Radiating…? Like, does it go somewhere? I think… sometimes it feels a little funny in my leg, but not always. It’s hard to explain. Just like a dull ache, mostly in my lower back. Not sharp. Does that make sense? I’m sorry if I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: Dull ache… radiating to the leg. Vague symptoms. Alright. Let's try to be more precise. Does it worsen with specific activities?
PATIENT: Um… yeah! Bending over, for sure. And… lifting things. Heavy things, obviously. Sometimes even just sitting for too long makes it stiff. But walking usually helps. That makes it feel a little better, I think. I work on engines a lot, so I’m always bending and reaching. It's kinda part of the job.
DOCTOR: Right. So, musculoskeletal strain, likely. We can do a quick physical exam just to confirm, but I suspect you're just overdoing it. Stand up for me, if you would. Let's see your range of motion.
PATIENT: Okay… sure. Is it okay if I… take my time? It feels a bit stiff today. I don’t wanna fall or anything.
DOCTOR: Take your time. But try to be efficient. Now, bend forward and touch your toes. Don’t push it if it's painful. I'm watching for any limitation or asymmetry.
PATIENT: Oof… that’s… not great. I can kinda reach my knees, but it hurts a bit in my lower back. Not a sharp pain, just… a tight ache. It feels a little worse now, actually. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Limited range of motion, discomfort with forward flexion… as expected. Posture is… less than ideal, contributing to the strain. Palpation reveals tenderness over the lumbar spine. No signs of radiculopathy, thankfully. It’s a mechanical back pain. Likely muscle strain. We’ll need imaging if it doesn’t resolve. I’ll write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant. Use as directed.
PATIENT: Okay… a muscle relaxant. Will that… make me sleepy? I kinda need to, like, work. And what if it doesn't get better? What about the imaging? I don’t really understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, it may cause drowsiness. That's a side effect. But you’re young, hopefully you can tolerate it. Imaging… an X-ray or MRI, if this doesn't improve within two weeks. Don't overdo it, and come back if the pain worsens or you develop any numbness or weakness. I'm writing the prescription now. And a referral to physical therapy, just in case. Don't expect miracles. Any other complaints?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. Just my back. Physical therapy… what do they do in physical therapy? Is it… painful? I’m not good with… being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Physical therapy involves exercises to strengthen your core and improve your flexibility. They'll show you the correct way to lift things, so you don’t continue to damage yourself. As for "poking and prodding," it’s therapeutic manipulation. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it's not… torture. Here’s your prescription and referral information. Schedule an appointment with the physical therapist as soon as possible. Any further questions can be addressed at that appointment. Next!
PATIENT: Oh. Okay… thank you. I… I guess I'll go schedule that. .
