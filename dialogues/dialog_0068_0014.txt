DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well, my wife… she told me I needed to come in. Something about… papers. For work, I think? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Something about being… off? For a bit. I manage some things at the church, you see, and… well, she said I need something official. Maybe for leave? I'm Ronnald, by the way. Just in case that wasn’t clear.
DOCTOR: Right, Ronnald. Yes, I see here you're 67… and managing things at the church. And your wife suggested this visit… because you’ve been feeling “off”?
PATIENT: That's right. “Off” is a good way to put it. It's not… pain, exactly. Just… things don’t stick in my head like they used to. And I get tired quicker. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a sudden thing, you understand? More like… a slow fading. I still do everything, but… it takes more effort. And I forget things constantly. Names mostly, and… what I was going to do next. Honestly, I’m not even sure why I’m here. Is this about… being able to take some time off? From the church work, I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ronnald. So, memory issues… increasing fatigue… developing gradually. And your wife is concerned about your ability to continue your work at the church. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Appetite… I suppose not much. My wife does most of the cooking, and I eat what she puts in front of me. Weight… that’s a good question. I haven’t really been weighing myself. I feel… thinner maybe? But I wouldn’t swear to it. It’s hard to tell. We eat pretty healthy, I think. Lots of fish, fruit… the usual. Is this important, Doctor? Are we looking for something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful information, Ronnald. We need to rule things out. And yes, changes in appetite or weight can be important. Now, aside from the memory and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I can recall, no. No aches or pains, nothing like that. I sleep alright, I think. Maybe a little restless sometimes, but nothing major. Oh! Wait… sometimes I feel a little… shaky. Like my hands are trembling. But only when I'm trying to do something precise, like… writing. It's not constant, though. Is that something to worry about? I really don't like to bother people, Doctor. My wife said I had to come, though… she's a good woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ronnald. Hand tremors, particularly with fine motor tasks… that's good to know. And restlessness at night. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Uh… well, Doctor, that’s a rather personal question, isn’t it? I… I suppose they’re a little irregular. Not… terrible, but not like they used to be. More… frequent, maybe? And… sometimes a bit loose. But I just figured it was something I ate. Old age, maybe? I’m not really one to complain about such things. Is that something we need to worry about? I really don’t like to talk about… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ronnald. It is personal. But it's important for me to have a complete picture. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes be indicative of other issues. Now, have you noticed any difficulty with your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… I suppose I have felt a bit… unsteady on my feet sometimes. Not often, mind you. Just a little wobble here and there. I haven't fallen or anything, but… I’m more careful now. Especially on uneven surfaces. It’s probably just age, like I said before. And maybe a little bit of weakness in my legs. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I’m falling apart piece by piece. But I don't want to be a bother. My wife worries so much. Maybe I should just rest for a while and see if things improve?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ronnald. We've covered quite a bit. Memory issues, fatigue, tremors, changes in bowel habits, and some unsteadiness. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. My wife said you’re a good doctor. Just… try not to poke too much, if you don't mind. My joints aren't what they used to be. And please, don't be alarmed by anything you find. I've lived a good life, Doctor. A long life.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ronnald. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. We’ll check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. It won’t take long. Blood pressure is… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is normal.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds alright. I always get a little nervous at the doctor’s office, so maybe that’s why my blood pressure is up. It’s happened before. Just… try not to rush, if you can. I don’t want to feel like you’re in a hurry. And if you find something… well, just tell me straight. I can handle it. I think. Is my wife here? Did she come with me? I can’t seem to remember.
DOCTOR: Your wife did bring you in, Ronnald, and she’s waiting in the reception area. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a very faint murmur. Lungs are clear, but there’s some decreased breath sound at the bases. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Nose and throat look normal. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I think so. It's a bit hard to concentrate, honestly. Everything feels a little blurry around the edges. Is that normal? I used to have such good eyesight. I could see a fish jump a mile away when I was younger. My wife says I need new glasses, but… I just haven't gotten around to it. Is that what you think? New glasses will fix everything?
DOCTOR: It could be your vision, Ronnald. We'll definitely get that checked. But there’s some slight difficulty with your eye movements, and some slowness… that's concerning. Your reflexes are a little diminished, and there's some weakness in your legs. Also, you have a slight tremor in your right hand. You also have a slightly unsteady gait, and a wider base of support than normal. Ronnald, I’m concerned. Your symptoms, combined with the exam findings, suggest a possible neurological issue. We need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: A neurological issue? What… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? My wife… she always worries so much. Is it something that can be fixed? I just want to be able to go back to my church work. And… and see my grandchildren. Please, Doctor… tell me straight. What’s wrong with me? I’m scared.
DOCTOR: Ronnald, it's too early to say definitively what’s going on. There are several possibilities. It could be something relatively benign, but it could also be something more serious, like Parkinson’s disease or another neurological disorder. To get a clearer diagnosis, I’m going to order a brain MRI, and I want you to see a neurologist as soon as possible. They can perform a more detailed evaluation and determine the best course of action. I’m also going to order some blood tests to rule out any other potential causes. I know this is frightening, but it’s important to get this checked out promptly. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a very good neurologist in the area. She's excellent and will explain everything to you in detail. We'll get to the bottom of this, Ronnald. Do you have any questions right now?
PATIENT: MRI… neurologist… it’s all too much. My head is spinning. Parkinson's… that's… that's what my uncle had. He… he couldn't walk anymore. Will I… will I end up like him? And what about the church? What about my wife? I don’t want to be a burden. I just want answers. And I… I want to be able to remember things. Is there anything… anything at all I can do right now? Just to… to feel a little bit better?
DOCTOR: Ronnald, it’s natural to feel scared and overwhelmed. And it's important to remember that everyone’s case is different. Just because your uncle had Parkinson’s doesn’t mean you do. We need to get a diagnosis before we can know what we’re dealing with. For now, I want you to focus on taking things one step at a time. I’m going to have my nurse schedule the MRI for you as soon as possible, and we’ll get you in to see Dr. Sharma within the next week. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest, eat a healthy diet, and avoid stress as much as possible. We can also explore some options for memory support, such as cognitive exercises or physical therapy. I’ll write you a prescription for a mild anxiety medication to help you manage your stress in the short term. And remember, you’re not alone in this. I’m here to help you every step of the way, and so is your wife. We will figure this out together. .
