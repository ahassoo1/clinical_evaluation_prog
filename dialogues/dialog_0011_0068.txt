DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. My name is Dr. NEPL, and I’m a physician here at the clinic. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my legs. They’re swelling up. It started after… you know… the treatment for the cancer. It's not so good.
DOCTOR: I see. You’re experiencing swelling in your legs that began after cancer treatment. Thank you for sharing that. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about the treatment you received?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it was… a lot of… things. Pills, mostly. And then… some times I had to go to the hospital and get… stuff through the vein. I don't remember the names, honestly. It was a while ago, and… I just want it to stop hurting. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Queener. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t recall the specific names of the medications. Many patients find it difficult to remember details surrounding their treatment, especially after some time has passed. We can certainly work through this. To clarify, the swelling began after you completed the cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, after. It didn’t happen during. It was… a few weeks after I finished all the pills and the… vein stuff. Maybe a month? It started small, just my ankles feeling a little puffy, but now… now it’s higher up my legs. It’s uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, the swelling developed gradually, starting in your ankles about a month ago and progressing upwards along your legs. And you're experiencing discomfort, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, discomfort is a good word. It’s not… pain, exactly. More like… heavy. And sometimes itchy. Especially at night. It makes it hard to sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. A heavy sensation and occasional itching, particularly at night. That’s helpful to know. Ms. Queener, have you noticed any changes in the color or texture of your skin on your legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The skin… it feels a little… tight. And maybe a little darker, yes? I don’t know if it's just because of the sun, honestly. I try to be careful, but I like to sit in the garden sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. A slight darkening and tightness of the skin. Thank you. Now, aside from the swelling, discomfort, and changes to your skin, have you experienced any other symptoms—perhaps shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing like that. I'm tired sometimes, but… I'm 59! That's just… being old, you know? My appetite is fine. And I can breathe alright. Just the legs… they’re bothering me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Queener. It’s helpful to know those symptoms aren’t present. Now, regarding your medical history – do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see… The doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high a few years ago, so I take a little pill for that every day. And… I had a problem with my gallbladder when I was younger, but they took it out. That was a long time ago, though. Otherwise… no, not much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Queener. So, you manage your blood pressure with medication, and you had your gallbladder removed previously. Are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Um… just the one for the blood pressure, I think. And sometimes I take something for my knees, when they really hurt. It's just an over-the-counter thing, you know? Nothing strong. I don’t really like taking pills if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Queener. So, you take a medication for your blood pressure regularly, and an over-the-counter medication for your knees as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything! I love cheese, especially. And chocolate. No, nothing bothers me. I’m lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Queener. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… complicated. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. And my brother… he had trouble with his legs too, but I don’t remember exactly what it was. It wasn’t this, though. I don't think so. It was more like… they just stopped working, eventually.
DOCTOR: I see. A history of heart problems in your mother and leg issues in your brother. Thank you for sharing that, even though it's difficult to recall specifics. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well… I live alone. I like to garden, like I said. And I read a lot. I try to walk, but the legs make it hard sometimes. I mostly just sit and… watch the birds. It’s a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Queener. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll need to examine your legs and feet, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want this swelling to go away. It's starting to worry me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Queener. I’ve completed the exam. I am noting 2+ pitting edema bilaterally in your lower legs, meaning there is noticeable swelling that leaves a temporary indentation when I press on your skin. Your pulses are present but slightly diminished in both feet. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. I’m also observing some mild skin discoloration in the lower legs, consistent with what you described.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. What does it mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking, Ms. Queener. It is important to understand what's going on. Based on your history and the exam findings, the most likely explanation for your leg swelling is chronic venous insufficiency. This means the valves in the veins in your legs aren't working as effectively as they should, leading to blood pooling and fluid buildup. It’s often a consequence of previous vein issues, or can develop over time, and can be exacerbated by factors like prolonged standing or sitting. The cancer treatment could contribute, although it's less direct. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, such as a deep vein thrombosis or heart failure. To do that, I’d like to order a Doppler ultrasound of both legs to check for blood clots, and a complete blood count and a BNP level to assess your heart function. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Oh… valves… and blood clots… That sounds scary. But… if it will help, yes, of course. I just want to know what’s wrong. What does the ultrasound… feel like?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be concerned, Ms. Queener. We’re taking these steps to get a clear understanding of what's happening and rule out anything serious. The Doppler ultrasound is non-invasive and painless. A technician will apply a gel to your legs and then move a handheld device over your skin. It uses sound waves to create images of the veins and assess the blood flow. It doesn't involve any needles or radiation. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes. I will also write a referral for a cardiology consult, as it would be best to have a specialist assess your heart function, especially given your mother’s history. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, wearing compression stockings, and avoiding prolonged standing or sitting. Do you have any questions about these recommendations, or about the tests and referral?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… oh dear. Those sound… uncomfortable. But… okay. I will try. And… is the cardiology… a long wait? I don't want to wait too long to get this sorted. And… how much will all this cost? I'm on a fixed income, you see.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Queener. Compression stockings can take some getting used to, but they are very effective in reducing swelling. We can start with a lower compression level and see how you tolerate them. I will provide a prescription for those. Regarding the cardiology consult, wait times can vary, but I will put in a referral with a priority request to expedite the process. I will also have our office staff check on the estimated wait time for you and let you know. As for the cost, I understand your concern about being on a fixed income. The ultrasound and the cardiology consult will likely be covered by Medicare, although there may be some co-pays or deductibles. Our billing department will contact you to discuss the estimated costs and payment options in detail. They can also help you explore any available financial assistance programs. Would you like me to have someone from billing reach out to you directly?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I don’t understand all those… billing things. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I was quite worried, but… I feel a little better now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Queener. It’s my pleasure. I understand that dealing with health concerns can be stressful, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. I’m glad I could ease your worries a little. I will go ahead and write the referrals for the ultrasound and cardiology consult, and I’ll make a note for our billing department to contact you. They should reach out within the next 24-48 hours. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call our office if you have any further questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I think… that’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re most welcome, Ms. Queener. I’m glad I could help. Please remember to elevate your legs, and we'll get the tests scheduled as quickly as possible. We’ll work together to get this sorted out. Have a good day, and please take care. If anything changes or worsens before your appointments, don’t hesitate to contact us.
