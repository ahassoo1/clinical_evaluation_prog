DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Zicarelli, have a seat. Sixty-three, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is right. Sixty-three come August the twenty-first. Is nice to meet you.
DOCTOR: Right. And what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, is this thirst. I does be drinking so much water, is not normal. And I hungry all the time too. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I still feel like I need more. It start maybe a month or so ago, and it getting worse, you see?
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Maybe a little longer, now that I thinking on it. Like six weeks, maybe? It hard to say exactly, but it definitely not how I usually feel. I always been a good eater, but this is different. Is a constant feeling, you know?
DOCTOR: Constant… Hmm. And any other symptoms accompanying this… increased thirst and appetite?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, I does be going to the bathroom more often, that is for sure. Especially at night. It wake me up sometimes. And I feel a little tired, but I always tired, you know? Being my age. I not sure if that is part of it. Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem… busy.
DOCTOR: Busy is a permanent state, Ms. Zicarelli. Frequent urination… night time especially. And fatigue. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision? Not that I know of, Doctor. I does wear glasses, you see? For reading and such, but they always been the same. Maybe a little blurry if I don't have them, but that is normal for me. I haven't notice anything different happening with my eyes, no. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. And what about weight?
PATIENT: Weight? Well, I does be a little… full-figured, you see? Always been that way. But I don’t think I lose any weight. Maybe I gain a little, but nothing drastic. I weigh about, oh, maybe one hundred and seventy pounds? I haven't stepped on the scale in a while, though. My daughter has one, I could ask her.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any pills or anything. Never have. I always try to stay natural, you know? Herbs and things, but nothing from the doctor. My mother always said the best medicine is good food and rest. Though, that not helping with this hunger, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of… diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Let me see… my Uncle Cecil, on my father’s side, he had something with his sugar, I think. He always had to be careful what he eat. And my cousin Esme, she was sick with it too, before she pass. Is that what you asking, Doctor? Is this something I could catch from them? I not sure what it is, exactly.
DOCTOR: It can be hereditary, yes. Alright. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I eat a little of everything, to be honest. I love my doubles in the morning, and I try to have a good bowl of callaloo soup at least once a week. I cook a lot of chicken and rice, and I does enjoy a good roti sometimes. Is not the healthiest, I suppose, but I enjoy my food! Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “Enjoying your food” and “healthy eating” are rarely synonymous, Ms. Zicarelli. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just tell me what you want me to do. I hope is nothing too serious. Is this something I need to be worried about?
DOCTOR: If you could step onto the scale first, please. And then we’ll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart. Don’t worry unnecessarily. We’ll figure it out.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here we go. Is a little wobbly, this thing.
DOCTOR: One hundred and seventy-two pounds. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly stronger than ideal. Now, if you’ll just lie down on the table, please. I need to listen to your lungs and check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Is cold, this thing. But I will do whatever you need. Just be gentle, please. My back is not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Reflexes are… diminished, but not alarming for your age. Now, I'm going to check your feet. Do you feel anything here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I feel a little… tingling, sometimes. Especially in my toes. I thought is just because I wear closed shoes all day. Is a little numb, like. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Reduced sensation in both feet. Not ideal. Okay, Ms. Zicarelli, I’m going to order some blood work. Fasting glucose, A1C, and a complete metabolic panel. This will give us a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Blood work, you say? Is that going to be painful, Doctor? I not good with needles, you know. And will it take long? I have to get home and make dinner for my husband. He does not cook, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s a simple blood draw, Ms. Zicarelli. A small prick. It will take about ten minutes, and the lab is just down the hall. I'll write you a requisition form, and they'll take care of it. We'll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. I suspect we are looking at elevated blood sugar levels, potentially indicating type 2 diabetes. But we need the lab results to confirm. It’s important to take this seriously, Ms. Zicarelli. Lifestyle changes - diet and exercise - will be crucial.
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. Type two, you say? Is that… serious, Doctor? My Uncle Cecil, he lost his leg, you know. Lifestyle changes… I will try, Doctor. I promise. But is hard. I love my food. And I not very active, to be honest. Is this something I can get better from? Or is this… forever?
DOCTOR: It's manageable, Ms. Zicarelli. Not a death sentence. But it requires discipline. Diet, exercise, and potentially medication. Losing a leg is an extreme outcome, usually due to prolonged neglect. Don't dwell on worst-case scenarios. We will address it step by step. First, we get the lab results. Then we discuss a plan. Now, go to the lab. The nurse will show you the way. And try not to eat anything after dinner tonight, as you will need to fast for the blood work. Next patient.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you, Doctor. I will go to the lab now. I… I hope is not too bad.
