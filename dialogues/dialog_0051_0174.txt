DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, to be frank, I haven't been myself lately. It's... difficult to explain, but I suppose that's what I'm here for, isn't it? I just feel… low. Very low. And truthfully, I'd like to get this sorted out quickly if possible. I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Low" can mean a lot of things, and it's good you're taking the time to address it. We'll certainly try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as we can. When you say “low,” could you describe what that feels like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s not a physical feeling, not exactly. It’s… a heaviness. A lack of interest in things I used to enjoy. I used to love my garden, and now… I barely look at it. And I sleep a lot. More than I should, I think. Everything just feels… muted. Like someone turned the colour down on the world. It’s been going on for a few months now, I’d say. Perhaps longer. Honestly, time seems to slip away these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heaviness, loss of interest, increased sleep, and things feeling muted… that gives me a starting point. And you mentioned this has been going on for several months, possibly longer. Has anything specific happened around the time this started?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think… around the time… Well, my divorce was finalised about six months ago, yes. That’s… that was difficult. We were married a long time, you see. A very long time. And my son… he moved further away. Said it was for a better job opportunity, and I understood, of course, but… it felt like a piece of my life went with him. I don't know if that's connected. It just… all happened around the same time.
DOCTOR: Significant life events like a divorce and a son moving away… those absolutely can be connected to how you're feeling. It's perfectly normal to experience a range of emotions, and even physical symptoms, after such changes. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit more about your sleep?
PATIENT: Well, I go to bed early. Earlier than I used to, certainly. And I wake up several times during the night. Not because of any pain or discomfort, just… restless. I lie there, thinking. Or not thinking, exactly. Just… being awake. And then I get up and… I might read, or watch a little television, but I rarely feel rested when I finally get up for the day. It’s… frustrating. And then I find myself napping during the day, which I never used to do. It's all very unlike me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, early to bed, frequent awakenings, restless sleep, and daytime napping. That certainly paints a picture. And you're right, that is a change from your usual pattern. Now, to get a broader understanding, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Medical history… well, nothing major, thankfully. I had my usual check-ups, of course. Blood pressure's been a little high for years, but controlled with medication. I had a hip replacement about ten years ago, but that healed well and doesn't bother me. I haven’t been hospitalised for anything serious. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was a little low on that. That’s… about it, I think. Nothing else I can recall at this moment. I try to stay healthy, you see. All those years as a lifeguard… you have to be fit!
DOCTOR: Good, that’s helpful. So, controlled high blood pressure, a hip replacement ten years ago, and vitamin D supplementation. And a history as a lifeguard – that explains your focus on staying healthy! Do you take any other medications besides the blood pressure medication and the vitamin D?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just those two. I don't like taking pills unless I absolutely have to, you understand? I prefer to… handle things myself. Though, clearly, that’s not working out so well at the moment. I just feel… tired, all the time. Exhausted, even. And… I'm not myself. I used to be very active, very social. Now… I mostly just stay at home.
DOCTOR: I understand. Just the blood pressure medication and vitamin D. And the feeling of not being yourself, along with the exhaustion… that’s what prompted you to come in today, and it's good you did. Before we proceed, are you allergic to any medications or have any other allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies of any kind. I’ve always been lucky that way, thankfully. I don’t even get hay fever! My mother always said I was a strong constitution. Though, I suppose that doesn’t help me much now, does it? Being strong if you’re feeling… like this. Honestly, I just want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Derasmo, that is absolutely not too much to ask. Now, to get a better understanding, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – experienced depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she was a very private woman. She didn’t talk much about her feelings. But looking back… she did spend a lot of time alone. And she was often… sad. Not outwardly, but… a quiet sadness, you understand? My father was very strong, very stoic. Didn’t believe in… “weakness,” he called it. And my brother… he was always the cheerful one. Always smiling. So, it’s hard to say. I don’t know if anyone experienced anything similar, but… perhaps. Perhaps there was something. It wasn't something we talked about openly.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. It sounds like there may be some family history there, even if it wasn't openly discussed. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Could you tell me a little bit about your social life currently?
PATIENT: Well, as I said, Doctor, it’s… diminished. I used to have a very active social circle. We’d go to the theatre, have dinner parties… But since my divorce… and my son moving away… I haven’t really made the effort. My friends… they’ve tried to include me, of course, but I mostly decline. I just… don’t feel up to it. I feel like a burden, you see? Like I’m not much fun anymore. So, I mostly keep to myself. I have a neighbour who’s very kind… she pops in occasionally for a chat, but… it’s not the same. It’s rather lonely, to be frank.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant sense of isolation, which can certainly contribute to how you're feeling. Now, Ms. Derasmo, would you be comfortable if I performed a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Yes, go ahead. I suppose it’s necessary. Though, as I said, I don't think there's anything physically wrong. But… do what you need to do. Let's get this over with, shall we? I have appointments, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'd like to lie down on the table, we'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I’ll listen to your lungs and do a quick neurological check. Nothing too involved, just to rule out any underlying physical causes.
PATIENT: Very well. Get on with it, then. The sooner this is done, the better. I do hope it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Heart rate is 76, regular rhythm. Lungs sound clear, though you're taking slightly shallow breaths. Your reflexes are normal and strength is good in all extremities. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Everything appears physically normal, Ms. Derasmo. Which, frankly, points us in another direction.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… something, I suppose. So, it’s not physical. As I suspected. What does that mean, then, Doctor? What direction are we pointing in? Is it… in my head? I do hope it’s not something serious. I haven’t the energy for serious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Derasmo, it doesn’t mean it’s “just in your head,” though our thoughts and feelings certainly play a significant role. Based on what you’ve told me, and the normal physical exam findings, what we’re seeing is highly suggestive of major depressive disorder. The loss of interest, the fatigue, the sleep disturbances, the feelings of low mood, the social isolation… those are all classic symptoms. Now, it’s important to remember that depression is a very common and treatable condition. It’s not a sign of weakness, and you're not alone in experiencing this. There are several avenues we can explore, including therapy and medication. I want to assure you that we will work together to find the best course of action for you. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Depression… You mean… like a illness? I thought I was just… sad. And tired. And… lonely. I didn't realize it was… a disorder. Therapy… and medication… I’ve never… I’ve always prided myself on handling things myself. The idea of talking to someone about all this… and taking pills… it feels… undignified. But… if you think it’s necessary. What would therapy even be like? And what kind of medication are we talking about? I don’t want to become… dependent on anything. Or… feel like a different person. This is… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, Ms. Derasmo, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. You're right, it's not just "sadness," though sadness is a part of it. It’s a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors. Therapy, or psychotherapy, is simply talking to a trained professional – a therapist or counselor – about your thoughts, feelings, and experiences in a safe and confidential environment. It's about learning coping mechanisms and developing strategies to manage your symptoms. There are different types of therapy, and we can discuss which one might be best for you. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is often helpful for depression – it focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns. As for medication, there are several antidepressants available. They work by balancing certain chemicals in the brain. They’re not a “cure,” but they can help alleviate symptoms and make it easier to engage in therapy. We would start with a low dose and monitor your response carefully. It's important to understand that antidepressants take time to work – usually several weeks – and there can be side effects, although many people experience minimal or no side effects. We don’t have to start medication right away. We can explore therapy first and see how you respond. I would also recommend a blood test to rule out any vitamin deficiencies that could be contributing to your symptoms. What are your thoughts on exploring therapy first?
PATIENT: Therapy… well, I suppose… it’s less daunting than the idea of pills. Though, the thought of… opening up to a stranger… it makes me uncomfortable. But… if it could help. Do you… recommend a particular therapist? Someone who specializes in… people my age? Someone who understands… the life experience? And how long would these sessions be? And… how much would they cost? I have… insurance, of course, but I don't want to run up a huge bill. I need to be practical, you see. Even if I'm feeling… unwell.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I have a list of qualified therapists in the area who specialize in geriatric mental health. Dr. Eleanor Vance is particularly well-regarded – she has extensive experience working with patients your age and a compassionate approach. She's located conveniently close to the clinic. Another option is Ms. Anya Sharma, who uses a mindfulness-based approach. Typical therapy sessions are 50 minutes long. The cost varies depending on the therapist, but generally ranges from $120 to $180 per session. Your private insurance should cover a significant portion of that cost, but it's best to check with your provider beforehand to confirm your coverage and any copay amounts. I can provide you with the contact information for both therapists, as well as a referral form to streamline the insurance process. We can also discuss options for lower-cost therapy if needed, such as community mental health centers. Would you like me to provide you with that information now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Yes, the contact information for both therapists would be helpful. And the referral form, of course. I suppose… I suppose I should at least talk to them. See if they’re a good fit. Dr. Vance… mindfulness-based… I don’t know… I think… I think I’d prefer to start with Dr. Vance. She sounds… more traditional. More what I’m used to. Thank you, Doctor. This… this has been helpful. More helpful than I expected, truthfully.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. I'm glad I could provide some clarity and direction. Here is the contact information for Dr. Vance, along with the referral form. I’ll also send a summary of our consultation to your primary care physician, so they’re aware of our plan. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No, I think that’s all. Thank you again. For your patience… and your understanding. I suppose… I’ll see what Dr. Vance has to say. Goodbye, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Derasmo. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. I wish you all the best.
