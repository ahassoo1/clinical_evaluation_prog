DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come see someone about it. It's… not a lot, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Coughing up blood is definitely something we need to investigate. Just to be clear, you said some blood – can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. It is… bright red. Not dark, you know? And it's mixed with… my regular cough stuff. Like, when I cough, it comes up with the mucus. Not… just blood by itself. Does that make sense? I am sorry if I am not explaining it well.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Weichers. Don’t worry about explaining it perfectly. Bright red blood mixed with mucus is helpful information. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it something new?
PATIENT: It is… new. Maybe about three days now? I thought it was just a bad cold at first, but it hasn’t gone away, and then… the blood started. I do not remember ever coughing up blood before. It is quite frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days. And no fever, chills, or shortness of breath accompanying it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. I do not think I have chills, but… sometimes I feel a little cold, but I live in the country, and the house can be drafty. And no, I can breathe okay. It doesn’t make it hard to breathe, no. Just… worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. And maybe a little bit of a chest pain, but it is not… sharp pain. More like a dull ache, if that makes sense. It only happens when I cough a lot. It is hard to say if it is connected or not. My husband… he passed away last year, and I have not been sleeping very well. Perhaps it is just that.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Weichers. That must be incredibly difficult. It’s good you mentioned the fatigue and chest pain, even if you’re unsure if they’re related. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some possible causes and next steps. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds very good. A physical exam is fine. I want to make sure everything is okay. Thank you for being so kind. It is… nice to talk to someone who listens.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Weichers. That’s what I’m here for. If you could just sit up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Is there anything special I need to do? Should I take off my shoes?
DOCTOR: No, no need to remove your shoes. Just relax as much as possible. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart with the stethoscope first. Take a few deep breaths for me, please… and exhale slowly. Good. I'm hearing some… mild wheezing in the lower lobes, but nothing too concerning at this stage. Now, I’m just going to check your throat and feel your lymph nodes. Open your mouth for me and say “ah.”
PATIENT: Ah… Is everything okay, Doctor? It feels a little strange to have someone looking in my throat. I hope you do not think I am silly to ask.
DOCTOR: No, not silly at all, Ms. Weichers. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. Your throat looks a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Your lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but again, not dramatically so. Now, just to be thorough, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s alright. It feels a little cold. Is that normal? It is just that my hands are often cold.
DOCTOR: It's normal for the clip to feel a little cold, Ms. Weichers. Your oxygen saturation is 97%, which is good. Alright. Based on what I’ve heard and seen, we need to investigate this further. The blood you’re coughing up, along with the mild wheezing and slightly enlarged lymph nodes, warrants some additional testing.
PATIENT: Okay. I understand. What kind of testing, Doctor? Is it something serious? I… I am a little worried now. I hope it is not something terrible. My husband… he was always so strong, and then…
DOCTOR: Ms. Weichers, it’s understandable to be worried, and I want to assure you we are taking this seriously. It doesn't necessarily mean it's terrible, but it does require us to rule out potential causes. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We'll also do a sputum culture to check for any infection. And I’d like to order a complete blood count – that’s just a routine blood test to check your overall health and look for any signs of inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… alright. An X-ray and blood tests… I suppose that is what needs to be done. When will I know the results? And… will it hurt? I do not like needles very much.
DOCTOR: The X-ray won’t hurt at all, Ms. Weichers. You'll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. The blood draw… well, it’s a pinch, but it's usually very quick. I’ll have the lab draw the blood right after this exam. The results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you cough up a significant amount of blood – more than a teaspoon – or if you develop a fever, or if you feel short of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I understand. No more than a teaspoon, and if I get a fever… or trouble breathing. I will remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very patient with me. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. What happens next? Do I need to do anything before the X-ray?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. No, you don't need to do anything special before the X-ray. You can wear your regular clothes. The technician will just ask you a few questions, and then take a few pictures. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now, and then we can go over the aftercare instructions. I'll also have them print out a copy of the instructions for you to take home. Just one moment. Nurse, could you please come in to draw some blood for Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: Okay, very good. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it is not too much blood. I do get a little faint sometimes.
DOCTOR: It won’t be much, Ms. Weichers. And please, let the nurse know about your tendency to feel faint. They are very experienced and will take extra precautions to make sure you’re comfortable. They’ll have you lie down during the blood draw if needed. Alright, I believe that's everything for now. We’ll get the tests done and discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor Fazzina. I will call if I have any questions. .
