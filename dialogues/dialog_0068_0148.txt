DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Stepbro. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Oh, um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. It’s… pain. Down there. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked. I don’t… really know where to begin explaining it. It’s just… pain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright, Ms. Stepbro. Many women experience pelvic pain at some point. No need to be embarrassed. "Down there" is a perfectly acceptable start. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s… reassuring. Well, it’s not… sharp, exactly. More of a… dull ache, most of the time. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s worse after I’ve been… working, you know, with the wood. But not always. And I… I can’t really pinpoint exactly where it is, if that makes sense? It feels… general. Does that help at all? I'm not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Stepbro, thank you. General pelvic pain, fluctuating, worse with activity sometimes… Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky question. It feels like… a few weeks, maybe? Or a month? It's hard to say. I've been quite busy with commissions, and I… I tend to ignore things when I'm focused on my work. It didn’t start suddenly, more of a… gradual awareness of discomfort. I wish I could give you a more precise answer. It's just… time seems to slip away.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to put things off when you’re busy. A few weeks to a month… alright. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain at all and ten being the worst pain you've ever experienced, what would you say your pain is at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a scale, you say? Hmm. At its worst… I wouldn’t say it’s ever been truly awful. Maybe… a four? No, perhaps a five, on a bad day. It’s definitely not debilitating. More… annoying and worrisome. It doesn’t keep me up at night, but it’s always… there, in the background. Is five too high? I don’t want to exaggerate.
DOCTOR: Five is helpful, Ms. Stepbro, thank you. Not debilitating, but persistent. Do you notice anything that relieves the pain?
PATIENT: Relieves it… Honestly, not really. Resting helps a little, I suppose. But I have a lot of work to do, so I don’t rest much! Sometimes, if I sit very still and focus on my breathing, it’s less noticeable. But that doesn’t last long. I haven't really tried anything specific for the pain, to be honest. I usually just… try to ignore it. I haven’t found anything that makes it go away completely. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh… goodness. Well, um… I suppose everything is… pretty normal. I haven’t noticed anything… unusual. I mean, things are as they usually are. I don’t know if that’s helpful. I'm not quite sure why you’re asking, if you don’t mind me saying. Is it related to the… pain?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Stepbro. We just need to rule things out. And sometimes pelvic pain can be related to other systems. Now, how about your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Urinary habits… Well, I go to the bathroom as often as usual, I think. No burning or… urgency. Nothing like that. I haven't noticed any blood or… anything strange in my urine. It's all perfectly normal, as far as I can tell. Are you concerned about something, Doctor? Is this something serious? I confess, I'm a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s good that everything seems normal, Ms. Stepbro. I'm simply gathering information. Now, have you experienced any vaginal bleeding or discharge that is different than usual?
PATIENT: Oh… my. Well, um… no. Not that I’ve noticed. Everything is… as it should be. I… I haven't paid much attention, if I'm honest. I've been so focused on my work. It's been a long time since… well, since I’ve had any reason to… to check. I hope that's not a problem.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. That was… oh, goodness, almost twenty years now? And I have… high blood pressure, I think. Or at least, the doctor told me that once. I don’t take any medication for it, though. It's usually alright if I watch my salt intake. Apart from that… I’m usually quite healthy. I work hard, but I’m strong. Is that helpful? I don’t remember much beyond that. It’s been a while since I’ve been to a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and a history of high blood pressure. Now, any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I don't believe so. No, I'm quite certain. Just the gallbladder. I remember being very sick afterward, but… that's all I recall. I've always been careful to avoid surgery if possible. I heal slowly, you see. Is that… a problem? Should I have had more surgery? I'm getting confused now.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Stepbro, that's not a problem at all. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's about it. And occasionally, ibuprofen for a headache. But I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I prefer to… tough it out. I don't like the way medication makes me feel. Is that… bad? Should I be taking something? I'm sorry, I'm probably not being very helpful. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Stepbro. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. I've never had any trouble with food. And I haven't been stung by a bee or anything like that in years. I'm quite lucky, I think. Should I be worried about allergies? Is that what you're asking? I confess, this is making me anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… difficult. My mother… she had heart problems, I think. And my grandmother… she had something with her bones. Arthritis, maybe? But it was a long time ago, and I don't remember much. My family… they weren’t ones for talking about their health. It was considered… private. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s all very vague, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Stepbro. It’s common for family history to be vague. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well… I used to drink a little wine, with dinner sometimes. But I haven’t had a glass in… oh, goodness, years now. I found it didn’t agree with my blood pressure. And no, I definitely don’t smoke or… use any recreational drugs. Never have. I work too hard for that. I hope you don’t think badly of me.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Stepbro, not at all. Now, what about your occupation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I’m a woodworker. I make furniture, mostly. Commissions, you see. It’s… very satisfying work. Keeps me busy. I’ve been doing it for… well, a long time now. It’s hard work, physical, but I enjoy it. Though, perhaps that has something to do with the… pain? I do a lot of lifting and bending.
DOCTOR: That could certainly be a factor, Ms. Stepbro. Now, finally, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh… my. That’s… a very personal question, Doctor. I… I am single. And… it’s been a long time. It’s not something I… frequently engage in. Is that… necessary to know? I apologize, but I'm quite uncomfortable discussing this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Stepbro. That's perfectly alright. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me assess the source of your pain. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Well… I suppose so. But… what does that involve, exactly? I confess, I'm a bit nervous. I haven't been to a doctor in a long time, and I'm not very good with… procedures. Will it be painful? Perhaps you could explain it to me first?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stepbro. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your blood pressure. Then, I'll gently palpate your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or masses. Finally, I’ll need to do a pelvic exam. That involves looking at your external genitalia and then using a speculum to visualize the vagina and cervix. It may cause some mild discomfort, but it shouldn’t be painful. We can stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A speculum…? Oh dear. That sounds… invasive. I… I don’t know. I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that. I haven't had… anyone look at those parts in a very long time. Is it absolutely necessary? Perhaps we could try something else first? I’m really starting to feel quite overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Stepbro. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. The pelvic exam is helpful in ruling out certain conditions, but it’s not absolutely required at this stage. We can start with the abdominal exam and see what we find. We can always revisit the pelvic exam later if necessary. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be… much better. Yes, the abdominal exam sounds… less daunting. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being understanding. Where should I… position myself? And… will I need to undress? I apologize for all the questions. I'm just… nervous.
DOCTOR: You’re perfectly alright, Ms. Stepbro. No need to apologize. Please lie down on the examination table. You can keep your clothes on for the abdominal exam. Just loosen your pants a bit so I can listen to your abdomen comfortably. I'll start by listening with my stethoscope, then gently press on different areas to feel for any tenderness. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. Please be gentle. I bruise easily, you see. And… try not to surprise me.
DOCTOR: I will be, Ms. Stepbro. I'll let you know what I'm doing before I do it. Now, I'm just listening to your bowel sounds. Breathe normally. Your bowel sounds are present, though a bit quiet. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. Does this feel tender?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. A little. Not… sharp, exactly. More of a… dull ache. Like when I’ve been lifting heavy things. But… less intense. It’s… on this side, I think. Lower down. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about here?
PATIENT: No… that’s alright. Not painful there. Just… normal. A little… firm, perhaps. But not uncomfortable. Oh… there. A little bit. It’s… radiating, I think. Does that make sense? Like it’s spreading out. Is that… normal? It's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about here?
PATIENT: No… that’s alright. Not painful there. Just… normal. A little… firm, perhaps. But not uncomfortable. Oh… there. A little bit. It’s… radiating, I think. Does that make sense? Like it’s spreading out. Is that… normal? It's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's alright, Ms. Stepbro. I understand your concern. Radiating pain can be a bit worrisome. Based on this exam, you have tenderness in your lower right quadrant with some radiation. It could be muscular, related to your work, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a urinalysis. A CBC will help us check for infection, and the urinalysis will check for a urinary tract infection. I’m also going to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your organs. Does that sound okay?
