DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. Welcome. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Don't bother with the 'nice to meet you' bit, we both know why I'm here. It's this… problem. Black stools. Honestly, it's probably nothing, but my husband insisted. He worries too much, always has. I take those pain pills, you know, for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. I guess that's what this is about, right? Those pills? Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to rush, but I appreciate you being direct. Black stools… yes, that does warrant a look. And you're right to consider the pain pills as a possibility. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a bit more about these stools?
PATIENT: Ugh, more questions. Fine. They're… black. Like tar, almost. Not just a little dark, black. And they’ve been happening… oh, I don't know, a few days now? Maybe a week? It's hard to keep track, honestly. Everything blends together after a while. They don't hurt, if that makes a difference. Just… alarming. And messy. Is that all you need to know? Because frankly, I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Just trying to get a clear picture. "Messy" is good to know, that helps. And no pain is… helpful, though not definitive. Now, these pain pills you’re taking… what kind are they, and how often do you take them?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. It's naproxen, alright? The usual. Two a day, sometimes three if my arthritis is acting up. I've been on them for… oh, must be fifteen years now? Longer, maybe. I don't keep track of these things. The doctor before, Dr. Hemlock, he just kept prescribing them. Never bothered asking much. Are you going to quiz me on every single detail of my life now?
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all. Just trying to understand the whole picture. Fifteen years is good to know. Now, besides the naproxen and the black stools, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I'm seventy-three years old, things are always changing. My knees ache more, my hair falls out, I forget where I put my glasses… is that what you mean? Honestly, you're asking me to recall everything that's happened in the last month, it's ridiculous. I haven't been bleeding anywhere, if that's what you're getting at. And I haven't felt faint or anything dramatic like that. Does that cover enough “changes” for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. No bleeding, no dizziness… good. Now, have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? Not really. A little discomfort sometimes, but that's just my digestion, always been sensitive. Nausea? No. Vomiting? Absolutely not. I haven't thrown up in… well, I can't even remember. Look, I'm a practical woman. I eat, I sleep, I take my pills, and I try to avoid falling. I don't have time for complicated illnesses. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going in circles?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, yes. Just trying to rule things out. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions besides arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, here we go again. Arthritis, obviously. High blood pressure, but it’s managed with a little pill. Had my gallbladder out years ago, but that’s ancient history. Nothing else, really. I’m not one of those people who collects illnesses. And honestly, I don’t remember everything from fifty years ago. Are you going to ask me about childhood chickenpox now?
DOCTOR: No chickenpox, I promise. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, any family history of stomach problems, bleeding disorders, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. My mother had… something with her stomach, I think. Indigestion, maybe? She was a worrier, just like my husband. My father… he died of a heart attack. And my brother… well, he lived a perfectly healthy life, as far as I know. Honestly, we weren’t a family that talked about medical things. Too depressing. Is this really necessary? It feels like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not always easy to recall family history. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're agreeable. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. Not to penicillin, not to bee stings, not to anything. I'm a remarkably sturdy person, all things considered. Look, I’m starting to feel a bit faint just sitting here answering questions. Can we please get on with the exam? I have a garden to tend to, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, absolutely. Let’s move on to the physical exam then. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently press on your abdomen. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful. Alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And be gentle. My ribs are delicate. I haven’t broken any bones, but they're not as strong as they used to be. Hurry up, will you?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds… reasonably normal, though your breath sounds are a bit quiet. Now, I’m just gently pressing on your abdomen. Any pain here?
PATIENT: A little. Right there. Not sharp pain, just… discomfort. Like indigestion, maybe? I told you I have a sensitive stomach. Is that what you were looking for? Honestly, this is probably just gas. I had a cabbage salad yesterday.
DOCTOR: Yes, that tenderness is in the epigastric region. And a cabbage salad could certainly cause some discomfort. However, given the black stools, I'd like to be cautious. I’m going to order a stool test, to check for blood. Also, I’d like to order a Complete Blood Count to assess your overall health and rule out any anemia. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for goodness sake. More tests. Just what I needed. Alright, fine. Do what you have to do. But I’m telling you, this is probably just the cabbage salad. And I don’t want any unnecessary poking and prodding. When can I expect the results? And can I still have my garden to myself this afternoon?
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab should be able to process the tests quickly. I expect the results within a couple of days. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. And yes, you can absolutely still tend to your garden this afternoon. However, if you experience any new symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or vomiting – please don’t hesitate to call us immediately. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend avoiding any foods that tend to upset your stomach. And we can discuss strategies to manage your arthritis while we wait for the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get this over with. I’ll try to avoid the cabbage, although I do enjoy it. And I’ll try not to worry, although that’s easier said than done. Honestly, I just want to get back to my garden. Are we finished here?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are finished here for today. I’ll have the lab order printed for you, and the nurse will give you instructions on where to go for the tests. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Thank you for your patience, Dawnetta. And please, do enjoy your garden. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Alright. Thank you. I suppose. I’ll see what the results say. And yes, I will enjoy my garden. It’s the only thing that keeps me sane. Good day.
