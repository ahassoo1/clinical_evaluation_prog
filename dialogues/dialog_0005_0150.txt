DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t have all day. I want a baby. A healthy baby. And I’m not getting any younger, you know. I want to make sure everything is… working properly before I even try. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, wanting a healthy baby isn’t unreasonable. Though, frankly, just deciding you want one isn't a medical plan. We need to figure out what isn’t “working properly,” as you put it. Let’s start with some basics. Have you been trying to conceive already?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t been “trying.” I came here to avoid that whole messy process if possible. I’d like to know if there’s anything wrong with me before… well, before I waste my time. And frankly, the time of a perfectly good man. Is that clear enough? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear. Though, a little history is still necessary, even if you haven’t actively been trying. It's not about wasting time, Ms. Shteynberg; it’s about being thorough. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Yes. Once. A long time ago. It... didn't end well. And honestly, I don’t feel the need to rehash the details of a failed marriage and a… difficult situation. Let’s just say it wasn’t a pleasant experience. Are we getting anywhere, or are we just going to talk about my personal life all day?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. We don’t need a detailed autobiography. But knowing you've been pregnant before is relevant. Do you remember any complications during that pregnancy?
PATIENT: Complications? Oh, where to begin. I was very young. It was… a difficult birth. Lots of pain. There was… pressure. And then… well, it ended with a C-section. And a divorce. Honestly, it was a disaster from start to finish. I don’t see how reliving it is going to help me have a healthy baby now. Are you a specialist in difficult cases? Because I feel like I'm going to need one.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I am a doctor. And a C-section is a relevant part of your medical history. It can affect future pregnancies. Now, have you had any follow-up care after that C-section?
PATIENT: Follow-up? Doctor, it was thirty years ago! I moved countries, I got divorced, I built a business! I did not spend my time scheduling appointments about a… a past trauma! I think I’ve recovered quite well, if you must know. I run a successful bicycle repair shop, I’m perfectly capable. Honestly, I find your questions… insulting.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I understand you’ve been busy. However, it’s standard procedure to understand a patient’s full medical background. And a previous C-section can create adhesions, which… never mind. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes ibuprofen for my back. Running a shop is hard work, you know. All that lifting… and dealing with… people. Is that going to be a problem? Everything else, I’m perfectly healthy. I eat well, I exercise… well, I used to, before my back started acting up. Are we getting closer to finding out if I’m fit to have a baby or not? I have customers waiting, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Ibuprofen occasionally. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… dust. I’m allergic to dust. It's a bicycle repair shop, you see. There’s a lot of dust. And… I think I get a bit itchy around cats. But other than that, no. I’m a very robust person. I rarely get sick. This is all quite unnecessary, isn’t it? Do you have some sort of machine that can just tell me if I'm able to conceive or not?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, there’s no machine that can simply "tell" you. We need to understand your overall health. And dust and cat allergies are good to know. Do you have any family history of infertility or genetic conditions?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, please. My mother had a lot of children. My grandmother had even more. We're a very fertile family. Always have been. It’s probably in my genes! Honestly, I think you’re asking me pointless questions just to fill up your time. I came here for a solution, not an interrogation. I need to know if I can have a healthy baby, and if so, what I need to do about it. Can we please move on to some actual tests?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, with all due respect, dismissing family history and previous medical events is not conducive to a proper evaluation. It’s not about filling up my time. It's about risk assessment. And frankly, your…attitude is making this difficult. However, since you are insistent. I'm going to order some basic bloodwork to assess your hormone levels and overall health. I will also need a pelvic exam to check the condition of your reproductive organs. That is the only way to get a better understanding of what, if anything, is going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Bloodwork. A… a pelvic exam. Honestly. It’s demeaning. But, if that’s what it takes to get this over with, then do it. Just… try to be quick about it. And be gentle. I have a very busy schedule, remember? And I expect results promptly. I don't have all day. Where do I go to get this done? And will my insurance cover it? Medicare, by the way.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse draw the bloodwork right here in the office. As for the pelvic exam, I will perform that now. It will be as quick and gentle as possible. As for insurance, Medicare should cover these basic tests, but I recommend you verify with your provider just to be sure. The nurse will provide you with the appropriate codes for verification. Please undress from the waist down. I'll be back in a moment. And Ms. Shteynberg… try to relax. It will go much smoother that way.
PATIENT: .
