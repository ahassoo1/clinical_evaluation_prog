DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Delron, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Delron Hartness. Look, I ain't got all day, you know? Just need this done so I can get started with the army thing. Everything alright with the paperwork? I filled it out like they told me.
DOCTOR: Yes, the paperwork appears complete. Though, a form is just a starting point, wouldn’t you agree?
PATIENT: Look, I don't get what you mean. It is complete. I checked it twice. What more do you want from me? You trying to waste my time? I got things to do, people to see... well, mostly the army, but still. It's a good job, you know? Real responsibility. Not like... some other jobs.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, please. I'm simply trying to understand why you are here today. What specifically brought you in for a medical evaluation before joining the army?
PATIENT: They told me I needed this exam. The army people. Said it was standard. Gotta make sure I’m… fit. I feel fit! I work with engines all day, you know? Heavy lifting, greasy hands, the whole deal. What else do they need to know? Do I look sick to you? I haven’t even had a cold in years.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "feeling fit" and being medically fit are two different things. It’s standard procedure for a reason. We need to systematically assess everything. Let’s start with a basic history. Have you experienced any recent illnesses, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Look, I already told you, no. No illnesses. Nothing. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, I don't even remember. Maybe ten years? More? I just deal with things. A little ache here, a little pain there, you know? Workin' with machines isn't exactly a gentle occupation. But I've never been sick. Never needed to be. Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Ten years is a significant gap in medical history. Alright. Let’s try this. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No! What kind of question is that? I work with engines, remember? Sometimes I get a little… tight feeling after lifting something really heavy. But that’s just muscles. Not… chest pain. You makin’ me nervous now. I don’t have chest pain. Why would I be here if I had chest pain? I'd be at the hospital, not fillin’ out forms for the army.
DOCTOR: Right. And shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No! I breathe just fine. I gotta breathe to live, don't I? You askin’ stupid questions now. Look, I ran a few kilometers last week, no problem. Well, not ran. More like… briskly walked. But I didn't get winded. I'm a strong guy, I told you. This is a waste of time. Are we getting anywhere or what?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Let’s move on. Any history of dizziness or fainting spells?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Not even once. I've always been pretty steady on my feet. Workin' around machinery, you have to be. Can’t be passin' out on the job, can ya? That'd be...bad. Really bad. Look, I’m a practical guy. Always been strong, always been healthy. Is there a point to all this or are we just going through the motions? I got a schedule, you know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but this isn’t simply “going through the motions.” This is a necessary medical evaluation. Have you ever had any issues with your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Vision and hearing are fine! I can see just fine, and I can hear everything you’re saying, even if you are asking silly questions. I gotta see small parts when I'm assembling things, and I gotta hear the engines to know if they’re running right. You think I’d be doing that if I was blind or deaf? Common sense, really. Look, I'm startin’ to get a headache. Can we speed this up? I need to get back to work. Or, you know, army stuff. Whatever.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your digestive system. Any problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: Are you serious? You’re asking me about my… bathroom habits now? That’s a little much, isn’t it? Look, I eat normal food. I… go to the bathroom when I need to. It’s a private matter! What does my digestion have to do with joinin' the army? This is ridiculous. I think I'm done. I'm not answerin' any more of these personal questions. I want to see a different doctor. This is a waste of my time, and frankly, it’s a little insulting. I came here for a simple exam, not a… interrogation. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your discomfort. However, a thorough medical evaluation requires asking these questions. But, if you prefer, I can document your request to see another physician. But, I must inform you that delaying this evaluation could impact your ability to meet army requirements. Before we do that, however, let's at least do a quick physical exam. It will take only a few minutes and may alleviate some of your concerns. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and a basic neurological check. Would you be willing to allow that?
