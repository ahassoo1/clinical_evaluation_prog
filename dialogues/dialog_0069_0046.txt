DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. My name is Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Andraca. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… discomfort with my bladder, a sort of pressure. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about that discomfort?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not necessarily painful, exactly. More… a constant feeling of needing to go, even when I’ve just gone. And sometimes, when I do go, it doesn’t feel like… everything comes out, if that makes sense. It’s a bit difficult to explain. It’s just… frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and you're explaining it perfectly. A feeling of incomplete emptying and frequent urges… alright. And how long has this been going on for, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… I’d say about three months ago, maybe a little longer. It was subtle at first, just noticing I was going to the bathroom a bit more often. But it’s definitely increased in the last month or so. I remember it starting around the end of May, beginning of June.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly three months. And it's been progressively worsening, especially in the last month. Have you noticed any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain at all, Doctor. It’s not a burning sensation or anything like that. Just this… pressure and the feeling of not quite emptying completely. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, which is good. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, smell, anything unusual like blood?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. The color seems normal, and the smell hasn’t changed that I’ve noticed. I make a habit of paying attention to those sorts of things, so I’m fairly certain it’s all… standard, as far as urine goes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain along with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t experienced any fever or chills. And thankfully, no lower back pain either. Just the bladder discomfort. I have been a little more tired than usual, but I thought that was just from work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or back pain. Increased tiredness, potentially work-related. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had chickenpox as a child, of course, but that’s about it. Nothing major. I do have slightly high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I see my primary care doctor regularly for check-ups.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension. That’s good. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: I’m taking Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I’ve been on that for about… five years now, I think. It’s been very effective, and my doctor is happy with my numbers.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband always jokes that I could eat anything, but I try to be sensible!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had any surgeries or been hospitalized. I've been very fortunate in that regard. Just the usual childhood immunizations, and a few stitches when I was little – nothing significant.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like kidney problems, bladder cancer, or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, similar to me. And my grandmother, on my father's side, had diabetes. I don’t believe anyone else in my immediate family has had any kidney or bladder issues. My aunt did have frequent urinary tract infections when she was younger, but not as an adult.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of hypertension and diabetes, aunt with history of UTIs as a child. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once or twice a week, but that's it. And I absolutely do not use any recreational drugs.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional wine, no recreational drugs. Now, before we move onto a physical exam, can you tell me about your typical fluid intake?
PATIENT: I try to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Probably around eight glasses, maybe a little more if it’s hot or I've been exercising. I limit my caffeine intake to one cup of coffee in the morning. And I avoid sugary drinks as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, good hydration habits. Now, Marialena, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your abdomen, and I'd also like to do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes. Then I'll need a urine sample to check for infection. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please proceed. I understand the need for these tests, and I’m happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Alright, your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Your reflexes are normal. Now, if you could please provide a urine sample, that would be great. There's a collection cup in the bathroom. I'll step out to give you some privacy.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I'll let you know when I've brought it back.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Marialena. I’ll be right here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I tried to be as accurate as possible.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I'll send this off to the lab. We should have the results back in a couple of days. While we wait for those results, based on your history and the physical exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of an overactive bladder, or possibly a urinary tract infection that hasn’t fully developed. We need the lab results to confirm. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake slightly, unless you notice it makes your symptoms worse, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. We can also discuss some behavioral techniques like timed voiding. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Increasing my fluid intake and avoiding caffeine and alcohol are easy enough. And I’m certainly willing to explore behavioral techniques. Timed voiding… could you explain that a little more, please?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Timed voiding involves going to the bathroom on a schedule, even if you don't feel the urge, and gradually increasing the intervals between bathroom trips. It helps retrain your bladder. We start with a set schedule - for example, every two hours - and then slowly increase the time between voids as you become more comfortable. It takes some discipline, but it can be very effective. We can also keep a bladder diary for a few days, noting how much fluid you drink, when you urinate, and any urges you experience. That will give us a better understanding of your bladder habits. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable, actually. Keeping a diary and trying timed voiding. It sounds like a good plan, and I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. I'm willing to give it a try. Would you like me to start the diary immediately? And is there anything specific I should be noting besides fluid intake, void times, and urges?
DOCTOR: Yes, please start the diary as soon as possible. Besides fluid intake, void times and urges, also note any leakage, whether you were able to make it to the bathroom on time, and any pain or discomfort you experience. Also note any activities that seem to trigger your urges. We'll review the diary at our next appointment, and based on the lab results, we can discuss further treatment options if needed. I’ll also give you a handout with more information about overactive bladder and behavioral techniques. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds excellent, Doctor. I'll be sure to keep detailed notes, and I appreciate the handout. It helps to have everything in writing. Thank you for your time and for explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel much more informed and optimistic now. I believe that's all my questions for today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, chills, or significant pain, please contact the office immediately. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to review the lab results and your bladder diary. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Andraca. I will. You have a good day as well.
