DOCTOR: Hi Philipp, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my heart. It feels… funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not always. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention. “Funny” is a perfectly fine way to describe it – we'll get to the bottom of it. When you say it feels like it’s beating too fast, can you tell me a little more about when that happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… not when I run, or work hard. It happens when I’m… just sitting. Or maybe when I sleep. Sometimes I wake up because of it. It doesn’t last long, maybe a few seconds. But it feels… weird. Like a flapping.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not related to exertion, which is helpful to know. It happens at rest, and even wakes you up sometimes. And you describe it as a “flapping” sensation... that's a good way to put it. A few seconds, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Not long. Maybe ten, fifteen seconds. Sometimes less. Then it stops. I don’t feel… bad after, just… surprised. It scared my wife once when it happened at night. She asked if I was okay. I was okay, just… heart doing the flapping thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. It sounds like it's fairly brief episodes. And it doesn’t leave you feeling unwell afterward, just startled. Do you notice anything before these episodes start?
PATIENT: No. Nothing I can think of. I just… feel normal. Then, flap, flap, and then it’s gone. I eat normal. Sleep normal. Work normal. I don't drink coffee or anything. Just tea, sometimes. Maybe that does something? I don't know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the tea – we can definitely talk about that. It’s unlikely to be the cause, but it’s good information. When you say “normal,” do you ever feel anxious or stressed before these episodes, even just a little bit?
PATIENT: Anxious? Not really. Work is okay. Wife is good. Family is good. Maybe… sometimes I worry about money, a little. But not too much. It’s just… life. Everyone worries about money, right? I don’t think that makes my heart flap. I don’t feel worried when it happens. Just… surprised.
DOCTOR: Right, that makes sense. Worrying about money is very common, and it doesn’t sound like that's directly linked to these episodes. Let’s move on to some other things, just to get a broader picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I just… get sick sometimes, like a cold. Nothing serious. I haven’t seen a doctor in… a long time. Maybe ten years? I usually just wait it out. My wife, she tells me I should come more often. She worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No prior medical diagnoses, and it’s been a while since your last check-up. That’s alright – we can get things updated now. And it's good your wife encourages you to take care of your health! Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never surgery. Never hospital. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, but that’s it. Just a cast. Everything else… okay. I work with machines, you know? Chemical stuff. But I’m careful. We have rules. Safety rules. Everything is good. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations, just a broken arm as a child. And you work with chemicals, but follow safety protocols – that’s reassuring. Let’s talk about your family history, if you don’t mind. Does anyone in your family have heart problems, like heart disease, arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had… high blood pressure, I think. He took pills for it. But no heart attacks, no sudden death. My mother, she was okay. No problems. Grandparents… I don’t really remember. They died when I was little. My wife's family… I don't know so much about their health. We haven't talked about it. Sorry. I'm not good at remembering all that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright – you’re not expected to be a medical historian! Knowing your father had high blood pressure is helpful, though. We’ll take that into account. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can eat anything. I can take any medicine. No problems. I haven't taken medicine in… a long time. Just… headache pills sometimes. But not often. And I don’t think I’m allergic to those. They work fine. My wife always says I’m too tough to be allergic to anything. She jokes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies – that’s good. And you haven't been taking any regular medications. Alright, Philipp, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That’s okay with you, right?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. That's fine. What will you do? Just… listening to my heart? I hope it’s not too bad. It usually sounds normal. But when it flaps… maybe not so normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears and throat. It's a pretty standard exam. If you could just sit up on the table, please. We'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. 130 over 80. Your heart rate is a little fast, about 90 beats per minute. And your lungs sound clear. Do you feel any pain anywhere right now?
PATIENT: No pain. Not anywhere. My heart feels… normal now. Just a little fast, maybe. Like it's working too hard. But no pain. You said my blood pressure is a little high? Is that bad? My wife, she worries about my blood pressure. She makes me eat lots of vegetables.
DOCTOR: It's good to know you're not experiencing any pain. A blood pressure of 130/80 is slightly elevated, but not at a level that requires immediate concern. It’s something we’ll want to monitor, and yes, your wife is right to encourage healthy eating! It can definitely help. Now, sometimes these palpitations, as we call them, can be triggered by things like caffeine or stress. You mentioned you don’t drink coffee, which is good. Let’s try a little test. I'm going to listen to your heart again while you take a few deep breaths and hold them. This sometimes helps us capture irregular rhythms. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breaths. Hold them. I can do that. My wife always tells me to breathe when I'm worried. She's good at that. Is it different now? It feels the same. Maybe a little faster.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m not hearing anything significantly different with the breath-holding. Your heart rate is still a little fast, but the rhythm appears regular. Given your description and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing what we call sinus tachycardia, which is simply a faster-than-normal heart rate. However, to rule out any underlying causes, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to get an EKG to check the electrical activity of your heart?
PATIENT: EKG? What is that? Does it hurt? I don’t like needles. And I don’t like machines poking me. My wife always makes me do tests, but I don't like them. Is it important? Is my heart broken?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be nervous about tests, and I want to assure you, an EKG is not painful at all. It doesn't involve any needles. It's a simple, non-invasive procedure where we place small sticky patches, called electrodes, on your chest, arms, and legs. These patches detect the electrical signals of your heart and record them on a piece of paper. It doesn't poke you at all! It’s important because it helps us understand if there's any irregular heart rhythm, or any signs of heart strain. It's just a precaution to make sure everything is okay. “Broken” is a strong word – it’s very unlikely your heart is broken, but we want to be thorough. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. No needles. And no poking. Just… sticky patches. My wife will be happy I’m getting a test. She always worries. And it's okay if it makes her happy. Yes. I will do the test. When can we do it? Is it long? I have to go to work later. Chemical stuff. I need to be careful.
DOCTOR: That’s great to hear, Philipp. It’s a very quick test, usually takes about five to ten minutes. We can do it right now in the office. The technician is ready to go. Then we'll get the results fairly quickly. It won't interfere with your work at all. I’ll let the technician, Maria, come in and get you set up. And we’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to relax. It’s likely nothing serious, but it’s good we’re checking it out. Would you like a glass of water while you wait?
PATIENT: Yes. Water is good. I get thirsty when I worry. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. My wife says I need to listen to doctors more. Maybe she is right. Just… don't let the machine poke me. Okay? .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no poking, I promise! And you're very welcome, Philipp. I'm glad you came in, and it's excellent that your wife encourages you to take care of your health. I’ll get Maria in here right away with the water and the EKG. Maria?
