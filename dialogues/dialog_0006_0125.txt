DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, to be honest, my wife insisted. She worries too much. I wanted to get checked for... you know... the HIV thing. Just to keep her happy, really. I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Just a check-up to put your wife’s mind at ease. That's perfectly reasonable. And you feel no symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Look, I work long hours, compliance is stressful. I'm always a bit tired. That doesn’t mean I have something wrong with me. I eat alright, I guess. Normal food. Not one of these fussy eaters. What kind of symptoms would I even be looking for? Honestly, I wouldn’t know.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Well, sometimes there are flu-like symptoms early on – fever, fatigue, maybe a sore throat, muscle aches. But those can be from lots of things. And sometimes, there are no symptoms at all for a long time. Let’s just go through a bit of your history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Tested? No. Never needed to. I mean, I've been married for ten years, happy as you like. Where would I even get something like that? Honestly, it feels like a waste of time, but… alright. No, never tested. And honestly, I don't really understand why I'm even here. Is this a routine thing now? Everyone getting poked and prodded?
DOCTOR: It’s not routine for everyone, no. Your wife just wants to be sure, and that's a good thing. It's always best to know. Okay. Let’s move on. Any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Not really. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox... nothing serious. Broke my arm once, climbing a tree when I was a kid, but it healed fine. Other than that, just the normal aches and pains of getting older. I've never been hospitalised, if that's what you mean. I'm a pretty healthy guy, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No hospitalizations. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Absolutely none. I haven't had anything removed or put in. I keep my body intact, thank you very much. This is a lot of questions for something I didn’t even want to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Belan. We just need to cover all the bases. Okay. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my parents are both… they're both gone now. A long time ago. My wife's family is healthy enough, as far as I know. They’re not exactly forthcoming with information, if you understand. No history of… anything major, not that I’ve heard. They're… simple people. What kind of family history are we even talking about here?
DOCTOR: Just general health problems, sir. Anything like heart disease, diabetes, cancer… things that might run in the family. It helps us understand your risk. Let's move on to something else for a moment. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. I find it disgusting. And bad for you. My wife would have a fit. I do enjoy a drink now and then, a beer with dinner, maybe a glass of wine on the weekend. Perfectly normal, I’d say. Not enough to cause any problems. I'm a reasonable man.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional alcohol. That's good to know. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Spicy food, peanuts, shellfish... never had a problem. Honestly, I'm pretty robust. My wife tries to get me to eat more vegetables, but I'm not a fan. Never been allergic to anything. I'm a fairly simple man, really. No fancy foods, no fancy allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nothing. I don't believe in popping pills unless I absolutely have to. A little painkiller for a headache now and then, but that’s it. I like to let my body heal itself. Too much of this modern medicine, if you ask me. What are you trying to find out, exactly?
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a complete picture, Mr. Belan. Okay. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, just to be on the safe side. Can you step up on the exam table?
PATIENT: Exam? Now hold on a minute. I came here for a blood test, that's it. I'm not really dressed for… poking and prodding. And honestly, I'm perfectly healthy. What's the point of this? My wife will be furious if I come home smelling like a hospital.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, the blood test will give us information, but a quick exam helps us interpret the results. It’s standard procedure. It won't be invasive. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure... It will only take a few minutes. And it will reassure your wife. If you’re uncomfortable, we can skip it, but it's not ideal. We need to do what's best for your health.
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And be gentle. I'm not used to this sort of thing. I'm a busy man, you know. I have things to do. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Belan. Quick and gentle. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, then check your blood pressure. Please take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear… Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s a little elevated, but not concerning at this point. Reflexes are normal. Throat looks clear, ears are fine. Everything seems normal so far, physically. Now, let's get that blood test done. It will take just a few minutes.
PATIENT: Alright, get it over with then. I still think this is a waste of time, but if it keeps the wife happy... Just don't poke me too much. And tell me if it’s going to hurt. I’ve got a low tolerance for pain, you know.
DOCTOR: It’ll be a quick prick, Mr. Belan. A little sting, that’s all. Try to relax… Okay, all done. Just apply pressure for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. There, that wasn’t so bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, it wasn't pleasant. But I suppose it's over now. How long before we get the results? And will I have to come back here for something else? I really don't have time for repeated visits. Honestly, I've wasted half a day already.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within 3-5 business days, Mr. Belan. We can call you with the results, or you can check the online patient portal. If everything looks normal, you won’t need to come back. If there are any concerns, we'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. No other questions. Just get me out of here. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of time, but if the wife is happy, I suppose that’s all that matters. Tell me again about this online thing? How does it work? I’m not very good with computers.
DOCTOR: Of course. You'll receive an email with instructions on how to create an account on the patient portal. It's a secure website where you can view your test results, schedule appointments, and message our office. It’s very user-friendly. If you have any trouble, our office staff can help you set it up over the phone. Here’s a card with the website address and our phone number. Alright, Mr. Belan, you’re all set. Have a good day, and try not to worry. We’ll be in touch soon.
