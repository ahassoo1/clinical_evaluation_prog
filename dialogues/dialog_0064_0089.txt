DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, I suppose. I’ve been having some rather… unpleasant pains. Lower down, you see. It comes and goes, but when it does come… oh dear. It’s difficult to explain. I do apologize; my memory isn’t what it used to be. I believe my… condition… plays a part in that. The lupus, yes. I think that’s what the other doctors said.
DOCTOR: Right, lupus. Yes, that can certainly have a range of effects. No need to apologize at all, we’ll take our time. “Unpleasant pains” is a good start. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well… they're… cramping, mostly. A very deep ache, and sometimes… sharp, almost. It feels like… twisting, if that makes any sense? And it’s… unpredictable. Sometimes it’s just a mild discomfort, barely noticeable, and other times… well, other times I can scarcely stand. It comes on suddenly, usually. I haven't been able to pinpoint anything that causes it, exactly. I do try to keep track, but… it escapes me. I wish I could be more precise, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Alese. “Twisting” gives me a good idea. And the unpredictability is important. You’re doing just fine. When did these pains start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. It feels like they’ve been… gradually worsening over time. It’s not like a sudden onset, you see. Perhaps… six months ago? No, longer. A year, perhaps? It’s all rather… blurry. I do recall a particularly bad episode around… the holidays, I think. December, yes. But before that… it was more manageable, just occasional discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly a year, with a worsening trend, and a particularly bad episode around December. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me see… lying down sometimes helps, yes. Just… being still. And… warm compresses. A warm bath, or a heating pad on my lower abdomen. That seems to soothe it somewhat. Not a complete fix, mind you, but it takes the edge off. I haven't found anything that makes it completely disappear, though. And sometimes… nothing works at all. It just has to… run its course.
DOCTOR: Alright, lying down and warm compresses offer some relief, but it’s not always consistent. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the stomach pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… now that you mention it. Fatigue, of course. I’m always rather tired, but it’s been… more pronounced lately. And… some bloating, yes. My abdomen feels quite swollen at times. I've also had… some changes in my bowel habits, if you don’t mind me saying. Not regular, you see. Sometimes… constipated, other times… the opposite. It's quite… embarrassing to discuss, but I want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: No need to be embarrassed at all, Alese. These details are very important. Fatigue, bloating, and changes in bowel habits… alright. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No vomiting at all. And nausea… very rarely. Perhaps once or twice, but it wasn't severe. It passed quickly. Mostly it’s just… the pain and the discomfort. And the… well, the general feeling of being unwell. It’s difficult to describe. I just don’t feel… right.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea or vomiting. Just the pain, discomfort, fatigue and changes in bowel habits. You mentioned lupus earlier. Are you currently under a specialist’s care for that?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Dr. Eleanor Vance. She's… very good, very thorough. We’ve been… managing the condition for quite some time now. I see her every… three months, I believe. She monitors my bloodwork and adjusts my medication as needed. I’m on… oh dear, I forget the name of the drug. Something with… “my-fen…” or something similar? I apologize. I should write these things down, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Alese. Don't worry about remembering medication names. We can look it up in your records. Let me just pull up your file here... Ah, yes. Mycophenolate mofetil. That's the one. And Prednisone, intermittently. Do you take any other medications at all, even over-the-counter things?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it! Mycophenolate, yes. And the Prednisone… when things flare up, you see. As for other medications… just a multivitamin, really. And occasionally… ibuprofen, for aches and pains. But not very often. I try to avoid it, if possible. It doesn’t seem to do much good, anyway. And I worry about… interactions with the other medications. Dr. Vance warned me about those.
DOCTOR: Alright, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you had any changes in your diet lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… not drastically, no. I’ve been trying to eat a bit healthier, perhaps? More fruits and vegetables. Less… processed foods, you see. It’s difficult, though. I do enjoy a good biscuit now and then. But I haven’t made any major changes to my diet. And I haven’t noticed any… specific foods that trigger the pain. It seems to come on randomly, regardless of what I’ve eaten.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major dietary changes or specific food triggers. Alright, Alese, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Yes, I believe so. A hysterectomy, quite some time ago. Perhaps… thirty years ago? It was… routine, you see. And… an appendectomy, when I was a young girl. That was… rather unpleasant, I recall. Other than those… I don’t believe so. Nothing major, anyway. Just the usual… childhood illnesses, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, hysterectomy thirty years ago and an appendectomy in childhood. And any serious illnesses – other than the lupus – that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had… high blood pressure, for a while. But it's been well-controlled with medication, thankfully. And… arthritis, in my hands. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older, you see. Nothing debilitating. Other than those… I don’t recall anything major. I do try to stay healthy, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and arthritis. And finally, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that's a question. My mother… she had… heart trouble, I believe. And my father… he had diabetes. And… my sister, she had… well, she had some sort of… autoimmune condition. Not lupus, though. Something else. I can’t recall the name of it, I'm afraid. It was… quite a long time ago. And… other than that… I don't recall any major illnesses in my family. It's a rather large family, you see, so it's difficult to keep track.
DOCTOR: Alright, heart trouble in your mother, diabetes in your father, and an autoimmune condition in your sister. Thank you, Alese. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement. I'm… a little nervous, of course, but I'm sure it's nothing serious. I just want to feel… better.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Okay… I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds, but there is some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on your left side. It doesn’t seem to be acute pain, but it’s definitely there. And… no masses that I can feel. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes… that's… a little uncomfortable. There. On the left side, you see. A dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, but… noticeable. It’s… similar to what I’ve been feeling at home, just… a little more pronounced. And… yes, a little higher up too, perhaps? It’s difficult to pinpoint, I apologize. It’s just… a general discomfort in that area. It doesn't feel like anything is… broken, or anything, you understand. Just… sore.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That’s helpful. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145 over 90. Your reflexes are normal. Alright, Alese, based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing a flare-up of abdominal pain, likely related to your lupus. However, the changes in your bowel habits, and the tenderness in your lower abdomen, make me want to rule out other possibilities. I think it would be wise to order some bloodwork – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an inflammatory marker, like a C-reactive protein. And I'd also like to order a stool test to check for any infection or inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If that will help determine what’s going on, then please, proceed. I trust your judgement entirely. Bloodwork and a stool test… very well. I do hope it’s not anything too serious. And… how long will it take to get the results? And… will I need to change anything before the tests?
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be anything too serious, but it's always best to be thorough. The lab results typically take about 2-3 business days. As for before the tests, nothing special. Just… continue to drink plenty of fluids. For the stool test, the nurse will give you a collection kit and instructions. It’s… fairly straightforward. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or if you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. Two to three business days for the results, and just continue to drink fluids. And contact the office if anything worsens. Very well. I… appreciate your thoroughness. And… your patience with my… forgetfulness. It’s a comfort to know someone is taking this seriously. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. It’s my pleasure. Don’t worry about the forgetfulness at all – we’ll work around it. The nurse will be in shortly to collect a urine sample and give you the instructions for the stool test. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. I truly appreciate your time and attention. I… I feel a little more at ease now, knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alese. That’s what I’m here for. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if anything changes. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon. .
PATIENT: .
