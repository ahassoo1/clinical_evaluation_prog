DOCTOR: Hi Derick, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, hello. Dr. Ranjan, is it? Right. Well, it’s… my face. And legs. They’re all puffy, see? Not like a lot puffy, but… noticeable. It's been going on for a bit now, I reckon. Can't quite put my finger on when it started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You've noticed some swelling in your face and legs, and it's been going on for a while. "A while" is a bit vague, though – would you say it's been days, weeks, or longer?
PATIENT: Weeks, I suppose. Maybe a month? Hard to say, really. Time just… slips away when you’re on your own, you know? Not like I’m keeping a calendar or anything. It just… gradually got puffier, that's all. Didn’t happen overnight. And it doesn’t hurt, if that matters. Just… looks funny, I guess. My Elsie always said I looked best with sharp angles. She had an eye for these things.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's been gradual, over about a month, and there's no pain. That's good to know. It does matter. Elsie sounds like she had good taste! To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me if anything seems to make the swelling worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm… well, standing around for too long, maybe? I do a bit of… fiddling with metal all day, you see. Welding and such. Gotta stand pretty still to get it right. But it's not like I notice it getting worse during the day. It's just… worse at the end of it, I think. Does that make sense? And sometimes… when it’s real hot. But again, I can’t say for sure. Everything feels a bit warm these days, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so standing for long periods, especially with your welding, and heat might make it a bit more noticeable. That’s helpful. And you’ve mentioned it’s worse at the end of the day. Now, have you noticed any changes in how much you’re urinating?
PATIENT: Urinating? What do you mean? Like… more or less? I… I don't really pay attention to that sort of thing. Same as always, I suppose. Go in, go out. Never thought about counting or anything. Is that something I should be doing? Sounds a bit silly, if you ask me. Elsie would have a good laugh about that. She always said I was hopeless at keeping track of things.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all to ask, and no, you shouldn’t necessarily be counting, but just generally, have you noticed a significant change in how often you go to the bathroom, or the amount you're passing?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe a little less? Now that you mention it. But I've also been drinking less water. It's been so hot, I just haven’t been feeling as thirsty. And when I do drink, it's usually with my meals. Not like I'm sipping on it all day. Is that bad? I didn't know you could get sick from not drinking enough water. You learn something new every day, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so less water intake, and possibly less urination. That could be contributing. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your health in general. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Hmm. Well, Elsie always worried about my blood pressure. Said I got too flustered too easily. But I never really went to a doctor about it. Didn't see the point, really. Just a bit of puffiness now and then. As for anything else… no, not that I know of. I’ve always been a pretty sturdy Swede, if you ask me. Kept going, even when things got tough. She always said I was stubborn as a mule, though. Probably not a medical condition. Just… me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some concern about blood pressure in the past, but no formal diagnosis. And you’ve generally been healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Now that you mention it, when I was a young lad, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. But that was… ages ago. A long, long time ago. Just a simple break, they set it and I was good as new. No big deal. Other than that… no, I can't recall ever being in a hospital. Elsie always looked after me, kept me out of trouble. Well, mostly. She had her hands full with me, that woman. A good woman. Still miss her terribly, you know.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about Elsie. It sounds like she was very important to you. Okay, so a broken arm as a child, otherwise no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of swelling, kidney problems, heart problems, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Swelling… Hmm. My mother, she had… well, her ankles got a bit puffy towards the end, I think. But she was old. And she didn't really talk about her ailments. A stoic woman, that one. As for the rest… I don't really know. We weren't a family for sharing secrets, if you catch my drift. Kept to ourselves, mostly. My father… he was a fisherman. Strong as an ox, but not one for doctors either. So, no, I don’t know about any heart problems or diabetes. I reckon most of us just worked ourselves to death, to be honest. It was a different time.
DOCTOR: Okay, some swelling in your mother's ankles when she was older, but no known history of other relevant conditions. Now, I'm just going to ask a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched the stuff. Elsie wouldn’t allow it. Said it smelled dreadful and was bad for your lungs. As for alcohol… I used to enjoy a beer with dinner now and then. A light lager. But that was… well, not anymore. Doesn’t seem to appeal to me since she passed. Just sits there, flat. No flavor. No enjoyment. It's all a bit pointless, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don’t smoke and you’ve reduced your alcohol intake since your wife passed. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not a one. Elsie used to try and get me to take something for my blood pressure, but I always refused. Didn't see the point, really. Vitamins… No, nothing like that either. Just good old-fashioned hard work, that’s what kept me going. And a bit of Swedish stubbornness, of course. She always said I was a mule. But honestly, I haven't been taking anything at all, not since… well, not since Elsie. It all just feels… unnecessary, if you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Alright, Derick, thank you for that information. Now, would you mind if I just quickly examine you?
PATIENT: Go right ahead. I suppose it can’t hurt. Though I warn you, I’m a bit sensitive about my belly. Elsie always said I carried a bit of extra padding, but I liked it. Kept me warm in the winter. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Just be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 90. Your pulse is 78, which is normal. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to examine your legs and feet, checking for swelling and looking at your skin. I'll also gently palpate your abdomen. I am noting some swelling in both legs, up to the ankles, it's what we call pitting edema. Your skin feels normal, and your abdomen is soft. No tenderness when I touch it. Alright, Derick, thank you. That was helpful. It sounds like you’re experiencing some fluid retention, which is contributing to the swelling in your legs and face. Your elevated blood pressure is also a concern. Given your history and the examination findings, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause at this time. It could be a number of things, from kidney issues to heart problems, or even just a side effect of reduced activity and changes in diet.
PATIENT: Reduced activity… Well, that sounds about right. It's hard to get motivated these days. Everything feels… pointless, if you catch my drift. Kidneys and heart… Now that sounds serious. Elsie always worried about my heart, you know. Is it bad? Should I be worried? I don't want to end up in a hospital bed, flat on my back. Elsie always said I looked best on my feet, tinkering with metal.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Derick. It is good that we're looking into this now. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s anything serious, but it's important to rule out potential causes. Your blood pressure is something we definitely need to address. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and a urine sample. The blood tests will help us check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any underlying infections. The urine sample will also give us more information about your kidneys. I also think an EKG, which is a simple test that checks your heart’s electrical activity, would be a good idea. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… More poking and prodding, eh? Well, I suppose it's better than ending up flat on my back in a hospital bed. Elsie would have a good laugh about this, I reckon. All these tests… She always said I was too stubborn to go to the doctor. Alright, go ahead and order whatever tests you need. Just… try to be gentle, alright? And… can you explain what all these tests are, exactly? I don't understand all that medical jargon. Elsie always did the talking for me when it came to doctors.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll explain everything as we go, and I'll make sure it’s as gentle as possible. The blood tests involve taking a small sample of blood from your arm. It’ll only take a few minutes. We'll be looking at things like your kidney function, electrolytes, and checking for any signs of infection. The urine sample is pretty simple. You'll just need to provide a sample when you go to the bathroom. We'll send that off to the lab to check for protein, blood, and other things that can give us clues about your kidneys. And the EKG is a completely painless test. We'll put some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs, and it will record your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t involve any needles or anything like that. It just takes a few minutes. These tests will help us narrow down the possible causes of your swelling and elevated blood pressure. Do you have any questions about any of them?
PATIENT: Sounds… less dreadful than I thought, I suppose. No needles is good. Elsie always hated needles. Sticky pads… Alright, I can handle sticky pads. Protein and blood… Is that bad if there’s protein or blood in the… the sample? Does that mean my kidneys are failing? I’ve heard stories, you know. Old man Hemmings down the road, he ended up on dialysis. Didn’t look happy. And if my heart’s electrical activity is… off, what does that mean? Am I going to need one of those… pacemakers? Elsie always said I had a strong heart, even if it did beat a bit too fast sometimes when I got flustered.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking these questions, Derick. It’s important to understand what we're looking for. Finding protein in the urine can be a sign of kidney problems, but it doesn’t automatically mean your kidneys are failing. There are many reasons why protein might be present, and we need to look at the bigger picture. As for your heart, irregular electrical activity can sometimes indicate a problem, but again, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need a pacemaker. An EKG will give us a more detailed picture of your heart’s rhythm and help us determine if any further investigation is needed. Right now, we're just gathering information. I don’t want to jump to any conclusions or scare you unnecessarily. These tests will help us figure out what's going on and develop a plan to address it. I'll order these tests for you now. The nurse will come in shortly to take your blood and explain the instructions for collecting the urine sample. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that’s enough for now. All this talk about kidneys and hearts is making my head spin. Just… try to be gentle with the blood, alright? And tell the nurse I’m a bit sensitive. Elsie always said I had thin veins. Alright, let’s get it over with. The sooner we know what’s going on, the sooner I can get back to my metal. It's the only thing that keeps me going these days, you know. Keeps the memories alive.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll make sure the nurse is aware. And I promise we’ll be as gentle as possible. I’ll let you get started. The nurse will be in shortly. And please, don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns along the way. I’ll be back to discuss the results once they come in. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We're taking things one step at a time.
PATIENT: .
