DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the paperwork said. Look, can we just get this over with? I got things to do. It's…what, a check-up? My husband made the appointment. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling pressed for time, Ms. Dudney, and we'll do our best to be efficient. However, it's important we gather all the necessary information to ensure we provide you with the best possible care. Your husband is thoughtful to be proactive about your health. So, regarding the high blood pressure – do you know when you were first diagnosed?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. He just…told me. Said the machine at work showed it was high when they do that yearly thing. I don't pay attention to those numbers. They always freak me out. It was…maybe a month ago? Or two? I don’t know. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter a little, Ms. Dudney, but we can work with that. It’s good to know it was detected at work during a routine check. Do you happen to know what the numbers were, even approximately?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don’t do numbers. They told my husband, he’s the one with the… the list. He keeps everything. I wouldn’t even know where to begin looking. Seriously, can we just…take my blood pressure now? I'm sure it's fine. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Dudney. We can certainly take your blood pressure now. However, to get a complete picture and understand what might be going on, I'd like to ask a few brief questions, if you don't mind. It will help me determine if any further testing is needed. First, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've always been healthy. A little…stressed, maybe. But who isn’t? Look, I eat okay, I guess. Not a lot of junk food. And I definitely don’t go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. So, no. Nothing. Can we please move this along?
DOCTOR: Certainly. And I appreciate you telling me that. It’s helpful to know you generally feel well and don't have any chronic conditions. Just a couple more quick questions, and then we can proceed with the blood pressure check. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I broke my arm when I was little, does that count? But it was… ages ago. Barely remember it. Nothing else. Look, I really need to get back to work. My boss is already annoyed I’m even here. Can we just skip the history and get this done?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. We can focus on getting your blood pressure checked right away. However, it’s important to understand that high blood pressure often has no symptoms. That’s why it’s important to gather information, even if you feel fine. Before we proceed, could you tell me if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has a history of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting into family history? Seriously? Look, my grandma… on my mom's side… she had something. I don't know what. Something with her heart, maybe? Everyone in my family is old, things happen. My husband probably knows, but he’s not here. Can we just skip it? It's just going to be a waste of time. I bet it's nothing. Just stress.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. I understand your frustration. It's helpful to know about the potential heart condition in your grandmother. We can certainly proceed with checking your blood pressure. Before we do that, could you briefly tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I don’t take pills. I don't like taking pills. Maybe… sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. Very rarely. Honestly, I’m a healthy person. This whole thing is probably just a mistake. Can we please get this over with? I’m starting to feel anxious just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Dudney. We'll take your blood pressure now. Please relax your arm, and try to take a few deep breaths. I’m going to inflate the cuff, and it will feel tight for a moment.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Dudney. Your blood pressure reading is a bit higher than we'd like to see. It's 158 over 92. While one reading doesn't necessarily mean you have high blood pressure, it's enough to warrant further investigation. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood work. This will help us assess your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and rule out any other underlying causes. We will also need to repeat the blood pressure measurement several times over the course of a few days to confirm the reading. Would that be acceptable?
