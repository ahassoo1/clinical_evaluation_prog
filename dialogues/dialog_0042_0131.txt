DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my blood pressure. It's been a little high lately, and my regular doctor said I should come get it checked out properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good you're getting it checked out. High blood pressure is something we want to address. Just to clarify, when you say “lately,” about how long have you been noticing it’s been higher than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Probably… about three months now, I'd say. Maybe a little less. It wasn’t anything drastic at first, just felt a bit off when I checked it at the pharmacy, but it’s been creeping up steadily since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months. And you’ve been checking it at the pharmacy…do you know what the readings have been, roughly?
PATIENT: Not exact numbers, no. I just remember it being over 140 sometimes, and the nurse always said anything over 140 is something to watch. I don’t write it down or anything, just kinda check when I'm there getting my usual stuff. I mostly just noticed 'cause it felt higher than what it usually is.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a starting point. It's good you've been aware of it creeping up. And it’s helpful you recall readings over 140. Now, have you been experiencing any symptoms along with the higher blood pressure – things like headaches, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t had any headaches or anything like that. My vision’s been fine, and I haven’t had any chest pain or trouble breathing. Honestly, that’s why I didn’t rush to come in sooner - 'cause I didn’t feel sick, just worried about the numbers being high.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. It's not uncommon to have high blood pressure without noticeable symptoms, which is why regular checks are so important. Now, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, like chickenpox, but nothing serious. I had a bit of trouble with asthma when I was a little girl, but I haven’t needed an inhaler in years. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy. I get regular check-ups with my primary care doctor, and she always says I’m doing okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Asthma as a child, but well-controlled now. That's helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. And I haven't been in the hospital since I was born, thankfully! Just the regular doctor visits and stuff, nothing major. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can!
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. Alright, let's talk about your family history. Are there any health problems that run in your family – things like high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm... my grandfather on my mother's side had high blood pressure, I think. And my aunt on my father’s side had diabetes. She had it for a long time, but I don't know much about it. Nobody else that I know of has had anything serious. My mom's pretty healthy, and my dad passed away a few years ago, but he was mostly okay for his age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in your maternal grandfather and diabetes in your aunt. That's good information. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. Always thought it was a terrible habit. My mom always warned me about it when I was younger. I don't like being around it much either, honestly. Makes me cough.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: I drink sometimes. Not very often, though. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month, or a drink at a party. I don't really drink much at all, to be honest. It doesn't really agree with me, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine, nothing regular. And how about exercise?
PATIENT: I try to get some exercise when I can. I like to walk when the weather is nice, and I do a little bit of gardening. It’s not a full workout or anything, but I try to stay active. I used to go to a Zumba class, but I haven’t been in a while. Life gets busy, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Life definitely gets busy. Now, what about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. I like to cook at home as much as possible, and I try to use fresh ingredients. I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, and I try to limit my processed foods and sugary drinks. I have a bit of a sweet tooth, though, so I do indulge in a treat sometimes! I love a good slice of cake, if I'm being honest. But I try not to overdo it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a pretty balanced diet overall. Last few questions about your background. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember. Nothing prescribed by a doctor or anything. I try to get most of my nutrients from my food, to be honest. I don’t really like taking a lot of pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. My mom always said I had a strong stomach. Nothing bothers me really, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's excellent. Thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure, of course, and then listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. Hopefully everything is alright. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest, but I know you’re trying to help.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright to be nervous. We'll take things one step at a time. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 152 over 90. That is elevated. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Ears look clear, throat is normal. Overall, your exam is unremarkable, but the elevated blood pressure is something we need to address. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh… 152? That is high, isn't it? I was hoping it wouldn’t be that bad. So… what does that mean? What do we do now? Is it something serious? I’m a little scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It is a bit higher than we’d like, and I understand your concern. It can be serious if left unmanaged, increasing your risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems, but the good news is it's very manageable with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. We don’t need to jump to medication immediately. First, I want to repeat the blood pressure reading in a few minutes to confirm it. Sometimes anxiety can temporarily elevate it. Then, I’d like to talk about some lifestyle modifications that can help lower it. These include reducing your salt intake, eating a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, getting regular exercise, and managing stress. We can also do some blood work to rule out any underlying causes of your high blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds…reasonable. Repeating the reading makes sense, and I'm glad you're not rushing into pills right away. And yes, blood work sounds good. I’d rather know everything is okay, even if it’s not great news. Less stress if I know what we’re dealing with. What kind of diet stuff are we talking about? I already try to eat pretty healthy, but I guess I could probably do better. And stress… that’s a hard one! But I’ll try.
DOCTOR: That's a very good attitude, Mykeisha. Knowledge is definitely power. Okay, regarding diet, we’re aiming for a diet rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium—things found in bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach, and dairy. The DASH diet is a good starting point. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy, while limiting saturated and total fat, cholesterol, and sodium. We can get you a handout with more details. As for sodium, try to limit processed foods, fast food, and canned soups—they’re often loaded with salt. Read labels carefully and aim for less than 2300 milligrams of sodium per day, ideally closer to 1500. As for stress, there are many strategies that can help. Regular exercise is a great start, as is deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga. Finding hobbies you enjoy can also help you relax and de-stress. We can discuss some other options if those don't work for you. Before we move on, do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s a lot to take in. I think I understand the basic idea. Less salt, more fruits and veggies, and try to calm down! The DASH diet… I'll have to look that up. I'm not sure I’ve ever heard of it. I guess I can try. I do like to cook, so maybe I can find some recipes. And the exercise… yeah, I can definitely walk more. It’s the stress part that worries me. I have a busy life, you know? But I’ll try to make time. The blood work… what exactly will that check for? Just to know what I'm getting myself into. And how long will that take to get results?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. The blood work will give us a broader picture of your overall health and help us rule out any underlying causes of your high blood pressure. We’ll be checking your kidney function, electrolyte levels, blood sugar, cholesterol levels, and a complete blood count. It will also help us assess if there’s any evidence of other health problems that might be contributing to your hypertension. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a more tailored treatment plan. In the meantime, let’s repeat the blood pressure reading just to get a second confirmation. I’ll also write down some information about the DASH diet and some resources for stress management. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, please! That would be really helpful. Having something written down makes me feel better. And repeating the reading is a good idea. Okay, let’s do it. I just hope everything isn't too bad. I really don't want to have to take a bunch of pills. But I'm willing to try, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, your second reading is 148 over 88. Still elevated, but slightly lower than the first. It's good that it’s coming down a little. We will need to monitor it consistently. Here you go. This information provides a good overview of the DASH diet and some techniques for managing stress. I also want you to monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible. It’s helpful to track your readings and bring them to your next appointment. For now, let’s focus on lifestyle changes. I’ll order the blood work, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and see how you're doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds like a plan. Two weeks… I can definitely do that. I'll try to be good and stick to the diet and stress stuff. And I’ll try to get a blood pressure monitor, if I can. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I feel a little less worried now, knowing what we’re doing. Hopefully everything will be okay.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. I’m glad I could help ease your worries. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll work through this together. Have a good day, and I'll see you in two weeks.
