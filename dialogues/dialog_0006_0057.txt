DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s… well, it’s about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you. It’s been… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Cancer, right. Yes, I… I see that note here. It is a lot, you're right. Okay. Um… let’s take this slowly. Do you mind telling me what you were told, specifically?
PATIENT: They said… it’s in my lungs. And… that it started a while ago, but we didn’t know. I don’t… I don’t really understand everything they said. It was a lot of words. Something about… stages? And treatment? I mostly just remember being… scared.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. "Stages" and "treatment," yes. That's… standard. It is a lot to process all at once. Let’s try to break it down. So, you were informed about lung cancer… and it’s been developing for some time, they said?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s right. They said… it wasn’t caught early enough. I don’t know what that means, exactly. Does that mean… it’s bad? I’m sorry, that probably sounds silly. It’s just… I don’t know what any of this means. And my husband… he would have known.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound silly at all, Chellsea. It’s perfectly normal to be confused and scared. “Not caught early enough”... well, it means the cancer has had more time to grow. It doesn't automatically mean it’s hopeless, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that helps a little. I guess. What… what happens now? Do I… do I need more tests? Or… is there something you can do? I’m just trying to understand what my options are. And… what to expect.
DOCTOR: Right, options. Yes. Well, we definitely need to get a clearer picture of things. I'll want to review the previous scans, if you don’t mind. Let me see… ah, here we are. It looks like a CT scan was done… and a biopsy. Do you remember anything about those?
PATIENT: I… I remember the CT scan. It was a big machine. And they had me lie very still. The biopsy… that was… uncomfortable. They took something from my lung, I think. It hurt for a little while afterwards. But they didn't tell me what they found, not really. Just that it was cancer.
DOCTOR: Okay, CT scan and biopsy. Good. So, the biopsy confirmed cancer… and the CT scan gives us some idea of the size and location. We need to know the type of cancer, Chellsea. That determines the best course of action. Let’s see… it appears this report says… non-small cell lung cancer. Do you have any family history of cancer?
PATIENT: Non-small cell… I don’t think so. No one really talked about it much. My grandmother… she was sick for a long time, but we didn’t know what was wrong with her, not exactly. And my mother… she passed when I was young. No… no family history that I know of. It feels strange, talking about this. I wish… I wish my husband was here. He always knew what questions to ask.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s… a lot to take on alone. Okay, no known family history. Let's talk about staging, then. The staging tells us how far the cancer has spread. The report indicates… Stage IIB. Does that mean anything to you?
PATIENT: Stage IIB… no. They said something about numbers, and letters… but it didn’t really stick. It just sounded… bad. Is that bad? What does that mean for me? Like… how long? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea, let's take it one step at a time. Stage IIB means the cancer is in the lung and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. It’s… it’s not ideal, but it is treatable. As for how long… that's a very difficult question. It depends on a lot of factors – your overall health, how well you respond to treatment… and the specific type of non-small cell lung cancer. It is important to understand treatment options before trying to predict an outcome. As for pain… that varies too. We have excellent ways to manage pain if it becomes an issue. We'll talk about those later, if necessary. For now, let's focus on the next steps. I’d like to order some more tests to get a clearer picture, if that’s alright. A PET scan, and maybe a bronchoscopy. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A PET scan… and a bronchoscopy… Yes, okay. If that’s what you think is best. I… I trust your judgment. What will those tests do? And… how long will they take? I have… appointments. And… things.
DOCTOR: Right, appointments. I understand. A PET scan helps us see if the cancer has spread anywhere else in your body. It involves an injection of a special dye. As for the bronchoscopy… it's a procedure where we insert a thin tube with a camera into your airways to get a better look at the tumor and potentially take more samples. Both tests usually take a few hours, including preparation and recovery. We can schedule them for next week. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, call you with specific times. In the meantime, I want to refer you to an oncologist, Dr. Ramirez. She’s a specialist in lung cancer, and she’ll be the one overseeing your treatment. Would you like me to schedule that appointment as well?
PATIENT: Yes, please. An oncologist… that sounds… good. Someone who knows more about this. And… scheduling the appointments would be very helpful. I… I don’t think I could manage all of that myself right now. Thank you. Thank you for explaining everything. It… still feels overwhelming, but… a little less scary.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. It is a lot to take in, and you're doing well. I'm glad I could help clarify things. Sarah will be in touch shortly to schedule those appointments. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… please have Sarah call as soon as possible. I… I want to get this started. And… thank you again. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. Sarah will be in touch very soon. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care.
