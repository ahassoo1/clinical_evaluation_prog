DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, doc, it's this… shaking. It's in my hands, mostly. Makes things difficult. I don't have all day to sit here explaining it, you know. It just is. My wife… she would always tell me to get it checked. Now she’s gone, and… well. Just get on with it, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, we will get to the bottom of this. It’s perfectly alright to take things at your own pace, though. It sounds like you've been dealing with this hand shaking for some time. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed the shaking?
PATIENT: When I noticed? Honestly, doc, that's a hard one. Things blur after a while, you know? Probably… oh, geez… a few months ago, maybe? Longer? It started subtly. I thought it was just getting old, being tired. It’s not like I’m doing anything strenuous. I used to be a director, you know. A producer. Lots of sitting. Now it's just… more noticeable. Especially when I try to… hold a glass. Or eat. It’s embarrassing. Does that answer your question? Can we speed this up?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Mr. Baide, thank you. A few months ago, gradually worsening, more noticeable with activities like holding a glass or eating… I appreciate you sharing that. And no, we will certainly move at a pace that is comfortable for you. Now, is the shaking present all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Definitely comes and goes. Mostly when I’m… trying to do something. Like I said, holding a glass. Or signing my name. Used to be able to sign a contract in a flash, now it looks like a kid wrote it. When I’m just… sitting, it’s not so bad. Not always there, anyway. Sometimes it just… flares up. For no reason. It’s just… annoying, doc. Really annoying. Is this going to involve a lot of poking and prodding? I really don’t like that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about poking and prodding, Mr. Baide, and I will do my best to make the examination as comfortable as possible. We'll start with some simple observations, and then if necessary, we can proceed with a more thorough physical exam. You mentioned it flares up seemingly at random. Does anything specifically seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Look, I'm eighty years old! Everything triggers it! Stress, mostly. Thinking about money, which is always a problem. Trying to remember names... that's bad. And… strong coffee. I used to drink a lot of it, back in the business. Kept me going. Now, even a little bit sets it off. Honestly, doc, it's just old age. That's what it is. And I don’t need a bunch of tests to tell me that. My wife kept wanting tests… It never helps. Just costs money.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism about tests, Mr. Baide, and I certainly respect your wishes. However, even though it may feel like old age, it’s important to rule out other possible causes for the shaking so we can ensure you receive the best possible care. We can proceed cautiously, of course. You mentioned stress, thinking about finances, and strong coffee seem to worsen it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I get tired, obviously. Eighty years old, remember? My knees ache. I forget things… like I was saying, names. And… sometimes I feel a little… off balance. Not falling or anything, just… wobbly. It’s hard to explain. And my handwriting… it’s gotten terrible. You wouldn't believe it. It looks like a doctor wrote it now, all scribbled. Is that what you mean by symptoms? Honestly, doc, I’m a mess. A tired, forgetful mess. Let's just say it's old age and be done with it. I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of that with me, Mr. Baide. Fatigue, achy knees, forgetfulness, and a feeling of being off-balance, along with the changes in your handwriting... those are all important pieces of information. Now, just to clarify, have you noticed any stiffness in your muscles, or any slowing down of your movements in general, besides the shaking?
PATIENT: Stiffness? No, not really. My knees ache, but that’s just arthritis, I think. Always had it. Slowing down? Well, yeah, I’m slower than I used to be. Obviously. I don’t run marathons anymore, doc. Used to be able to move pretty fast when I was yelling at actors though. Now… not so much. Everything takes a little longer. But it’s not like I’m frozen or anything. I can still get around. I just wish this shaking would stop. And if this is going to take much longer, I’m going to have to reschedule my lunch. It's with… well, never mind. Important people. Can we hurry this up?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Mr. Baide. I will do my best to be efficient. No stiffness, no slowing of movements aside from what you'd expect with age… Alright, Mr. Baide, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you're agreeable. I'll check your reflexes, coordination, and look for any other signs that might help us understand what's going on. It won't be anything invasive, I promise. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick, doc. And don’t poke too much. I hate being poked. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. I have things to do, people to see… important people. Just… get on with it. But gently, alright? Very gently. And don't ask me to do anything complicated. I'm eighty! I can barely hold a glass, let alone… whatever you're thinking of making me do. Just a quick look, alright? That's all. A quick look.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. A quick and gentle examination is exactly what we’ll do. First, I'd like you to just sit comfortably in the chair. I’m going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There. Happy? Can we get this over with? It's not like you're going to find anything. I’m telling you, it's just old age. And don’t stare at my hands, it makes it worse. It really does. Now, what are you looking for, anyway? Are you going to tell me I need to eat more vegetables? Because I already know that. My wife used to tell me that all the time. Now she's… Never mind. Just hurry up, alright? I have a lunch appointment. A very important lunch appointment. And I'm starting to feel… wobbly. This chair isn't very comfortable either. It’s too low.
DOCTOR: I see. I'm just noting the tremor in your hands, Mr. Baide, and observing its characteristics. And no, I won't suggest more vegetables, I assure you. Now, could you please tap your thumb against each of your fingers, one at a time?
PATIENT: There. Done. Honestly, doc, this is ridiculous. You're just making me nervous. And the more nervous I get, the worse this gets. It’s a vicious cycle, you know? My wife used to say I get too worked up about things. She was right, of course. Always right. But what are you even looking for? I’m telling you, it’s just old age! And my lunch… I'm going to be late. Very late. This is going to ruin everything. Just… tell me if I need to go to a home or something. Is that what this is about? Because I'm not going to a home! I have… important things to do. People to see.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I assure you, we are not talking about going to a home. I'm simply gathering information to help understand what’s going on. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There. Done. Honestly, doc, this is… undignified. It feels like I'm at the circus. And my eyes are getting tired. Eighty years old, remember? Everything gets tired. And I keep thinking about… never mind. It's not important. But this is taking a long time. A very long time. I’m going to miss my lunch. And Mr. Henderson… well, you don't want to miss a lunch with Mr. Henderson. He’s a… important person. Is this going to involve any needles? Because I hate needles. I faint, you know. Absolutely faint. Just tell me straight, doc. Is there anything seriously wrong with me? Or can I just go home and take a nap?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxieties, Mr. Baide. No needles are planned at this time. Based on my brief examination, I’m noting a tremor in your hands, some mild slowness with movements, and some difficulty with coordination. Your reflexes appear normal, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or Parkinson’s disease?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s disease? Goodness, no. Never. I just… get tired easily. And my knees ache. Arthritis, like I said. And the doctor told me I had high blood pressure years ago. Took pills for it, I think. Can’t remember now. Lots of pills, lots of doctors… everything blurs after a while, you know? My wife used to handle all that. She was very organized. Now… well, I just try to take things one day at a time. And this shaking… it’s just getting worse. Honestly, doc, I think I’m falling apart. And I have a lunch appointment. A very important lunch appointment. Can we please just wrap this up? Tell me what I need to do, and let me go. I’m starting to feel… dizzy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a lot, and it’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed. Based on the information you’ve provided and my examination, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing the shaking. The symptoms you're describing could be due to a variety of factors, including essential tremor, which is a common condition that causes shaking, or it could be related to your high blood pressure or other underlying medical issues. Given your age and the potential for multiple contributing factors, I would like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any other possible causes. I would also recommend a neurological consultation with Dr. Ramirez. She is a specialist in movement disorders and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you be agreeable to those recommendations?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More tests? And another doctor? Oh, for goodness sake. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just tell me I'm old and leave me alone. I'm tired of doctors, tired of tests, tired of being poked and prodded. But… my wife… she always said to get a second opinion. She was very sensible. Fine. Fine! Do the tests. Send me to Dr. Ramirez. But just… make it quick, alright? And don’t expect me to be cheerful about it. I have… important things to do. A lunch appointment, remember? And if I miss it because of all this… well, you’ll be hearing from my lawyer. Honestly, this is a nightmare. A complete and utter nightmare. Can I at least get a glass of water? I’m parched. And shaky. Always shaky. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. I will get the lab orders and referral to Dr. Ramirez sent to the front desk right away. They will schedule the appointment for you, and the lab can draw the blood samples before you leave. Let me have the nurse bring you a glass of water while I finish this paperwork. And please, don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get through this together. .
