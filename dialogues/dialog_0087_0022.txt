DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Soodeen, you say? A pretty name. Well… my tummy. It feels… big. And I don’t want much to eat these days. Not like before. It’s just… not feeling right. I don't remember exactly when it started, though. Things get… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Big" and not feeling hungry… can you describe the "big" feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… like a balloon, maybe? Not painful, just… full. And hard. It’s always a little bit there now, you know? Not getting bigger fast, but not going away either. I used to be able to eat a good plate of potatoes, but now… just a few bites. And even those don’t always taste good. It's strange. I don’t know what’s happening. Do you… understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. A feeling of fullness, like a balloon, that doesn't go away, and a decreased appetite… alright. And you said this has been going on for some time now, though you don’t recall exactly when it began. Has there been any change in your bowel habits – more or less frequent, different consistency?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… bowel… what now? You mean… going to the bathroom? It's… regular, I think. Not different. Maybe a little… harder to go sometimes, but I always manage. Old age, you know? Things slow down. Is that what you're asking about? I'm sorry, dear, I don't always understand these fancy words.
DOCTOR: No, no apology needed at all, Ms. McConnon. It’s my job to explain things clearly. Yes, I was asking about your bowel movements - how often you go to the bathroom and the consistency of your stool. You said it’s regular, but a bit harder to pass sometimes, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Regular, but… harder. Like little pebbles, sometimes. Not always, though. Sometimes it’s okay. I drink a lot of tea, you see. Maybe that’s why? I used to be a sociologist, you know. We studied people. Not… insides. Just… people and their lives. Everything is so different now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. McConnon. And yes, tea can sometimes contribute to that. Now, have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, nausea… that’s when you feel… sick to your tummy? No, not really. I haven't been sick. And weight loss… well, I’ve always been small. Maybe I’m a little smaller, but I haven't been trying to lose weight! I just… don't feel hungry. Is that bad? I'm sorry, dear, I'm rambling again, aren't I? It's just… everything is a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Ms. McConnon. It’s helpful for me to understand everything. No nausea or vomiting, and you haven’t noticed significant weight loss… alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… medical history. That’s… a long time ago. I don’t remember much. I used to be very healthy, I think. I walked everywhere. But old age… it brings things. I think the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, a long time ago. He gave me some pills, but I don’t take them anymore. I didn’t like them. And… I had a little trouble with my heart, maybe? It would flutter sometimes. But that was years and years ago. I really don’t remember much, dear. I didn’t keep very good records. Everything is lost now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to have difficulty recalling details from a long time ago. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think… when I was very young, I had my tonsils out. That's all I remember. And… maybe I was in the hospital once for a bad cold, when I was a little girl. But it was a long, long time ago. I don’t remember much about it. I mostly remember my mother being very worried. It's all so blurry now. I'm not very good at remembering these things, dear. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. You’ve told me everything I need to know for now. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother… she lived a long life, but I think she had trouble with her heart at the end. And my father… he was a strong man, but he died young, from… I don’t remember exactly. Something with his lungs, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to my family. We didn’t talk about these things much. I'm sorry, dear. I wish I could tell you more, but my memory… it's just not what it used to be. Everything feels so distant now.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. McConnon. You’ve given me some helpful information. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. Except… I don’t like beets. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just a dislike. And I haven’t taken many medications in my life. I prefer to stay healthy naturally, you see. I drink a lot of tea, and I try to get plenty of rest. But no allergies, dear. Not that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just my tea, dear. I drink chamomile mostly, for a good sleep. And sometimes I take a little bit of honey in it, if I have a sore throat. But no pills, no vitamins, no… anything else. I'm a simple woman, you see. I prefer the natural way. Just tea and rest. That's all I need. Well, and maybe a little bit of chocolate sometimes. But that’s not a medication, is it?
DOCTOR: No, chocolate definitely doesn’t count as medication, Ms. McConnon. Alright, that’s all the questions I have for now. I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s fine. A physical exam… Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just be gentle, my old bones are a little… fragile. And don’t mind if I ask questions. I like to know what’s going on. Just be patient with me, you see? My mind wanders sometimes. But yes, go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. McConnon. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds a little bit muffled, and your breathing is slightly diminished on the lower right side. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your abdomen is firm, as you described, and I do feel some slight resistance in the lower right quadrant. It's not acutely painful, but it's definitely something to note. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Okay, dear. It's a little cold, isn't it? My old bones always feel the cold. And you say my heart sounds muffled? Is that bad? And my breathing… diminished? Oh dear. That does feel a little… strange. Not painful, just… firm. Like a rock, almost. And you say resistance? Oh dear, oh dear. What does that mean? Is it serious? I'm starting to get a little worried now. Please tell me everything is alright, dear. My mind is racing.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. McConnon. Try not to worry. “Muffled” and “diminished” are just medical terms. It means the sounds aren’t as clear as I’d like, but that doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. It could be due to a number of things. And the firmness in your abdomen, along with the slight resistance, is something we need to investigate further. Based on what I’m hearing and feeling, I’d like to order a few tests. We’ll need a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and other organs. That will help us understand what’s going on. It’s possible this is just a temporary issue, but it’s important to rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests… Tests sound… frightening. Blood tests… I don’t like needles. And an ultrasound? What does that involve? Is it painful? I'm starting to feel very anxious now, dear. You say it could be temporary? That’s… good. But you say we need to rule out anything serious? Oh dear, oh dear. What if it is serious? I… I think I understand, but I’m a little confused. All these tests… and what if something is wrong? Will it be painful? Will I need to be in the hospital? Please… just tell me everything is going to be alright. I'm a simple woman, dear, and all this medical talk is very overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to feel anxious, Ms. McConnon. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed in situations like this. Let’s take things one step at a time. The blood test will just involve a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. It’s a quick procedure, and the discomfort is minimal. As for the ultrasound, it’s completely painless. It uses sound waves to create an image of your organs on a screen. It’s like… seeing a picture of the inside of your body, without any needles or discomfort. We’re not assuming anything is wrong, Ms. McConnon. These tests are simply to gather more information, so we can understand what’s going on and create a plan to help you feel better. It’s possible this is just a minor issue, and we’ll address it accordingly. We'll discuss all the results with you in detail, and we’ll make sure you understand everything. And if any further treatment is needed, we’ll discuss all your options and create a plan that’s right for you. We’ll do everything we can to make sure you’re comfortable and informed every step of the way. Regarding the possibility of hospitalization, that’s unlikely at this stage. We’ll start with these tests and see what they reveal. If any further intervention is necessary, we'll discuss it with you in detail. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I’ll have my nurse draw your blood, and then we’ll schedule an appointment for the ultrasound. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, dear… Blood test… and then an ultrasound… That sounds… manageable. As long as there are no needles involved in the ultrasound. And you promise you’ll explain everything clearly? I don’t want any surprises. And you really think it’s unlikely I’ll need to be in the hospital? That’s… a relief. I don’t like hospitals. They’re cold and scary places. Okay… let’s do the tests. But please… be patient with me, dear. My mind wanders sometimes, and I forget things easily. And I get anxious easily, so please… just be gentle. And explain everything clearly. Thank you, dear. You’re very kind. I’m grateful for your patience. Let’s get these tests done. But please… be gentle. And explain everything clearly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McConnon. I understand completely. We’ll take things at your pace, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. There are no needles involved in the ultrasound, I promise. It’s a completely painless procedure. And I’ll be here every step of the way to answer any questions you have and address any concerns. We’ll make sure you feel comfortable and informed throughout the entire process. I’ll have my nurse come in and draw your blood right away. It will only take a few minutes. Then, we’ll schedule an appointment for the ultrasound. It’s usually done on an outpatient basis, so you can go home afterward. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever – please don’t hesitate to call the office right away. Now, let’s get started. My nurse will be in shortly. And remember, I’m here for you. We’ll take things one step at a time. And we’ll get through this together.
PATIENT: .
