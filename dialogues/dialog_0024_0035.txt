DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please, tell me. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s these hiccups, you see. They just won’t stop. Been going on for… goodness, I’d say nearly three days now. It’s quite annoying, really. Not painful, just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Three days of hiccups, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Started right after I had a lovely bit of fish with my daughter, Leilani. Though, it wasn’t bad fish, you understand. Fresh from the market, always is. It just… started. And hasn't stopped since! It's a bit embarrassing, really, when I’m trying to chat with people.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And you state this occurred immediately following a meal of fish?
PATIENT: Yes, right after. We were sitting on the veranda, enjoying the breeze, and I was telling Leilani about… oh, what was I telling her? Something about my garden, I think. Anyway, mid-sentence – hic – started the hiccups. And they’ve been with me ever since. Not constant, mind you. They come and go, but they keep coming back. It’s like they have a life of their own!
DOCTOR: I see. And have you attempted any… home remedies, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes. Leilani suggested holding my breath, of course. And drinking water upside down – quite a feat, let me tell you! A spoonful of sugar, too. I even had a friend tell me to get someone to scare me, but that just made Leilani laugh. Nothing seems to work for very long, you see. It's a bit frustrating.
DOCTOR: So, you’ve tried breath-holding, the water trick, sugar, and… a scare attempt. All without significant relief. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the hiccups themselves. No heartburn, no nausea, no… well, nothing else. I’ve been eating normally, sleeping alright. I'm not feeling unwell otherwise, just… irritated by them. It's just a little unsettling to have something keep happening to your body that you can't control, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… just a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. But I haven't taken any ibuprofen in… oh, it must be a week or so now. Nothing else regularly, no. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can, you see.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat most things, though I’m not terribly fond of eggplant. But that’s just a preference, not an allergy, you understand. Never had any trouble with medications either. My doctor’s always been careful about asking, of course.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, Ms. Sucich. Primarily, I will listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. This will help me rule out any obvious underlying causes for these persistent hiccups. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment completely. I’m used to check-ups, you see, and it’s always best to be thorough. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back on the examination table. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No masses palpated. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all four quadrants. No significant findings on examination, Ms. Sucich.
PATIENT: Well, that's good to hear, isn't it? Though, it's still a mystery, these hiccups! I must admit, I'm a little puzzled myself why they haven't gone away. Is there anything else you'd like to check, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Sucich, I believe that is sufficient for the time being. Frankly, persistent hiccups are often idiopathic – meaning, without a discernible cause. It's likely a temporary annoyance. I would recommend you continue to stay hydrated and avoid any overly stimulating foods or beverages. If they persist beyond another week, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or abdominal pain – then you should contact my office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Idiopathic, you say? That's a big word! So, it just… happens? Well, that’s frustrating, isn't it? Alright, stay hydrated, no stimulants… I can manage that. And if anything else starts bothering me, I’ll give you a call right away. Yes, I understand perfectly. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you checking me over, even if you can’t find a reason for it. Perhaps they’ll just go away on their own. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sucich. That is often the case. Well, have a good day. .
