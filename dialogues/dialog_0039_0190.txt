DOCTOR: Hello Lilyanna, welcome! It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing a bit of unsteadiness, you see. A sort of… imbalance. It's been troubling me. Honestly, it’s difficult to explain precisely when it started, or what makes it worse. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteadiness… imbalance. And you said it’s difficult to pinpoint when it started or what makes it worse?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. It feels… random. Sometimes I’m walking and I just… feel off-balance. Other times, it’s when I’m standing still. It’s not constant, thankfully, but it’s worrying. I… I’m afraid I don’t recall anything specific that triggered it, or if anything does make it worse. My memory… isn’t what it used to be, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we’ll take it slowly. Random, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Quite random, Doctor. It's… frustrating, to be honest. It makes me hesitant to do things, you see. My work… it requires a steady hand and good balance. It’s a bit worrisome. I operate a rotary drill, and… well, precision is important.
DOCTOR: I understand. A steady hand is crucial for your work. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Let me think. No… not that I recall. No dizziness, no ringing in my ears. No headaches, thankfully. Just… the feeling of being off-balance. Sometimes… perhaps a little bit of fatigue, but I attribute that to the work itself. It is demanding, you see. It’s difficult to say what is related, and what isn't.
DOCTOR: Okay. No dizziness, ringing, or headaches. Just the unsteadiness and some fatigue. Have you experienced any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… that is a good question. I… I haven't noticed anything specifically. Perhaps a little bit of blurriness sometimes, but I wear glasses, you see. I assumed it was simply a matter of needing a new prescription. I haven't had my eyes checked recently, I admit. It’s been… a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any falls, or near falls, because of this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Thankfully, no falls. But… yes, a few near falls. I’ve managed to steady myself each time, but it’s been… frightening. I gripped onto things, you see. A counter, a railing… I’ve been very careful. That's why I decided to come in, to be honest. I don’t want to risk a serious injury. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. No falls, but near falls. That’s good you’re being cautious. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: That is… a complicated question, Doctor. I… lost my husband a few years ago, and… things were a bit chaotic after that, you see. I haven’t been as diligent about keeping track of everything as I should be. I believe I had high blood pressure at one point, but I was taking medication for it. I… I'm not entirely sure if I still am. It's all rather… hazy. And I had a surgery, years ago, on my knee, but it wasn't anything major. I… truly wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, medication for it, but unsure if still taking it. And surgery on your knee, years ago. We can look into both of those. Do you happen to know what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is a difficult one. I… I truly don't recall the name of the medication, Doctor. It was a small, white pill, I believe. And it was… years ago now. My husband handled most of the medical details, you see. After he passed… things became quite disorganised. I apologise for my lack of precision. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lilyanna. We can often figure things out. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, or food, or anything else, thankfully. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. Perhaps a little bit of hay fever in the spring, but nothing serious. Nothing that would require an epinephrine pen, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That is… a complicated question, Doctor. My family… we are from Ethiopia, you see. And medical records weren’t always… readily available, or kept with the same diligence as they are here. I know my mother had… some sort of heart condition, I believe. But I don't recall the specifics. And my father… he passed away at a relatively young age, but I don’t know the cause. It’s… rather vague, I’m afraid. I wish I could be more helpful, but my memory… it's just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lilyanna. We can work with what you know. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Certainly not. I do not smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine on a special occasion, but that’s it. And I have never used any recreational drugs. I’ve always led a very… respectable life, you see. It’s never been something I’ve been interested in.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Well… yes, actually. I am… a bit concerned about my work, you see. As I mentioned, I operate a rotary drill, and it requires a steady hand and good balance. Is it possible this unsteadiness is something serious? Will I be able to continue working? That is my biggest concern, Doctor. It's… how I provide for myself. And… could it be related to my husband passing? I know it sounds silly, but sometimes I wonder if it’s… stress, or something like that.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Lilyanna. It’s not silly at all to wonder if stress could be a factor. Grief and stress can absolutely manifest physically. As for whether it's something serious, it’s too early to say definitively. That’s what the exam and possibly some tests will help us determine. We need to rule out a few things, like inner ear problems, neurological issues, or even medication side effects. Let's start with a physical exam, and then we'll discuss potential next steps. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. I understand. I… I trust your judgement. Please, proceed with the exam. I just… I want to get to the bottom of this, and be able to continue working, if possible. It's… very important to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just follow me over to the examination table. We'll start with your ears, then I’ll check your balance and coordination, and do a basic neurological exam. It won’t take long. I'll explain everything as we go.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. Please, proceed at your own pace. I shall do my best to assist you in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lilyanna. Let's start by taking a look at your ears. I'm just going to use this light and an instrument called an otoscope. It won't be uncomfortable, I promise. Okay... your ear canals look clear. The eardrums appear normal as well. No signs of infection or fluid buildup. Good. Now, let’s check your balance. Could you stand with your feet together, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Oh… I do feel a bit unsteady, even now. I… apologize. It's difficult to remain still, even with my eyes closed.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilyanna. It’s good you let me know. That’s helpful information. I’m just observing. Now, let’s try this. Could you walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I… I’m afraid that wasn’t very graceful, Doctor. It’s quite difficult to maintain a straight line. I seem to be… drifting to the left. I apologize for the trouble. Perhaps my balance isn’t as good as I thought.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilyanna. Don't apologize. It’s perfectly fine. These tests are just helping me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you please sit comfortably, and I’ll tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, proceed. I shall do my best to remain still. I… just hope it doesn't hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay… your reflexes are normal on both sides. Good. Now, let’s do a quick check of your coordination. Could you touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: Oh… I… I seem to be a bit clumsy today, Doctor. It’s difficult to coordinate my movements. I apologize for the inconvenience. Perhaps I’m just… nervous.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry about it at all, Lilyanna. It's perfectly alright. These tests can be a bit challenging even when someone isn't nervous. Okay, that’s enough for the physical exam for now. Based on what I've observed, your ears look clear, your reflexes are normal, but there's some difficulty with balance and coordination. I'm going to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and I’d like to schedule you for a more comprehensive balance assessment with a specialist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. Blood tests and a specialist assessment… I understand. If that’s what’s necessary to determine the cause of this unsteadiness, then I am willing to proceed. I trust your judgement. When would these tests and assessment be scheduled? And… will I be able to continue working while I wait for the results? That is my biggest concern, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ll write you a lab requisition for the blood tests. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. It should take a few days to get the results back. As for the balance assessment, I’ll have my assistant schedule that for you. They'll likely get you in within a week or two. Regarding work… Given your occupation requires good balance and coordination, I’m going to recommend that you avoid operating the rotary drill until we have a clearer understanding of what’s going on. It's just to ensure your safety and prevent any potential injuries. I know that’s not ideal, but it’s better to be cautious. I can also write you a note for your employer explaining that you’re undergoing medical evaluation. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Oh dear… avoiding work… that is… concerning. It’s how I provide for myself, you see. But I understand your reasoning, Doctor. Safety is paramount. If it's truly necessary to avoid operating the drill, then I suppose I must. A note for my employer would be… very helpful, yes. It would explain the situation and hopefully prevent any misunderstandings. I appreciate your thoughtfulness. Thank you. Do you have any idea… what might be causing this unsteadiness? Is it something serious? I understand you need more information, but any initial thoughts would be reassuring.
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say definitively without the results of the blood tests and the balance assessment. However, some possible causes of unsteadiness include inner ear problems, neurological conditions, vitamin deficiencies, or even medication side effects. We need to rule those out first. Given your history of high blood pressure, it’s also possible that it’s related to that, although your reflexes are normal which makes that less likely. I want to reassure you that it's unlikely to be anything catastrophic. But it’s important to get it checked out properly to determine the exact cause and get you the appropriate treatment. We’re going to take it one step at a time. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That makes sense. One step at a time… I understand. Blood tests, specialist assessment… I shall do my best to cooperate and follow your instructions. Thank you for your time and your patience, Doctor. I appreciate your thoughtfulness and your willingness to help. I shall await my assistant’s call regarding the scheduling. Is there anything else I should do, or any questions I should be asking?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help. For now, just try to rest and avoid any activities that might worsen your unsteadiness. If you experience any new symptoms, such as headaches, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, please call the office immediately. I’ll also have my assistant send you information about preparing for the balance assessment. Otherwise, just await the call from my assistant, and we’ll get everything scheduled. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have answered all of my questions. Thank you again for your time and your patience. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kindness. I shall await my assistant's call. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
