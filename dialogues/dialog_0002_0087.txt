DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Croonquist, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. The usual. Honestly, I can’t really remember why exactly. Something about checking things… you know. Medicare sent me a notice. That’s all I really know. Can we just get it done? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. Sometimes those notices don't give a lot of detail. We can definitely get some lab work done. It sounds like it's likely a routine check-up recommended by Medicare. Let me just take a look at your record here… Ah, yes. It looks like you're due for your annual wellness visit, including a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, and a lipid panel. Is that what you were thinking of?
PATIENT: Lipid… what now? Look, I just want the blood taken. I don’t need a… a description of everything. Is that what those things are for? Just tell me if I need to fast beforehand or something. Honestly, these appointments… they just get longer and longer every year.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask! The lipid panel checks your cholesterol levels – that’s the “lipid” part. It helps us assess your risk for heart disease. The Complete Blood Count looks at your red and white blood cells, and the Metabolic Panel checks things like your kidney and liver function, and your blood sugar. And yes, fasting is required for this specific set of labs. Ideally, nothing to eat or drink – except water – for about 8-12 hours beforehand. It's best to schedule it first thing in the morning, if possible. Does that work for you, or would you prefer a different time?
PATIENT: Eight to twelve hours? Goodness. Well… morning is probably best. I… I guess I can skip breakfast. Is there anywhere I can sit and wait? And… how long will it take? I really do have… appointments. Lots of them.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We have a comfortable waiting area right down the hall. The phlebotomist usually only needs about 15-20 minutes to draw the blood, and then the results usually take about a week to come back. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available. While we wait for the lab results, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, no, that's it. Just the blood work. Really. The less fuss the better, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so trying to remember everything you say is… difficult. Just call with the results. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. We'll keep it simple. Just the blood work, and we'll call you with the results when they’re back. I'll also make a note to keep the explanation of the results concise when we do call. The phlebotomist is just down the hall, first door on the left. They're expecting you. Let me know if you have any trouble finding them. It was nice meeting you.
PATIENT: Right. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. First door on the left… I think I can manage that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist?
PATIENT: Yes? Is something… wrong? I thought you said… first door on the left.
DOCTOR: You’re exactly right, you did! I just wanted to offer to walk you down the hallway if you'd prefer. It can be a bit of a walk, and I noticed you were moving a little slowly. No pressure at all, of course, but I’m happy to accompany you if it would be easier.
PATIENT: Oh. Well… that would be… kind. Yes, actually. That would be easier. My knees aren't what they used to be, you know. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. No problem at all. It’s my job to make sure you’re comfortable. Here we are. This is the phlebotomy room. They'll take excellent care of you. Is there anything else I can do for you before I leave you with them?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just… try not to take too much blood, okay? I always feel faint. And… tell them I don’t like needles. Just… tell them.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. I'll let them know right away – both about the faintness and the needles. They're very good at making patients feel comfortable, and they’ll take extra care with you. They’ll also have you sit for a bit afterwards to make sure you’re feeling okay. Hi Sarah, this is Mr. Croonquist. He's here for his annual wellness labs. He’s a little nervous about needles and sometimes feels faint, so if you could be extra gentle with him, that would be wonderful. They’ll take good care of you. I’ll leave you in their capable hands now. I’ll see you when we get the results back. Just let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Right. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… helpful. I suppose they'll tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Croonquist. Have a good day. .
