DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be honest. It’s about… a problem. A personal problem. It's… discharge. From… down there. I really don’t like talking about these things, but it’s been going on for a little while now and I thought I should get it checked. It's not very dignified, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jinnie. These things are often difficult to talk about, and you’ve done the right thing by coming in. It takes courage to address these concerns, and you’re in a safe place here. There’s absolutely no need to feel embarrassed. We see this quite often. Could you tell me a little more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Well… it's not… pleasant. It’s… yellowish, mostly. And there’s a bit of an odor. Not horrible, but… noticeable. It’s been happening, oh, I’d say for about two weeks now, maybe a little longer. I haven’t been… with anyone, if you know what I mean. So it’s not… that sort of thing. Honestly, I thought it might just go away on its own, but it hasn't. It seems to be getting… more frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discharge with an odor, for about two to three weeks, and increasing in frequency. And you haven't had any recent sexual activity. That's helpful information. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no chills. I haven’t felt any pain, exactly. But… there is a bit of… irritation. Down there. Just a sort of… burning sensation, especially after I… use the restroom. And sometimes it feels a little… itchy. Not constantly, but off and on. It's not terribly uncomfortable, mind you, but I've noticed it. And, to be perfectly frank, it's quite distracting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever or chills, some irritation, a burning sensation after using the restroom, and occasional itching. That gives me a clearer picture. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – like more frequent trips, or difficulty going?
PATIENT: Yes, actually, now that you mention it. I have been going to the restroom more often. Not a huge amount more, but enough to notice. And… sometimes it feels like I don’t quite empty my bladder completely. It's a strange sensation. I just thought I was drinking too much water, to be honest. But perhaps it’s related to… this. It's just all very bothersome, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It very well could be related, Jinnie. Frequent urination and the sensation of incomplete emptying are certainly things we need to investigate. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, for example?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, not that I know of. The doctor always says my blood sugar is fine when I get my yearly checkup. I have a bit of high blood pressure, but I take medication for that. And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. But other than that, I'm fairly healthy, for my age. I try to eat a sensible diet and get a bit of exercise, although the heat has been making that difficult lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal ten years ago. No diabetes. And you generally try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. That's good to know. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the one for my blood pressure, Lisinopril. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not very often. Usually just when my arthritis is acting up. And I take a multivitamin, but that’s about it. Nothing else. I don’t believe in taking a lot of pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for blood pressure, occasional ibuprofen for arthritis, and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication. I’m fairly careful about what I take. My mother always said, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!” And I tend to agree. I’m not one for unnecessary things, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a sensible approach. Now, Jinnie, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. It will involve an external examination and I may need to collect a small sample of the discharge to send to the lab for testing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I… suppose so. I wasn’t expecting that. Is it… terribly uncomfortable? I really don't like being… poked and prodded, if you know what I mean. I understand it’s necessary, of course, but…
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension completely, Jinnie. It won’t be terribly uncomfortable, I assure you. I’ll be as gentle as possible. It’s a fairly quick and standard procedure, and it will help us determine the cause of the discharge and get you the right treatment. We'll just take things one step at a time, and if you feel any discomfort at all, please let me know immediately. Would you like me to explain the process in a bit more detail before we begin?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… reassuring. I just don’t like surprises, you see. What exactly will you be… doing? And what are you looking for, exactly? I suppose I should know these things.
DOCTOR: Certainly. First, I'll just have you lie on the examination table. I'll visually inspect the external area for any signs of irritation, redness, or swelling. Then, using a speculum – a small instrument that gently opens the vaginal canal – I’ll take a sample of the discharge. It's a bit like a Pap smear, you may have had one before. This sample will be sent to the lab to look for any bacteria, yeast, or other infections. We’ll be looking for anything that could be causing the discharge - like a yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, or a sexually transmitted infection. The entire process should only take a few minutes. And again, please don’t hesitate to tell me if you feel any discomfort at any point. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A speculum… Oh dear. I haven’t had one of those in… a very long time. It doesn’t sound very pleasant, to be frank. And you said something about sexually transmitted infections? I haven’t… well, let’s just say it’s been a long time since I’ve been… active. Are you suggesting…?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jinnie. It's standard procedure to rule out all possibilities. It doesn’t mean I’m suggesting anything at all. We simply need to consider all potential causes, and sexually transmitted infections are part of that. And to be clear, it’s possible to contract some infections even without recent sexual activity, though it’s less common. The speculum can feel a little uncomfortable, I won't lie, but we can use lubrication to make it easier. I will proceed slowly and gently, and you’re in complete control. You can ask me to stop at any time. Before we proceed, would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. It’s just… unsettling, you know? Having to think about all those things. But I understand what you’re saying. Best to rule everything out. Alright. Let’s just… get it over with then. Slowly, you said? And… tell me if it will hurt?
DOCTOR: Yes, slowly. And I will absolutely tell you if anything will hurt. You might feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. If you do feel any pain, please let me know immediately. We can stop at any time. Alright, Jinnie, if you could just lie down on the examination table, we'll get started. I'll explain each step as we go.
PATIENT: Alright. Here goes nothing. Just… try to be quick, please. And gentle, like you said. This is… not my favorite thing, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jinnie. We’ll take things as slowly as you need. I'm going to start by just visually inspecting the external area. I’ll let you know what I see. I see a little redness, but nothing too concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to apply a little lubricant to the speculum. This will make it more comfortable. Then, I'll gently insert it into the vaginal canal.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… hurry, please. It feels… cold. And… strange. Is it always this cold? I don't remember it being this cold.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Jinnie. You're right, it is a little cold. We can warm it up a bit more if you’d like. I’m just going to gently open the speculum now. I know it’s not comfortable, and I’m going as slowly as possible. Just breathe deeply and try to relax your muscles. I’m almost there... Just need to get a small sample now.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… not pleasant. It feels… wide. And… scratchy. Can you feel that? It’s… rubbing against something. Please, just be quick. I really don’t like this. I’m tensing up… I can’t help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jinnie, I hear you. It sounds like you're very uncomfortable, and I apologize. I'm going to stop for a moment. It seems like your muscles are very tense, and that's making things more difficult. That’s completely understandable. We can absolutely stop here and reschedule for another day when you might feel more relaxed. Or, if you want to proceed, we can try using a smaller size speculum. It might be more comfortable. What would you prefer, Jinnie?
PATIENT: Oh… thank goodness. Smaller… yes. A smaller one, please. This one… it feels awful. I just… I can't. It's too much. Please, just… a smaller one. And be even gentler, if you can. I'm really trying, but it's… it's very difficult.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jinnie. A smaller size is perfectly fine. I apologize for the discomfort. Let me get that for you. I’ll be even more gentle this time, and we'll take our time. I want to make sure you are as comfortable as possible. Just breathe deeply and try to relax. We'll get through this. I'm going to insert this smaller speculum now. It shouldn't be as wide. I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… hurry, please. And tell me when you’re finished. I just want this to be over with. This whole thing is… mortifying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jinnie, just inserting it now. You're doing great. It does feel a little better, doesn't it?
PATIENT: A little. It's still… not pleasant. It's cold. And… I feel like I need to… push. Is that normal? I don’t want to… push.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jinnie, stop. Don't push. You shouldn't feel like you need to push. That's not normal. It sounds like your muscles are still very tense, and that's making things difficult. I'm so sorry. It's clear you're very uncomfortable, and I don't want to cause you any more distress. I think it's best if we stop here. We can reschedule for another day when you might be more relaxed, or we can explore other options for getting a diagnosis, like a urine test. What would you prefer, Jinnie?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. No. No more. Just… stop. A urine test… yes. That sounds… much better. No more poking and prodding, please. I just want to go home. This whole thing has been… awful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jinnie. No more poking and prodding. A urine test sounds perfectly reasonable. We can get that done right here in the clinic. It will help us rule out some of the potential causes of your symptoms. I’m very sorry this was such a difficult experience for you. We’ll get through this, and we’ll find out what’s causing your symptoms. Can you tell me if you've recently had anything to drink, or are taking any diuretics?
PATIENT: Just a little water this morning, Doctor. And… no. No diuretics. Just my blood pressure medication, like we discussed. I just… I need to go home now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jinnie. Just a little water this morning. That’s good to know. Let's get you a sample cup and you can go ahead and provide a urine sample when you're ready. It shouldn't take long, and then we can get you all set to go home. The bathroom is just down the hall, and there’s a private stall. Take your time. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Thank you…
DOCTOR: .
