DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. Noordin. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seein' me. It's… well, it's my stomach, mostly. I get full awful quick now. Just a little bit of food and I feel like I ate a whole feast. It's been goin' on for a few months, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay. A few months, you say. And it's just the feeling of fullness, or are you experiencing any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Just the fullness, really. Not much else. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I figure that's just gettin' old. I ain’t had no pain, no… well, nothin' else noticeable. It just kinda stops me from enjoyin' my food, which is a shame, you know? My wife makes a mean salmon chowder.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s good you can still enjoy some food, but frustrating when it’s limited. So, no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or any weight loss?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. Weight… well, I haven’t been weighin’ myself lately. My wife used to, but the scale broke last winter and she hasn’t gotten around to replacin’ it. I’d say I'm about the same as always, maybe a little lighter, but hard to say for sure. I definitely ain't been sick to my stomach or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your appetite before you get full?
PATIENT: Well, I am hungry when I start. Normal hungry, like you’d expect. It’s just… it doesn't take much to fill me up. A small bowl of soup, a few bites of fish… that’s usually all it takes. It's just odd. I used to be able to put away a good plate, you know? Especially if my wife made it.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes... well, everything seems pretty regular, if you know what I mean. Same as always, really. Not constipated, not… the other thing. It ain't been botherin' me, if that makes sense. I guess I just thought this fullness was the main thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I can swallow just fine. Never had trouble with that. Food goes down easy enough. It’s not like it's stuck or anything. It just feels… like my stomach is tellin' me “enough” way too soon. It's a strange feelin', really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not much, really. I had a bit of a cough when I was younger, but that cleared up years ago. High blood pressure, the doctor told me once, but he put me on some pills for it and it's been okay ever since. I take those every day, religiously. Other than that, nothin’ major. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, I suppose. My wife keeps me movin’, so that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication. That’s good. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had nothin’ cut open. Always been lucky that way, I reckon. Just a few stitches here and there when I was a young fella, climbin' trees and such. But no real surgeries, no. Always avoided 'em if I could. My grandma used to say it let the bad spirits in.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother lived to be a good age, 92, I think. She had a bit of arthritis, but otherwise was pretty healthy. My father… he passed away younger, maybe in his 70s. Heart trouble, I believe. And my brother… he had diabetes, but that's about it. Not much else sticks out in my mind, honestly. We weren't a family that talked a lot about medical things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Nope, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife hates 'em. And I don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with supper on a special occasion, but that's it. Mostly just water, and tea. Lots of tea. My wife makes a lovely blueberry tea, keeps me goin' all day. I try to stay active, too. We walk down to the beach most days, weather permitting. Keeps the joints movin', you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, other than the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills, like I said. Little white ones. Take 'em every mornin' with my tea. No vitamins, no supplements, nothin’ else. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. My wife is a good cook, so that helps. She grows a lot of her own stuff, too. Fresh is best, she always says.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Just the blood pressure medication. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Go right ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need. I ain't got nothin' to hide. My wife always told me to listen to the doctors, so here I am. Just let me know if it's gonna be cold! My old bones feel everything these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are a bit quiet, but regular. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice a little tenderness when I press here, in your upper stomach area. Not alarming, but something to keep in mind. No masses or distention.
PATIENT: Hmm, tenderness, eh? Never noticed that myself. I get a bit of heartburn sometimes, but I figured that was just the salmon chowder. Could be that? My wife makes a mean chowder, but it's a bit rich, I suppose. I eat it anyway. Is that somethin' to worry about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be related to the chowder, yes. But the tenderness warrants further investigation. Given your age and symptoms, it’s important to rule out anything more serious. I'm going to order some blood work to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and pancreatic enzymes. I'd also like to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your gallbladder, liver, pancreas, and other organs in your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and an… ultra-sound, you say? Sounds… thorough. Never had an ultra-sound before. But if you think it's best, Doctor, I trust your judgement. Just let me know what I need to do. And will those tests tell you what's causin' this fullness? Is it somethin' serious? I'm gettin' a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s good that we're being thorough. The blood work and ultrasound will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. They can help us rule out things like gallbladder issues, pancreatitis, or other problems that could be causing your early fullness and abdominal tenderness. It's difficult to say definitively whether it’s serious without the results, but given your age and symptoms, it's best to be cautious. I'll have the lab draw the blood now. For the ultrasound, the clinic will schedule you for an appointment. They’ll likely ask you to fast for several hours beforehand. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or the fasting requirements?
PATIENT: Fasting… several hours, you say? That’ll be tough. My wife makes breakfast awful early. But I can manage, I suppose. As long as I know what I'm lookin' for. What exactly are we lookin' for with this ultra-sound? Is it somethin' to do with my stomach? And the blood work… will that tell you if it’s my gallbladder, like you mentioned? Sorry to ask so many questions, Doctor. I just like to know what's goin' on.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Obarr. It’s important to be informed, and you have every right to ask questions. With the ultrasound, we're primarily looking at your gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. The gallbladder can sometimes develop stones that cause pain and early fullness. The liver and pancreas can also have issues that cause similar symptoms. We'll also get a good look at your stomach, although visualizing it clearly can be difficult sometimes. The blood work will help us assess your liver and pancreatic enzyme levels. Elevated levels can indicate inflammation or blockage in those organs. It won't definitively diagnose a gallbladder problem, but it can provide strong clues. Essentially, these tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine if further investigation is needed. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: That makes a bit more sense, yes. Gallbladder stones… never thought about that. And lookin' at my liver and pancreas, too. All right. Seems like a good plan. I reckon I can fast for a few hours, if it helps find out what's goin' on. So, the lab first then, for the blood work? And the clinic will call me to schedule the ultra-sound? Do I need to bring anything with me to the lab? A list of my medications, maybe?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. First, we'll get the blood work done. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will take care of everything. Then, the clinic will call you to schedule the ultrasound. And yes, it’s a good idea to bring a list of your medications, including the blood pressure medication, with you to both the lab and the ultrasound appointment. It's also helpful to have a list of any allergies you have. I'll write down the lab order for you, and also include a note for the clinic regarding your medication list. Do you have any other questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for explainin' it all so clearly. I feel a bit better knowin' what’s goin’ on, and what needs to be done. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old man like me. I’ll head down to the lab now, then. And I’ll make sure to bring my medication list. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It’s my job to listen, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns after the tests. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I'll see you after the tests.
