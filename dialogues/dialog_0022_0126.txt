DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It's a bit unusual, and frankly, rather bothersome. I eat a good meal and feel peckish an hour later. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Increased thirst and hunger for a few weeks… that’s definitely worth looking into. When you say “awfully thirsty”, about how much fluid are you drinking in a typical day, compared to what you usually drink?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Usually, I’d have… perhaps two or three pints of water throughout the day? Now… it’s more like… six, maybe seven. Easily. I’m constantly reaching for a glass, or a bottle. I keep a large jug on my desk at work, and I’m emptying it twice a day, where I normally wouldn't. It's a good bit more, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, six to seven pints is a significant increase. And you mentioned this is accompanied by increased hunger as well. Have you noticed any changes in your weight—either gaining or losing—during this time?
PATIENT: That’s… a fair question. I haven’t actively been weighing myself, Doctor. I suppose I haven’t noticed any drastic changes… but my trousers have felt a little tighter lately, if that makes any sense? It’s not a huge amount, but enough to… register. I wouldn't say I've gained a stone, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, noticing your trousers feeling tighter is a good observation. And that suggests some weight gain. Have you noticed any changes in how often you're urinating?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it… I’m going to the bathroom far more frequently. Especially at night. It’s… disruptive, to be frank. I usually sleep straight through, but I've been waking up two, maybe three times a night to use the facilities. It’s becoming quite a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright, increased thirst, increased hunger, potential weight gain, and increased urination, especially at night… These symptoms together raise a few possibilities. Before we go any further, do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Hmm… That's a bit worrying. Let me think… My mother’s side… my grandmother, I believe, had something similar. I was very young at the time, so I don’t recall the specifics. It was… a long time ago. She was always a bit frail, though. I suppose it’s possible. I don't believe anyone else on either side of the family suffered from anything similar, though. I honestly couldn't say for certain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes, even if uncertain, is good to know. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I had a check-up last year, a routine one with my GP, and he didn’t mention anything concerning. Blood pressure was normal, cholesterol was fine, everything was as it should be. I’m generally quite healthy, to be honest. I work a fairly physical job, shipping and receiving, so I’m on my feet most of the day. Though, this thirst and hunger is rather disruptive.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know you're generally healthy and had a normal check-up last year. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t really believe in taking pills unless absolutely necessary. I might take the odd paracetamol for a headache, but that's it. Nothing regular, and certainly nothing prescribed. I try to stay away from medication where possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll do a brief neurological exam and check your feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand it's necessary. Please, proceed as you see fit. I’m rather eager to get to the bottom of this, if I’m honest. The constant thirst is… quite irritating.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me… Excellent. Blood pressure is 130/80 – slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. Pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Sensation is intact. Feet appear normal, no signs of neuropathy or infection. Skin is warm and dry. I'm noting no obvious abnormalities.
PATIENT: Right. That all sounds… reassuring, I suppose. Though, I confess I don’t entirely understand what it means. Is that elevated blood pressure related to the thirst, perhaps? And what now, Doctor? Are we any closer to discovering the cause of all this? I have a delivery to oversee this afternoon, so I'm hoping for a swift resolution, if possible.
DOCTOR: The slightly elevated blood pressure isn’t necessarily directly related to the thirst, but it’s something we’ll want to monitor. At this point, with your symptoms – increased thirst, increased hunger, frequent urination, potential weight gain, and family history – the most likely possibility is diabetes, specifically Type 2. However, we need to confirm this with some blood tests. I'd like to order a fasting blood glucose test and a hemoglobin A1c test. The A1c gives us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests seem the logical next step. I’d rather know for certain one way or another. So, yes, please. Arrange the tests, and I’ll… cooperate fully. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to fast beforehand? I do have that delivery to oversee, as I mentioned… perhaps we can schedule it for a convenient time?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. We can schedule it for first thing tomorrow morning, that should allow you enough time to oversee your delivery this afternoon. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have the lab send the results directly to my office, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. In the meantime, try to limit sugary drinks and snacks. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all clear enough, Doctor. Limit sugary drinks and snacks, fast for tomorrow’s tests… I can manage that. It’s just… rather inconvenient timing, but needs must, I suppose. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll see you after the tests, then. Is there anything I need to bring with me for the follow-up?
DOCTOR: You're welcome. It's definitely not ideal timing, but getting a diagnosis is the priority. For the follow-up, just bring your insurance information and a list of any questions you might have. I’ll also have the lab results ready for us to review. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as blurred vision, increased fatigue, or unexplained weight loss—please contact the office immediately. I'll have my assistant schedule the blood tests for you now. Have a good afternoon, Christen, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before then.
PATIENT: Right. Insurance information, questions… and monitor for any new symptoms. Very well. Thank you again, Doctor. I believe that’s all I require for now.
