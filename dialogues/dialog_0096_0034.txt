DOCTOR: Alright, Emileigh, is it?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. That’s me. It is Emileigh. I just… moved here. Not from too far, but still. New doctor and everything.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, moving is… disruptive. Best to get things sorted quickly. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um… honestly? Not much, I think? Just… the healthcare lady said I should come. Said it was a good idea to, you know, get checked since I’m new to the area. I don’t really feel sick or anything. Does that make sense? I kinda forget why exactly they wanted me to come… something about being new?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, preventative care is… something. Though frankly, wasting my time on perfectly healthy young women… it’s not ideal. Still, we’ll do a basic check. You said you don't feel sick?
PATIENT: Yeah, no sickness. At least, not that I know of. I mean, sometimes my back hurts a little, from work, but that’s just… work. I build things. Lots of bending and lifting. It's usually okay after I rest. Nothing bad bad, you know? Is… is this a normal check-up then? Like, just to see if everything’s working? I’m not very good at remembering what the lady at the front desk said.
DOCTOR: “Working.” Right. And what is this work, exactly?
PATIENT: Um… I’m a… a mechanic helper? I guess that’s what they call it. I build stuff, fix stuff. Mostly… machines? Big, small, doesn’t matter. I work with metal a lot. I… I don’t remember the fancy names for everything, sorry. It's at the… the shop just outside of town. Big red building. You probably know it?
DOCTOR: Metal, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Lots of it. Welding, cutting… bolts and stuff. It's… physical. My husband helps too, he’s really good at the… the design part. I’m better at making things real, you know? Actually building it. I mostly do the… the putting-it-together stuff. Does that make sense? I'm not good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Right. Physical. Well, that explains… something. Let’s get some basics down. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I mean, I get itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just from the metal dust at work. Or maybe bugs? I get bug bites a lot in the summer. Nothing… serious. Like, no swelling or trouble breathing or anything. I just… scratch them. I don't have any bad allergies, I don’t think. Is there something I should be thinking of?
DOCTOR: “Metal dust.” Of course. And medications?
PATIENT: Medications… not really? Just… sometimes ibuprofen for my back. When it really hurts. Like, after a long day. Not every day, just when I need it. And… vitamins, sometimes. My husband thinks I should take more vitamins. But I forget. He buys them, and then they just sit there. Does that count? I don’t take anything regularly. I don't need anything, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been seriously ill?
PATIENT: Seriously ill…? Hmm… when I was little, I had… chickenpox, I think? And maybe the flu a couple of times? But nothing bad. Not in the hospital or anything. And… I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. But that was a long time ago. Mostly just scrapes and bruises, I think. I’m usually pretty healthy. Or I was… before moving, maybe? I don’t know. It's hard to remember everything. Does chickenpox count as seriously ill? I don’t really… think so.
DOCTOR: No, chickenpox does not count. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? No. Nope. Never had one. Not that I remember, anyway. I mean, they fixed my arm when I broke it, but that was just… a cast. They didn't cut me open or anything. I definitely haven't had surgery. My husband would remember if I did. He remembers everything. So, no. No surgeries. Unless… does getting stitches count? I got a bad cut on my leg once, but it was small. They just… glued it shut. Is that a surgery?
DOCTOR: No, glue is not surgery. Now, family history. Is there anyone in your family with… serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses…? Hmm… that’s a good question. My… my grandma had… something with her heart, I think? But she lived a long time. My grandpa… he had bad knees. But that was just old age, I think. And… my uncle, on my husband’s side, had… something with his lungs? But he smoked a lot. Everyone says that’s why. I don’t really… know much about it. They don't really talk about it. Is that helpful? I'm not very good at remembering family stuff. It's a big family. Does smoking count as an illness?
DOCTOR: No, smoking is a lifestyle choice, not an illness. Alright, let’s move on. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes? Not a lot. Just… at parties, maybe? Or with dinner sometimes. My husband likes wine. I usually have a little bit with him, but I don’t really… need it. Not like some people. It’s not a habit, I don't think. Just… social drinking. Does that make sense? I don't drink every day. Usually just on weekends, or special occasions. It's not a big deal. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: “Okay” is irrelevant. Do you use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No! Definitely not. Not me. And not my husband either! He always says it's bad for you. Never touched the stuff. No cigarettes, no cigars, no chewing tobacco… nothing. We both think it's a really bad habit. No, thank you. Never. Does that answer your question? We're both very healthy. Or we were. Before moving, maybe? This is getting confusing.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it seems you're determined to be perfectly healthy. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to confirm. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. A check-up is probably a good idea. Just to be sure. I hope it doesn't take too long? I have to get back to the shop later. My husband said he could really use my help with something.
DOCTOR: It won't. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, a look in your ears and throat, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. Please, take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breath… like this? My heart usually feels okay. Sometimes it beats a little fast when I’m working hard, but that’s just… from the lifting and stuff, right? Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, but not concerning. Lungs are clear. Throat is clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender… though there is some mild guarding. Do you experience any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little… sensitive. Not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Sometimes my stomach hurts a little after I eat. Especially if I eat too much. Or too fast. It’s just… indigestion, probably. I usually take something for it. But it goes away. It's not… serious. Is that what you're asking? It’s probably just the food. I eat a lot when I’m working hard. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Indigestion is a possibility. Your weight is also a bit above the average range for your height. Do you have any difficulty with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes? I mean, not every time. Sometimes it's a little… hard. But I just drink more water, and it usually goes away. It's not… a big deal. I eat a lot of… fiber. My husband makes me eat a lot of vegetables. But sometimes it's just… difficult. I don’t really… talk about it. Is that okay? I don't want to bother you with… that. Is it bad if it's hard sometimes? Does that mean something is wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s not ideal. Based on your current weight, slightly elevated heart rate, and occasional difficulty with bowel movements, I suspect some mild metabolic dysfunction, potentially related to your diet and activity level. We need to address this before it potentially develops into something more serious.
PATIENT: Metabolic… what? I'm sorry, I don't understand. Is that… bad? Does that mean I'm sick? I just thought I was a little… out of shape. Is that all? My husband keeps telling me I need to exercise more, but… work is so tiring. I just want to know… is it something I should be really worried about? Or can I just… eat less and try to get more sleep? I don't want to take a lot of medicine. Is that possible? Is there something wrong with my belly?
DOCTOR: It’s not a simple “something wrong with your belly.” It’s a complex interplay of factors. While it’s not an immediate emergency, ignoring it could lead to… complications. We need to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of your cholesterol, blood sugar, and thyroid function. Also, a stool sample to rule out any underlying issues. I’m going to write up a requisition for those tests. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more tailored plan. It may involve dietary changes, increased physical activity, and potentially medication. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.
PATIENT: Blood work…? A stool sample…? Oh… that sounds… awful. I don’t like needles. And… and talking about… that. Is it really necessary? Can’t I just… try to eat less? My husband is a really good cook. He could make me healthier meals. I just… I don't want to spend all my time at the doctor’s office. I have to get back to work. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can I just… start with the diet thing? Please? I just feel really… scared now. What if it’s something bad?
DOCTOR: Look, I understand your apprehension, but these tests are crucial to accurately assess your health. Ignoring potential issues won’t make them disappear; it will only make them worse. We’re not looking for anything specific right now, just establishing a baseline. Here are the forms for the blood work and stool sample. The lab is just down the hall. Once you’ve completed them, they'll send the results to my office. I strongly advise you to follow through with this. We can discuss the results and create a plan that works for you. For now, focus on reducing processed foods, increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables, and incorporating some moderate exercise into your routine. That’s a good start, but it’s not a substitute for proper testing. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Um… questions? I… I guess so. How long will it take to get the results? And what if… what if they find something bad? Will I have to… have surgery? Or take a lot of medicine? I just… I'm really scared. And what about work? I can't just… take off all the time. My husband helps, but he has his own things to do. This is all so much. I just wanted to make sure I was healthy. I didn't want… all this.
DOCTOR: Look, let’s not catastrophize. The results will typically take 3-5 business days. And again, we haven’t even found anything yet. If we do discover an issue, it may not require surgery or a drastic change in your lifestyle. Often, simple dietary modifications and increased physical activity can make a significant difference. I understand this is overwhelming, but I’m here to guide you through it. We’ll take it one step at a time. Let’s focus on getting these tests done first. Once we have the results, we can discuss a tailored plan that fits your lifestyle and work schedule. Do you want me to go over the instructions for the stool sample again?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Yes, please. I probably won’t remember if you don’t. And… and can you remind me how to get to the lab? I don’t want to get lost. Everything just… feels so confusing right now. I just… I need a minute. This is a lot to take in. And… thank you. For… for not yelling at me. I’m not very good at this. All the doctor stuff. I just wish my husband was here. He always knows what to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's take a moment. It's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. That's perfectly normal, especially when dealing with something new. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. It's clearly marked. They'll give you a container and instructions. Basically, you'll collect a small sample in the container and bring it back to the lab. They have a private room for this, so you don't have to worry about that. Here's a brochure with detailed instructions. It's all very straightforward. And don't worry. I'm here to help you through every step of the process. We’ll take things slowly. Do you have any immediate questions about the process?
PATIENT: Um… does it… does it hurt? To… you know? I'm really worried about it hurting. And… and what if I can’t…? What if I can’t… collect enough? Will they be mad at me? I just… I’m really embarrassed to ask this. I'm not good at… bodily functions. My husband always handles that stuff. I just don’t want to mess it up. Is there someone I can call if I need help? I just… I'm really scared now.
DOCTOR: Look, there is absolutely no reason to be embarrassed. It’s a perfectly normal bodily function, and it's something we deal with every day. It shouldn’t cause any pain, and it's unlikely that you'll have any difficulty collecting the sample. The instructions in the brochure are very clear, and the lab technicians are very understanding and helpful. If you have any questions or concerns, or if you're having difficulty, you can call the lab directly. They're happy to walk you through the process. I can assure you, no one will be mad at you. It’s not a competition. We’re just trying to gather information to help you. Take a deep breath, and focus on following the instructions. You’ll be fine. And if you need anything at all, don’t hesitate to call my office or the lab. We're here to help. Do you want me to write down the lab’s phone number for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… really helpful. I always forget numbers. And… and can you remind me what we’re looking for? In the tests? Is it… is it something bad? Or just… normal stuff? I just… I need to know. Even if it’s bad, I need to know. My husband is really good at handling stressful situations. I wish he was here. He always knows what to say. This is all so much. Can we just… get it over with? I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Here you go. The lab number is 555-123-4567. We are looking for basic markers of metabolic health – cholesterol levels, blood sugar, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. These tests will help us understand if there are any underlying imbalances. Most likely, it’s nothing serious. Many people have minor imbalances that can be easily addressed with dietary changes and exercise. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying issues. I understand you're anxious to go home, and I want to help you get there. The sooner you complete these tests, the sooner we can get a clearer picture of your health and create a plan to help you feel better. Just take a deep breath, go to the lab, and follow the instructions. Don't worry, you'll be fine. And once you have the results, call my office and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you… for being patient with me. I’m just… not very good at this. All the doctor stuff. And being sick. I just want to be normal. And I want my husband. I think… I think I’ll just go now. I don’t want to bother you anymore. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Emileigh?
PATIENT: Yes?
DOCTOR: Just… take your time. And don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. We’re here to help. And… try to relax. It’s just a few tests. You’ll be okay. .
PATIENT: .
