DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jaxston. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi, Doctor. Right, well... it's my head. Been getting these, like, really bad headaches. And I get all sweaty when they happen, and my heart races. It's… not fun, to be honest. I don't really remember when it started, exactly. Just that it's been happening on and off for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, sweating, and a racing heart. That doesn’t sound pleasant at all. “On and off for a while now” is a little vague – can you try to pinpoint when you first noticed these headaches?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, you're right, vague is… me, apparently. Let me think. It feels like… maybe last spring? Or was it summer? Honestly, time gets away from me. It definitely wasn't this year, I think. Before… before everything, you know? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at dates.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Jaxston. Dates aren't always easy to remember. So, sometime last spring or summer. And have they been getting worse, staying the same, or better since then?
PATIENT: Hmm… worse, I think. Or… more frequent, definitely. They used to be really far apart, like months between them. Now it feels like… every few weeks, maybe? Sometimes even closer than that. It’s hard to keep track, to be honest. They don’t all feel exactly the same either. Some are just a really bad pressure, and others… others feel like something’s pounding inside my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, increasing in frequency and varying in intensity – that's helpful. When you say "pounding," where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Usually all over, like, my whole head. But sometimes it's worse on the sides, you know? Like, near my temples. And it kinda… radiates? Does that make sense? It’s like it starts there and then spreads all over. I don't know if that helps or just makes it more confusing.
DOCTOR: It helps, actually. Radiating pain is good to know. And aside from the pain, sweating, and racing heart, are you experiencing any other symptoms with these headaches?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, like I might be sick to my stomach. Not always, though. And… I think I get a bit sensitive to light when they happen. Like, bright lights bother me more than usual. That's about it, I think. I don’t usually feel ill afterwards, just… tired. Really tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea and light sensitivity along with the headaches, sweating, racing heart, and fatigue. That gives us a bit more to work with. Now, have you noticed anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers… That’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. Stress, maybe? I mean, I've had a bit of a rough time lately, so… But I don’t know if that’s a trigger, or just… well, life. Food doesn’t seem to matter, and I haven’t changed anything with my sleep or anything like that. Honestly, they just… happen.
DOCTOR: Alright. No obvious triggers. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I… haven't been to the doctor in a while. Everything was always fine before, to be honest. I'm usually pretty healthy. Just… this headache thing started, and it’s been bugging me. I didn’t even really think about going to the doctor until it got worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. No prior medical conditions. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. I'm a pretty lucky guy, usually. Apart from this, of course. It's just… really frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mom had… migraines, I think? When she was younger. Bad ones, she used to say. But that was a long time ago. My dad was always healthy as a horse. And I don't really know much about my grandparents, to be honest. I don't remember anyone else having headaches like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of migraines on your mother's side. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I just… try to sleep it off, usually. Or drink some water. It hasn't really been helping lately, though. Honestly, I'm starting to worry a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And do you have any allergies to anything – medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty good with everything. I can eat anything, and I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I’m honestly starting to feel a bit silly listing off all the things I don't have going on! It’s just this headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a neurological exam. Just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try not to poke too much, okay? I'm not great with needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem. No needles today, I promise. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might be a little surprising, but it shouldn’t be painful. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Okay, balance seems good. No obvious coordination issues. Cranial nerves are intact. Blood pressure is 130/80. Temperature is normal. Everything looks normal on the initial exam, but given your symptoms and the increasing frequency, I'd like to order a CT scan of your head just to rule out anything serious. It's a precaution, alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan… okay. That sounds… serious. Is it something bad? Like, is it something really wrong? I mean, you said everything looked normal… But you wouldn’t order a scan if it wasn't important, right? I just… I don't like scans. Is there anything else we could try first? Maybe some medication? I just… I'm not a fan of hospitals, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jaxston, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about a CT scan. It is a precaution, and the vast majority of the time, these scans come back normal. Given the nature of your headaches – increasing frequency, radiating pain, and the associated symptoms – I want to rule out any structural issues. Things like a tumor, an aneurysm, or bleeding in the brain are rare, but we need to be thorough. Before we jump to medication, which might mask the symptoms without addressing the underlying cause, it’s best to get a clear picture of what’s going on in your head. It's important to be thorough. We can discuss the risks and benefits of the CT scan in detail. It's a relatively quick and painless procedure. And if you are truly uncomfortable, we can explore other options, but they may take longer to provide a diagnosis. Would you like me to explain the CT scan procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… a tumor or… bleeding. That’s… scary. I guess… I guess if you think it’s important, I should do it. But… what exactly does it involve? And is there… radiation involved? I've heard things about radiation. And… how long will it take? I have a bit of a… a complicated schedule. And what if they find something? I just… I don't want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Jaxston. It's natural to be scared when you hear about possibilities like tumors or bleeding, but I want to reassure you that these are rare occurrences. We're taking this precaution to rule them out, and most likely, everything will be perfectly normal. Let me explain the CT scan process. It involves lying on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. The machine uses X-rays to create detailed images of your brain. It’s painless and usually takes just a few minutes, maybe 5-10 minutes at most. Regarding radiation, yes, a CT scan does use a small amount of radiation. However, the amount is very low and is considered safe, especially when weighed against the benefits of potentially identifying a serious problem. The technician will use the lowest possible dose to get a clear image. If they do find something, we will discuss it in detail and create a plan of action. It could be as simple as monitoring the situation, or it might require further testing or treatment. I will be with you every step of the way to explain everything and answer your questions. We can schedule the scan for as soon as possible. It usually takes a day or two to get the results back. I understand you have a complicated schedule, and we will work around that as much as possible. Would you like me to provide you with more information about the CT scan procedure, or do you have any other questions at this moment?
PATIENT: Okay… low dose of radiation… I guess that’s… better. And you’ll be there to explain everything? That's… good. I just… I don't handle medical stuff very well. I get… panicky. And what if it's something bad? What kinds of things could it be? I know you said rare, but… I just want to know… what am I looking at if it is something bad? Just… roughly. I don’t need a lot of detail, just… what are the possibilities? Then I can at least… prepare myself. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely okay to want to prepare yourself, Jaxston. It’s a very sensible thing to do, and I commend you for asking. I want to be completely honest with you, but I also want to avoid unnecessarily alarming you. The most common things we look for on a CT scan in this situation are structural abnormalities – things that aren’t normally there. This could include a small tumor, which, in most cases, is benign and slow-growing. It could also be an aneurysm, which is a bulge in a blood vessel, or evidence of a bleed, which is less common. Less frequently, we might identify a blockage in one of the blood vessels. In the rare event we do find something, the next step would depend on the specific finding. For a tumor, we might recommend further imaging, like an MRI, to get a clearer picture. For an aneurysm, we might recommend monitoring it to see if it’s growing. For a bleed, we might recommend medication or, in some cases, surgery. I want to emphasize again that these are unlikely scenarios. The vast majority of the time, these scans come back normal. We're simply taking a precautionary step to rule out anything serious. I understand you're feeling anxious, and I want to assure you that I will be with you every step of the way. We can schedule the scan for as soon as possible, and I will personally review the results with you and explain everything in detail. Do you feel comfortable with moving forward with scheduling the scan?
PATIENT: Okay… benign tumor… monitoring… That's… less scary than bleeding. Alright. Let’s… let’s just get it over with. Schedule it. As soon as possible is fine. But… can you make sure they explain everything to me during the scan? I get… claustrophobic easily, and I think it will help if I know what’s happening. And… can I bring someone with me? Just… for support. I really don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaxston. You’re being very brave facing this. We will schedule the scan as soon as possible. I will personally speak to the technician and request that they explain everything to you during the procedure, step by step. They are used to dealing with patients who feel anxious, and they will do everything they can to make you comfortable. And yes, of course, you can bring someone with you for support. Having a friend or family member there will likely make you feel more at ease. Let me just get your insurance information… Oh, wait… you mentioned you weren't insured. That's okay. We'll discuss payment options after the scan. The clinic offers a financial assistance program, and we'll figure something out. I'll have my assistant, Sarah, schedule the scan for you right now. She'll give you all the details, including the date, time, and location. She'll also provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the scan. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact me or Sarah. We're here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Jaxston?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. And for not making me feel like I’m being silly. I just… I really don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaxston. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical procedures, and you’re not being silly at all. I'm glad I could help. And don't worry, we’ll do everything we can to make the experience as smooth and comfortable as possible. I’ll have Sarah schedule your scan now. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Jaxston.
