DOCTOR: Hi Soila, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… Well, my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. It just… doesn't feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, “big” and not wanting to eat as much. That’s a good place to start. When did you first notice your tummy feeling bigger, Soila?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I notice? That’s a hard one. It feels like… a long time now. Maybe… a few months? It’s all a bit blurry, you see. I don't keep good track of time these days. It just… slowly got bigger, I think. Not suddenly.
DOCTOR: A few months of gradual change. That’s helpful. And has anything specific changed in those few months that you can think of?
PATIENT: Specific…? Oh, goodness. Let me see… Not that I can recall, no. Everything is pretty much the same, really. I still sit and look out the window, read my books… the usual. Maybe I’ve been… sleepier? Yes, I think so. More naps. But that's not a change, exactly. I always liked my naps.
DOCTOR: Okay, more naps, but you’ve always enjoyed those. And has this feeling of fullness, or the change in your appetite, been affecting anything else?
PATIENT: Fullness… Well, my clothes feel a little tighter, of course. But other than that… not really. I still walk to the market, though it takes me longer now. And I still see my friend, Irina, for tea. But I don't eat much at tea, if you know what I mean. It feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, tighter clothes and some discomfort impacting your appetite, especially at tea with Irina. That gives me a better picture. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh dear. Is that… is that what you ask old ladies? Well, let me think… Everything is… slower, I suppose. Not as regular as it used to be. But I don’t worry about things like that too much. It just… happens. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad to share that with me, Soila. It’s important information. Slower bowel movements are good to know. And have you experienced any unintentional weight loss in the last few months?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Oh, I don’t know. I haven’t been weighing myself. I used to, but… it didn’t seem important anymore. I feel… lighter, maybe? But that could just be from not eating as much. It’s hard to say, Doctor. I don’t keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent weight checks, and feeling lighter is subjective. Let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Oh my. So many questions! Let me see… nausea… no, I haven’t been sick to my stomach. No throwing up. And… urine and stool color… Everything looks… normal, I think. Yes, pretty normal. I haven't noticed anything different there. Although, sometimes... sometimes I feel a little tired after I go to the bathroom. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea or vomiting, normal urine and stool color, and some fatigue after using the bathroom. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a long time ago. I had a… a bad cough when I was young. Very bad. And the doctor gave me some medicine. But that was… a long, long time ago. And then… I don't really remember. I’ve been to many doctors over the years, you see. They all said different things. I don’t think I have anything… serious now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough in your youth and multiple doctors over the years. Do you recall any surgeries or hospitalizations you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm… I think I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… Oh, yes! When I broke my arm, many years ago. I was climbing a tree! Very silly of me. But that’s all I can remember. No… no big hospital stays or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a broken arm in the past. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, that’s a hard one. My mother… she was always very strong. Never sick a day in her life, as far as I know. And my father… he worked very hard. He died… when I was young. I don’t remember if he was sick. They didn’t talk about those things much back then. We just… carried on. I don't think there was any… anything special in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family medical history. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications…? Oh, no. No, I don’t take anything. Doctor told me years ago to stop taking the little white pills. Said they weren’t helping. And I haven’t taken anything since. Just… tea and a biscuit now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Oh, let me see… No, I don’t think so. I’ve always eaten everything. And I’ve never had a… a bad reaction to anything. I like flowers, and I smell them all the time. No, I don’t think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Go ahead. It's been a long time since anyone listened to my heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your bowel sounds are normal. I did feel a little tenderness when I pressed on your lower abdomen. Do you feel pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A little bit. Not… sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It comes and goes, you see. Sometimes it’s worse than others. Especially… after I eat.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your lower abdomen, especially after eating. Now, I'm going to ask a few more specific questions about your bowel movements. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh, no! No, I haven’t. No blood. I would have noticed, wouldn’t I? That sounds… terrible. No, definitely no blood.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood in your stool. Have you experienced any recent changes in your stool consistency - like diarrhea, constipation, or stools that are narrower than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, everything is… slower, like I said before. Not as regular. And… sometimes it’s a little hard. But nothing… dramatic. And no, not narrower than usual. Just… slower. Everything is just… slower these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, slower bowel movements with occasional hard stools. Given your age, symptoms, and the tenderness in your lower abdomen, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something simple like constipation, but it’s also important to rule out other conditions. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a stool test to check for any signs of inflammation or infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests…? Oh dear. Is it something bad, Doctor? I don’t like tests. But… if you think it's necessary… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… please don’t make it too unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. It's not necessarily something bad, but it’s best to be thorough. The tests will help us figure out what’s going on. The CBC is just a blood draw, and the stool test is a sample you can collect at home. The nurse will explain everything in detail. I'm also going to recommend a dietary change. Try increasing your fiber intake with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and drink plenty of water. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild stool softener to help with the constipation. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the test results and see how you’re feeling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… More tests… and changes to my diet… and pills. It’s a lot. But… alright. If it helps. I’ll try the diet, and I’ll take the pills. And I’ll come back next week. The nurse will explain everything? That’s good. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Soila. I understand it’s a lot to take in, but we're going to work through this together. The nurse will give you detailed instructions for the tests and the medication. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’m going to print out a summary of our discussion, the prescription, and the test requests for you. Is there anyone I can contact if needed?
PATIENT: Oh… No, dear. No one. I… I don’t have any family close by. And my friend, Irina… she’s not very good with these things. I’ll manage. I always do. Just… thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. I understand. We’ll make sure you have all the information you need. Here are the documents, and the nurse will be right in to assist with the next steps. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. It was lovely meeting you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
