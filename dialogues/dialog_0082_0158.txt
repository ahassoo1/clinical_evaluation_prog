DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Yes, hello. Um… a letter, I think? For a pet. It’s… something about owning one. Honestly, my niece handles most of these things, but she’s busy, you see, and I just… needed to get it sorted. It’s a dog, a lovely thing. Though, truthfully, I don’t remember why I need a letter. Something about rules, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A letter… regarding your dog. Rules, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, rules. Exactly! My niece said something about… housing? Or maybe the building? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. She said I needed permission or something in writing. It's a very nice apartment, you know. Not that I chose it, mind you. It was her suggestion. Everything is always her suggestion.
DOCTOR: So, it sounds like your apartment complex may have certain regulations about pets, and they’ve requested a letter from a physician… Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That sounds right. Regulations… yes. It’s all very… bureaucratic, isn’t it? Honestly, it’s a good dog. Very well-behaved, mostly. Doesn't cause any trouble. I don’t see what the fuss is about. My niece said something about a weight limit, maybe? Though, I don’t recall the dog being that big. It’s a medium-sized one, certainly. Not a Great Dane, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it sounds like the apartment complex has a weight restriction for pets. Do you happen to know approximately how much your dog weighs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weight… That’s a tricky one. I haven’t actually weighed the dog, you know? My niece usually handles those sorts of things. I'd say… around thirty, maybe? Thirty-five pounds? It's a guess, truly. It’s not a little dog, but it's not enormous. Definitely not a hefty thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm, Deloris, you're here because the apartment complex requires a letter stating your dog doesn't pose a health or safety risk to other tenants, and potentially confirming it meets their weight requirements?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! That’s it precisely. A health and safety risk… honestly, the thought is rather absurd. It’s a perfectly lovely dog. A bit excitable sometimes, but never aggressive. And the weight… yes, if they have a limit, it needs to be confirmed. My niece is very particular about following rules, you see. Though, I still don’t understand why they need a letter from a doctor. It’s a dog, not a medical condition!
DOCTOR: You’re right, it does seem a bit unusual. Sometimes these things are just… standard procedure. Alright, let’s just go through a quick check-list to be certain everything is in order for the letter. Have you had any recent concerns about your dog's health or behavior?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. It’s a healthy thing, as far as I know. Eats well, sleeps well… sometimes barks at the mailman, but that's perfectly normal, isn’t it? No major issues, thankfully. My niece makes sure it gets all its… its vaccinations, I suppose. And whatever else dogs need. I don’t really pay attention to those details, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, and just to be thorough, do you have any medical conditions that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I have… a bit of arthritis, I suppose. In my knees, mostly. But it doesn’t affect me that much. I manage. It doesn’t stop me from… walking the dog, or anything. Though, sometimes it’s a bit stiff in the mornings. Honestly, it's probably just old age. Nothing to worry about, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Deloris. It sounds like you and your dog are both in good health. Just to be certain, and as a standard precaution, would you mind if I quickly checked your blood pressure and listened to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Really? Is that necessary? I mean, it’s just a letter for a dog. I suppose… if it’s standard. But I feel perfectly fine, you know. I don’t like doctors poking and prodding. It’s always a bother. But… alright. If you insist. Just make it quick, please.
DOCTOR: It's just a quick check, Deloris, to ensure everything is as it should be. It won't take long at all. And it's good to get a baseline reading, just in case. If you'll just have a seat and I’ll get started.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Very well. Just please be quick, dear. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know. And I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142/88, but that can be common with a little stress or just from being in the office. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good, overall. Now, to finish up the letter, I just need to confirm that your dog doesn’t pose a health or safety risk to others. Is there anything at all – any behavioral quirks or tendencies – that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Behavioral quirks… Well, it gets a bit excited when it sees squirrels, of course. Runs around in circles, barks a lot. But that’s perfectly normal, isn’t it? And… it sometimes tries to steal food off the table, if you’re not careful. My niece keeps telling me to be stricter, but it’s just so cute! Other than that… no, not really. It’s a good dog. Really. Definitely not a dangerous thing.
DOCTOR: Squirrel chasing and a little table scavenging… perfectly normal dog behavior, Deloris. No concerns there at all. Here you go. This letter confirms that you are in good health, and that your dog does not pose a health or safety risk to others. It also notes your dog’s normal, playful behavior. I’ve included a note about the slight elevation in your blood pressure, and I recommend following up with your primary care physician for regular check-ups. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Thank you, dear. A bit long, perhaps, but… yes, that’s good. Thank you for your time. Hopefully, this will satisfy my niece. She can be very particular, you know. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can I be on my way? I have errands, you see… and my knees aren't getting any younger.
DOCTOR: No, Deloris, that’s all for today. Just remember to follow up with your primary care physician for regular check-ups, especially given the slightly elevated blood pressure. Other than that, enjoy your time with your dog! It was a pleasure meeting you. If you have any concerns in the future, don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I will try to remember that. Thank you again, dear. You've been very helpful. And yes, it was a pleasure meeting you too. Right then. I suppose I should be on my way. Goodbye. .
