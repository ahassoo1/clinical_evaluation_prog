DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, um… it’s my memory. It’s just not what it used to be, and it’s starting to worry me a little. I keep forgetting things. Little things, mostly, but… it feels like it’s getting worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly concerning when you notice changes in your memory. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me more about these instances of forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Let me think. It's not like, big things, you know? I don't forget who people are, or… how to drive. It's more like… I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and lose my train of thought mid-sentence. And sometimes… I struggle to remember what I had for breakfast. It’s silly stuff, really. But it’s happening more and more often.
DOCTOR: Those examples are helpful, Ms. Heidenthal. It doesn’t sound like the sort of memory loss that would be immediately alarming, but it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. To clarify, has this been a gradual change, or did it seem to start suddenly?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I think… gradual. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, but looking back, maybe six months ago? It was just little things then, easily dismissed. But in the last couple of months, it’s definitely felt more noticeable. I wouldn’t say sudden, no. More like… a slow creep.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slow creep over the past six months. And is this memory difficulty impacting your daily life at all – things like work, hobbies, or social activities?
PATIENT: Um… yes, a little, actually. At work, I’m a dentist, so I need to remember details about patients - allergies, what work they've had done before. I haven’t messed anything up yet, thankfully, but I have to really concentrate to recall things, and I double-check my notes constantly. It’s… tiring. And with friends, I sometimes forget conversations we’ve had, or things they’ve told me, which is embarrassing. It makes me not want to be as social as I used to.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like it's causing you some stress and anxiety, which is understandable. Let's delve a little deeper into your medical history. Do you have any history of medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or depression?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. My blood pressure is usually good when I get it checked at my yearly physical, and I don't have diabetes. I had a bout of thyroid issues about ten years ago, but that was treated with medication and it’s been fine ever since. The doctor said it was under control. And… I’ve felt a little down sometimes, everyone does, but I wouldn’t say I’ve ever been depressed. Nothing diagnosed, anyway. Is that okay? I hope I’m remembering all this right…
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Heidenthal, and you're doing very well. It's completely normal to be a little anxious about remembering things accurately during a medical history. We can always revisit things if needed. You mentioned thyroid issues treated ten years ago. Are you currently taking any medications for that or for anything else?
PATIENT: No, I stopped taking the thyroid medication a long time ago. The doctor said I didn't need it anymore. And… let me think… no, nothing else. Just over-the-counter stuff sometimes, like ibuprofen for headaches, but that's it. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've eaten everything, pretty much! No allergic reactions ever. Sometimes I get a bit of a sniffle with dust, but that’s it. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my wisdom teeth taken out when I was younger, that's about it. And… I was hospitalized once when I was a teenager with a bad case of pneumonia, but that was a long time ago. Everything went fine, I recovered completely. No other surgeries or hospital stays.
DOCTOR: Okay, wisdom teeth removal and pneumonia as a teenager. Now, let's talk a bit about your family. Is there any history of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease in your family?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… well, she wasn't really with it towards the end. But it was just “old age,” everyone said. She was very confused a lot, and forgot things, but no one ever really talked about it being anything specific, like Alzheimer's. My mother said she just… faded away. And… my uncle on my father’s side, he had some health problems later in life, but I don’t think memory was one of them. Honestly, we didn't really discuss family medical history much. I wish we had.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon for family medical history to be incomplete. Okay. And finally, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone, in a house. I'm a dentist, as we’ve said, so I work pretty regular hours, Monday to Friday. I try to eat healthy, lots of vegetables, not too much junk food. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a week. I try to get some exercise, I go for walks when I can, but it's hard to find the time. I sleep… okay. Maybe six or seven hours a night. It’s not amazing, but it’s not terrible either. I spend a lot of time at work, or just… relaxing at home, watching TV. I don't have many hobbies, I suppose. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Heidenthal. Thank you for sharing that with me. Alright, to get a better understanding of your current cognitive function, I’d like to perform a brief cognitive assessment. It will involve some simple questions and tasks to evaluate your memory, attention, and other mental abilities. It shouldn’t take too long, and it will help me determine if further evaluation is needed. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. A simple test sounds good. I hope I don’t do too badly…
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel a little anxious, but there's no need to worry. It’s not a pass/fail test, just a way for me to gather some information. Okay, let’s begin. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date… hmm… it’s… August 2nd, 2025. I think. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I'm pretty sure. Is that right? I always get a little mixed up with the dates…
DOCTOR: That is correct, Ms. Heidenthal. Don't worry about being a little unsure, it happens. Okay, next, can you spell the word "world" backwards for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Backwards… Okay, let me think. Um… d-l-r-o-w. Is that right? I always struggle with spelling backwards. It’s terrible. I'm so embarrassed.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Heidenthal. That's perfectly okay. We’re just getting a baseline here. Now, I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me after I finish. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Go ahead. I’ll try my best to remember. This is harder than I thought it would be.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: table, penny, rose. Please repeat those back to me when you're ready.
PATIENT: Um… table… penny… rose. Did I get those right? I’m trying really hard to focus, but my mind is a little blank now. It’s like they’re just… gone.
DOCTOR: You repeated those correctly, Ms. Heidenthal. Now, I'm going to ask you to perform a simple serial 7s calculation. I want you to start at 100 and subtract 7, five times. Can you do that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Serial 7s? That sounds… complicated. I was never very good at math. But I’ll try. Um… 100 minus 7 is… 93. Then 93 minus 7 is… let me see… 86. And then… 86 minus 7 is… 79. Then 79 minus 7 is… 72. And finally… 72 minus 7 is… 65. Is that right? I had to really concentrate on that. I'm probably wrong.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Ms. Heidenthal! Very good, despite saying it was difficult. Alright, Ms. Heidenthal, that concludes the brief cognitive assessment. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. Based on the results of this assessment, your scores are slightly below the average range for your age group, particularly in areas of immediate recall and processing speed. This doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it does warrant further investigation. It could be due to a number of factors, such as stress, anxiety, sleep deprivation, or early signs of cognitive decline. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, or electrolyte imbalances. I also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI or CT scan, to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A brain scan? That sounds… scary. But… if it helps figure out what’s going on, I guess so. I just… I don’t like the idea of something being wrong. But I understand. Blood work sounds okay. Less scary. So, yes, I think… yes, let’s do the tests. Just… please explain everything to me as we go. I get very worried easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Heidenthal. I completely understand your concerns, and I will explain everything to you every step of the way. A brain scan is a non-invasive procedure that provides detailed images of your brain. It doesn’t involve any radiation, and it's usually very well-tolerated. It will help us rule out any potential causes for your memory problems. I’m ordering the blood work now, and I'll also schedule you for an MRI scan. The lab will contact you to schedule your blood test, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule the MRI. In the meantime, I would like to recommend some lifestyle modifications that may help improve your cognitive function. These include getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, managing stress, and staying mentally active. Are you experiencing any symptoms of depression or anxiety, such as sadness, loss of interest, or difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I get a little stressed sometimes, with work and everything, but I wouldn’t say I’m depressed. I get sad sometimes, like everyone does, but nothing major. I sleep okay, most nights. Maybe a little restless, but nothing terrible. Honestly, I think most of my worry comes from… forgetting things. It’s like I’m afraid of what I’m going to forget next. That’s what keeps me up at night. Not… sadness. Just… fear.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Heidenthal. Fear and anxiety can definitely exacerbate cognitive symptoms. It's good that you're able to identify that as a primary source of your worry. Alright. We'll proceed with the blood work and MRI as planned. I'm also going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. A neurologist is a specialist in brain and nerve disorders, and they can provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? That sounds… serious. Is it really necessary? I mean, couldn't it just be stress? Or… something I can fix myself? I don't like the idea of seeing a specialist. It feels… scary. But… if you think it’s best, I guess so. I just… I wish there was an easier answer. If you really think it’s necessary, then yes. A neurologist. But please, explain everything to me beforehand. I need to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s completely normal to feel anxious about seeing a specialist. However, a neurologist is the best person to evaluate your condition and determine the underlying cause of your memory problems. While it may be due to stress, it’s important to rule out any other potential causes, such as early signs of cognitive decline or other neurological conditions. I’m referring you to Dr. Emily Carter, a highly respected neurologist in the area. She specializes in memory disorders and is very compassionate and understanding. She will perform a thorough neurological examination and review your medical history and test results. During the appointment, she will likely ask you about your symptoms, your medical history, and your family history. She will also perform a series of tests to evaluate your cognitive function, motor skills, and reflexes. She may also order additional tests, such as an EEG or a PET scan. The entire appointment will likely take about an hour or two. Here’s the referral slip with Dr. Carter’s contact information. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Um… yes, actually. What if… what if it is something serious? What if it’s… Alzheimer’s? I’ve heard… terrible things. And what about my work? I’m a dentist! I need to remember things. If I can’t remember things, I can’t do my job. I’m… very worried about that. And… is there anything I can do now? Anything to help my memory? Just… anything at all? I feel so helpless.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Heidenthal. It's completely natural to feel anxious and helpless in this situation. Let's address them one by one. First, regarding the possibility of Alzheimer's, it's important to remember that we don't know what's causing your memory problems yet. Many different conditions can cause memory loss, and it's important not to jump to conclusions. The neurologist will perform a thorough evaluation to determine the underlying cause. And even if it is Alzheimer's, there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Regarding your work, I understand your concern about being able to continue practicing dentistry. If it turns out you have a cognitive impairment, we can explore options for accommodations, such as reducing your workload or delegating tasks. And there are also resources available to help dentists with cognitive impairments continue practicing safely and effectively. Now, regarding what you can do now to help your memory, there are several things you can try. First, make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Second, stay mentally active by engaging in activities that challenge your brain, such as reading, puzzles, or learning a new skill. Third, try using memory aids, such as writing things down, using checklists, or setting reminders. Fourth, reduce stress by practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation. I'm also going to give you a brochure with information about memory aids and resources for people with cognitive impairment. It includes websites and support groups that may be helpful. Remember, Ms. Heidenthal, you're not alone in this. We're here to support you every step of the way. And we'll do everything we can to help you figure out what's going on and develop a plan to manage your condition. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… explained a lot. It’s still scary, but… I feel a little better, knowing what to expect. I’ll try those things you mentioned. Sleep, exercise… memory aids. I guess I can try. Thank you for being so patient with me. And thank you for not… dismissing my worries. I guess I’ll go home now and… try to relax. And try not to forget where I parked the car. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, and it's important to take things one step at a time. And don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Please take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again. And don’t worry about forgetting where you parked – it happens to the best of us. Have a good day, Ms. Heidenthal.
