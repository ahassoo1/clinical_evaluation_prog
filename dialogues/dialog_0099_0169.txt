DOCTOR: Right then, Mr. Miner. Derick, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, Derick. Just Derick is fine. Though, honestly, people get it wrong all the time. Don't bother with the last name, really. So, you said somethin' 'bout my face and legs swellin'? Feels a bit silly talkin' about it, to be honest. It comes and goes, y'know?
DOCTOR: Well, it's not silly to discuss what's bothering you, Derick. It's my job to listen. Comes and goes, you say… How long has this been happening now?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That’s a tough one. A while, I reckon. Months, maybe? I don’t really keep track of things like that. It’s not like it’s a sudden thing, it just...started bein' noticeable, I guess. Around spring, maybe? Though I spent a lot of time in the shed, so couldn’t really tell ya. Does it matter? It's not constant, thankfully.
DOCTOR: It matters in the sense that timing can sometimes give us clues, Derick. “Around spring” is…vague. Was it a gradual onset, or did it appear quite suddenly?
PATIENT: Sudden? No, not sudden. More…slow. Like a balloon bein' filled, I suppose. Just got bigger and bigger 'til I noticed it. Mostly my ankles, at first. Then it kinda spread up my legs, and my face gets puffy sometimes. Mostly in the mornin', I think. Look, I ain't one for detail, okay? I fix things, I don't talk about things. What do you think it is? Old age? I’m not gettin’ any younger, that’s for certain.
DOCTOR: “Old age” is rarely a diagnosis, Derick. Although you are right, certain conditions become more common with age. Puffiness and swelling – edema, as we call it – can be caused by a variety of things, ranging from simple fluid retention to more significant underlying medical issues. Now, before we jump to conclusions, let's go through some questions. Do you have any problems with your kidneys or liver?
PATIENT: Kidneys and…liver? Geez, I dunno. Never been told I do. Never had much trouble with anything, really. Just the usual aches and pains. Doc always said I was a tough Swede. I don’t go to doctors much, though. Waste of time, if you ask me. They just poke and prod and tell you not to eat bacon. Now, that's a medical issue. Is this about me eatin' too much salt? I like a good salt cure on my fish, you see.
DOCTOR: A salt cure could contribute, yes. However, it's rarely the sole cause. And it wouldn't explain the facial swelling as easily as leg swelling. Let’s talk about your heart. Have you ever been told you have a heart problem, or had any symptoms like shortness of breath, palpitations, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Heart trouble? Nah. Beat steady as a drum, last I checked. Always been a strong fella. Used to lift heavy things, weld all day. Never winded or nothin'. Palpitations…is that like when your heart skips a beat? Maybe sometimes, but everyone gets that, right? Just nerves, probably. I’m a bit of a worrier, I suppose. Not about my health, mind you. More about whether the price of steel is gonna go up again. That’s a real problem.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’re trying to rule things out, Derick. Now, do you take any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Not a fan of 'em. Never been one for pills and potions. I’ll take a bit of aspirin if my head’s throbbing, but that’s about it. Doc tried to get me on somethin' for my blood pressure years back, said it was a little high. Told him I'd just lay off the coffee. And I did, for a week. Didn't see much change. Honestly, I think they just want to sell more drugs.
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I used to help my wife with her garden, and she had all sorts of things growin'. Never had a reaction to any of it. She used to say I had a cast-iron stomach. That was before…well, nevermind. No, no allergies that I can recall. Just a general dislike for hospitals, if that counts. And doctors askin' a lot of questions. It gets tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright, Derick. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll want to examine your legs and ankles. Just to get a clearer picture. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don't poke too hard, alright? My legs get sensitive sometimes. And try not to take too long. I got a shed to get back to. Steel ain't gonna weld itself, y'know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart rhythm is regular, though a bit quick. Your lungs are clear. Now, as for your legs… there’s definite pitting edema, bilaterally, up to about mid-calf. Pressing here… …see how the indent remains for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, yeah, I see. Feels a bit tender, alright? Always has when it's swollen. Like a water balloon. What does it mean, this…pittin' business? Is it serious? My wife used to say my ankles always puffed up at the end of the day, but she never said anything 'bout any...pittin'. She was a practical woman, not one for fancy words.
DOCTOR: “Pitting edema” suggests fluid is accumulating in your legs due to a problem with circulation, heart function, kidney function, or sometimes liver disease. It's not necessarily serious, but it does warrant investigation. Given your age and this sudden onset—or, well, your recollection of it—we need to rule out some of the more concerning causes. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel—which checks kidney and liver function—and a BNP level, which can help assess your heart’s condition. I also recommend an EKG—electrocardiogram—to check the electrical activity of your heart.
PATIENT: Blood tests? EKG? Good grief. That sounds like a lot of pokin’ and proddin’. Look, I told ya, I don’t bother much with doctors. Is it really necessary? Can’t you just give me somethin’ to make the swellin' go down? Maybe some kinda ointment? My wife always had a good ointment for everything. She was a good woman. I got things to do, ya know. Steel ain’t gonna weld itself.
DOCTOR: Derick, I understand your reluctance. But dismissing this without investigation could be a mistake. I’m not suggesting anything drastic, but these tests are essential to determine the cause of the swelling and rule out any serious underlying conditions. While an ointment might temporarily alleviate the symptoms, it won't address the problem. The blood tests and EKG are relatively quick and painless, and the results will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. We can discuss the results and create a plan from there. I can order them through the lab down the hall. It should take no longer than an hour. And honestly, given your age and the fact you've noticed this recently, it's better to be safe than sorry.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, alright. But don't expect me to sit there and be happy about it. An hour, you say? Can I at least have a magazine? Somethin' with steel prices, preferably. And try to be quick about it, will ya? I got a shed to get back to. Honestly, the things I do for my health... Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the lab technician bring you some magazines. And I assure you, we'll be as quick as possible. Just let me print out the lab orders and instructions, and I’ll have them ready for you. They will explain the procedure and any necessary preparation. One moment. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. They’re expecting you. Let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Fine. Alright. Thank ya. I suppose. Steel prices, eh? Let’s hope they got a decent magazine… This whole thing’s a waste of time, I tell ya. A complete waste of time.
