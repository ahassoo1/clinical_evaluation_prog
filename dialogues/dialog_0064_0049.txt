DOCTOR: Good morning, Betty. Welcome. It's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Smetak, you say? That’s a nice name. Well, now… what was I comin’ in for? Oh, right! My ears. They ain’t what they used to be, that’s for sure. Folks mumble a lot these days, or maybe it’s just me. I dunno. It’s hard to tell, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It certainly can be, Betty. It's very common for hearing to change as we get older, so you're not alone at all. And yes, sometimes folks do mumble! Let's talk about your ears. When did you first notice this difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice… Now that’s a question. Seems like it’s been comin’ on for a while now, slow-like. Maybe… a year or so ago? It’s hard to pinpoint, really. I used to be able to hear the birds singin’ clear as a bell, and now… well, now it’s just a bit of a blur. I mostly notice it when there’s a lot of noise, like at the grocery store. Everything just kinda… jumbles together, ya know?
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual change is typical, and grocery stores are a good example – lots of background noise can make things harder. Has it been getting worse steadily, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been steady, I think. Not a sudden thing. Just… less and less. I find myself askin’ people to repeat themselves a lot, which is a bit embarrassing, to be honest. My nephew, bless his heart, he tries to speak up, but even then… sometimes I just nod and smile and hope I got it right, ya know? It’s easier that way. Though I’m sure I’ve misunderstood a thing or two!
DOCTOR: It's very common, Betty, and you're certainly not alone in that experience. It’s good that your nephew is trying to help, and it's perfectly alright to ask people to repeat themselves. It's much better to be sure. Now, besides difficulty hearing, have you noticed any ringing in your ears, any pain, or any fullness or pressure?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes, yeah. A little bit. It’s not constant, just… a sort of faint buzzin’ now and then. Like when you’re really quiet, ya know? Not painful, thankfully. And no pain, no pressure. Just… quiet and a bit muffled. That’s about it, I guess. Though, now that I think about it, my ears sometimes feel a little… blocked, like when you’re flyin’ in a plane. But it goes away quick enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Have you ever had any problems with ear infections, or had any injuries to your ears?
PATIENT: Ear infections… oh, goodness. When I was a little girl, maybe. I had a bad sore throat once that went to my ears, but that was a long time ago. I don't remember much about it, to be honest. And no injuries… no, I don't think so. I was always careful. I used to work in a shoe factory, mind you, lots of noise there, but we all had earplugs, bless their hearts. We looked like a funny bunch, but it saved our hearin’, I reckon.
DOCTOR: That's good that you had ear protection at the factory, that would have certainly helped. Now, let’s do a quick examination of your ears, just to get a better look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Long as it doesn’t hurt! I always get a little nervous when folks poke around in my ears. But I suppose it’s gotta be done. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty, I'm just going to take a quick look in your ears with this instrument. It doesn’t go in your ear, just over the opening. It might be a little cool. Okay, right ear looks… a little bit of wax buildup, which is quite common. The eardrum itself looks normal in color and shape. And the left ear is similar – some wax buildup, and the eardrum looks normal as well. There doesn’t appear to be any sign of infection or fluid. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you have age-related hearing loss, likely combined with a bit of wax buildup. The wax could be contributing to the muffling you're experiencing.
PATIENT: Oh, wax, eh? Well, that makes sense. I do like a good bath, but I suppose I haven't been payin’ much attention to inside my ears. Age-related, you say? That’s what I figured, more or less. Everything goes eventually, I suppose. So… what do we do about it? Can you… fix it?
DOCTOR: It’s very common, Betty, and nothing to be too worried about. And while we can't "fix" age-related hearing loss, there are things we can do to help. First, we can remove the wax buildup, which should improve your hearing somewhat. I can do that here in the office. It’s a quick and painless procedure. As for the hearing loss itself, the best thing to do is usually a hearing test to get a better understanding of the specific type and severity of loss. Then, we can discuss options like hearing aids if you're interested. They can be a big help in improving your quality of life. Would you like me to schedule a hearing test for you?
PATIENT: A hearing test, you say? Well… that sounds sensible, I suppose. I’ve been puttin’ it off for a while now, but if it’ll help… yes, alright. Schedule a test, please. And get rid of the wax while you’re at it! Maybe I'll be able to hear my nephew without askin’ him to repeat himself five times. That would be a blessin’. When can you fit me in? I’m fairly flexible, thankfully. Retired life has its perks!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's see… the audiologist has availability next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at ten… hmm. Yes, that should be fine. Perfect, even. Gives me time to have my mornin’ tea and get ready. Tuesday it is then! Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been a big help already, just explainin’ things. I feel a bit better just knowin’ what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Betty. I'm glad I could help. Now, before you go, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me think… not that I know of, no. I used to be allergic to cats, a bit, but I haven't been around one in years. Nothing that requires an EpiPen, thankfully! I've always been fairly lucky in that department. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, ya know?
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my blood pressure, that’s all. Lisinopril, I think it is. A small dose, every mornin'. Other than that, just tea and good company! I try to stay healthy, ya know? Can’t beat a good cup of tea!
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril. Perfect. And one last thing – just to confirm, your insurance is Medicare, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Medicare. A lifesaver, honestly. Though the paperwork can be a bit… overwhelming at times. But I manage. They keep changin’ the rules, ya know? But Medicare it is. Is that all you needed, Doctor? I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, that’s all for today, Betty. We've covered everything I need. Just remember, Tuesday at 10:00 AM for the hearing test. The receptionist will give you some paperwork to fill out beforehand. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, Betty. I hope you have a wonderful day, and I’ll see you on Tuesday.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful. Tuesday it is then! And thank you, Doctor. You too! You've been a real help. I’ll fill out those papers and see you then. Bye bye to you as well! Have a lovely day now!
