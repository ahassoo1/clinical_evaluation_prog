DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Right, well... it's about getting a good night's sleep, I suppose. And maybe... feeling a bit more together, you know? It's just... things haven't been quite right since… well. It’s hard to put my finger on it, honestly. I just feel… sluggish. Not exactly unhealthy, but not good, either.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Sluggish” is a good way to describe it. And you said this started after… something happened?
PATIENT: Yeah, after... look, it was a while ago. My wife… she passed. It’s been… a few years now, but I still don't sleep properly. I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all. And then I’m just… tired all day. It's not like I'm doing anything strenuous, mind you. Mostly just fiddling with instruments. It's a calm job, really. Shouldn’t be wearing me out.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry for your loss, Mr. Redfern. That must have been incredibly difficult. It’s perfectly understandable that something like that would continue to affect you, even after several years. Let’s talk about this sleep issue and the fatigue. When you say you don’t sleep properly, can you describe what happens?
PATIENT: Right, well... it's not that I can’t fall asleep, usually. It’s more… staying asleep. I wake up. A lot. And then I just… lie there. Thinking. And then I’ll get up, make some tea, maybe look at an instrument. Then I'll try again. It's just… a cycle. I don’t even know what I'm thinking about half the time. Just… stuff. And then I’m tired all day. It’s not a productive tiredness, if you know what I mean. More like… a grey tiredness.
DOCTOR: A "grey tiredness," yes, I understand. So you're falling asleep relatively easily, but experiencing frequent awakenings throughout the night, and finding it hard to get back to sleep. How many times would you estimate you wake up on an average night?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. That's a difficult one. Honestly? I haven't kept track. It’s not like one or two times. It feels… constant. Maybe… three or four times, at least. Perhaps more. It really varies, you know? Some nights it's just a little irritating, other nights I'm up half the night. I just… accept it now, I suppose. It's not ideal, but it's what I've gotten used to.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you notice anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Not really. Nothing specific. Sometimes if I’ve been working on a particularly delicate repair, I’ll wake up thinking about it. Fret about whether I’ve done it right, you know? But that's rare. And honestly? It doesn't really matter what I eat or drink. I’ve tried cutting down on tea before bed, but it didn't make much difference. I suppose… stress, generally. But who doesn't have stress, these days?
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and sleep issues?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Not that I've noticed. I mean, I'm a bit… creaky, you know? Getting old. I'm not as quick as I used to be. But that's just age. My appetite's alright. I’m not losing weight. Everything seems to be… functioning, if you catch my drift. I just don’t have much energy.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications… No, nothing regularly. Occasionally a painkiller for my back, but that’s it. Allergies… not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I haven't had a reaction to anything in… well, ever. I suppose I’m fairly robust.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have a family history of sleep problems, depression, or anxiety?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… that's a tough one. My mother was always a bit… anxious, I suppose. Worried about everything. But I don’t know if it was a clinical thing, you understand? Just… a worrier. And my father was… stoic. Didn't talk about feelings much. I don't recall anyone specifically having trouble sleeping, no. But we weren't really the type to discuss these things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Mr. Redfern, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to your fatigue. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I'm not particularly fussed about poking and prodding, but if it helps… go ahead. I'm used to fiddling with small instruments, so I’m sure I won't mind.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie down on the examination table, we’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. First, let's listen to your heart. Deep breaths, please. Sounds normal. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'll just check your reflexes. Reflexes are within normal limits. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything seems to be physically normal, Mr. Redfern. Given your history and the physical exam, it sounds like we're dealing with a sleep disturbance, likely related to stress and potentially some lingering effects from your loss. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a basic blood work-up, including a complete blood count, thyroid function test, and vitamin D level. Also, I would recommend a sleep diary for a week, just to get a more detailed picture of your sleep patterns. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work, sleep diary… fine. Anything that might help. Honestly, I'm happy to try anything at this point. I just want to feel… less grey, you know? Less… like I’m going through the motions.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Redfern. We'll work towards that. I’m going to write you a referral for the blood work. It can be done at [local lab name], and it doesn't require a fasting sample. The results usually take about three to five business days. I’ll also print out a sleep diary for you to fill out. It's a simple chart, just tracking when you go to bed, when you wake up, and how you feel in the morning. I also want to talk about some strategies for improving your sleep hygiene. Things like establishing a regular bedtime routine, making sure your bedroom is dark and quiet, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed. And… I think it might be helpful for you to consider talking to someone about your grief. There are support groups and therapists who specialize in loss. I can provide you with some resources if you're interested. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… thorough. Sleep hygiene, blood work, diary… alright. I suppose the support groups… I haven't really thought about that. But… maybe. I'll think about it. Give me the resources anyway, I suppose. No harm in having them. I just… I don’t want to dwell on it, if you understand. I just want to sleep.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here are the lab requisition, the sleep diary, and a list of local support groups and therapists. I've highlighted a few that specialize in bereavement. As you said, you don’t need to use them right away, but it’s good to have the information. I’ll also send these electronically to your primary care physician. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in about two weeks, once the blood work results are back, to discuss them and see how the sleep diary is going. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, no, I think that covers it. Just the usual… old age and feeling tired. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very… thorough. And patient. I appreciate that. I suppose I should get going, then. Before it gets too late.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Redfern. I'm glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you in two weeks. .
PATIENT: .
