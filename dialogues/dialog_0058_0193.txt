DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor TodoroVICH. Thank you for seeing me. It is… a bit embarrassing, really. I have… too much gas. A lot of it. It happens many times during the day, and sometimes at night. It is… unpleasant, for everyone. I worry it is something serious.
DOCTOR: Right. Gas. Okay. Well, it can be unpleasant, I suppose. It’s… not usually serious, but we need to figure out why it’s happening. A lot of people get gas, it’s true, but many times a day… that's not normal. First, let's try to pinpoint things. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. Let me think… it began, I believe, around… maybe three months ago? Perhaps four. It was… gradual. At first, it was just a little more than usual. Now, it is… quite frequent. I do not recall changing anything in my diet around that time. I eat mostly the same foods as always. I have not traveled anywhere either.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months… gradual onset. No dietary changes, no travel. Alright. And what exactly does this gas feel like?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it is… different sometimes. Sometimes it is just… rumbling. Like a small earthquake in my stomach. Other times, it is… sharp pains. Not terrible pains, but… uncomfortable. And then, of course, there is the… release. Which is the most problematic part, naturally. It sometimes smells… quite strong, too.
DOCTOR: Right, rumbling, sharp pains, and… the smell. Okay. Have you noticed any connection between what you eat and when this happens?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. I have tried to notice, Doctor. I really have. But I do not see a clear connection. I eat… simple foods. Soup, bread, sometimes a little chicken. I avoid… spicy things, as much as possible. I do not drink… fizzy drinks. Now that I think about it… maybe it is worse after I eat beans? But I only eat beans… once a week, perhaps less. And it does not always happen after beans. It is very confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no consistent trigger, even with beans. Let's move on. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? You mean… when I go to the… restroom? Well, yes. It is… more frequent now, I suppose. And… looser. Not diarrhea, exactly. But not… firm, either. It is… difficult to explain. Everything feels… unsettled. It is also… harder to control sometimes. I must be… more careful.
DOCTOR: More frequent, looser stools, harder to control. Right. Any nausea, vomiting, weight loss, or fever?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely no vomiting. No nausea either. I have not lost any weight. I checked. And I do not have a fever. I feel… warm sometimes, but that is just the weather, I think. It has been very hot lately. I am eating normally, I believe. Perhaps even a little more than usual, because I am worried about losing weight.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it sounds like irritable bowel syndrome, possibly. A lot of people experience that. But we should rule out other things first. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then I'll do a quick physical exam, just to be sure. Alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Of course. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I want to know what is happening. And I want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little tender here, and here. Nothing… alarming, but definitely some sensitivity. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to complete the exam. Your heart and lungs sound clear. No unusual sounds. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. All normal. Given your symptoms, and the exam findings, I suspect it is IBS, but we need to rule out a bacterial infection or other issues. I'm going to order a stool sample analysis, and a basic blood workup. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… very thorough. A stool sample… and blood work. Yes, of course. Whatever is necessary. I want to be sure. Will the blood work tell us if it is something… serious? And the stool sample… how does one… collect that? I hope I do not need… special instructions. I do not want to make a mistake.
DOCTOR: The blood work will rule out inflammation and other potential problems. The stool sample will check for bacteria or parasites. It’s a fairly straightforward process. I’ll give you these collection kits and detailed instructions. It involves… collecting a small sample using this. It needs to be refrigerated immediately and brought to the lab within 24 hours. The instructions explain everything, but if you’re unsure, the lab technicians can help. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding… gas-producing foods. Broccoli, cabbage, beans, carbonated drinks… things like that. And try to manage stress. Stress can exacerbate IBS. I’ll also give you a prescription for a mild anti-gas medication. It won’t cure anything, but it may provide some relief while we wait for the test results. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… very helpful. Avoid gas-producing foods… and manage stress. I will try my best. The anti-gas medication… that sounds good. I am quite stressed, actually. Living alone… and worrying about this… So, a stool sample, blood work, avoid certain foods, manage stress, and the medication. I believe I have it all. How long will the test results take? And… where is the lab?
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take about three to five business days. Here’s a slip with the lab address and instructions. It's just down the street, at the County General Hospital. It’s open Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a more comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, or a high fever, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor TodoroVICH. I believe that is all. You have been… very thorough. And very patient. I appreciate your help. I will collect the sample, avoid the foods, and try to manage the stress. And I will return for a follow-up appointment. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You’ll receive a call to schedule the follow-up. Have a good day. .
