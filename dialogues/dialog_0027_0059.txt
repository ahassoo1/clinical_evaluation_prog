DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what exactly brought me in. My husband, he said something about my speech… that it’s been a bit… off? I’ve just been feeling a little bit… hazy, I suppose. It’s difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Hazy… okay. And how long have you been feeling this way, this… haziness?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. Honestly, I struggle to recall precisely. It feels like… a few weeks, maybe? It’s not constant, you understand. Some days I feel perfectly fine, and others… well, others my words seem to get… tangled. It’s rather frustrating, to be quite frank. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Adyn. It’s perfectly alright. It sounds like it comes and goes. And is this “tangling” of words… does it affect everything you say, or just certain things?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good point. I believe it’s more… noticeable when I’m trying to explain something complicated. Simple things, like ordering food, I can usually manage alright. But if I’m trying to describe… a problem at the construction site, or explain something to my husband… that’s when it gets tricky. It's like the words are just… there, in my head, but I can't quite get them out properly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. And you mentioned the construction site… so you’re working?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am a Construction Manager. It’s… a demanding job, I won’t lie. Lots of coordinating, and problem-solving, as I mentioned. I have been doing it for about three years now. It's usually very fulfilling, but lately… well, with this speech issue, it's been a little bit more stressful. I’m worried it’s impacting my performance.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the speech, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. I’ve been… a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. And my balance hasn’t been the best, but I always assumed that was just from being on my feet all day at the site. It's difficult to tell what’s normal and what isn’t, you see. I haven't fallen or anything, just… a little unsteady sometimes. Oh, and I think I’ve been a little bit forgetful lately, but again, it's hard to say. I apologize, I’m rambling now, aren't I?
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Adyn. It’s good you’re telling me all of this. Fatigue, some balance issues, and forgetfulness… Okay. Have you had any headaches, vision changes, or weakness in any of your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No headaches, Doctor. And my vision seems to be perfectly alright, as far as I can tell. I had my eyes checked just last year. No weakness in my arms or legs either, thankfully. I need those for work, you see. I suppose I haven't noticed anything major, but these little things… they are starting to worry me. I just want to make sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to do a quick neurological exam, just to get a better sense of things. It’s nothing to be concerned about, just a standard check. We’ll look at your reflexes, balance, coordination, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I trust your judgement. Please, do whatever you think is best. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. I just want to figure out what’s going on, and hopefully, get back to feeling like myself again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just follow me. We'll start with your balance. Could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Like this? I feel a little unsteady already, if I’m honest. It's probably just nerves, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, just like that. A little bit of sway is normal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. I’m going to tap here, on your elbows and knees. Okay, good reflexes bilaterally. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can follow it. Is this alright? I’m trying my best to keep my head perfectly still. It's a little bit difficult, but I’m managing, I hope. I apologize if I'm not doing it correctly.
DOCTOR: You're doing wonderfully, Adyn. No need to apologize at all. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly. Is that alright, Doctor? I don't want to squeeze too hard. I’m mindful of my strength, you see. It's important for my job.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then we’ll do a quick ear exam. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I want to check your cranial nerves. This involves a few simple tests to assess your facial muscles and senses…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. I appreciate you being so attentive. Please, proceed with whatever tests you deem necessary. I trust your expertise. I'm ready when you are. I hope I won't be a bother.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Adyn. Just doing my job. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that sufficient? I can try a bigger smile if you'd prefer. I sometimes get self-conscious about my smile, if I’m honest. But I’m trying to be more confident.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Adyn. No need to force anything. Now, can you frown for me?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that alright? I can try to make it more pronounced if you need me to. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. It’s just a little strange having my facial expressions scrutinized, if I’m honest. But I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, can you stick your tongue out?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that alright? I hope I’m not being too silly. It feels a bit… undignified, but I’m doing it for the sake of the examination. Please, let me know if you need me to do anything else. I'm happy to comply.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Adyn. Everything looks good so far. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever had any significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses or surgeries… Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was in high school, playing netball. Apart from that, I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries, thankfully. I’m generally quite healthy, Doctor. Or, was healthy, before this… issue. Is there anything specific you're looking for? Perhaps it would help me recall more accurately.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and a broken arm… good to know. Have you ever had any problems with your heart, lungs, or kidneys?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any issues with my heart, lungs, or kidneys, to my knowledge. I've never been diagnosed with anything related to those organs. I do try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, you see. I eat a balanced diet and try to get regular exercise, when my job allows. Though lately, with all this stress, it's been difficult to stick to my routine. Is there a particular reason you're asking about those organs specifically? Perhaps that would jog my memory.
DOCTOR: Just routine, Adyn. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm… that’s a bit complicated, Doctor. My mother passed away a few years ago, from… complications after a stroke, I believe. And my father has high blood pressure, but he’s managing it with medication. As for other relatives… my grandmother on my mother’s side had diabetes, and my uncle on my father’s side has heart disease. Apart from that, I don’t believe there’s a significant family history of any major illnesses. Is there anything specific you're concerned about? It's just that my family isn't very forthcoming with medical information, if I'm honest. It's a cultural thing, I suppose. They prefer not to dwell on illness.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’m not currently taking any medications. I don’t like taking pills unless absolutely necessary, you see. I prefer to manage my health naturally, when possible. Although, I do take a multivitamin occasionally, just to supplement my diet. But that’s hardly a medication, is it? I hope that answers your question. Is there anything else you need to know about my medical history? Perhaps a list of allergies? I do have a mild sensitivity to shellfish, but it’s not life-threatening.
DOCTOR: Shellfish allergy, multivitamin… good. Now, before we move on, I’d like to order some blood work and an MRI of your brain. The blood work will help rule out any underlying infections or vitamin deficiencies. The MRI will give us a better look at your brain and help identify any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… Yes, Doctor, that sounds… alright. But I must admit, I’m a little apprehensive. I’ve never had an MRI before. Is it… painful? And what are we looking for specifically? I understand you need to rule things out, but it’s just… a little unnerving, to be honest. Will it take very long? And will I be claustrophobic? I've heard stories...
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Adyn. It’s perfectly normal to be nervous. The MRI itself isn’t painful at all. It’s a bit loud, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. As for claustrophobia, we can give you a mild sedative if you’re concerned, or you can open your eyes and focus on a point outside the machine. We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. As for what we're looking for, we want to rule out any structural issues in the brain that could be causing your symptoms, like a small stroke, tumor, or inflammation. It’s a precautionary measure. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be very helpful, thank you. Knowing what to expect would certainly ease my anxiety. A sedative sounds… appealing, actually. I’m just… worried about what we might find. It’s silly, I know, but my mind is racing. Please, explain the procedure to me in as much detail as possible. And perhaps tell me what the chances are of finding something serious? I understand you can’t give me a diagnosis now, but just… a general idea would be reassuring. I trust your expertise, Doctor, I truly do. It’s just… difficult to process all of this.
DOCTOR: Of course, Adyn. I completely understand. The MRI is a very safe procedure. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. You will need to remove any metal objects, like jewelry and hairpins, before the scan. We'll provide you with headphones to protect your ears from the noise. During the scan, it's crucial to remain still, as any movement can blur the images. The technologist will be able to communicate with you throughout the procedure. As for the chances of finding something serious, it’s difficult to say. Your symptoms could be due to a variety of factors, most of which are not life-threatening. However, it’s important to rule out any potential underlying causes. In cases like yours, where there's a recent onset of speech and cognitive changes, it's always best to err on the side of caution. We will discuss the results thoroughly once they are available, and I will explain everything to you in detail. Do you have any specific concerns about the MRI?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very thoroughly, Doctor. That has certainly eased my anxiety. The thought of being enclosed in a tunnel is still a little unsettling, but knowing I can communicate with the technologist and potentially have a sedative is reassuring. You’ve been very patient and understanding, Doctor, I truly appreciate it. I think… I think I’m ready to schedule the MRI. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? Any specific instructions? And when can I expect the results? I know you said thoroughly, but just… a general timeframe would be helpful. I’m just eager to get this sorted out and get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Before the MRI, you’ll need to fill out a safety questionnaire to ensure you don’t have any contraindications, such as metal implants. You can eat and drink normally before the scan. As for the results, it typically takes 24-48 hours for the radiologist to interpret the images. Once I receive the report, I’ll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule the MRI for you now. She'll also give you a copy of the safety questionnaire and instructions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfect. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You’ve been incredibly helpful. Please, let me know if there’s anything else I need to do. I’m very grateful for your thorough examination and clear explanations. I truly appreciate it. I’ll wait for Sarah, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. It was my pleasure. Just remember to take it easy, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Sarah will be with you shortly. .
