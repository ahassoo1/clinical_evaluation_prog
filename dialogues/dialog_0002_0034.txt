DOCTOR: Hi Emileigh, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Um, hi Dr. Ranjan. Nice to meet you too. Well, I just… moved here? And I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor. It’s… Medicare, I have. And I guess just a general check-up? I don’t really… remember the last time I saw one.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly fine, Emileigh. Getting established with a primary care doctor is a great idea, especially after a move. And Medicare is all set here, no problem. A general check-up sounds good. So, just to start, can you tell me a little bit about why you specifically decided to come in today?
PATIENT: Today? Oh… um. I don’t know, really. Just… felt like it was time? My husband, he said it was a good idea to get things sorted. I don’t… feel sick, not really. Just… tired, maybe? A lot. But I always feel a bit tired. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. Feeling tired a lot is definitely something we can look into. It’s good you’re coming in to get it checked out, even if you don’t feel actively sick. It’s much better to address things early. Okay, so generally feeling tired. Has this tiredness been getting worse recently, or has it been pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… maybe a little worse? But it’s hard to say. Things have been… different since we moved. Lots of changes. It’s not like, really bad, just… more noticeable, I guess? I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s hard to remember what it felt like before.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Emileigh. Major life changes like a move can definitely impact your energy levels. It’s completely normal to feel off when you're adjusting. Okay, so tiredness, possibly worsening, and related to the recent move. Besides the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… I’ve been… a little forgetful? More than usual, maybe. Like, I left the stove on yesterday, and I never do that. And I keep losing things. Small things, mostly. But it’s… annoying. Does that count as a symptom? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts as a symptom, Emileigh. Forgetfulness, especially if it’s new or different for you, is something we need to explore. And leaving the stove on is definitely concerning – it’s good you caught that. Okay, so we have tiredness and increased forgetfulness. Now, just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: My… medical history? Um… I don't really… have one? I mean, I haven't been to the doctor in ages. As a kid, I had… chickenpox? And maybe strep throat once? But nothing serious. I don’t… really remember anything else. It’s all a bit blurry. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh! It’s very common for people to not have a detailed medical history if they haven’t seen a doctor regularly. Chickenpox and strep throat are good to know, though. Okay, no significant past medical history to report. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No! Never. Nope. No surgeries. I… I don’t even like hospitals. I’ve only been in a hospital when I was little, with my grandma. But it was just visiting. I haven’t had anything done.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, just to be thorough, I like to ask about family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, grandparents, siblings – has any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… that’s… hard. My mom… she had… I think… high blood pressure? But she didn't really talk about it. And my dad… he worked a lot, so I didn't see him much. I don't really know anything about his health. My grandma… she lived a long time, but she just… got old, I think? I’m not sure. We didn't really talk about those things. Sorry. I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: That’s okay, Emileigh. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history openly. Anything you do know is helpful. So, potentially a family history of high blood pressure on your mother's side. Okay. And just a couple more questions to get a full picture. What about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? Like… what I do for fun? Well, I work. I’m a mechanical… technician. That’s what my husband does, so I followed him. It’s… okay. We don’t really… go out much. Mostly just stay home. He likes to fish. I… read sometimes. But not a lot. I don’t really… have a lot of hobbies.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, you work as a mechanical technician, and you and your husband generally keep a quiet lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! No, no, no. Never. I don’t like any of that. My husband… he used to drink a little beer sometimes, when he was younger, but he doesn’t anymore. He’s very healthy. He makes sure I eat my vegetables! It’s… good to be healthy. Is something wrong? Am I… sick?
DOCTOR: No, you’re not necessarily sick, Emileigh. I’m just gathering information to get a complete picture of your overall health. It’s good to hear both you and your husband prioritize healthy habits. Okay, one last thing in this section. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat… pretty much anything. I don't wear any jewelry, so no metal allergies. I don't think I’m allergic to… pollen or anything like that. I haven’t noticed, anyway. I think I'm pretty lucky. Does that mean we’re done with the questions?
DOCTOR: Yes, that about covers the initial questions! Okay, so to summarize, you're a 21-year-old female, new to the area, presenting with tiredness and increased forgetfulness. You have a limited medical history, no known allergies, and you and your husband live a quiet, healthy lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s okay with you. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological check. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay… um, sure. That’s… okay. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… it won’t hurt, will it? I don’t like… needles.
DOCTOR: No, it won't hurt! I promise. We won't be doing any blood draws today, just a basic exam. Alright, if you could just go ahead and have a seat on the table, and we'll get started. I'll need you to put on one of these gowns. The opening is in the back. I’ll step out while you get changed and be right back.
PATIENT: Um… okay. I always forget which way these go… This is… awkward. .
