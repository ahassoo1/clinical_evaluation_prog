DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um… good morning. I think… my husband told me to come. Something about… learning things? I don’t really remember. He said it was important. I work with the metal… the sheets. It's hard work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Airam. That’s perfectly alright. Sometimes it's good to just get things checked out. Your husband sounds like a caring person. You said you work with metal sheets… is that physically demanding work?
PATIENT: Yes! Very. Lots of… lifting. And bending. My back gets… not good sometimes. But what am I supposed to learn about? I don't understand why I am here. Is it about… safety? We have rules at the shop, but… they don't always listen.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you’re here for a general check-up, to see if the work is impacting your health, and perhaps to discuss ways to stay safe at the shop. We can definitely talk about that. But let's start with your back. When you say “not good,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s like… achey. And sometimes… sharp. If I bend over too much. Or lift something heavy. It makes me… slow down. My boss doesn't like that. He says I need to be faster. It's just… old. I think. I am not young anymore. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Airam. Aches and sharp pains with bending and lifting… that definitely sounds like something we should investigate. And it’s perfectly alright to not be as fast when you’re in pain. We need to figure out what’s causing this. Now, has this been a recent issue, or has it been going on for a while?
PATIENT: A while… a long while. Maybe… a year? Longer? I don’t really keep track of dates. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s okay, and sometimes it's… really bad. Like I can’t even… stand up straight. But I still have to go to work. We need the money. My husband… he works too, but… it's not enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been ongoing for at least a year, with periods of better and worse pain. That's helpful to know. And you’re pushing through it to be able to work. I understand that’s a difficult situation. Do you notice anything that specifically makes it worse, besides bending and lifting?
PATIENT: Hmm… cold weather. Definitely cold weather. It makes my muscles… stiff. And… standing for too long. The shop floor is… hard. No good for my feet, and my back. And… when I'm tired. Everything hurts more when I'm tired. Is that a good answer? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That is a very good answer, Airam. You’re doing just fine. Cold weather, standing for long periods, and being tired… those are all very relevant things to consider. It sounds like a lot of factors are contributing. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just so I can get a better sense of what’s going on. I’ll need you to stand up and move around a little bit. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh… okay. But don’t make me… bend too much. It hurts. And… I don’t like doctors poking me. Just… quick, okay? Very quick. I have things to do. My husband will be mad if I'm gone too long.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Airam. I understand. We’ll keep it quick and gentle. I’ll only ask you to do what you’re comfortable with. I'll start by just watching you stand and walk. Then, I’ll gently feel your back to check for tenderness or muscle spasms. We'll take it slow. First, could you just stand up for me and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Okay… one… two… three… This is… not good. It feels… worse when I move. Maybe I should just sit down. Is this helping? I don't feel like I'm telling you anything useful. It just hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam, that’s alright. It sounds like even walking is causing some discomfort. We can absolutely stop there. No need to push yourself. It’s already helpful for me to see that. Let me just feel your back gently. Just tell me if anything feels too painful. I’m just trying to get a sense of where the discomfort is located. Can I do that?
PATIENT: Ugh… fine. But very gentle. Don't poke! Just… touch it. Quickly. And tell me what you find. Maybe it’s just… old age. Like my mother. She hurt all the time. I don't want to end up like her.
DOCTOR: Alright, very gentle touches. I'm feeling some tenderness along your spine, especially on the left side. And there's some muscle spasm as well. It doesn't feel like anything acutely broken, but there's definitely some inflammation and discomfort there. It’s not uncommon to develop these kinds of issues with physically demanding work, and it’s not necessarily just "old age", though age can contribute. I'm also noticing you’re carrying a little extra weight, which can put additional strain on your back. I don't mean to offend you, Airam, but it's something we can discuss as part of your overall health. Now, do you have any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Ugh… you don’t have to tell me. I know. My clothes don’t fit anymore. My husband says I eat too much. But I’m tired, okay? And food makes me feel better. For a little while. Numbness… sometimes. In my feet. When I stand for too long. Like… pins and needles. Not all the time, but… when I'm really tired. It goes away when I sit down. Is that bad? Everything feels bad these days. I just want it to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: It's understandable you want the pain to stop, Airam. And the numbness in your feet, along with the pins and needles feeling, is something we need to address. It could be related to the strain on your back, or there could be other factors involved. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing muscle strain and some inflammation in your lower back. The weight and fatigue are likely contributing to this as well. I recommend we start with some conservative treatments. This includes: Physical therapy: To strengthen your back muscles and improve your posture. Pain medication: Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the pain and inflammation. Weight management: Losing even a small amount of weight can make a big difference. Lifestyle modifications: Avoiding prolonged standing and lifting, and taking breaks throughout the day. I’m also going to order some blood tests to rule out any other underlying conditions. And, I'd like to get an X-ray of your lower back to get a better look at the bones and joints. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh… more tests? More poking? My husband will be mad. He doesn’t like me going to the doctor. He says I waste money. But… physical therapy sounds good. Maybe it will help. Blood tests… okay, fine. But make it quick. And X-ray… is it safe? I don’t want to glow in the dark. And what about the pain medication? Will it make me sleepy? I need to work. I don’t understand all this… modification stuff. Just tell me what to do. Simple. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Airam. I understand your concerns. Let’s keep it simple. Yes, the X-ray is safe. The amount of radiation is very low, and it will only take a few minutes. It won’t make you glow in the dark, I promise. The blood tests will help us rule out anything else that could be causing your pain. They are standard tests, and shouldn’t take too long. As for the pain medication, ibuprofen or naproxen can sometimes cause drowsiness, but it’s not common. We can start with a low dose and see how you feel. If it makes you too sleepy, we can switch to something else. And for the modifications, it means trying to avoid things that make your pain worse. So, taking breaks when you’re standing for long periods, lifting with your legs instead of your back, and trying to maintain a good posture. I’m going to write down some instructions for you, including the blood tests, the X-ray, and the pain medication. I'll also give you a referral to a physical therapist. Here you go. It looks like a lot, but we'll take it one step at a time. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you're doing and discuss the results of the tests. Do you have any questions right now?
PATIENT: Ugh… okay. This is… a lot of writing. My husband is going to make fun of me. He says I should just work harder. But… okay. I guess I will try. Physical therapist… where is that? And how much will this cost? I don't want to spend too much money. And… what if the tests show something bad? I don’t want to know. Just… tell me what to do. And make it simple. Please. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Airam. I understand your concerns. The physical therapist is located at 123 Main Street, just a few blocks from here. I’ll write down the address and phone number for you. Regarding the cost, I'm not sure of the exact amount, but I can have our billing department contact you to discuss your options. They can also see if you qualify for any financial assistance programs. And as for the tests, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. If anything serious is found, we'll discuss it together, and I'll explain everything in simple terms. We won't rush into anything, and you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. Here you go. And don't worry, we'll take it one step at a time. Remember, the most important thing is to listen to your body and take care of yourself. I'm here to help you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
