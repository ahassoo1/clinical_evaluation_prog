DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my chest... it's been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? Like a tight feeling, sometimes. It started maybe... three weeks ago?
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight feeling in your chest for about three weeks. I understand that’s concerning. Can you tell me a little more about that tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, it's not like a sharp pain, not really. More like… someone is squeezing it. It comes and goes. Sometimes when I walk, it feels worse. And… I get a little short of breath then too. Not a lot, but I notice it. It’s hard to explain, you know? It just… feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I do understand, it sounds unsettling. The squeezing sensation and the shortness of breath with walking are important details. Does anything specifically trigger it, besides walking?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, not that I've noticed. Sometimes after I eat a big meal, maybe? But not always. And… oh! When I get upset. If I'm arguing with my husband, or something bad on the TV… it feels tighter then, for sure. But mostly, it just… happens. It’s random, I guess?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be linked to exertion, large meals, and emotional stress. That gives us a good starting point. Now, aside from your chest discomfort, have you been experiencing any other symptoms – anything at all, even if it doesn't seem related?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, my arms… sometimes they feel a little heavy. Not weak, just… heavy. And my jaw… it feels a little tight sometimes too. Not always when the chest hurts, but a few times, yeah. Oh! And I’ve been a little tired lately. More tired than usual, I mean. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But maybe it’s something else?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Sherion, thank you. Heavy arms, jaw tightness, and increased fatigue are all things we want to consider. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, the doctor told me a few years ago I have… high blood pressure, I think. I take a pill for it, every morning. And… let me think… my husband always tells me my cholesterol is a little high too, but I don’t take anything for that. Just try to eat healthy, he says. And… oh! My back. I have bad back problems, always have. But that’s different, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful to know. High blood pressure is definitely important, and we'll want to make sure that's well-controlled. Back problems are a separate issue, but good to be aware of. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… It's a little white pill. Small one. I always take it with my coffee. Oh! I remember now! Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. That’s it. My husband gets it for me every month. He remembers everything! I’m terrible with names, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. That's excellent. And how much Lisinopril are you taking each day?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking too much! I just take the pill he gives me. It’s… I think it’s 20 milligrams? He tells me, but I never remember the numbers. He’s the organized one. He says it's enough, and I trust him. He used to be a nurse, you know? A very good one.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly fine to rely on your husband, especially with his medical background. We can confirm the dosage with the pharmacy later. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No surgeries, no. Never had one. And… hospitalized… oh! When I had my babies, of course! But that was a long time ago. Both times, it was okay. No problems. Nothing serious. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Just the usual colds and flu, you know? Nothing to keep me in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or significant hospitalizations besides childbirth. That's good to know. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything! I love to cook, you know? Colombian food, lots of spices. Never had a problem. Sometimes I get a little heartburn after spicy food, but that’s not an allergy, right? Just… spicy! No, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. My husband always says I have a strong stomach. He’s right, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother… she had problems with her heart. She died when she was… oh, maybe 70? Something with her heart. I don’t know exactly what. It was a long time ago. And my father… he had diabetes. He lost his leg because of it. Very sad. And my husband’s side… his mother had high blood pressure too, I think. Everyone has something, you know? It runs in the family, always.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems, diabetes, and high blood pressure. That’s important information. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I’m retired now, so I don’t work. I like to cook, like I said. And I spend time with my grandchildren, they live nearby. We go to the park sometimes. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to walk when I can, but… it’s hard sometimes with the chest pain, you know? And my husband… he gardens a lot, very healthy. I help him sometimes, but mostly I stay inside. It gets hot, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, enjoy cooking and spending time with grandchildren, no smoking or excessive alcohol, some walking but limited by chest pain. That gives me a good understanding of your daily life. Sherion, I see here you were diagnosed with hypertension 14 years ago, and you’ve been on Lisinopril 20mg daily since then. Your last blood pressure reading at the clinic was 148/92, which is a little elevated. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I just want to know what’s going on with my chest, you know? It’s been worrying me. It's good you're checking everything, though. My husband always says it's best to be careful. He’s right, usually. Go ahead, I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, your blood pressure is 152/90 on the right arm and 150/88 on the left. Your heart rate is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Your lungs sound clear, but I notice a little bit of swelling in your ankles. I'm also noting some mild tenderness when I press on your chest, just here. Everything so far is preliminary, of course. But these findings, combined with what you've told me, suggest a few possibilities. It's unlikely to be something immediately life-threatening, but we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A murmur? What does that mean, Doctor? And swelling in my ankles… I hadn’t even noticed that! I thought my shoes were just getting tight. It’s not something serious, is it? I get scared easily, you know. My husband always tells me to calm down, but it’s hard when you don’t know what’s going on. What do we need to do now? What kind of tests do I need?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be concerned, Sherion, and it's good you’re sharing your feelings with me. A heart murmur doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem; many people have innocent murmurs that don’t require treatment. However, given your chest pain and family history, it’s important to investigate it further. The swelling in your ankles, known as edema, can be a sign of fluid retention, which can be related to heart problems or other conditions. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. First, an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to check the electrical activity of your heart. Then, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart size. And finally, some blood work to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and a marker called BNP, which can help rule out heart failure. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. A lot of tests, but if it helps, then I’m willing. ECG, X-ray, and blood work… Can they do all of those here at the clinic? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a doctor’s appointment with my regular doctor next week, and I’d like to have something to tell him. Will they be painful? I don’t like needles, you know. And I get claustrophobic sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Sherion. It is a lot of tests, but they’ll give us valuable information. Yes, we can do the ECG and blood work here at the clinic today. The blood work will only require a small sample, and it shouldn’t be too painful – just a quick pinch. The ECG is completely painless; it involves placing stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. The chest X-ray will need to be done at the imaging center across town. It doesn't involve any needles, and it’s a quick procedure. You will need to stand still for a few seconds, so if you’re prone to claustrophobia, let the technician know, and they can make you comfortable. The results usually take a few days to come back. I’ll make sure to call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I’ll also write a note for your regular doctor, summarizing your symptoms and the tests we’ve ordered. Does that all sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… better. Not needles for the X-ray, that’s good. And you’ll call me when the results are back, that's a relief. Just a quick pinch for the blood work… I can handle that, I guess. Okay, let's do it. Where do we start? Blood work first, right? And… can I drink something afterwards? I get a little dizzy sometimes. And… will you explain the results to me when I get them? I don’t understand all that medical stuff, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, let’s start with the blood work. Our nurse, Maria, will take you to the lab just down the hall. She'll draw a small sample of blood, and it shouldn't take long. You can definitely drink something afterwards, and Maria will make sure you’re comfortable. And absolutely, I will explain the results to you in detail when they come back, using language you can understand. No medical jargon, I promise. I'll also write down everything for you to take home, so you can refer back to it later. Maria will be with you in just a moment. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… thank you. You’re very kind. I feel a little better knowing you’re taking care of me. It’s scary when you don’t know what’s wrong. I’ll go with Maria now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. That’s what I’m here for. Don’t hesitate to let Maria or me know if you have any concerns at all. We'll take good care of you. .
