DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Fatigue. I tire… easy. Like, too easy. Doctor said… liver. Something wrong with liver. Been feeling this a long time now, though. Not new.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Fatigue… easy tiring.” And this doctor who mentioned the liver – was that a primary care physician, and do you recall when they suggested looking into that?
PATIENT: Primary… yes. Doctor… Patel. About… six months, maybe? Hard to say exactly. Time… it goes. He did some blood tests, I think. Said liver numbers… not good. But he is always busy. Very busy man. Didn't explain much. Just… numbers. And a referral. That is why I am here.
DOCTOR: Six months ago with Dr. Patel… okay. And these blood tests – do you happen to have a copy of those results, or perhaps a list of your medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. Just… a little pill for blood pressure. Doctor gave me. White one. Small. I take it every morning. Blood tests… no. Patel’s office… they just send things to other doctors. I don’t keep things. Too much paper. Waste of time. You have them, yes? From Patel?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Mr. Grumman, my system only pulls information from this clinic. We’d need those records from Dr. Patel to proceed effectively. It’s rather inconvenient, I understand, but without them, I’m working with very limited information. Do you have any family members who might have a copy, or perhaps the name of the hospital or lab Dr. Patel used?
PATIENT: Inconvenient for me, you mean. Always is. Hospital… hmm. I think it was… City General. Big place. Lab… no. Never asked. Patel just said, “Tests, City General.” That’s all. Family… my wife, maybe. She handles things. I just… feel tired. It’s the tiring that is the problem, Doctor. Not the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Alright. City General… we can request records from them, though it can take some time. In the meantime, let's focus on you. Could you describe this fatigue more precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely? How to say… Like walking through mud. Even in the morning. Even after sleep. Not… a strong tiredness. A weak tiredness. It steals… the wanting. The wanting to do things. I used to fix things. Around the house. Now… I just sit. And the wanting is gone. Does that make sense? It is not just the body. The mind feels tired too. Like… dull.
DOCTOR: "Walking through mud… steals the wanting… dull mind." Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think. Sometimes… stomach feels funny. Not pain. Just… unsettled. And… I get hot. Sweaty. Even when it's not warm. Wife says I smell… off. Like old things. But she worries too much. Also… legs. Sometimes legs feel heavy. Like stone. But then… sometimes they don’t. It changes. Difficult to say. Liver, you think? Is that what this is?
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, while Dr. Patel mentioned liver issues, it's premature to jump to conclusions. The symptoms you're describing could indicate a number of different possibilities. We need to gather more information to form a proper assessment. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides blood pressure?
PATIENT: Other conditions… hmm. Not that I know of. Doctor said blood pressure, years ago. Takes the pill. That’s it. Never been in the hospital. Except… when I was a boy. Very sick. Fever. But that was… Ethiopia. Long time ago. They gave me something. I don’t remember what. Not important now. I’m a strong man. Always been strong. Until this tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant past medical history other than hypertension. And you had a fever as a child in Ethiopia. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Never. Not even a tooth pulled. I have good teeth, see? . Not that I like the dentist. But no surgeries. Never needed them. Wife said… appendix once? When I was young? She remembers things I don’t. Maybe. But I don’t remember surgery. Only the tiring now. It is getting worse, you know. Slowly, but… definitely.
DOCTOR: Very well. No surgeries. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, liver problems perhaps?
PATIENT: Family… difficult. My parents… gone now. Long ago. Ethiopia. They didn't go to doctors much. Old ways. My sister… she has trouble with her stomach. Always complaining. But I don’t know what trouble. Just… upset. And my brother… he drinks. Too much. But he is strong. Like me. No liver problems that I know of. My wife’s family… they are healthy. Very healthy. She likes to say. Always bragging. Not much help, you know. For this tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family medical history available. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette. Disgusting. Alcohol… sometimes. With dinner. A small glass of wine. Red wine. My wife likes it too. Not every night. A few times a week. Recreational drugs? No. What kind of question is that? I am a respectable man. I work hard. I don’t have time for… that. The tiring is enough. It takes all my energy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Occasional alcohol consumption. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Maybe a little itchy when I cut grass. But everyone gets itchy when they cut grass. Nothing serious. My wife says I’m allergic to her cooking sometimes. . But that is not a real allergy. Just… strong flavors. No. No real allergies. The tiring is the problem. Not allergies. It is always the tiring.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Grumman, I understand your frustration with this fatigue. We've established your past medical history, family history, and social history. Before we proceed with further testing, let's perform a quick physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a basic neurological assessment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Examination… yes. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Get it over with. The tiring is getting worse, you know. I don't want it to… take everything. Just do it quickly, please. I have things to do. Even if I don't have the energy to do them. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back on the examination table. . Your heart sounds… regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. . Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper right quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. . Reflexes are normal. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. . I'm noting some mild tenderness in your upper right abdomen. It's subtle, but worth mentioning. We will need to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and liver function tests are essential. We will also check your iron levels. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Liver tests… that is what Patel said. So you think he was right? Tenderness… that is where it hurts. Sometimes. Not always. Iron levels? What for? I eat… normal food. I don’t feel weak. Just… tired. But the tiring… is that from the liver? Will the tests show something? Or will I just keep feeling this way? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, it’s too early to say definitively if the fatigue is related to your liver. Liver function tests will give us crucial information about how your liver is functioning. The tenderness in your upper right quadrant could be indicative of a liver issue, but it could also be caused by other factors. Iron levels are important to rule out anemia, which can also cause fatigue. These tests will help us determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. . I’m ordering the tests now. The lab results usually take 24 to 48 hours. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend… …trying to get as much rest as possible and maintaining a healthy diet. I know that’s not a solution, but it’s a starting point. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Rest? Easy for you to say. I want to rest. But the tiring… it doesn't go away with rest. It is always there. Diet… I eat what my wife cooks. . I don’t know. Maybe I should just… accept this. But I don’t want to accept it. Will the tests really show something? Will they fix this? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, I understand your frustration and your desire for a quick resolution. I cannot guarantee that the tests will pinpoint the exact cause of your fatigue, nor can I promise a cure. However, they will provide valuable information that will help us formulate a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. I am also going to order a Vitamin D level. Deficiency can cause fatigue, and it is common. Once we have all the results, we can discuss potential treatment options, which may include medication, lifestyle changes, or referral to a specialist. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen—if you experience any fever, abdominal pain, jaundice , or changes in your stool or urine—please seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Jaundice? . Yellow skin? I don’t have yellow skin. Stool… normal. Maybe a little dark sometimes. But I don’t know. Wife handles things like that. A specialist? What kind of specialist? Liver specialist? . This is… a lot. Just… when will I get the results? And will they help? I need to know if this is something… bad. Something serious. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, I understand your anxiety. We will have a clearer picture once the results are available. A specialist referral might be necessary depending on the findings, potentially a gastroenterologist, a liver specialist, or an endocrinologist. We will cross that bridge when we come to it. The lab results should be available in 48 hours, as I mentioned. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are ready. In the meantime, try not to dwell on worst-case scenarios. Fatigue can have many causes, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious illness. We will address this systematically, step by step. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Systematically… Easy for you to say. You don't feel the tiring. But alright. No. No more questions. Just… get the results. And tell me what they mean. Please. . I think… that is all. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Grumman. My nurse will be in touch. Have a good day.
