DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Tremor, you said? Yes… that’s right. My hands shake. Been happening… well, a while now, I suppose. Honestly, time gets away from me. Not sure exactly when it started, but it’s… noticeable.
DOCTOR: "A while now" isn't terribly helpful, Mr. Jezik. We need to establish a timeline for these sorts of things. Can you recall approximately when you first noticed this shaking?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not good with dates, Doctor. Truly. Maybe… a couple of years? Three? It's hard to say. It started small, you know? I thought it was just getting old, or maybe too much coffee. It's gotten worse lately, that’s for sure. I just… don’t remember specifics. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It is a problem, Mr. Jezik. Approximately three years is still rather vague. Was there anything specific happening in your life around that time?
PATIENT: Around that time… Hmm. Let me think. My divorce was… well, before that, I think. Definitely before. Nothing much else, really. Just… work. Always work. Water plant. Same job for… a long time. A very long time. I don't recall any big changes. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's focus on the tremor itself. Is it present constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, mostly. Worse when I try to do something… like hold a cup. Or write. That’s why I noticed it, I guess. Trying to sign paperwork at the plant. Makes a mess, you know? It’s not always shaking, though. Sometimes it’s fine. Quiet. Like now, mostly.
DOCTOR: And does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Stress, I think. Definitely stress. When things are busy at the plant, lots of problems… the shaking gets worse. And… cold weather, maybe? I seem to notice it more when it’s chilly. Though, to be honest, it's hard to tell with the stress. They kinda go hand-in-hand, you know? Running a water plant isn’t exactly relaxing.
DOCTOR: Right. So, stress and cold. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Other than the shaking? Uh… no, not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s just getting old, I figure. I sleep alright. No pain, no… dizziness or anything like that. Just… tired. And the shaking, of course. Is there something else I should be feeling?
DOCTOR: Let’s go through a quick review of systems, Mr. Jezik. Just to be thorough. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? I… I haven't really been paying attention. Probably lost a bit, to be honest. Not eating as much these days. Not much of an appetite. It’s hard to cook when your hands are shaking, you see? It's just easier to grab something quick.
DOCTOR: And any issues with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… now you're asking. Look, Doctor, I'm an old man. Things aren't what they used to be. Let’s just say… irregular. Is that good enough? I don’t want to get into details.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We don’t need a detailed account. Any difficulty with urination?
PATIENT: No, no problems there. Thankfully. Everything works… mostly. Look, is this all necessary? I just want to know about the shaking. I got things to do, you know? The plant needs me.
DOCTOR: Everything is necessary, Mr. Jezik. A proper assessment requires a comprehensive review. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: My vision? A little blurry sometimes, I suppose. But I’ve always had trouble with my eyesight. Just… old age. I got glasses, but they don't seem to help as much these days. Honestly, everything is just getting…dimmer. Like looking through a fog. But I've lived with it for years.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how is your hearing?
PATIENT: Not the best. People mumble, you know? Especially the younger ones. I usually have to ask them to repeat themselves. It’s… gradual, I guess. Been getting worse for a while now. Nothing sudden, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any dizziness or balance problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t fallen or anything. A little unsteady sometimes, maybe, but that’s just… getting old. I don't feel dizzy, though. Just… careful, you know? Gotta watch your step.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. The doctor… back in the old country… he said I had something with my… blood pressure, maybe? High blood pressure, I think. Years ago. They gave me pills, but I stopped taking them a long time ago. Didn't seem to make much difference. And… I had a bad case of the flu a few years back. But that's about it, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a kid. A long, long time ago. And… I think I had a hernia operation, maybe? Something with my stomach. But that was… decades ago. Honestly, my memory is just… a mess. It’s hard to keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any significant medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Family… my father, he had… heart trouble, I think. Died young, relatively. My mother… she lived a long time, but she had… arthritis, bad arthritis. Lots of aches and pains. And my sister… she had… well, something with her nerves, I think. But honestly, I don't remember the details. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about things much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Haven't taken anything regularly in years. I don't like taking pills. They make me feel… strange. I prefer to just tough things out, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll need you to perform a few simple movements so I can assess your tremor. Please extend your arms in front of you. Your blood pressure is 160/95. Elevated. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Now, can you touch your nose with your index finger, alternating hands?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it looks. See? Shaky. Always shaky. Gets worse when I try to be precise. It's been worse lately, I tell you. I don’t know what’s causing it. And I really need to get back to the plant. Things pile up fast.
DOCTOR: I see. And now, can you hold your hands out, palms up, and try to keep them still?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… difficult. They won't stay still! See? Shaking… just constant shaking. It’s worse when I’m nervous, I think. Which is… right now. I’m not usually this shaky, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tap your fingers together, as quickly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? See? It's not smooth. It's… jerky. Hard to control. It’s embarrassing, really. I used to be so steady.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Based on the exam, and your history, there are a few possibilities. Given your age, the tremor, and the elevated blood pressure, the most likely diagnosis at this point is essential tremor, possibly exacerbated by hypertension. However, we need to rule out other causes. I'm going to order some blood work, including a thyroid panel and a complete metabolic panel. I’m also going to order an EKG to check your heart. We also need to monitor your blood pressure closely. I'm going to prescribe you a low dose of propranolol, a beta-blocker, to help control the tremor. Start with 20mg twice a day, and we’ll see how you tolerate it. I also want you to try to reduce your stress levels and adopt a healthier diet. I’m not suggesting a major overhaul, but cutting back on caffeine and processed foods could help.
PATIENT: Blood work? Pills? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, I just wanted to know why my hands shake. This sounds… complicated. Propranolol… what does that even do? And stress… how do you reduce stress when you run a water plant? It's a stressful job! And I don't eat that badly… just simple things. This sounds like a lot. Is this really necessary? Can't I just… try to manage it on my own?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns, but ignoring this could lead to complications. The tremor could be benign, but it's important to rule out other possibilities, such as Parkinson’s disease or other neurological conditions. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and identify any underlying issues. The propranolol is a relatively mild medication that can often help control the tremor, but it's important to monitor your blood pressure while you're taking it. I'm prescribing this medication because you’re experiencing symptoms that need to be addressed. As for the stress, I understand your job is demanding, but chronic stress can exacerbate your symptoms and negatively impact your health. I’m going to recommend you explore some stress-reduction techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation. I have some resources here on stress management, and I’m happy to provide you with a referral to a counselor if you’re interested. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to see how you're responding to the medication and review the blood work results. Do you have any questions about the medication or the tests?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Blood work, pills, follow-up. Propranolol… side effects? What if it makes me feel worse? And I really don't think I have time for counseling. The plant… I can’t just leave it unattended. I guess… I guess I’ll try it. But if it doesn't work, or if it makes me feel terrible, I'm stopping. Is that alright? And can you just… explain the side effects again, slowly? I don't want to forget.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Propranolol can cause some side effects, but they're usually mild and temporary. The most common side effects are fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. Some people also experience cold hands and feet. Less common side effects include slow heartbeat, low blood pressure, and difficulty breathing. I've written down a list of the potential side effects here. If you experience any of these, especially difficulty breathing or a significantly slow heartbeat, stop taking the medication immediately and contact me or go to the nearest emergency room. It's important to monitor your blood pressure closely while you're taking this medication. I recommend checking it at least twice a day, morning and evening, and keeping a log. We’ll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. I understand your concerns about the plant, but your health is the priority. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out for help. I’ll provide you with a prescription for the propranolol, and I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for one month from today. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… the blood pressure checks. And the side effects. It's a lot to remember. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I’ll see you next month. I really need to get back to the plant. Things are probably piling up as we speak. I hope this works.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. I'll have the nurse schedule your blood work and provide you with instructions on how to monitor your blood pressure. Try to stay positive, and remember to contact me if you experience any concerns. Here's a summary of everything we discussed today. I’ll see you next month. .
