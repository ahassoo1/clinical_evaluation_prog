DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, my wife thought it was a good idea I get checked for… that thing. HIV, is it? She watches a lot of those health programs, you see. Keeps me on my toes, always worrying about something. It's probably nothing, but she insisted.
DOCTOR: Right. "That thing," as you put it. HIV. It's… prudent to be cautious, I suppose. Though frankly, I find patients often self-diagnose based on television programs. It rarely proves accurate. Nevertheless, let's proceed systematically. Have you experienced any symptoms that prompted your wife's concern?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I feel fine. Perfectly normal. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s just… life, isn’t it? Working, you know. Compliance Officer work is draining. Lots of paperwork. It’s not like I’ve been sick or anything. Fever, rashes, swollen glands… Nope. Nothing like that. Honestly, Doctor, I think my wife is overreacting. She always does.
DOCTOR: "Tired," you say. And how long has this fatigue been present?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't know... a few months, maybe? It comes and goes. Hard to say exactly. Like I said, it's work. Long hours staring at a computer screen, making sure everyone else follows the rules. It's not exactly a physically demanding job, but it is mentally exhausting. I just assumed it was that. It’s not like it stopped me from doing anything, you know? I still go for my weekend hikes, I still help with the garden... Normal things.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, "normal things." Let’s try to be precise, Mr. Belan. When you say "tired," can you describe it?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… tired. You know, like you’ve had a long day. Like you need a nap. Like you just don't have the energy for much. It’s not a strange, debilitating exhaustion, Doctor. It’s just… regular tiredness. What exactly are you trying to get at? Are you suggesting I have something seriously wrong? My wife is going to be insufferable if she's right.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I assure you, I am attempting to gather a thorough history. It is my job, and frankly, your dismissive attitude is not assisting me. Now, have you had any recent infections – colds, flu, anything that required a doctor’s visit?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I’m a busy man. I don’t have time for this. A cold, maybe, last winter? A little sniffle, a sore throat. Nothing major. Took some over-the-counter stuff, got better. It’s been months. You're asking a lot of questions about something that probably isn't even a thing. My wife reads too much, honestly. It fills her head with nonsense. Are we getting anywhere with this or are we just going to keep going in circles?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions? No. Never. Why would I need a blood transfusion? I haven't been in any accidents or anything. I'm perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Look, Doctor, are you always this… thorough with everyone? It feels like you're trying to find something that isn’t there. Frankly, it’s a bit insulting. Is this going to take much longer? I have a report to finalize this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, your history is… sparse. It is my professional obligation to inquire about potential risk factors. Now, have you ever shared needles for any reason?
PATIENT: Shared needles?! Are you serious, Doctor? What kind of question is that? I've never touched a needle in my life, except when I got my flu shot! I am a respectable Compliance Officer, for goodness sake! That’s a rather… accusatory line of questioning, don't you think? This is becoming quite unpleasant. I think I’ve answered enough questions about things that are frankly ridiculous. What exactly are you implying?
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I am obligated to ask about all potential risk factors, regardless of your profession or perceived respectability. Now, let's discuss your sexual history. Have you ever had unprotected sexual intercourse?
PATIENT: Unprotected… Now you've gone too far! I came here for a simple test, at my wife’s insistence, and now you’re asking me… personal questions? This is completely inappropriate! I have a wife! A good wife! This is… outrageous! I demand to speak to your supervisor! You have no right to pry into my private life! This whole thing is a waste of my time, and frankly, it's deeply offensive. I’m leaving.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. As you wish. I trust you will inform your wife of your… decision. .
