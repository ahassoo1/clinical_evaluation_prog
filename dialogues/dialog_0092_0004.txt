DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s just a check-up, really. Routine immunizations, the nurse said. Just keeping up with things, you know? I like to stay on top of it if I can.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Fornes. Preventative care is very important. The nurse did mention a routine check-up and immunizations. Before we get to those, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Sure. Overall… pretty good, I think. I stay pretty active, help my husband with some building projects now and then. Not as much as I used to, but enough to keep me moving. No major problems, thankfully. I haven’t been really sick in… oh, goodness, years, I guess. Just the usual colds here and there. Do you want me to list any medications I take? I don't take much, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Staying active is wonderful. And yes, please, if you could list any medications you’re currently taking, even over-the-counter ones, that would be helpful. Also, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Okay, let me think… um, I take a daily vitamin, just a basic one. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I’ll take ibuprofen. Just when I need it, though, not every day. As for allergies… not really. I used to think I was allergic to some kinds of pollen when I was a kid, but I haven’t had any problems with that in ages. Nothing serious, anyway. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Fornes. Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a daily vitamin. No known drug allergies. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, when I was younger, I had pretty bad strep throat a couple of times. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, measles, mumps… but nothing major. A few years back, I was diagnosed with arthritis in my hands, that’s why I take the ibuprofen sometimes. And… let me see… oh! I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. That was… unpleasant. But I’ve been doing fine since then. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I sometimes forget things.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Fornes, it’s perfectly normal to forget things. So, arthritis, gallbladder removal ten years ago, and a history of strep throat and childhood illnesses. Do you recall the specific type of arthritis diagnosed?
PATIENT: You know, that's a good question. The doctor just said “arthritis” and gave me some cream and pills. I don’t think he got into specifics, honestly. It’s mostly in my hands, and flares up when it’s cold or if I’ve been using them a lot. I don’t remember him saying what kind it was. It's never been really bad, thankfully, just uncomfortable. I mostly manage it with the ibuprofen and trying not to overdo things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fornes, so arthritis in your hands, managed with ibuprofen. We can document that as unspecified arthritis for now. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mom… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my dad, he had some heart trouble when he got older. He had a pretty rough time with it. And my grandma on my mother’s side, she had diabetes. I think that's about it, honestly. Nobody else that I can recall had anything major. We weren't a family that talked about illnesses a lot, if you know what I mean. More of a keep-it-to-yourself kind of thing. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Fornes. High blood pressure in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and diabetes in your grandmother. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history... Well, I've been married to my husband, George, for 35 years now. We live here in town, pretty quiet life. He does most of the building, I do the paperwork, that sort of thing. I don't smoke, never have. I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not every night. I used to be really involved in the local Tlingit community, but my arthritis makes it hard to get around as much these days. Mostly, we just enjoy each other's company and try to stay busy. Is there anything specific you need to know?
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Ms. Fornes. 35 years of marriage is wonderful. No smoking, occasional wine, and a history of community involvement. Now, just to finish up the history portion, have you noticed any changes in your health recently – any new symptoms, like weight loss, fatigue, or pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I think I've just been feeling a little more tired lately, but honestly, that could just be the weather. It's been so hot! And, like I said, the arthritis flares up now and then, but that's pretty normal. Nothing new, as far as I can tell. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know? I haven’t lost any weight or anything like that. I’ve been eating pretty normally. Is that helpful? I do worry sometimes that I'm just slowing down.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Fornes. A little fatigue, possibly related to the weather, and occasional arthritis flares. Alright, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go right ahead, Doctor. I don’t mind at all. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out. Sounds are clear bilaterally. Heart rate is regular at 72 beats per minute. Next, I'm going to take a look at your throat. Please open your mouth and say "ah." Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Some mild swelling and tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal joints bilaterally. Range of motion is slightly limited. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes and test your strength. Reflexes are 2+ and strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Everything seems within normal limits overall, but the mild swelling and tenderness in your hands is consistent with arthritis. I’m documenting these findings now.
PATIENT: Okay. That all sounds… well, about right, I guess. My hands do bother me sometimes, so it’s not surprising to hear that. Is it something I should be worried about? Or is this just the arthritis acting up? I just don’t want it to get worse. I like being able to use my hands, you know?
DOCTOR: That's a valid concern, Ms. Fornes. The findings are consistent with arthritis, and based on the exam, it doesn’t appear to be anything acutely alarming. However, given the swelling and tenderness, and your concern about it getting worse, I’d like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. These tests will help rule out other potential causes of joint pain, like rheumatoid arthritis, and give us a baseline to monitor the progression of your arthritis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps to know for sure, then I’m all for it. I’d rather be safe than sorry, I suppose. What kind of blood tests are we talking about? And where would I go to get them done? I don’t have insurance, so I’m a little worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, Ms. Fornes. I'm ordering a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , an erythrocyte sedimentation rate , and a C-reactive protein test. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and inflammation levels. You can get these tests done at the lab just across the street, at Suburban Diagnostics. I’ll provide you with a lab requisition form. They do have a financial assistance program for uninsured patients, and I’m happy to write a note explaining your situation if needed. The cost should be around $150-$200, depending on the specific tests and the lab’s rates. Once you have the results, you can either have them sent directly to my office, or you can pick them up and bring them with you. Once I have the results, we can discuss them and develop a plan for managing your arthritis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable, I think. I'm glad to hear they have a financial assistance program. And yes, having them sent directly to your office would be easiest. So, just to be clear, that’s a CBC, CMP, ESR, and CRP test at Suburban Diagnostics, and they can send the results to you. Is there anything else I need to do or know before I go? I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. Yes, just bring this form with you to Suburban Diagnostics. There's no specific preparation needed for these tests, you can eat and drink normally beforehand. And as I mentioned, there’s no specific rush, but the sooner we have the results, the sooner we can discuss them. In the meantime, you can continue to manage your arthritis as you have been – ibuprofen as needed and try not to overdo things. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like severe pain, swelling, redness, or fever, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very helpful, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so thoroughly. I’ll go get those tests done as soon as I can. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I look forward to seeing you again once we have the lab results. Have a good day, and take care.
