DOCTOR: Hi Nicky, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's… alright to meet you, I suppose. It’s this bruising. I’ve been noticing it more and more, and frankly, it’s a bit concerning. I’m on a blood thinner, you see, and I just want to make sure everything is as it should be. It's just… well, you know how it is with these things. One little bump and bam, a purple mess.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Bruising easily when you're on a blood thinner is definitely something we want to check out. It’s good you’re being proactive about it. First, can you tell me a little more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Alright. Well, it’s not like I’m walking into walls or anything. It’s usually just… small things. Bumping into furniture, a slightly harder-than-usual handshake… things like that. And the bruises themselves… they seem bigger than they used to be, and they take longer to go away. Honestly, I feel like a child sometimes. I haven't fallen or had any real injuries, if that’s what you’re getting at. It’s just… bothersome, and a bit undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, it sounds like the bruising is happening with minor trauma and is more significant and prolonged than you’ve experienced before. And it’s causing you some concern, which is completely understandable. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me when you first noticed this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It wasn’t sudden, exactly. It’s been… gradual, I suppose. Maybe… three, four months ago? It started with just a little more color than usual after a bump, and then it just… escalated. It’s hard to pinpoint a specific date, honestly. I don't sit around charting my bruises, Doctor. I have better things to do. It’s just been… steadily worse, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand, you don’t need to be tracking it! “Steadily worse” is good information. And it’s helpful to know it’s been happening for about three or four months. Now, just to be thorough, are you noticing any bruising in unusual places – like your back, abdomen, or anywhere you wouldn't normally expect?
PATIENT: No, not really. It's mostly on my arms and legs, you know, the usual places where you’d expect a bump to cause a bruise. I haven't woken up covered in them or anything. That would be… alarming. And I haven’t felt any pain, thankfully. It’s just the visual aspect, really. It’s… unsightly. I'm a pathologist, Doctor, I notice these things. A man shouldn't look like he’s been in a boxing match after a gentle afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know it's localized to your arms and legs and there’s no unexplained bruising. And no pain is also reassuring. You’re a pathologist, so you’re observant – that’s helpful! Now, let’s talk about the blood thinner you’re on. What medication are you taking, and what’s the dosage?
PATIENT: It’s… Warfarin. I’ve been on it for… oh, must be eight years now, since the… well, never mind that. The dosage is… let me see… it’s 5 milligrams, taken every evening. Sometimes Dr. Abernathy adjusts it, depending on my INR results, of course. He's retired now, though. A good man, Abernathy. Knew his stuff. I've been seeing a nurse practitioner since he left, and she's… adequate. Though I do wish I still had his expertise.
DOCTOR: Okay, 5 milligrams of Warfarin daily, with adjustments based on your INR. And you’re currently followed by a nurse practitioner. That’s good to know. Do you know what your most recent INR result was?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. They just tell me if it needs adjusting. They don't really explain things to me anymore. They say "increase it" or "decrease it" and I do as I’m told. I’m a doctor myself, Doctor, I don’t need a lecture on blood coagulation every time they change the dose. It’s… condescending, frankly. I just want to know why I’m bruising more. Is it the medication? Is something else going on?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Nicky. It’s reasonable to want a clear explanation, especially as a medical professional yourself. It sounds like communication hasn’t been ideal. Okay, let's set that aside for a moment. Since we don’t have your recent INR, we’ll need to check that. I also want to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else that might be contributing to the bruising. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But don't poke and prod unnecessarily. I’ve spent my life examining other people, Doctor. I know when something isn’t right. And I assure you, this isn't some mysterious ailment. It’s probably just the Warfarin. It’s always something with these medications, isn’t it? Still, I suppose I’ll let you have a look. Just be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be gentle. And I understand your skepticism. We’ll start with a quick look at your arms and legs, checking for any unusual bruising or swelling. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. It’s standard procedure, and I’ll explain everything as I go. I see some bruising here, as you mentioned. It looks mostly superficial, but the variation in color suggests some are older than others. Do you recall any specific incidents that might have caused these?
PATIENT: No, I do not. That’s the problem, Doctor! It’s not like I’m purposefully walking into things. One moment everything is fine, the next… purple. It's just… appearing. Honestly, it’s quite unsettling. And I’ve been more careful lately, trying to avoid any bumps. It makes no difference. It’s like my skin has become… fragile. And don't tell me it’s my age. I’m perfectly healthy for a man my age. I still walk three miles a day, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I’m not dismissing it at all. It's good you're active. And I certainly wouldn’t attribute this to age alone. No tenderness with palpation, which is good. Now, let’s take a look at your legs. No edema in your ankles, which is also reassuring. Heart and lungs sound clear. Based on this quick exam, there aren’t any obvious signs of anything else going on. However, since you're on Warfarin and experiencing increased bruising, it's important to get a blood test to check your INR and also a complete blood count to rule out any other potential causes. Would you be okay with getting those tests done today?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it doesn’t take all day. I have… things to do, you know. I suppose a blood test is the logical next step. But I still maintain it’s the Warfarin. It always is. And make sure they don’t draw too much blood. I’m not a fan of needles, you know. A professional hazard, I suppose, but still… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We’ll get the tests done as quickly as possible, and I’ll make a note to the phlebotomist to be gentle. We’ll just need a routine blood draw. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d also like to review your medication list and ask a few questions about your lifestyle, just to get a more complete picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. But don’t ask me about my diet. I eat perfectly fine. And I’m not about to start detailing my daily activities to a… a younger doctor. I’ve lived a full life, Doctor. I think I have a good grasp on what’s going on with my body. But, fine. Ask your questions. Let’s get this over with. The sooner I know it's the Warfarin, the sooner I can… well, complain about it to someone else.
DOCTOR: Fair enough. I just want to cover all the bases, and I respect your experience. Let’s start with your other medications. Are you taking anything besides Warfarin – any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I take a multivitamin, yes. A basic one. And occasionally, ibuprofen for a headache. Not often, mind you. Perhaps once a month. And… that’s it. I don’t believe in filling my body with unnecessary chemicals. I’m a pathologist, remember? I know what those things do. No, just the Warfarin and the occasional ibuprofen. And the multivitamin, of course. A sensible precaution.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen, and Warfarin. That’s helpful to know. Now, regarding your lifestyle… do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Not every night, mind you. I’m not an alcoholic, Doctor. I enjoy a good Cabernet Sauvignon, that’s all. A civilized habit. And I certainly don’t drink to excess. It’s good for the heart, in moderation. Or so I’ve read. I assure you, my alcohol consumption is not contributing to this… bruising problem.
DOCTOR: I wasn’t implying that it was, just gathering information. And a glass of wine with dinner is perfectly reasonable. Now, do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not. Never have, never will. Disgusting habit. Another unnecessary chemical. I lost my father to lung cancer, you know. I have no desire to repeat that tragedy. I’ve always been very careful about my health. Despite this… unfortunate bruising situation, I assure you I lead a healthy lifestyle. I walk, I eat well, I drink in moderation, and I certainly don’t smoke. Is that satisfactory, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you're very conscientious about your health, which is excellent. Now, one last question. Have you noticed any bleeding anywhere else – nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your stool or urine?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. No nosebleeds, my gums are perfectly healthy, and… well, you can imagine how I would notice anything like that. No, thankfully, it’s just the bruising. It’s… frustrating. It’s unsightly. It’s inconvenient. And frankly, it’s a bit alarming. But no, no other bleeding. Just the bruising. Are we done now, Doctor? I’m starting to feel… lightheaded. Probably from the phlebotomist’s needle.
DOCTOR: Yes, we're almost done. Feeling lightheaded is good to know, let's have you sit up slowly. Okay, based on everything you've told me, and the physical exam, the most likely explanation for your increased bruising is the Warfarin, possibly in combination with a slightly higher INR. However, we need the blood test results to confirm that. While we wait for those results, I'm going to order a repeat INR to get a more accurate picture. And I'll also ask the lab to run a complete blood count just to rule out any other potential issues. In the meantime, if you notice any significant bleeding – a nosebleed that won’t stop, blood in your stool or urine, or any unusual pain – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. I suppose not. I mean, I already know what the problem is. It’s the Warfarin. It always is. And I’m sure the nurse practitioner will adjust the dosage, as she always does. I just… I wish they would explain things better. I’m a doctor, you know. I deserve a little respect. And a little explanation. But, no. I suppose I'll just wait for the results. And complain about it to my colleagues. And… yes. That will have to do. Is there anything I need to do? Other than sit here and wait? And perhaps schedule an appointment with a good lawyer? Just in case this bruising gets any worse?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Nicky. You absolutely deserve a clear explanation, and I apologize that hasn't been provided. I’ll make a note in your chart to emphasize the importance of clear communication going forward. For now, there's nothing you need to do besides avoid any activities that could cause trauma. And no, you shouldn't need to schedule an appointment with a lawyer just yet. Let's see what the blood tests reveal first. I'll have the phlebotomist come in and draw the blood now. And I'll let you know the results as soon as they come back. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… get it over with. I have things to do. And frankly, I’m starting to feel rather unwell. Perhaps it’s the anticipation. Or the phlebotomist’s needle. Whatever it is, let’s just get this over with. And please, tell the phlebotomist to be gentle. I’m a patient, not a pincushion.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll let the phlebotomist know. And I’ll be right back with the results as soon as they’re available. .
