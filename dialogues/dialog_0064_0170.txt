DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for a life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out before they approve everything, you know? Gotta get a medical exam done. I'd like to get this over with as quick as possible if we could.
DOCTOR: Right, a life insurance exam. Perfectly understandable. We'll get through this as efficiently as we can. Just a routine check-up, really. To start, can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. I’m okay, I guess. I work a lot, managing the lodging place. It keeps me busy. Not much time for getting sick, honestly. I try to eat alright, but it's hard sometimes with the hours. No big problems, though. I haven’t been to the doctor in a while, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Working long hours can certainly take a toll. And it does matter that you haven't been in for a check-up recently, just so we have a good baseline. Let's go through a few things, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart trouble, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never been told I have any of those. My mom had some problems with her blood sugar when she got older, but I don’t think I inherited that. Honestly, I don’t really keep up with all that medical stuff. I just… feel fine, usually. A little tired, maybe, but that’s the job.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. And just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a kid, I broke my arm pretty bad playing around. Had to get a cast, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… no, I don't think so. Nothing serious, anyway. Definitely haven’t been in the hospital as an adult. That I remember, at least. It was a while ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins, if that counts. Multivitamin, mostly. And sometimes I take something for aches and pains after work, you know, ibuprofen or something like that. Nothing regularly, though. Only when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamins and occasional ibuprofen. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. My wife used to always tease me about my stomach, said I could eat a whole cow! She’s… well, that’s another story. But no allergies, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good. Now, just to finish up this part, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… what does that even mean? I work. A lot. At the lodging place. I don't really have time for hobbies or anything. I used to fish a little bit, but haven’t done that in years. I don’t really drink much, maybe a beer now and then. And I… don’t smoke. Never have. Is that what you mean? Just work, pretty much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I meant. Thank you. That gives me a good picture. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, would you mind if I check your height and weight?
PATIENT: No, go ahead. Whatever you need to do. Just wanna get this over with, you know? I think I told the insurance lady already, but I’m about six feet tall…ish. And… I’ve put on a few pounds lately, unfortunately. Don’t ask. Stress, probably.
DOCTOR: Of course. No judgment here. It’s helpful to have accurate numbers. Let's just get this done. Okay, it looks like you're 6’0” and 215 pounds. That's alright, we'll use that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Do you mind if I take your blood pressure as well?
PATIENT: Six feet even, huh? Close enough. Okay, go ahead with the heart and lungs and… whatever else you need to do. Blood pressure, sure. The faster we finish, the better. Just try not to poke too much, alright? I’m not a big fan of needles.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I promise. Okay, heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let me just check your reflexes quickly... and a quick look in your ears and throat. Alright, everything seems… within normal limits overall. We might want to repeat the blood pressure reading in a bit, just to be sure. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a basic blood panel, just to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and things like that. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood panel… alright. Sounds… thorough. Look, Doc, is this gonna take much longer? I got things I gotta get back to. And is that blood pressure number bad? You said “a little elevated”, but… is that something I should worry about? I just wanna know if I'm gonna need a whole bunch of tests and pills and stuff. I really just came for the insurance exam.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Putney. It's not going to take much longer. The blood panel is relatively quick. As for your blood pressure, 140/90 is a little high, but it's not an emergency. It could be elevated due to stress, or it could be something we need to monitor. That's why I recommend the blood panel. It’ll give us a more complete picture of your overall health. It doesn’t necessarily mean you'll need tests or pills, but it's important to be informed. We can discuss the results once they come back and decide on a plan if needed. It sounds like you're busy, and I respect that. The blood draw shouldn’t take long, and we can schedule a quick follow-up to discuss the results, if you'd like. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, alright. Blood panel, then. But quick, you promise? And can we do the follow-up by phone? I really don’t have much time to be running back and forth to the doctor’s office. And… is this gonna affect my insurance approval? I really need this insurance. Just tell me straight. Is this gonna cause problems?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We’ll make it as quick as possible. And yes, we can definitely do the follow-up by phone. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. As for your insurance approval… it’s difficult to say for sure. The insurance company will review your medical records, including the blood panel results. Elevated blood pressure could potentially cause some questions, but it doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll deny your approval. It depends on their specific guidelines. I’ll provide a comprehensive report with my findings, and you can share that with them. I will document everything accurately and honestly to help support your application. I can’t guarantee approval, but I will do everything I can to assist you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Just… get it done. Let’s get the blood drawn. And… tell the nurse to call me as soon as possible, okay? I got a business to run.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll take good care of you. And I'll make a note for her to call you as soon as the results are available. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Putney. We’ll get this sorted out quickly.
