DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Look, I don’t have all day, you know. It’s about… well, it’s about this. <gestures vaguely at own body> I just… don’t like what I see in the mirror anymore. It’s not what it used to be, and frankly, it's upsetting. I want somethin' done about it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It can be distressing when we don’t feel quite ourselves. “Not what it used to be” can mean many things. Could you be a little more specific about what’s troubling you?
PATIENT: Specific? Specific?! <Scoffs> Look at me! Everything is droopin'! The skin… it’s loose. And… and the stomach. It used to be flat as a board, strong from years of workin' the pile driver. Now… now it’s… wobbly. I want it fixed. Tightened up, you understand? Like it used to be. Is that specific enough for you? I don't need a lecture on aging, either. I know I'm not a young man.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so direct, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you’re concerned about changes in your skin elasticity and abdominal contour. We certainly can discuss options. To best understand what might be appropriate, could you tell me if this has been a gradual change over time, or something more sudden?
PATIENT: Gradual? Sudden? <Frowns, tapping a bony finger on his knee> It’s been… years. Years of hard work, you see? Years of bein' outside in the sun, rain, everything. Pile drivin' ain’t no office job, you know. It started slow, I suppose. A little sag here, a little wobble there. But lately... lately it's gotten worse. Much worse. I just want it gone. I'm not askin' for miracles, just... somethin' done. Do you even do somethin' like that here? I don't want to be sent all over town.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler, and I assure you we can explore some options here at the clinic. It sounds like the changes you’re describing may be related to sun exposure and the natural effects of aging on the skin and muscle tone. Before we discuss potential procedures, I’d like to get a more complete picture of your health. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? <Raises an eyebrow> What for? You think a few aches and pains from workin' is gonna change anything? Look, I’m a strong man, always have been. Never been sick a day in my life, 'cept for a little flu here and there. I don’t need a whole examination. I just want this fixed! But… alright, alright. Ask your questions. But make it quick. I got things to do. Don't go askin' about childhood illnesses, I barely remember yesterday!
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Trendler. I'll keep it brief. Just a few basics to ensure any procedure is safe and appropriate for you. First, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. No. Never had any allergies. Not to bee stings, not to dust, not to nothin'. I worked outside all my life, you understand? Built up a resistance to everything. Dust, pollen, whatever. No allergies. Next question. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? <Scoffs> You think I need medications?! I'm a strong man! I take a little cod liver oil sometimes for the joints, that's it. Old man's remedy, you understand? Nothing fancy. Just the cod liver oil. And maybe a little pain reliever if I really overdo it with the gardening, but that's rare. Mostly I just tough it out. Now, are we gettin' anywhere with this, or are you just tryin' to waste my time?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Cod liver oil and occasional pain relievers. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses? <Pauses, tapping his chin> Let me think… <grimaces> I broke my arm once, fallin' off a roof when I was a young man, fixin' it after a storm. And… and I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That’s about it. Nothin' serious. Just the arm and the appendix. Now, are we finally gettin' to the fixin' part? I don't see how any of this matters. I'm a strong man, always have been.
DOCTOR: Broken arm, appendix removal. Good. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: <Sighs dramatically> Family medical conditions? <Rolls his eyes> Honestly? I barely knew my father. He died young, workin’ too hard, they said. Mother… she lived to be old, but she always complained about her arthritis. That’s about all I remember. My sister… she had high blood pressure, I think. But that’s it. Mostly, they were just… hard-workin' people. Not much time for doctors. Are you sure you need to know all this? It feels like I’m givin' you my whole life story! I just want this fixed. <gestures again at his stomach>
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Just a few more questions, then we can discuss options. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? <Scoffs> Absolutely not! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgustin' habit. No, no smokin' here. Always been a clean livin' man. Clean air, hard work, that's what keeps you healthy. Next question. I really don’t have time for this. Are we getting anywhere? I'm starting to think you just want to ask questions all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. No smoking. And finally, how much alcohol do you typically drink in a week?
PATIENT: <Raises an eyebrow, looking slightly offended> Alcohol? <Scoffs> Now you're askin' about my drinkin'? I have a small glass of rum sometimes, with dinner. That’s it! A small glass. Helps me relax after a hard day’s work. Not like those fellas you see down at the bar, drinkin' all night. Just a small glass. And honestly, I’m startin’ to get annoyed. This feels like an interrogation. Are we going to talk about fixin' this, or just my whole life? I'm a respectable man!
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Mr. Trendler. I assure you, I am simply trying to gather the information necessary to determine the best course of action for you. A small glass of rum occasionally. Good to know. Now, to address your concerns… you mentioned dissatisfaction with the loose skin and abdominal contour. Have you noticed any other changes, such as weight loss or fatigue?
PATIENT: <Grumbling> Fine. Fine. No, no weight loss. I always been a solid build, you see? Strong. And no fatigue, either. I still do all the work in the garden. Still climb the ladder. Still… still get things done. <pauses, looking down at his stomach again> It’s just… everything’s droopin’. It’s embarrassing, you understand? I used to be… proud of my body. Strong. Useful. Now… now it just feels… old. <sighs heavily> So, can you fix it or not? I’m not gettin’ any younger. Are there… are there things you can do? What kind of things? I don't want to hear about diets and exercise. I’ve done those! I want a real fix.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant emotional impact from these changes, and you'd like to explore more direct solutions. There are several options we can consider, but it’s important to be realistic about what’s achievable. Procedures like abdominoplasty—a “tummy tuck”—can tighten the abdominal skin and muscle. There are also options for skin tightening using various energy-based devices. However, these are surgical procedures with risks and recovery times. Before we discuss specifics, I need to do a physical examination to assess your overall health and the extent of the changes. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: <Frowns deeply> Surgery? <Shakes head slowly> I don’t like the sound of surgery. I’ve never had surgery, except for the appendix when I was a boy, and I don’t want to start now. What about those… those energy things? The skin tightenin’ you mentioned? Is that less… drastic? I don’t want to be cut open. And what about the cost? I’m a retired man, you understand. I don’t have money to throw around. Tell me about these energy things, and how much they cost. And no long lectures, please. Just the facts.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. Let’s focus on the non-surgical options first. The skin tightening procedures use technologies like radiofrequency or ultrasound to heat the deeper layers of the skin, stimulating collagen production and resulting in a tighter, firmer appearance. These procedures are less invasive than surgery, with minimal downtime, typically involving a series of treatments spaced several weeks apart. However, the results are more subtle than with surgery, and they may not be suitable for significant skin laxity. As for cost, the price varies depending on the area treated and the number of sessions required. A typical session for the abdomen could range from $800 to $2000. Before I can give you a more accurate estimate and determine if you’re a suitable candidate, I need to examine the skin and underlying tissue. Would you mind if I did a quick assessment?
PATIENT: <Sighs dramatically> $800 to $2000? Per session?! That's… a lot of money. <Runs a hand over his chin> Fine. Fine, I’ll let you look. But make it quick. And don't poke and prod too much. I don't want any unnecessary pain. Just… tell me what you see, and whether it's worth spendin' all that money. I'm a practical man, you understand. I need to know if it'll actually work. <Gestures towards his stomach again> Just look, and tell me the truth. And no promises, alright? No promises that it'll magically fix everything. Just the facts. <Sits back in the chair, looking skeptical> Go ahead. But be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I’ll be as gentle as possible. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. Alright, Mr. Trendler, I'm just assessing the skin elasticity and the amount of excess tissue. <Palpates gently> The skin does appear to have lost some elasticity, as you’ve described. There’s a moderate amount of excess skin, and some looseness in the underlying abdominal muscles. Skin thickness is… approximately 2.5 centimeters in this area. <Marks on a chart> Based on this quick assessment, you would likely benefit from a series of radiofrequency treatments. However, I recommend a consultation with a specialist in non-surgical body contouring to discuss the best approach and realistic expectations. I can provide a referral. It would also be prudent to review your overall health status with your primary care physician before proceeding with any treatment, to ensure there are no underlying contraindications. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: <Frowns> Radiofrequency… <grimaces> Sounds complicated. And now you want me to see another doctor? And another one after that? This is getting ridiculous. I came here for a fix, not a referral to a whole team of specialists! <Sighs heavily> Look, I'm an old man, alright? I don't have the time or the energy to run around to a dozen different doctors. Is there anything you can do here, right now? Anything at all? Even a little somethin' to tighten things up? I’m willin’ to pay, but I don't want to spend a fortune on somethin’ that might not even work. Just… be honest with me. And don’t try to sell me on a bunch of complicated procedures. Just tell me what I can reasonably expect. <Looks at Dr. Pirl expectantly> And no more referrals, alright? I need a solution, not a wild goose chase.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I truly do. You’re right, running around to multiple specialists is not ideal, and I apologize for that. In the interest of providing something immediate, we can offer a series of skin tightening treatments using a lower-intensity radiofrequency device that we have in-house. It won't provide the dramatic results of a more advanced procedure, but it can offer a subtle improvement in skin tone and firmness. We could do a trial session to see if you notice a difference, and then discuss continuing if you’re satisfied. The cost per session is $350. A course of six sessions might provide a noticeable improvement. However, please understand that this is not a substitute for a more comprehensive treatment, and the results will be limited. Would you be interested in trying a trial session?
PATIENT: <Pauses, considering> $350 a session…<grimaces> It’s still a lot of money, but… better than a thousand dollars a pop. And a trial session… Alright. Fine. I’ll try a trial session. But if I don’t see any difference, I’m not payin’ for any more. Understand? No pressure, no sales pitch. Just a simple trial. <Sits forward, looking slightly apprehensive> Just… be gentle. And tell me exactly what you’re doin’ before you do it. I don’t want any surprises. And no promises, alright? No promises that it’ll magically fix everything. Just tell me what I can reasonably expect. <Takes a deep breath> Go ahead. But make it quick. I haven’t got all day. And be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I completely understand. No pressure, no surprises. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I'm applying this gel to ensure good contact between the device and your skin. It's just a standard coupling agent, perfectly safe. Now, I’m going to use this device to deliver radiofrequency energy to the deeper layers of your skin. You may feel a warm sensation, similar to a hot stone massage. It shouldn't be painful, but please let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort. The energy stimulates collagen production, which will gradually improve the tone and firmness of your skin. It’s a very subtle process, and the results will become more apparent over several weeks. We’ll do this section now, and then I'll assess your reaction before proceeding with the rest of your abdomen. How does that sound?
PATIENT: <Grimaces slightly as the device is applied> Warm… yes, it’s warm. A bit… tingly, too. Not painful, not yet. But it’s… strange. Like somethin’ is buzzin’ under my skin. <Closes eyes, taking a deep breath> Just… be careful. And don't spend too long on one spot. I don't want to get burned. <Pauses, then speaks cautiously> It's… alright, so far. A bit uncomfortable, but manageable. Just… let me know if it's getting too hot. And don't expect miracles, alright? I've seen enough of those in my life. Just a little tighten-up, that's all I'm askin’ for. Just a little tighten-up. Now, keep goin’, but gently. Very gently.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I’ve reduced the intensity a bit, just to ensure your comfort. I'll continue treating this section now, and I'll monitor your skin closely throughout the procedure. Alright, I'm just assessing your skin now. There’s a slight redness, which is perfectly normal. No signs of burning or irritation. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: <Opens eyes slowly, feeling his abdomen> Redness… yes, I can feel it. A bit warm still. But no burnin’, not yet. And… it doesn’t feel too bad. A bit uncomfortable, but… I’ve had worse. <Pauses, considering> It’s… alright. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just… alright. <Sighs> I don’t know. It’s hard to tell if it’s doin’ anything. Maybe I need a few more sessions. But don’t expect miracles, alright? Just a little tighten-up, that’s all. <Looks at Dr. Pirl expectantly> So, what do you think? Should we keep goin’? Or am I wastin’ my time? Be honest with me, alright? I’m an old man, I don’t have time for games.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re not feeling dramatic results immediately, Mr. Trendler. This is a subtle process, and it takes time for the collagen to rebuild. The slight redness is a good sign, indicating that the energy is being delivered effectively. Based on my assessment, and given your comfort level, I recommend continuing the treatment on the remaining areas of your abdomen. We can complete the session today, and then discuss scheduling follow-up appointments to assess your progress. However, I want to reiterate that this is not a substitute for more comprehensive procedures. A series of six sessions may provide a noticeable improvement, but the results will be limited. Are you comfortable proceeding with that understanding?
PATIENT: <Sighs heavily> Limited results… that’s what I figured. <Rubs his chin, considering> Well, I’ve come this far, haven’t I? And it’s not painful, not yet. <Looks at Dr. Pirl with a resigned expression> Alright. Fine. Let’s finish the session. Complete the abdomen. But if I don’t see any difference after a few more sessions… I’m not payin’ for any more. Understand? No exceptions. <Pauses, then adds cautiously> And be gentle. Very gentle. I don’t want to get burned. Just… finish it. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I understand completely. No exceptions. I will continue the treatment on the remaining areas of your abdomen, and I will be extremely gentle. Alright, Mr. Trendler, we’ve completed the session. There’s some redness, which is perfectly normal and will subside within a few hours. Please apply a cool compress if you experience any discomfort. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your progress. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: <Sits up slowly, feeling his abdomen> No. No, I think that’s enough for today. Just… let me get home and rest. <Pauses, considering> Schedule the follow-up appointment for two weeks, alright? But don't expect miracles. Just… see if it’s done anything. <Sighs heavily> And no more treatments unless I see a difference. Understand? No exceptions. <Looks at Dr. Pirl with a resigned expression> Alright. I’m done. Let’s get this over with. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I need a nap.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I have scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, and I will make a note in your chart regarding your expectations. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before then. Thank you for your patience, and I hope you have a restful afternoon.
