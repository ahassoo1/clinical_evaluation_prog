DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s this hand. It shakes. Been happening… well, a while now. Not a big deal, really. Just annoying. I was hoping to get it over with quickly, if you don't mind. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: “A while now” is rather vague, Mr. Baide. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, doc, do I look like I keep a calendar of my tremors? It's been… months, I guess. Maybe longer. Before… before Martha passed, definitely. She kept saying something about it, but… women, always noticing things. It wasn’t bothering me. Now it's a little worse, I suppose. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Months, worsening since your wife passed. And it’s the hand… which hand specifically?
PATIENT: This one. The right one. Always the right one. It’s… inconvenient, especially when I’m trying to eat. Soup is a disaster, let me tell you. Though, honestly, everything’s a disaster these days.
DOCTOR: Do you notice the shaking at rest, or only when you’re trying to do something – like eating, as you mentioned?
PATIENT: Rest? What's "at rest"? I mean, when I'm not doing something, it's usually… fine. It’s when I try to, you know, hold a fork, or write a check… things get wobbly. It's not like it’s constant. I just wish it would stop when I need it to, is all.
DOCTOR: So, primarily with intentional movement. And has it been gradually worsening, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. It wasn't a thing one day and then BAM, like a lightning bolt. It just… got more noticeable. Though, to be fair, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Maybe it was worse before and I just didn't pay attention. Martha would probably have a whole timeline for you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? Look, I'm eighty years old! Everything aches, I'm tired all the time, and I forget where I put my keys. Is that what you mean? You want a list of everything that's wrong with me? That’ll take all day.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Baide. I'm asking about new symptoms that have come on around the same time as the shaking. For example, have you noticed any stiffness in your muscles, any changes in your balance, or any difficulty speaking?
PATIENT: Stiffness… hmm. Maybe a little in my fingers sometimes, but I chalked that up to arthritis. Balance is fine, I think. I still walk, don't I? And speaking... well, I'm talking to you, aren't I? Though my daughter keeps saying I repeat myself. Probably just old age. Look, are we getting anywhere with this hand or what?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll need you to extend your arms in front of you, palms up. And please try to relax.
PATIENT: Ugh, more poking and prodding? Fine, fine. But make it quick, alright? I've got… things to do. Don’t expect miracles with this coordination, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide. I’m just assessing your reflexes and muscle tone. The tremor is most pronounced in your right hand, and appears to be a resting tremor. Your muscle tone is slightly increased, but not significantly. Reflexes are normal. I also note a slight bradykinesia - a slowness of movement - on the right side.
PATIENT: Brady-what now? Look, doc, I didn’t come here for a vocabulary lesson. Is it serious? Am I… dying? Just tell me straight. Don't beat around the bush with fancy words.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, it's not a matter of “dying.” However, the symptoms you've described, combined with what I'm observing during the exam, are suggestive of Parkinson's disease. It's a progressive neurological disorder. We’ll need further testing to confirm, of course. I’m ordering a DATscan, which is a type of imaging test. And I'd like to consult with a neurologist.
PATIENT: Parkinson's… like that actor? The one with the shaking? Ugh. That’s just great. Just what I needed. Another thing to worry about. Look, is there… anything I can do? A pill? Something to stop the shaking? I don’t want to end up like… him.
DOCTOR: There are medications that can help manage the symptoms, Mr. Baide. They won't cure the disease, but they can significantly improve your quality of life. We typically start with a dopamine agonist, like pramipexole. And physical therapy is also very important to maintain your strength and balance. I'm sending a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. I'll also write a prescription for the pramipexole, starting with a low dose. We'll monitor your response and adjust as needed. Here’s the referral information and the prescription details. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, more doctors. Fine. Just… try not to give me anything too complicated, alright? My daughter handles most of my pills as it is. She’s a good girl, always fussing over me. So, I take a pill… and see another doctor… and then what? Will I… fall a lot?
DOCTOR: The pill, pramipexole, will help with the shaking and stiffness. It's important to take it as prescribed, and to be aware of potential side effects, such as nausea or dizziness. We'll discuss those in detail. As for falling, it is a risk with Parkinson’s, especially as the disease progresses, which is why physical therapy is so important. It will help with your balance and coordination. I'm also going to recommend a home safety evaluation to identify potential hazards and make recommendations for modifications. And I’ll give you information about Parkinson’s support groups. It’s important to have a support network. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Support groups? I don't need a support group. I've survived eighty years, I think I can handle a little shaking. Look, doc, I appreciate you trying, but honestly, I just want a pill that will make it stop. That’s all. And if it doesn't work, well… I guess I'll just deal with it. Is that too much to ask? I've got appointments all afternoon, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration, but Parkinson’s is a complex condition. There is no “cure,” and medication alone may not be sufficient. It’s important to be realistic about expectations. The goal of treatment is to manage your symptoms and maintain your quality of life as best as possible. I’ve provided you with information on the medication and the neurologist referral. I strongly encourage you to follow through with these recommendations. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s enough. Just… let me get this prescription and get out of here. I've got things to do. And frankly, I’m tired of talking about shaking. Thank you… I guess.
