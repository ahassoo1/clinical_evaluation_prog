DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Kalinski, you say? It’s nice to meet you as well. Um... well, my joints. They’re just…stiff. Especially in the mornings. It’s not a bad pain, just…uncomfortable. I forget what I even told the lady on the phone, to be honest. It’s been going on for…a while now, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't recall the specifics you mentioned to the receptionist. We'll go over everything together. So, stiffness in your joints, particularly in the mornings. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, I wake up, and it’s hard to…move. Like I’ve been laying very still for a long time. My fingers, mostly. And my knees, sometimes. It takes a bit to…loosen up. A bit of walking helps, I think. Or just…doing things. I don't really do much anymore, though. Not since…well, never mind that. It just…takes a while to feel normal. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Voner. You’re explaining it very well. So, the stiffness is most prominent in the mornings, affecting your fingers and knees. It improves with movement throughout the day. Approximately how long does it take for you to feel less stiff after waking up?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question… I don’t really time it. Maybe…half an hour? Sometimes longer. It depends. If it’s cold, it’s worse, I think. And… well, I don’t really know. It’s just…gradual. It’s not like a sudden pop, it just…gets better little by little. I wish I could be more helpful. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Ms. Voner. Don't worry about precise timing – an estimate is perfectly fine. The fact that it improves gradually and is affected by the cold is valuable information. Now, would you say this stiffness is present in other joints besides your fingers and knees?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My…shoulders, maybe? A little. Not as bad as my fingers and knees, though. I sometimes feel a little ache there, especially when I reach for things. And… my hips, I guess? But I just figured that was…old age. I don’t really pay much attention to it, to be honest. Everything aches a little when you get to be my age, right? I haven't really told anyone about it before.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point, Ms. Voner, and it’s common for joints to have some discomfort with age. However, it’s good that you’re bringing this to my attention now. So, to clarify, you’re experiencing stiffness and some aching in your fingers, knees, shoulders, and hips. Is there any swelling or redness associated with these joints?
PATIENT: Swelling? Redness? I…I don't think so. No. Not that I've noticed. My fingers might be a little…puffy sometimes, but I thought that was just…my hands. I don’t know. I really haven’t looked closely. I don't really do much with my hands these days. Just…little things. I'd have to really try to look. Does it matter? Is that important? I get confused about what's important sometimes. Sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Voner. Don’t apologize at all. It’s important for me to gather as much information as possible, and any detail, even if it seems small, can be helpful. The lack of noticeable swelling or redness is good to know. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with this joint stiffness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm…let me think. I get tired, of course. But I'm always tired. That's just part of getting older, isn’t it? I haven’t really noticed anything else. Maybe a little…grumpy sometimes? But my husband…well, never mind. He always said I was a bit grumpy. I don't think that's connected to my joints, though. I don’t know. Is there something I should be looking for? I just feel…a little achy and tired, mostly. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Fatigue is common, and it’s good you mentioned that. Let’s move on to your medical history, Ms. Voner. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s a hard one. Let me think. I had…the usual, I suppose. High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor gave me a pill for it for a while. And…a bad back once. Years ago. But nothing serious, really. I went to the doctor a lot when my husband was alive, but I don’t remember what they said. He always handled all that. I haven't been to the doctor much since…well, you know. I can’t really remember much about it, to be honest. It’s all a bit of a blur. Does that help? I feel bad I can’t be more useful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Voner. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t recall all the specifics. We can try to access some of your records if you're comfortable with that. We have computers in the examination room, and I can see if the clinic has any information on file from previous visits. Would you like me to check that?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. If you could…yes, please. I have no idea where my old records are, even if I did have them. And I'm sure my husband kept some. It’s…it’s been a long time. If you can find anything, that would be great. Thank you. I appreciate you trying. It's just...everything feels so long ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner. I've been able to pull up some records. It appears you were diagnosed with hypertension approximately ten years ago and were prescribed lisinopril. There's also a note about a lumbar strain eight years ago, treated with physical therapy. No other significant medical conditions are listed. Do you recall being treated for anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, lisinopril…yes, that sounds right. A little pill, I think. I took it for a while, then…I don’t know. Maybe the doctor took me off it? I really don't remember. And the back…yes, I fell in the garden once. It was very painful. But nothing else…no, I don’t think so. Not that I can remember. I had a…a bad cold every winter, but that’s just normal, right? I don’t think that’s important. Is there anything else you need to know? I feel a little flustered now, trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Ms. Voner. Don’t feel flustered at all. Let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as arthritis, autoimmune diseases, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s another hard one. My mother… she had… I think she had some problems with her hands? Something with her joints, maybe? But it was a long time ago, and I was just a child. My father… he had a heart problem, I think. He died when I was young. And my sister… she was healthy as a horse, always bragging about it. I don’t really know much about her health history, to be honest. We weren’t very close. It all feels so…distant now. I wish I could be more helpful, but my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Voner. Any information you can recall is helpful. So, a potential history of joint problems in your mother and heart issues in your father. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… No, not really. I take a little aspirin sometimes, if I have a headache. But that’s it. I used to take something for sleep, but it didn’t really help, so I stopped. And I tried some vitamins once, but I forgot to take them. I don’t really believe in all that stuff, to be honest. Just aspirin for headaches, that’s all. And a little bit of coffee in the morning, if you count that as a medication! I don't really take much of anything, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes in the spring, but that’s just the pollen, I think. My husband was allergic to cats, but I love cats! I don’t have any allergies that I know of, to be honest. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. Is that all the questions, Doctor? I'm starting to feel a little tired now, trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Voner, that’s all the questions for now. Thank you for your patience and for providing me with this information. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, if that's possible. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll cooperate. I hope it doesn’t take too long, though. I get a little… uncomfortable when people poke and prod at me. But I’ll try my best. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Voner. I'll be as gentle as possible. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then I'll take a look at your joints, checking for any swelling or tenderness. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, Ms. Voner, I'm listening to your heart now. Take some deep breaths for me… Good. Your heart sounds regular and there are no abnormal sounds. Now, I'll listen to your lungs… Again, deep breaths… Lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look at your hands. I'm going to gently feel around your joints. Can you open and close your hands for me?
PATIENT: There we go. It’s a little stiff, you know? Especially my knuckles. And my wrists feel…creaky. Not painful, exactly, just…old. Like they need oiling or something. I haven’t used my hands much lately. Just…little things. But it feels a little…tight. Is that what you’re looking for? I hope I'm not being a bother. I get nervous when people touch my hands. It reminds me of…well, never mind.
DOCTOR: You're not being a bother at all, Ms. Voner. And I understand. Your knuckles do show some mild, bony prominence, which is common with age. I'm feeling a slight crepitus in your wrists when you move them – that’s the grinding sensation you’re describing, and it can be normal as well. There's no significant swelling or redness at this time. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: There… that's about as far as I can go without it being too uncomfortable. It feels a little tight in the back of my knees, and a little…stiff. Like they need to be…stretched. I used to be able to bend them all the way, but not anymore. I haven’t been very active lately, you see. It’s hard to get around. Is that what you’re looking for? It’s not a bad pain, just…uncomfortable. I hope I'm not making things difficult.
DOCTOR: You're not making things difficult at all, Ms. Voner. And thank you for letting me know what you're feeling. I’m feeling some mild crepitus in both knees, which is consistent with some wear and tear. There is no significant swelling or redness. Your gait appears slightly limited due to stiffness, but there are no major abnormalities. Alright, Ms. Voner. That completes the physical examination. Based on your history and the exam findings, it appears you’re experiencing joint stiffness, primarily in your fingers, wrists, and knees. There's no evidence of significant inflammation, but there is some wear and tear consistent with age. These findings are most suggestive of osteoarthritis. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Osteo…arthritis? Oh dear. That sounds…serious. Is that bad? My mother had something with her hands, maybe that's what it was? I don't really remember. Will I need…surgery? I don’t want surgery. I’m not very good with pain, you see. And I don't want to take a lot of pills. Is there anything…anything I can do to make it better? I just want to be able to move without feeling so…stiff. And tired. Will I be able to do that?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned when you hear a diagnosis like osteoarthritis, Ms. Voner. But it's important to remember that it’s a very common condition, and it doesn't necessarily mean you'll need surgery. In many cases, we can manage the symptoms effectively with conservative treatments. Surgery is typically reserved for more severe cases that don’t respond to other interventions. Based on your presentation, I don't believe surgery is necessary at this time. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, improve function, and slow the progression of the condition. We can start with a few simple things, such as: Regular exercise: Gentle exercises can help strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve flexibility. Weight management: If you are overweight, losing even a small amount of weight can significantly reduce the stress on your joints. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Medications like ibuprofen or naproxen can help relieve pain and inflammation. Topical creams: Creams containing capsaicin or menthol can also provide pain relief. We can also discuss physical therapy to help you learn specific exercises and techniques to manage your condition. Would you be interested in exploring those options?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds…manageable. Exercise… I haven’t exercised in years. But I suppose I could try. And I definitely could lose a few pounds. I’ve been baking a lot lately, to keep myself busy. I might have to cut back on that. And I suppose I could try those creams. I don't really like taking pills, so that would be better. Physical therapy… that sounds good too. Maybe someone could show me how to do things properly? I'm afraid of hurting myself, you see. Yes, I think I would like to try those things. Would it be…expensive? I don’t have much money, you see. And I don’t have insurance. I just want to be able to move without feeling so…stiff. And tired. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Voner. And it’s not too much to ask at all. We'll work together to find options that are both effective and affordable. Regarding cost, I can write you a referral to a physical therapy clinic that offers a sliding scale based on income. We can also discuss over-the-counter options that are relatively inexpensive. I'm also going to recommend a Vitamin D supplement, as many people with joint pain are deficient in Vitamin D. It's generally a low-cost supplement. I’ll write prescriptions for a topical NSAID cream and a referral to a physical therapist specializing in osteoarthritis management. I would also like to schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds…wonderful, Doctor. A sliding scale would be a huge help. And I'll definitely try the Vitamin D supplement. I spend most of my time indoors these days. And a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks sounds good too. It's good to know you'll be there to help. Thank you, Doctor. You've made me feel so much better already. Just knowing there are things I can do to manage this… it's a relief. I suppose I should schedule that appointment now? And I'll need to pick up those prescriptions? I appreciate your kindness, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I hope I'm not taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: You’re not taking up any of my time at all, Ms. Voner. That's what I'm here for. I’m happy I could provide some reassurance and a plan forward. Here are the prescriptions for the diclofenac topical cream and the referral to the physical therapy clinic. The clinic will contact you to schedule an appointment. And let’s schedule your follow-up appointment now. How does six weeks from today sound?
PATIENT: Six weeks from today sounds perfect, Doctor. That gives me time to get everything sorted out and try those things you suggested. And thank you again for the prescriptions and the referral. I really appreciate it. I suppose that’s everything then? I should go now? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been a lifesaver. I hope I don’t need to bother you again too soon. But it's good to know you're there if I do. Thank you, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Voner. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself. Here's the number for the clinic if you need to reschedule your appointment or have any other questions. Have a good day as well, Ms. Voner. And I wish you all the best. .
