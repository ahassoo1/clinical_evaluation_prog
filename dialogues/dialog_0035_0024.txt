DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. It’s for…well, it’s a bit complicated, but basically, the airline needs it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fit-to-fly letter. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about why the airline needs this?
PATIENT: My husband… passed away a few months ago. We had a trip planned, a non-refundable one. The airline is being… difficult about transferring the ticket, or even offering a refund. They said if I could get a note from a doctor saying I’m healthy enough to travel, they might reconsider. It feels a bit ridiculous, honestly, but I’m willing to try anything to get some of our money back.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds incredibly frustrating, Ms. Sayar. Losing your husband and then dealing with this… it's a lot. Absolutely, we can certainly document your health status for travel. To do that properly, I'll need to get some information from you. Let’s start with a basic medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up completely. Otherwise, no. I usually stay pretty healthy. I eat well, try to get some exercise… mostly walking, though. I’ve never been one for strenuous activity. Is that enough? Or do you need a full list of everything I’ve ever had? I can try to remember… it’s just been a while since I’ve needed to think about this stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you generally stay healthy. No, a full list isn’t necessary, just anything current or ongoing that might affect your ability to travel. The bronchitis last winter is noted. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… No surgeries. And no hospitalizations, thankfully. I did have my tonsils out when I was a kid – a long time ago, of course – but that was it. I remember being very sore for a week, but honestly, that’s the extent of my medical history. It’s… rather boring, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s good it’s boring, Ms. Sayar. That’s a very positive thing! No need to apologize for a healthy history. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I don’t even take a daily vitamin. I’ve always just… been okay. I eat a lot of fruit, I guess. And drink plenty of water. That’s probably it. Is that unusual? Everyone I know seems to be on something these days.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not unusual at all. Plenty of people don’t take regular medications. Just confirming, no allergies to anything – medications, food, environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten pretty much everything. I remember being a very adventurous eater as a child, much to my mother’s dismay. I think I’m pretty lucky, honestly.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s all very helpful. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My parents both lived into their eighties, which is good. My mother had high blood pressure later in life, but other than that, they were relatively healthy. My father’s side… there was some heart disease, I think, a couple of uncles. But nothing immediate, like a parent or sibling suffering from anything serious. It’s not a particularly remarkable family history, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. Sayar. Not having a strong family history of illness is a good thing. Just one more quick thing – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never have, never will. I don't have any vices, Doctor. I prefer a good cup of tea. I try to stay as healthy as possible, remember? All this is probably very straightforward for you, isn't it? It’s just… a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It is straightforward, Ms. Sayar, and I appreciate you being so thorough. It's important to cover all bases, even when things seem uncomplicated. Now, just to be absolutely sure, and for the fit-to-fly letter, I'd like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this letter sorted, if possible. I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 122/78, which is excellent. Heart sounds are normal, regular rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Everything seems to be in good working order. Given your medical history and this brief physical examination, I don’t see any contraindications to air travel. I’m happy to write a letter stating you are medically cleared to fly. Just so I can document this accurately, have you experienced any dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain recently, even with minimal exertion?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Nothing like that at all. I've been feeling perfectly fine. A little sad, naturally, given the circumstances… but physically, I’m completely healthy. I’ve been walking every day, trying to keep active, and haven’t had any issues whatsoever. I can walk up several flights of stairs without getting winded. It really is just a matter of getting this letter so I can at least try to salvage something from the trip.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s very reassuring. Alright, I’ve drafted a letter stating you are medically cleared for air travel, with no restrictions. It will also mention your normal blood pressure and clear lung sounds. I’ll have my assistant print it out for you. Do you need me to include anything specific in the letter, like a statement about deep vein thrombosis risk, or anything else the airline requested?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. They didn’t specify anything particular, just a general statement confirming I’m fit to fly. I think anything you’ve already mentioned would be perfect. Honestly, I just want to get it over with. I really appreciate you being so thorough and helpful, Doctor. This has been a huge weight off my mind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I understand. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and dealing with the airline on top of everything is just… unfair. My assistant, Sarah, will bring that letter to you in just a moment. She’ll also provide you with a copy of the office visit summary for your records. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Truly. Thank you again for your time and help, Doctor Alzoubi. You’ve been wonderful. I’m really hopeful this will resolve things with the airline. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I truly hope it does. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything further. Take care of yourself. .
