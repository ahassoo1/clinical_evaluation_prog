DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. It’s this fever, keeps comin’ back. Feels like it just won’t quit, ya know? Been botherin’ me for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Clide. A recurring fever, you said. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’ll go away for a day or two, maybe three, then bam, it’s back. Not super high, usually around 101, 102. No chills or anything, just... warm. Makes me tired, that's the worst part. Been happenin’ for, oh, maybe a month now? Hard to keep track, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fever on and off for about a month, peaking around 101-102 degrees, with fatigue being the main symptom. That does sound bothersome. When you say it goes away, does anything specific seem to make it better?
PATIENT: Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I just rest, drink some water… it just goes eventually. Then comes back when I least expect it. I took some Tylenol a couple times, helped for a few hours, but it always returns. I don’t pay much attention to it until it bothers me, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Clide. So it seems to resolve spontaneously, then recur. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the fever when it is present?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No cough, no sniffles. Maybe a little achy sometimes, like my muscles are tired, but nothin’ terrible. No headaches, no stomach problems… I really don’t think so. Honestly, just the fever and feelin' wiped out. My wife keeps askin' if I'm eatin' enough, but I feel hungry enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, no sniffles, minimal muscle aches, no headaches or gastrointestinal issues. Just the fever and fatigue. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more general questions, if that's alright. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' like that. Always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. The doctor back home used to say I had strong bones, and I used to work a lot with my hands. Little aches and pains from that, but no real conditions. I take a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know you've generally been healthy. And you mentioned medication for blood pressure. Could you tell me the name and dosage of that medication, please?
PATIENT: It’s Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. Been takin' it for, oh, five years maybe? Doc said my numbers were a little high, started me on that and it seems to keep things okay. I get the pills from the pharmacy down the street, no problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for five years. That’s good information. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just one. Tore my rotator cuff a few years back, had it fixed. That was… maybe eight years ago? Recovered pretty well, no problems with it now. Besides that, nothin’. No broken bones, no nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, rotator cuff repair eight years ago, otherwise no surgeries. Let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with a history of serious illnesses, like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: My mother had… well, she had a problem with her heart when she got older. Ended up passin’ from it, maybe ten years back. My father was healthy as an ox, lived ‘til he was 90. And my brother… he's got some arthritis, but that’s about it. Not much else, really. A lot of us just got lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had heart problems, and your brother has arthritis. That’s helpful. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she tried it once when she was young, didn't like it. Both of us are pretty clean livin', if ya know what I mean.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Clide. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Nothin’ crazy, ya know? A little somethin' to relax. My wife and I enjoy it, that’s all. Not a heavy drinker, never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of glasses of wine with dinner a few times a week. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can take most things without a problem. My wife is a little sensitive to some flowers, but I don’t mess with flowers.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very helpful, Clide. Thank you for answering all those questions so thoroughly. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Just a routine check to get a better picture of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I want to get this figured out. I just wanna feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now I’ll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Finally, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, not tender. No masses or enlarged organs. Temperature is 101.2 Fahrenheit. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal anything immediately concerning, but the persistent fever and slightly elevated blood pressure do warrant further investigation. Now, I’d like to order some blood work to help determine the cause of your fever. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever ya think is best. I just want to know what’s makin’ me feel this way. Blood work is fine.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm going to order a Complete Blood Count to check for infection, a Basic Metabolic Panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes, and an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate to look for inflammation. We’ll also check a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause fevers. The lab technician will come up shortly to draw the samples. It will just be a quick prick of the finger and a small vial of blood. Once the results are back, usually within a day or two, we’ll review them together and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest and drink plenty of fluids. If your fever spikes above 103 or you develop any new symptoms like severe headache, stiff neck, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the blood work or what to look out for?
PATIENT: No, that sounds pretty straightforward. Just gotta get the blood drawn, wait for the results… I can do that. No new symptoms, got it. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate ya takin’ the time to look into this. Hopefully, we can figure somethin' out soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clide. I understand it's frustrating when you don't know what's causing your symptoms, and we'll do our best to find an answer. I’ll also print out a lab requisition form for you to take to the lab, and a summary of today's visit for your records. The lab is just down the hall. Let me know if you have any trouble finding it. And again, please don’t hesitate to contact us if your condition worsens or you develop any new concerns. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they become available. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. I got the forms, I can find the lab. Thanks again, Doctor Vodzak. I think I'm good to go for now. I really appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Clide. I’m glad I could help. Please take care of yourself, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
