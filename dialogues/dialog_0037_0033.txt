DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Burdette. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's rather obvious, isn't it? The advertisement did say you handle...difficult cases. I seem to be losing my sight, and my hearing isn’t what it used to be. Honestly, it’s quite distressing. I’d hoped for a quicker resolution, if I’m being frank.
DOCTOR: I understand your distress, Ms. Burdette, and I appreciate you being so upfront. It’s good that you came in to get this checked out. "Difficult cases" simply means we don’t shy away from complex problems. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's been going on. When did you first notice changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Oh dear. When did I first notice? That’s… difficult to say precisely. It wasn't a sudden thing, you understand. More of a… a gradual blurring. Weeks, perhaps? Months? I really don’t keep track of such trivial matters. It’s been… a stressful time, if you must know. All rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual blurring over weeks or months. And is the blurring in both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I suppose. Though, I can't honestly say I've made a detailed assessment. I simply noticed things weren’t as… crisp as they once were. Really, Doctor, I expect you to tell me what’s happening, not ask me to perform my own examinations. I am a patient, after all.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to expect me to do the examining, Ms. Burdette. My apologies. I'm just trying to get a sense of the timeline. Okay. And with the hearing, when did you first notice that becoming a problem?
PATIENT: Oh, the hearing… around the same time, I think. People mumbling, you know? I kept asking my housekeeper to speak up, and she kept saying I simply wasn't listening. Honestly, the disrespect! But no, I do believe my hearing has diminished. It's rather frustrating when trying to follow a conversation. It’s all very… unsettling. Are we getting anywhere, Doctor?
DOCTOR: We are, Ms. Burdette, we are. It sounds like both vision and hearing have been gradually declining over a similar timeframe. Okay. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any other symptoms along with the vision and hearing changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, I have been rather fatigued lately. But honestly, who isn't these days? I maintain a very active social calendar, you see. And my memory… it isn't what it once was. Though I assure you, that has nothing to do with any medical condition. It's simply… the accumulation of years, Doctor. Important events, you understand. Now, are you going to do something, or are we simply going to discuss my lifestyle?
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue and some memory changes. We will definitely do something, Ms. Burdette. I just need to gather some information first to make sure I’m on the right track. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions—like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been a very healthy woman. I’ve never needed to trouble doctors much in my life. A little indigestion now and then, perhaps, but nothing serious. As for all those… conditions you mentioned, no, I have none of those. My family has excellent genes, you see. Though my ex-husband… well, that’s another story entirely. Now, if you’ll excuse me, this chair isn’t particularly comfortable. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. And you said you haven't had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Good heavens, no! I would never subject myself to such a barbaric practice unless absolutely unavoidable. A minor cosmetic procedure years ago, perhaps, but nothing… invasive. Honestly, Doctor, are you implying I look as though I’ve had a great deal of work done? It’s rather insulting, if you ask me. Now, let’s please expedite this process. I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question came across as insensitive, Ms. Burdette. It was simply a routine part of the medical history. Let’s move on to family history then. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, or vision or hearing loss?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s a complicated question. My mother was… rather frail, if I recall correctly. She suffered from a variety of ailments, but honestly, I never paid much attention. My father was a very stoic man, never one to complain. There might have been some… instances of dementia on my aunt’s side, but I couldn't say for certain. Honestly, Doctor, my family is rather… private. We don’t discuss such things. Are you sure all these questions are necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Burdette. It’s helpful to have some idea, even if it’s just a general sense. Okay. And just a few more questions, then we can get to the physical exam. Do you take any medications regularly—prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Really, Doctor. I pride myself on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and get plenty of rest. I have no need for artificial stimulants or… potions. Perhaps a little chamomile tea before bed, but that’s hardly a medication. Honestly, are you suggesting I’m a frail, ailing woman who relies on pharmaceuticals? It’s quite offensive, if you ask me. Now, can we please proceed with the examination? I’m wasting valuable time here. .
DOCTOR: I apologize again, Ms. Burdette. I was simply attempting to gather information to ensure the best possible care for you. No chamomile tea, no medications. Alright. Let's proceed with the physical exam, then. I’m going to start with your vision. Would you mind following my penlight as I move it back and forth?
