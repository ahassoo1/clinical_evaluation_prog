DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Smetak. Thanks for having me. It’s… well, it’s my eyes, really. They’ve been bothering me a lot lately with the light. Everything seems so bright, and it hurts. It started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, your eyes… sensitivity to light, that’s photophobia, as we call it. And it’s been going on for a few weeks now, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few weeks. Maybe a month now? It’s hard to say exactly, to be honest. It just slowly got worse. It's not constant, you know? Some days are better than others, but when the sun is out… oof. It’s really tough. And even bright indoor lights bother me now, which is new.
DOCTOR: Right, it’s intermittent, and it's recently started affecting indoor lights as well. Okay. Can you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s… not really a sharp pain. More like a really uncomfortable burning feeling, and everything just feels… washed out. Like when you stare at a bright light for too long and see spots. It makes me squint a lot. And honestly, it gives me a bit of a headache afterwards too. It’s just really draining, you know? Makes it hard to focus on anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. Burning sensation, washed-out vision, squinting, and headaches afterwards… alright. Do you notice any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven't noticed any blurry vision or anything like that. No floaters, or spots that aren't from the light itself. My eyes do feel a little dry sometimes, now that you mention it, but I thought that was just from being tired. And… oh! Actually, yes. I’ve been feeling a bit more tired than usual, generally. But I figured that was just… life, you know? Being a widower and all. It’s hard sometimes. But yeah, no other symptoms really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blurry vision, floaters, just the dryness and increased fatigue. I'm sorry to hear about your loss, Arbin. That certainly can contribute to fatigue. Let’s get some more information. Have you had any changes in your vision before this sensitivity to light started?
PATIENT: No, not that I've noticed. I wear glasses for reading, have for years, but my prescription hasn’t changed in… oh, goodness, maybe five years now? Six? I got my eyes checked regularly when my wife was still around, but it’s been a bit since. Everything was always fine. It's just this light thing that’s new.
DOCTOR: Alright, no changes to your reading glasses prescription. Okay. And have you had any eye injuries or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. No injuries, no surgeries, nothing like that. My eyes have always been pretty… normal, I guess. Just the usual needing glasses as I got older. I did used to spend a lot of time outside when I was younger, working in the garden, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no injuries or surgeries. And no family history of eye problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had cataracts when she got older, I think. But that was when she was quite old, maybe in her eighties. And my father… he always wore glasses, like me, but I don't remember him having anything serious wrong with his eyes. Just the normal getting older stuff, I think. I don’t really know much beyond that, to be honest. My family isn’t very… talkative about health things.
DOCTOR: Okay, cataracts in your mother, and your father wore glasses. Alright. Now, just to cover the basics, are you currently taking any medications, Arbin?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it a few years ago. Said it was getting too low on its own. Now, I just take a multivitamin every day. That’s it. Nothing for pain, nothing else at all. Medicare covers it, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I can eat anything, take any medicine, no problems at all. I used to worry about it when I was a kid, but I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife used to tease me about having an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. Now, I'm going to do a quick examination of your eyes. Just relax and look straight ahead. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements appear normal. There’s some mild redness of the conjunctiva, but no discharge. I’m going to check your visual acuity now, can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Sure, I can try. “Um… let’s see… E… F… P… T… Okay, I think that's as far as I can go on that line.” Is that bad? I usually can see a bit better than that. The light is pretty bright.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s a bit reduced from your last check, as you said. Let’s check the other eye. Okay, both eyes are slightly reduced. Now, I'm going to use a slit lamp to get a better look at the structures of your eye. It’s a bright light, and I’ll need you to look straight ahead. I’m seeing some mild inflammation in both eyes, and a small amount of… debris in the anterior chamber. It’s not severe, but it’s enough to explain some of your symptoms. It appears you have a bit of iritis, or inflammation of the iris. It's likely causing the light sensitivity and discomfort.
PATIENT: Iritis? What… what causes that? Is it serious? I haven’t been feeling sick, or anything. And is that what’s making my eyes hurt so much? The light is the worst part, honestly. I just want to be able to go outside without feeling like I'm staring into the sun. Is it something I caught? I haven’t been around anyone who’s been sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a deep breath. Iritis, or uveitis, as it’s sometimes called, is inflammation of the middle layer of the eye. The cause can be… varied, honestly. Sometimes it's related to an autoimmune condition, sometimes it’s an infection, though you’re right, it often has no clear cause. It's not usually contagious. And you're right to say you haven't been feeling sick - it often doesn't present with other systemic symptoms. It’s good we caught it. While it isn't an emergency, untreated iritis can lead to complications like glaucoma or vision loss. The good news is, it’s usually treatable. The light sensitivity, pain, and blurry vision are all common symptoms of iritis, so that lines up with what you’re experiencing. I’m going to prescribe you some eye drops – a steroid to reduce the inflammation. I also want to suggest an oral medication, a mild steroid, to help bring it under control more quickly. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes a little more sense. So it’s not… something I did? I was worried I’d caught something from somewhere. Steroid eye drops and… pills? Okay. I guess so. If it’ll help, yeah. I definitely want to get this sorted. Is there anything… anything bad about taking steroids? I’ve heard things. And how long will I need to take them?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question. You're right to be cautious. Steroids, even topical or oral ones, do have potential side effects. With the eye drops, the most common side effect is a temporary increase in eye pressure, which is why we'll monitor that. With the oral steroid, side effects can include increased blood sugar, mood changes, and trouble sleeping, but we’re prescribing a low dose for a short course, so the risk is minimal. I'll start you on a tapering dose of Prednisone, 20mg daily for five days, then 10mg daily for another five days. We’ll re-evaluate after 10 days. I'll also give you a prescription for Prednisolone eye drops, four times a day for the first week, then twice a day for the next week. It's important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your eye pressure and make sure the inflammation is resolving. I'm also going to give you a referral to an ophthalmologist for a more comprehensive evaluation, just to be on the safe side. They can rule out any other underlying causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Prednisone… Prednisolone drops… five days at one dose, then five at a lower dose. And a check-up in two weeks. An ophthalmologist too, to make sure nothing else is going on. Yes, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate that. I guess the most important thing is getting my eyes better. Will the Prednisone interact with anything? I just take a multivitamin, but I want to be sure. And… is there anything I should be doing now? Like, avoiding sunlight? Wearing sunglasses? Anything to help it along?
DOCTOR: Good questions. The Prednisone shouldn't interact with a multivitamin, but it's always a good idea to let your primary care physician know what medications you’re taking, just for record-keeping. And yes, absolutely. Avoid bright sunlight as much as possible. Wear sunglasses whenever you're outside, even on cloudy days. A wide-brimmed hat can also help. Rest your eyes as much as possible, and avoid straining them with prolonged reading or screen time. Cool compresses can also provide some relief. I'll also write you a note detailing your diagnosis and treatment plan, and I'll send it to your primary care physician. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very helpful, Dr. Smetak. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate you taking the time. And thanks for being so patient with all my questions. I’ll get the prescriptions filled right away, and I’ll schedule the follow-up appointment. Hopefully, this will sort things out quickly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. It's my pleasure. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. I’m glad I could help. And I hope you feel better soon. Take care, and have a good day.
