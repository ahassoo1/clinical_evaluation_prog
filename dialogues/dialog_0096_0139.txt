DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Shanor. Right. I need… check for referee. For sports. Fitness, you know? They want me to get check before I start. Is okay?
DOCTOR: A referee check-up?
PATIENT: Yes. For… soccer. Little leagues. I… coach too, sometimes. But mostly referee. They say I need to be… strong enough? Healthy enough? I don’t know. They just want paper from doctor. For insurance.
DOCTOR: Right. Insurance paperwork. Always the paperwork. Well, Mr. Shanor, while I appreciate you coming in before starting, it's… unusual to request a general fitness assessment simply for insurance requirements. Still. We’ll do what needs to be done. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing another doctor regularly?
PATIENT: No. Not regularly. My wife… she had doctor. I just… go when something hurt. After she… passed. I haven’t been to doctor much since then. Is… okay if we skip that part? I am mostly healthy. Just… need paper.
DOCTOR: Skipping medical history isn't ideal, Mr. Shanor. But… alright. We'll focus on the present, then. Tell me, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting spells – even if they were minor – in the last six months?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Maybe… tired sometimes. But work is hard. I fix… the inside of ovens. Big ovens. Very hot. Lots of lifting. Tired is normal. No… dizziness. Never faint. I think. Not that I remember.
DOCTOR: And what about your joints?
PATIENT: Joints? Um… They ache a little. After work. Knees mostly. And back. But… I am not young. Is normal for old man, yes? I take… something. From store. For pain. Ibuprofen, I think? The white pills. Helps a little.
DOCTOR: “Old man,” you say. You’re thirty-one, Mr. Shanor. While ibuprofen can mask pain, it doesn't address the underlying cause. Do you notice any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Thirty-one… Yes, right. Time goes fast. No… no swelling. No red. Just… ache. Like… after running. But I don’t run much. Mostly lifting. Heavy things. Is that bad? For the joints? I don't know much about… this. Is why I am here, yes? For the paper.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Just to get a baseline. Please, have a seat on the table. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. And then we’ll take a look at those knees and back. It’s standard procedure, even for… insurance paperwork.
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Is… quick, yes? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and another one… good. Everything sounds clear. A little crepitus in both knees. And some tenderness on the medial side of the left knee. Can you tell me on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate that tenderness?
PATIENT: Um… six. When I bend it. Not all the time. Just… when I really bend it. Like… when I squat. For… fixing the ovens. Is that bad? The six? Is that a lot? I don’t like pain.
DOCTOR: Six is… noticeable. It indicates some degree of irritation in the joint. Now, let’s check your back. Can you stand for a moment?
PATIENT: Okay. Is… okay. Just a little stiff. Usually gets better after I move around. Like that. A little click. But… is okay. I think. Is old. Everything is old.
DOCTOR: Some tenderness along the lumbar spine. And your reflexes are… normal. Mr. Shanor, while I can provide you with a note stating you’ve been examined, your exam does reveal some musculoskeletal issues. I recommend further evaluation with a physical therapist. They can assess your condition properly and recommend a targeted exercise program to improve your strength and flexibility. Ignoring this could lead to more significant problems down the line.
PATIENT: Physical… what? Is that… more doctor? More money? I just need the paper. For the referee. They don't ask about… muscles. They ask if I can run. And… if my heart is okay. Can you just write the paper? Please? I have to go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand you’re eager to get back to your… refereeing. And I can write a note stating you’ve been examined. However, providing a cursory examination without addressing underlying issues is… not good medical practice. I will write a note stating your heart and lungs sound clear, and your blood pressure is within acceptable limits. But I strongly advise you to follow up with a physical therapist. I will also include a recommendation for a basic stretching routine. Here. This should suffice for your insurance requirements. But please, take care of your body. It's the only one you have.
PATIENT: Thank you. Thank you very much. The stretching… is okay if I skip that part? It takes time.
DOCTOR: Do as you wish, Mr. Shanor. But don't come back complaining when something breaks. .
