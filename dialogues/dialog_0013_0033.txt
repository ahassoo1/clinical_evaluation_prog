DOCTOR: Hi Burdette, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Dr. Morenomartinez, is it? Well, honestly, I don’t have time for this. It's…it's my sight and hearing. They’ve just…gone. Not entirely, you understand, but diminishing. Rapidly. It's quite inconvenient, really. I have a very full schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, Burdette. I understand your time is valuable, and we'll do our best to be efficient. “Diminishing rapidly” is…concerning. Let's start with your sight. Can you tell me how it’s diminishing?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven’t the foggiest. Things just…aren’t as sharp as they used to be. And…darker, perhaps? It’s difficult to explain. I suppose it happened gradually, and I simply didn't notice until it became…problematic. I don’t need a detailed description, Doctor. I’m a surgeon, you know. I understand what “sharp” means.
DOCTOR: Right, a surgeon – that does give you a good baseline. Okay, so gradually worsening sharpness and some darkening. Is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I believe. Though one is…marginally worse than the other. It's rather unsettling, truthfully. I suppose it doesn’t matter which one is worse. They're both failing, aren’t they? Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: No, we'll try and be quick. And it does matter which one is worse, even slightly, so thank you for telling me. Alright. And when you say "darkening," is that like a shadow coming over your vision, or more like colors seem…faded?
PATIENT: Faded, I suppose. Though, honestly, I haven't given it much thought. Shadows…no, not exactly. Everything just appears…duller. Less vibrant. As if someone turned down the brightness. Really, I’m a very busy woman. I operate on children, you know. Precision is…critical.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Okay, fading and dullness in both eyes, worse in one. Now, let’s talk about the hearing. How is that diminishing?
PATIENT: It's…muffled. As if there’s cotton in my ears. And sometimes, I miss words. Particularly softer tones. It’s rather embarrassing, truthfully. People think I’m being rude. I have to ask them to repeat themselves constantly. It's simply inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled sounds and difficulty hearing softer tones. Is this in both ears as well, or is it worse in one?
PATIENT: Yes, both. Though, much like my sight, one is noticeably…less functional than the other. Honestly, I've always had rather sensitive ears, so I suspect it’s simply age. Though, at my age, one expects a few things to…fail.
DOCTOR: Alright. Both ears, worse in one, muffled sounds, difficulty with softer tones, and you’ve always had sensitive hearing. Do you recall any recent exposure to loud noises – like at a concert, or maybe a lot of machinery at work?
PATIENT: Machinery? Good heavens, no. I work with children, Doctor. Not…construction equipment. A concert…well, perhaps a charity gala or two. Nothing excessively loud, I assure you. I have standards, you know. This is all rather…disconcerting, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. No recent loud noise exposure. Now, just to get a full picture, have you noticed any ringing in your ears at all?
PATIENT: Ringing? Hmm…occasionally. A faint…tinnitus, I believe they call it? It's hardly noticeable. Comes and goes. Probably just stress. I have a very demanding practice.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional tinnitus. Good. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'm going to check your ears, your eyes, and do a basic neurological assessment. It won’t take long. Can you follow my penlight with your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, must we? Really, Doctor, I’ve spent my life performing delicate surgeries. I rather think I can assess my own neurological state. But, very well. If you insist. Just…please be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, following the light…good. And good. Both pupils react to light, though slightly sluggishly. External ears look normal, but there’s a bit of cerumen buildup in both canals. Okay, can you repeat what number I say?
PATIENT: Honestly? I can barely hear a thing you're saying. It's like you're mumbling. Is there anything you can do to speak louder?
DOCTOR: Okay, try again. Can you repeat "forty-seven"?
PATIENT: …seventy? Is that what you said? I’m quite certain I heard “seventy”. Really, Doctor, you’re not being very clear.
DOCTOR: Okay, Burdette, let's try something different. I'm going to ask a nurse to perform a formal audiometry test. This will give us a much clearer picture of your hearing loss. It's a quick, painless procedure. Nurse, could you please come in and perform an audiometry test on Burdette Julie?
PATIENT: An…audiometry test? Heavens. This is becoming rather protracted, isn't it? I really haven’t got time for this. And do you have to speak so loudly? It’s quite irritating.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the inconvenience, Burdette. But it's important we get a clear understanding of what’s happening. The audiometry test will give us objective data. While we wait for the nurse, can you tell me about any other symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Good heavens, where to begin? A slight headache, perhaps. And I've been feeling…rather fatigued lately. Though, honestly, Doctor, that's hardly unusual. I operate on children all day. It's exhausting work. I suspect it’s simply…overwork.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight headache and fatigue. Any dizziness or nausea accompanying the headache?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness. And definitely no nausea. Honestly, Doctor, I have standards. A headache and fatigue, as I said. Perhaps a slightly blurred vision, but that's likely related to the…deterioration of my sight, wouldn't you agree? Really, this is all rather obvious.
DOCTOR: Okay. And I see here in your records, you had a bout of shingles about six months ago, is that correct?
PATIENT: Shingles? Oh, yes, that dreadful business. It was most unpleasant. On my back, you know. Though I doubt that has anything to do with my…current predicament. I had it treated promptly, of course. A very good dermatologist.
DOCTOR: Nurse Anya, could you please perform an audiometry test on Ms. Julie?
PATIENT: Honestly. Another test? I do wish you'd simply tell me what's wrong with me instead of subjecting me to this endless barrage of examinations. Is this hospital always so…inefficient?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Burdette, and I apologize for the delay. But the tests are essential to rule out various possibilities and get an accurate diagnosis. This will allow us to determine the most effective course of treatment. Nurse Anya is very skilled, and it shouldn't take long. While the nurse begins the test, I’ll review your recent blood work, looking for any clues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, very well. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And please, Doctor, ensure the nurse speaks clearly. I’m rather sensitive to…mumbling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nurse Anya, please let me know when you're finished. Slightly elevated ESR…interesting. Let's see what the audiometry shows first.
PATIENT: Honestly. The silence is rather disconcerting. What exactly is going on? Is this something serious? You're not being very forthcoming, Doctor. It’s simply…impolite.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Burdette, and I apologize for not explaining things more clearly. We're gathering information, and I want to be certain before I offer any conclusions. The elevated inflammatory markers in your blood work are a bit unusual, and the audiometry test will help us determine if there’s a possible connection. Given your history of shingles, the possibility of postherpetic neuralgia is also being considered, which can sometimes affect hearing and vision. However, there are other possibilities we need to rule out. It's too early to say definitively what's going on, but we're investigating all potential causes. Are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? A slight ache in my lower back, perhaps. But that's hardly unusual. As I said, I operate on children all day. It's exhausting work. And I had that dreadful bout of shingles, you know. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. I suspect it’s simply…age. Or overwork. I’m a very busy woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, Burdette. Nurse Anya, could you please share the results with us?
PATIENT: Finally.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, the audiometry test shows a moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, worse on the left side. There's also a noticeable decline in high-frequency hearing. Given the hearing loss, combined with your symptoms and the slightly elevated inflammatory markers, I am concerned about the possibility of autoimmune inner ear disease, or AIED. It’s relatively rare, but it can cause progressive hearing loss and potentially affect your vision as well. To confirm this diagnosis, we'll need to order a magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, of your inner ear and brain, and likely a blood test to check for specific antibodies. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: MRI? Antibodies? Good heavens! This is…preposterous! Autoimmune…what did you say? It sounds terribly serious! I…I need to think about this. I need to consult with my…associate. This is all rather…overwhelming. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure I approve of all these…invasive procedures. I came in here because I couldn't hear properly, not to be subjected to a battery of tests and…diagnoses.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Burdette. It is a lot to take in. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging test, and the blood test is a simple draw. We won’t proceed with anything without your consent. However, AIED requires prompt treatment to prevent further hearing loss and potential vision impairment. Delaying diagnosis can unfortunately worsen the condition. I can certainly schedule a consultation with your associate if you’d like. In the meantime, I can provide you with some resources about AIED, and we can discuss your options further. Would you like me to schedule the MRI for you today, or would you prefer to think about it first?
PATIENT: Resources? Honestly, Doctor, I'm a surgeon! I assure you, I'm quite capable of researching this…affliction myself. No. No MRI. Not today. I need to…consider my options. And consult with my associate, as you suggested. This is all rather…distressing. Honestly, Doctor, I came in here for a simple diagnosis, not a…medical drama.
DOCTOR: Very well, Burdette. I understand. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to discuss your options and any concerns you may have after consulting with your associate. In the meantime, please contact the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as increased hearing loss, dizziness, or vision changes. Here's a card with my contact information. I want to assure you, we're here to support you in any way we can. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. I believe I have everything I need. Honestly, this has been…most unsatisfactory.
DOCTOR: .
