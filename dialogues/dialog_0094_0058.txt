DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m hoping we can discuss…weight loss. I’ve been putting on a few pounds, and it’s becoming a bit of a concern. I’d like to know if there’s anything—perhaps a medication—that might help. I’m not getting any younger, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Osumi. It’s very common to experience changes in weight as we get older, and it's good you’re addressing it now. We can definitely explore options. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this weight gain?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s been…gradual, over the last year or so, I’d say. Not a sudden thing. I used to be quite active, building models—it keeps me on my feet—but it’s become a little harder lately. Just…less energy, I suppose. And I find myself enjoying my meals a bit too much these days. My wife…she always kept me in check, but it's been difficult since she passed. I apologize, I don't mean to dwell on that.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all, Mr. Osumi. Grief can certainly impact many aspects of our lives, including our routines and eating habits. It’s perfectly natural to experience changes after such a loss. So, you’ve noticed a gradual weight gain over the past year, along with some decreased energy. About how much weight would you estimate you've gained, if you have an idea?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. Perhaps…15, 20 pounds? It’s mostly around the middle, I think. My clothes are feeling a bit snug, that’s for sure. I used to be around 160, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m closer to 180 now. It’s just…a general feeling of being heavier, you know? I'm not precise.
DOCTOR: I understand. That gives me a good starting point. And you mentioned decreased energy. Has that been a constant feeling, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s…more consistent now, I would say. It wasn’t noticeable at first, just a little more tired after a long day of work. But lately, even getting started on a project feels…difficult. I used to jump right in, eager to build. Now, I find myself putting it off. My hands still work fine, thankfully. It's more mental, I think. A lack of…drive.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistent fatigue and a decrease in motivation. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Let me think…not really, not that I can recall. I sleep alright, perhaps a little too much sometimes. No changes in appetite besides enjoying my food a bit more, as I said. My doctor—Dr. Ramirez, before he retired—used to check my blood pressure regularly, and it was always a little high, but nothing alarming. I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups. I’m not sure what the last results were, though. I apologize, I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Osumi. We have access to your medical records here, so we can certainly review Dr. Ramirez's notes and any recent lab results. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago—maybe 20 years now. Other than that, not much. I used to have a bit of trouble with my knees, but that’s mostly managed with some stretching and keeping active—when I can keep active, that is. No major illnesses, no diabetes, nothing like that. My wife was the healthy one, always making sure I ate right and exercised. I'm trying to be better about it now, but it’s…difficult without her. I really don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: You’re not taking up any time at all, Mr. Osumi. It’s important for me to have a thorough understanding of your history. So, gallbladder removal 20 years ago, some knee issues, otherwise generally healthy. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a tricky one. My mother lived to be 85, and she was healthy for most of her life. My father passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I believe. I have a sister, she’s still living, but we don’t see each other often. She lives on Guam. I don’t know much about her health, to be honest. I’m not really a family history kind of person, I apologize. Is that alright? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Osumi. We work with the information we have. So, mother healthy to 85, father with heart trouble, sister living on Guam with unknown health status. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My wife always discouraged it. She was very strict about that. And I don’t drink much either, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Mostly water, to be honest. I try to stay hydrated. I’m not much of a social drinker, if that makes sense. I prefer quiet evenings at home, working on my models.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Osumi. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I'm usually pretty careful about what I put into my body. I haven't taken much medication over the years, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for my knees, and nothing serious. I apologize, I'm rambling now, aren't I? I just want to get this sorted out. I want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Osumi, and I understand. It’s good to know you don't have any known allergies and haven't been on many medications. Okay, so to summarize, you've experienced gradual weight gain over the last year, accompanied by decreased energy and motivation, potentially related to grief after the loss of your wife. You have a history of gallbladder removal and some knee issues, but are otherwise generally healthy. No known allergies, and limited medication use. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. Just a routine check-up to get a baseline. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. A routine check-up is good. Anything to help figure out what’s going on. Thank you for being so patient with me. I apologize for not being the most organized patient. I just…want to feel better. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Osumi. It's my job, and I'm happy to help. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 85. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I do notice a slight increase in abdominal girth. Extremities are normal, no swelling. Okay, Mr. Osumi, that concludes the brief physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like we’re dealing with a combination of factors. The weight gain, fatigue, and decreased motivation could be related to grief and changes in routine, but the elevated blood pressure and increased abdominal girth warrant further investigation. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. We should also do a urinalysis. These tests will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…very thorough, Doctor. Blood work, urinalysis, everything you suggested. If that will help figure things out, absolutely. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s going on and what I can do to feel like myself again. When can we expect the results? And…what happens after that? I apologize for asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Mr. Osumi. It’s important for you to understand what’s going on every step of the way. The lab work should be completed within a few days, usually 2-3 business days. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Based on the results, we can then formulate a plan. This might include lifestyle modifications like diet and exercise, stress management techniques, or, if necessary, medication. We'll discuss all of your options and work together to find the best approach for you. In the meantime, I'd recommend continuing to focus on getting adequate rest, staying hydrated, and eating a balanced diet, as best you can. It’s also important to be mindful of your emotional well-being. Grief can take time to process, and it's okay to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think…I think you’ve covered everything. Everything sounds…reasonable, and I appreciate your thoroughness. I trust your recommendations, Doctor. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as I can. Thank you for listening to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. It means a lot. I suppose that’s all for now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Osumi. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
