DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's…well, it's my sight. It’s been going steadily, shall we say, downhill. Not abruptly, you understand. I’m not one for dramatics. Just…less clear. It’s bothersome, naturally. A man needs his sight.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Alcorta. It's certainly concerning when you notice changes in your vision. “Less clear” is a good way to describe it. And you're right to come in. Not abrupt, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. It hasn't been like someone flipped a switch. More…a gradual fading. Like an old photograph, perhaps. Though I assure you, my life isn’t nearly as interesting as a good photograph. It's just…difficult to make out details now. Especially at a distance. And reading…well, that’s becoming a chore. Not that I do much reading these days. Mostly just the newspaper. But even that is a struggle.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual fading, more noticeable with distance and reading. That helps me get a picture of what’s going on. And you mentioned the newspaper – is that what prompted you to come in today, the difficulty with reading it?
PATIENT: Not solely, Doctor. Though the newspaper was…the final straw, one might say. It’s more that I was noticing it in general. Difficulty judging distances… bumping into things. Small things, really. But they add up. A gentleman prides himself on his awareness, you see. And I found myself…lacking. It felt…undignified. It was my daughter, actually, who insisted I come. She said I was “straining” to see things. Daughters. Always noticing everything.
DOCTOR: Daughters do notice everything, it's true. It’s good she encouraged you to come in. So, this has been a gradual change over…how long would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. It’s not as though I marked it on a calendar, you understand. Perhaps…six months? Maybe longer. Time tends to…blur as one gets older. It wasn't sudden, as I’ve said. Just…a slow creep. I kept hoping it would correct itself, naturally. These things often do, you know. But it hasn’t. It’s…persistently worsening. Though, thankfully, not rapidly.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or longer of a gradual worsening. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the blurry vision?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. Well…my eyes do feel a bit…dry, sometimes. Not constantly, mind you. Just occasionally. And I suppose…everything looks a bit…washed out. Colors aren’t as vibrant as they used to be. Though, that could just be the summer light, couldn't it? Everything’s so bright these days. I hadn't really paid it much attention, to be honest. I tend not to dwell on…discomfort. It’s unproductive.
DOCTOR: Dryness and colors seeming less vibrant… okay. And have you experienced any floaters – little spots or shapes that seem to drift across your vision?
PATIENT: Floaters? Now there's a word I haven't heard in some time. No, Doctor, I haven't seen any “floaters”. Spots? Shapes drifting? No. Perfectly clear vision, otherwise. Though, admittedly, I don't stare at blank walls often enough to notice such things. I’m a man of action, not contemplation, you understand. I’m not one for…idleness. Perhaps I simply haven’t looked hard enough.
DOCTOR: I understand. No need to apologize for not staring at blank walls. Okay, so no floaters. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Heavens, no. I watch what I eat. High blood pressure? Not that I’m aware of. I had a doctor, years ago, back in Tulsa. He checked all that sort of thing. Said I was…robust. That was some time ago, naturally. I haven’t seen a physician regularly since…well, since my divorce. One tends to…neglect these things when one is…unburdened. Not that I’m complaining. It's just…life changes priorities, you understand. I’ve always been a relatively healthy man. A bit of arthritis, perhaps. But nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no diabetes or high blood pressure that you’re aware of. Arthritis is noted. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see... Nothing major, thankfully. I had my tonsils removed as a boy. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And I broke my wrist…oh, must have been fifty years ago, playing football. A minor fracture, quickly healed. Other than that…no. I’ve been remarkably fortunate, all things considered. I pride myself on avoiding hospitals, you understand. Germs and…well, the general unpleasantness of the place. I’ve always been a man who prefers to be…self-reliant. Though, admittedly, I’m beginning to see the limitations of that philosophy.
DOCTOR: Tonsils and a wrist fracture, noted. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. A…complicated subject, Doctor. My mother…she had poor eyesight in her later years. I believe it was cataracts. Though, she was never particularly diligent about seeking medical attention. A stubborn woman, my mother. My father…he was a robust man, like myself. Never seemed to have any health problems. Though he did have a rather unfortunate fondness for strong liquor. As for my grandparents…I scarcely knew them. My father didn’t speak much of his side of the family. The Cherokee, you see. A bit…distant, in those days. So, truthfully, I can’t offer you much in the way of definitive answers. It’s a rather…murky subject, family history. I’m not one for dwelling on the past.
DOCTOR: Okay, cataracts in your mother. That’s helpful. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! I find the habit…repugnant. Always have. My father smoked, you see. A dreadful cough he had. I witnessed his struggle…enough to discourage me, naturally. No, Doctor, I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I’ve always frowned upon those who do. It’s…a self-destructive habit, frankly. A lack of discipline. I pride myself on a healthy lifestyle. Moderation in all things, you understand. Though, admittedly, I do enjoy a glass of scotch now and then. But that’s hardly the same thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. No smoking. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: As I mentioned, Doctor, a glass of scotch now and then. Perhaps one or two on a weekend. Rarely more. I wouldn’t say I indulge…it’s more of a…ritual. A civilized practice. I don't partake to excess, naturally. I’m a man who appreciates quality, not quantity, you understand. I certainly wouldn't describe myself as a…drinker. I maintain a clear head, always. A gentleman must be in control of his faculties. And I assure you, my scotch consumption has never interfered with my…responsibilities. It’s merely a…pleasant accompaniment to a quiet evening. Now, is this line of questioning leading somewhere, Doctor? I confess, I'm rather impatient with unnecessary inquiries.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mr. Alcorta. Just gathering information to get a complete picture. And yes, it is leading somewhere. I appreciate your patience. One final question before we move on to a brief examination. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? No, Doctor, absolutely not. I pride myself on maintaining my health naturally. I haven't taken a pill in…well, decades, I suppose. A bit of aspirin now and then for a headache, perhaps. But nothing regular. I find most medications…unnecessary. And frankly, I’m rather skeptical of their effectiveness. A healthy diet, regular exercise…those are the true remedies, you understand. I haven’t the need for artificial assistance. Now, if you’ll excuse me, Doctor, I trust this examination won't be too…invasive? I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, frankly. It feels…undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand. No regular medications. And no, the examination will be quite simple. I’ll just check your vision, look into your eyes with a light, and perhaps check your blood pressure. Nothing invasive at all. If you’re comfortable, we can start with your vision?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed, then. But do be gentle, if you please. And I trust you’ll explain everything as you go? I dislike surprises. It's a…manly thing, I suppose. A need for control. I’m ready when you are. Though, I must warn you, my vision is…clearly deteriorating. Don't expect a particularly impressive performance. I'm merely hoping to ascertain the extent of the damage, so to speak.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Alcorta. I’ll explain everything as we go. And don’t worry about the results, we’re just establishing a baseline. Alright, could you please stand about ten feet away from the chart and cover your left eye with your hand?
PATIENT: Ten feet, you say? A rather…substantial distance. My depth perception isn’t what it used to be, you know. Proceed, then. But please, don't expect miracles. This is likely to be…disappointing. Now, what precisely am I supposed to be…discerning? Are those letters, or some sort of…abstract design? Honestly, the chart is rather blurry already. Perhaps we should begin closer? It feels…undignified, straining to see something that’s clearly beyond my capabilities.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Alcorta. We can adjust as needed. Don’t worry about being dignified. Let's try this distance. I’ll start with the largest letters at the top. Can you read the first letter you see?
PATIENT: The largest letter… Hmm. It appears to be… a… a rather amorphous shape. Is it an 'E'? Or perhaps a 'C'? Honestly, it’s difficult to say. They’re all rather…blurry. Is the lighting adequate? Perhaps a stronger light source would be beneficial. This is quite…trying. I'm starting to feel a headache coming on. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect my vision is considerably worse than you anticipate. Perhaps we should simply skip to the…diagnosis? I'm not one for prolonged examinations, you understand. They’re…unproductive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. We’ll lower the chart. Don’t worry, we’ll get a good assessment. Let's try reading just the very first letter on the top line…the largest one. Can you see that letter now?
PATIENT: Good heavens… it still appears blurry. Honestly, Doctor, this is… disheartening. Is it… an 'F'? No, wait… perhaps a 'P'? Or is it merely an indistinct smudge? It’s quite impossible to say with any certainty. My eyes are starting to ache, and frankly, this entire exercise feels rather… humiliating. Are you certain this chart is… calibrated correctly? Perhaps a more… modern device would be beneficial? Honestly, I suspect my vision is far more compromised than you realize. I’m starting to feel quite… discouraged. Perhaps we should simply discuss potential remedies? I'm not one for prolonged suffering, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. It appears we’re having significant difficulty. That’s alright. Let’s move on to something different then. I’m going to use a handheld light to look directly into your eyes. This won’t hurt, but it will require you to look straight ahead. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed, then. But please, be gentle. I have sensitive eyes, you know. And do try to be swift. I dislike prolonged exposure to bright lights. It's… unsettling. And do explain what precisely you're… observing. I'm not one for mystery, you understand. Transparency is key. Now, where is this light? And what are you hoping to… discern? Honestly, this entire examination feels rather… futile. I suspect my vision is beyond repair. Perhaps we should simply discuss potential… aids? A magnifying glass, perhaps? Or a seeing-eye dog? I'm merely trying to be… pragmatic.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I’m going to shine this light into each eye separately. I’m looking at the lens of your eye, the retina at the back, and the optic nerve. I’m checking for any clouding of the lens – cataracts, for example – or any damage to the retina or optic nerve. It won’t take long. Please just look straight ahead. Okay, right eye is complete. Now, let’s look at your left eye.
PATIENT: Very well. Proceed. But do be gentle, Doctor. And do explain what precisely you’re… observing. Are you detecting any… clouding? Any…damage? I confess, I’m not particularly fond of having foreign objects—or in this case, bright lights—shining into my eyes. It’s… unsettling. Honestly, I suspect my vision is considerably worse than you anticipated. It’s… profoundly disheartening. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I'm starting to see spots. Perhaps we should simply discuss potential… solutions? I'm not one for prolonged examinations, you understand. They’re… unproductive. Now, do proceed with the other eye, if you must. But do be swift. And do be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. That’s complete. Thank you for your patience. Based on what I’ve observed, your vision is significantly reduced. I'm seeing some clouding of the lenses in both eyes – which could be early cataracts – and some subtle changes to the optic nerves. To get a more definitive assessment, I would like to schedule you for a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist. They have specialized equipment to measure the extent of the clouding and evaluate the health of your optic nerves. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An ophthalmologist, you say? Specialized equipment? Yes, Doctor, that sounds… entirely reasonable. It seems my vision is considerably worse than I anticipated. Cataracts, you say? A rather… unpleasant prospect. Honestly, this entire experience has been… profoundly unsettling. Very well, proceed with scheduling an appointment. Though, I must warn you, I have a… rather busy schedule. And I do dislike prolonged waiting times. And do ensure that this ophthalmologist is… reputable. I do not wish to be subjected to unnecessary procedures or… frivolous examinations. Now, what precisely does this examination entail? And how long will it take? And what, precisely, are the potential… remedies? I'm merely trying to be… pragmatic, Doctor. Now, do proceed. And do be swift.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Alcorta. I’ll schedule you with Dr. Ramirez—she’s an excellent ophthalmologist, highly regarded in the area. The comprehensive exam will involve a series of tests to measure your vision, assess the health of your eyes, and determine the extent of the cataracts. It typically takes about an hour or two. Based on the results of the exam, potential remedies include prescription glasses—to help improve your vision—or cataract surgery—to remove the clouded lenses and restore your vision. We won't know which is the best option until we have the results of the exam. I’ve scheduled you for an appointment with Dr. Ramirez on August 16th at 10:00 AM. Here’s a referral slip and the contact information for her office. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: August 16th, you say? Very well. Though, I must warn you, I have a… rather full schedule. I trust this appointment will not unduly disrupt my… activities. And do ensure that Dr. Ramirez is… punctual. I do not appreciate wasting my time. Prescription glasses, you say? Cataract surgery? A rather… alarming prospect. Honestly, the entire situation is… profoundly unsettling. Very well, Doctor. I suppose there’s nothing more to be done at this juncture. Thank you for your… assistance. Though, I must confess, I remain… skeptical. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’m starting to see spots again. Perhaps a cup of tea would be beneficial. Now, do I require any further… instructions? Or may I be on my way?
DOCTOR: You're quite welcome, Mr. Alcorta. No further instructions are needed. Just be sure to bring your current glasses—if you have them—and a list of any medications you're taking to your appointment with Dr. Ramirez. And if you experience any sudden changes in your vision—such as a sudden increase in floaters or a loss of vision—please contact her office immediately. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Alcorta. I hope you find some relief soon. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavor to remember your… instructions. And I shall certainly contact Dr. Ramirez—if and when the need arises. Very well, then. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you for your… assistance. Though, I must confess, I remain… skeptical.
