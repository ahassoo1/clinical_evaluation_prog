DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Coby, is it?
PATIENT: Yep, Sammie Coby. And it's Mr. Coby, if you don't mind. Look, I don't usually come to doctors, but this heat... it's something else this year. Never been this bad, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I understand. Heatstroke is becoming… more common. So, you're here because of the heat?
PATIENT: "Heatstroke"? Now, hold on. I haven't got heatstroke. I just... can't handle the heat like I used to. I get all flushed, feel weak, and just generally miserable. It's not like I'm collapsing or anything. Just… uncomfortable. And frankly, a man shouldn't be bothered by a bit of sunshine. My grandfather climbed Everest, you know. Never complained about a little warmth.
DOCTOR: Everest is... different. And discomfort can be a sign of something serious. Let’s try to be specific. When did this start?
PATIENT: Specific? Alright, alright. Let me think… It's been getting worse over the last few summers, but this summer, it really hit me hard. Maybe... June? Yeah, around June. It was a particularly hot spell then, and I was working on Mrs. Henderson’s roof. Bad idea, clearly. But a job's a job. It’s not like I can just stop working when it gets a bit warm, you know? People need things fixed.
DOCTOR: So, it seems to be triggered by exertion in the heat. Any dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Not exactly dizziness. It's more… lightheaded. Like when you stand up too fast, but it doesn’t go away as quick. And sometimes, my hands get shaky. Not all the time, just when it’s really hot and I’ve been doing something. It’s… bothersome, is what it is. Makes painting a real challenge, let me tell you. Can’t be having shaky hands with a brush, now can you?
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing nausea, vomiting, headache, or any changes in your mental state?
PATIENT: Changes in my mental state? What is that supposed to mean? I feel perfectly fine in the head, thank you very much! Maybe a bit irritable when folks ask silly questions, but that’s just my nature. No vomiting, no headaches, and I haven’t been sick to my stomach. Just… warm. And uncomfortable. Honestly, doctor, I think I just need a fan. A good, strong fan. People used to deal with heat just fine without all these questions.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s do a quick exam, just to be thorough. Blood pressure, pulse… and I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Just a formality. Please sit back.
PATIENT: “Formality,” huh? Honestly. Fine. But don't go poking and prodding too much, alright? I've got things to do. And make it quick. This heat isn't going to get any cooler waiting for a doctor's exam.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148/92. Pulse is 88, regular. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Skin is warm and dry… though a little flushed as you mentioned. No edema. Have you checked your hydration levels?
PATIENT: "Hydration levels?" What does that even mean? I drink water when I’m thirsty, same as everyone else. I'm not a baby, doctor. I know when I need a drink. Look, I've been doing manual labor my whole life. I'm pretty good at taking care of myself. You’re making this much more complicated than it needs to be. This is just a bit of heat, is all. Now, are you going to tell me I need a fan, or are we going to keep talking about… hydration levels?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. It's possible you are experiencing heat exhaustion, which can progress to heatstroke if not addressed. Given your age and exertion, we need to be cautious. I'm going to order a basic metabolic panel to check your electrolytes and kidney function. And I want you to monitor your urine color – it should be pale yellow. Dark urine indicates dehydration. I’ll also print out a handout on heat safety, and I recommend limiting strenuous activity during the hottest part of the day.
PATIENT: “Limiting strenuous activity?” Now there's an idea. Easy for you to say, sitting in your nice cool office. People depend on me! Roofs don't fix themselves, you know. And handouts? Honestly. Look, I appreciate you looking at me, I guess, but I don’t need a lecture on… what was it? Heat safety? I’ve lived through plenty of summers. Just give me the paper, I’ll skim it. But don't expect me to change my whole life over a bit of sunshine. And how long will this “basic metabolic panel” take? I’ve got a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 24-48 hours. We’ll call you with the results. If you experience dizziness, confusion, nausea, or a high fever, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. And, Mr. Coby, I strongly recommend you reconsider limiting your activity during peak hours. It's about preventative care. Now, are there any other concerns I can address?
PATIENT: "Preventative care?" Honestly, the things they come up with these days. Alright, alright. 24 to 48 hours… fine. I'll try to remember to check that… urine color. Though I can’t promise I will. And no, that’s all. Just… this heat. Hopefully, it cools down soon. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got things to do. Don't bother calling if it’s just to tell me to drink more water. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Coby. Have a good day. And please, do try to stay cool. .
