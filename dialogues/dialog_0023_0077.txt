DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I am Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, they sent me. Said I gotta come get checked, even if I feel fine. Been working in that mine a long time, you know. Long, long time. They worried 'bout… what was it now? Air? Dust? Something like that. Don't feel nothin’ different, though.
DOCTOR: Right. A preventative examination due to your profession, then. Understandable, though frankly, at your age, a general check-up is advisable regardless. “Air” and “dust” are… reasonable concerns in your line of work, yes. Let's start with a complete history. How long exactly have you been working in the mine, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Sixty years. Sixty years I been down in that hole. Started when I was a young man, fresh off the boat, practically. Back then, nobody worried 'bout air and dust. You just worked. Now everyone got an opinion on everything. Makes a man tired, it does.
DOCTOR: Sixty years... that is… significant exposure. And you’ve experienced no changes in your health that you’ve noticed over that time?
PATIENT: Changes? No. Not really. Maybe a little stiffer in the mornings, but who isn’t? My wife used to rub cream on my back, bless her soul. But that was just old age, I reckon. Not that… mine air. It's a strong life, being a miner. Always has been. You need strong men for strong work, you see? Not like these young fellas now... too soft.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, "old age" can manifest in numerous ways, and it's prudent to rule out other potential causes, even if you feel perfectly healthy. Let’s proceed with a review of systems. Do you experience any shortness of breath, even with mild exertion?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. I walk to the shops, don't I? Carry my bags. Don’t puff and pant like a fish outta water. What kinda question is that? I’m a strong man! Always have been. You think sixty years down a mine makes a man weak? Huh!
DOCTOR: I'm simply gathering information, Mr. Bigger. It’s standard procedure. Do you have any cough?
PATIENT: Cough? Sometimes. Everyone coughs, Doctor. Especially when the weather changes. Dust gets in your throat. Little tickle, that’s all. Nothing to write home about. I ain’t hacking up my lungs, if that's what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: Right. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Never had chest pain. Heart’s strong as an ox. Always been regular, I'll tell ya. I eat my yams, get my sleep. Don't go gallivanting around like a young fool, you see. A man’s gotta take care of himself. It's not all 'air and dust' down in that mine, you know. It’s hard work. Builds a man up.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. My feet are… feet. They get tired after a long day, same as everything else. Never noticed any swelling. I wear good boots, you know. Proper boots. Can't be going around with sore feet when you're working in a mine. What kinda doctor asks about sore feet?
DOCTOR: It is standard, Mr. Bigger. Now, let’s move on. Have you experienced any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Well… it’s not what it used to be, I suppose. I need my glasses for reading now, and things get a little blurry in the distance. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? Happened to my wife too, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: And how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't know… maybe five, ten years now? Slow, like everything else getting older. A little at a time. It didn’t happen overnight, you see? I still see well enough to get around, don’t I? Can still make a cup of tea, can still… watch the television.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. I'm going to need to listen to your lungs and heart. Please remove your shirt and sit back on the examination table. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Now hold on a minute! Take my shirt off? What for? You think I got something wrong with my… chest? I told you, I feel fine! Sixty years down a mine, strong as an ox, and you wanna take my shirt off? This is… ridiculous!
DOCTOR: It's a standard part of a physical exam, Mr. Bigger. It allows me to assess your respiratory and cardiovascular health. It's not a personal matter, it’s simply… good medical practice. It’s hardly “ridiculous”. Unless you have a specific objection, I will need you to cooperate. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before proceeding?
PATIENT: Allergies? No! Never had allergies. Just… a strong constitution, you see? Strong, like a lion. Always been healthy. Look, I don't like being poked and prodded. I came here 'cause they told me to, not 'cause I felt like taking my shirt off for a young doctor to… to… examine me! It's… undignified.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. I understand your reluctance. Given your… insistence, and the lack of compelling symptoms, I will forego a full physical exam at this time. However, I strongly recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any potential lung damage from your years of mining. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? Hmph. That's… alright. If that's all. As long as you don’t want me taking my shirt off. X-ray sounds… sensible. Better safe than sorry, I suppose. But don’t go telling me I got something wrong, you hear? I feel perfectly fine!
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will arrange for you to have a chest X-ray at the imaging center across the street. Here is the referral form. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Please bring your insurance information with you. I'd also like you to monitor yourself for any shortness of breath, persistent cough, or chest pain and return immediately if you experience any of those symptoms. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… cough… pain… Yes, yes, I understand. Across the street, you say? I can manage that. Insurance card is in my wallet. Don't expect me to come running back for a little sniffle, though. Sixty years down a mine, I tell you! I’m a tough old bird.
DOCTOR: As you wish, Mr. Bigger. I’ve documented our conversation and your refusal of a full physical examination. If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact the clinic at the number on the form. I believe that concludes our consultation.
PATIENT: Right. Well, thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Though I still think all this fuss is unnecessary. You young people worry too much. .
