DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again, mostly on my right. And… honestly, I seem to be getting a lot of water infections lately too. It’s been going on for a while now.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” right side pain and frequent water infections… Okay. Let's start with this pain. When did it first start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s hard to say exactly. Probably… oh, six or seven months ago, I would guess. It comes and goes, you see. Not constant. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, other times it's a bit sharper. It’s just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Six or seven months…and it comes and goes. Is there anything specifically that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Not that I’ve noticed, really. I used to think it was maybe from lifting things, I do a bit of gardening, but it happens even when I haven’t been doing much at all. Sometimes I just wake up with it. It’s a bit of a mystery, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. A bit of a mystery… Okay. And what about these water infections?
PATIENT: Oh, they’ve been happening more often in the last few months, I’d say. Maybe three or four times now this year? Each time I get a burning feeling when I… well, when I go to the toilet. And it’s uncomfortable, of course. I’ve been getting them treated with… with pills, from the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Pills from the pharmacy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The pharmacist, he’s a good man, very helpful. He’s given me antibiotics a couple of times. He always asks how I’m feeling before giving them to me, of course. It’s just a small pharmacy in town, you see. It's easier than having to make an appointment all the time.
DOCTOR: It’s… convenient, yes. But over-the-counter antibiotics aren't ideal, Mr. Espinueva. It can lead to resistance, and we need to know exactly what we’re treating. Do you know what kind of pills they were?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I... I don't think I paid much attention to the name, Doctor. Just little white ones, mostly. He would give me a box, and I’d take them as directed. I suppose I should have asked. I’m not very good with remembering things like that, you see. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It’s…suboptimal. We need a proper urine culture to identify the bacteria causing the infections. And regarding this side pain, we'll need to do a physical examination and potentially some imaging. Let’s start with your vitals, and then I’ll listen to your abdomen. If you could just lie down for me, please.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds sensible. A proper look, you think? Yes, that’s a good idea. Here we go then. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Good. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Pulse is regular. Now, if you could just point to where you’re feeling the pain on your right side. Be specific. And then I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. It may be a little uncomfortable, but let me know if it's severe.
PATIENT: It's right… right here, Doctor. Sort of a deep ache, mostly. Sometimes it radiates a bit downwards, towards my back. Oh… yes, there. It’s… not too bad, but I can feel it. A bit tender, you see.
DOCTOR: Tender to palpation in the right flank. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Auscultating now… Bowel sounds are present, though a bit diminished. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no nausea or vomiting. And my bowel habits… well, they’ve been pretty normal, I suppose. Maybe a bit… slower than usual, now that you mention it. But nothing dramatic. I haven’t noticed anything really worrying. It’s just… everything seems a bit off, you see. This pain, the infections… it's tiring.
DOCTOR: “Tiring,” yes. Well, we need to get to the bottom of this. Given the recurring infections and the flank pain, and your age, we need to rule out a few things. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis with culture. And I want a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, with and without contrast. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh, goodness. I… I don't think so, Doctor. I haven't had any scans before, as far as I can remember. I've never been told I have any allergies, no. But… is it safe? What does it involve? I'm a bit nervous now, you see.
DOCTOR: “Safe” is relative, Mr. Espinueva. It’s a standard procedure. The contrast dye helps us see the structures in your abdomen more clearly. You'll receive it intravenously. There is a small risk of allergic reaction, which is why we ask. If you’ve ever had a reaction to iodine, that’s important to know. The scan itself is painless, you’ll lie on a table that slides into a machine. It takes about 30 minutes. We’ll need to arrange this with the radiology department. I'll have my nurse schedule it for you. In the meantime, avoid any heavy lifting, and drink plenty of fluids. Are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Oh, right. No, no iodine allergies, Doctor. Not that I recall. And I hardly take any medication at all, no. Just… just a little something for my knees sometimes, when they’re acting up. It’s… it's ibuprofen, I think. The regular kind, you get it at the pharmacy. Nothing else. This sounds like a lot, Doctor. Is it… is it serious?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Espinueva, recurring infections and unexplained flank pain require investigation. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we can’t simply ignore it. Ibuprofen is fine, just let me note that down. I’m ordering these tests as a precaution. We need to rule out kidney stones, infection, or other potential causes. I’ll have the nurse go over the instructions for the CT scan with you. And I want you to call immediately if you develop a fever, chills, or worsening pain. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. A lot to take in, of course. Thank you. I’ll just wait for the nurse then. .
DOCTOR: Very well. She'll be in shortly. .
