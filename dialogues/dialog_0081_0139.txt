DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just... fitness check. For... referee. Need paper say I okay. Want to be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: A fitness check for refereeing, alright. Understandable. Though, a proper medical evaluation is rarely quick, Mr. Shanor. We need to ensure a thorough assessment, regardless of the purpose. However, I can certainly streamline things. First, let’s start with the basics. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms – any pain, discomfort, shortness of breath, dizziness, or anything else unusual – recently?
PATIENT: No... nothing really. Feel okay. Little tired sometimes, work is hard. But not... sick. No pain. No dizzy. Just... want paper. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: “Just” wanting a paper isn't really a medical assessment, Mr. Shanor. Even if you feel alright, a basic physical exam and some questions are necessary to confirm your health status. It’s about ensuring you're fit enough for the demands of refereeing, and frankly, it's responsible practice on my part. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No… no doctor stuff before. Wife… she had things. But me? No. Work hard, eat rice, sleep. That is all. Sorry. Is… long story. Don't want talk about wife now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical history. I understand you don’t wish to discuss your wife’s health. That’s perfectly acceptable. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never surgery. Never hospital. Always work. When wife sick… she go hospital. I stay work. Need money. Simple.
DOCTOR: Very well. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. Let's move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, anything at all?
PATIENT: Um... my father… he get old, very weak. Fall down. That is all. Mother… she always strong. Work in field. No sick. No heart problems. Family… strong people, mostly. Except father, at end. Sorry. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Shanor. Family history can give us clues. So, your father had a fall in old age, and your mother was generally healthy. Was there anything specifically diagnosed with your father before the fall – weakness due to a medical condition, perhaps?
PATIENT: No. Just old. Very old. He work hard all life. No doctor. No medicine. Just… stop working. Then very weak. Fall. That is all. Village people… they say just old age. Is that enough? Can we do test now? I need paper soon.
DOCTOR: “Just old age” isn't a diagnosis, Mr. Shanor. It’s a description of a life stage. While I respect your time, a proper assessment requires gathering relevant information. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! No smoking. No drink. No drugs. I work. Very hard work. Sleep. Eat. That is all. Simple life. Bad life, maybe, but… healthy life. I think. Can we please do test now? I lose money every minute I’m here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand your concern about lost wages. However, I am obligated to conduct a reasonable examination to ensure your well-being and provide an accurate assessment for this fitness-for-duty clearance. It would be irresponsible of me to simply hand you a paper without doing so. Now, let's at least go over a quick review of systems. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Little tired sometimes, like I said. Work long hours. Eat same amount. Maybe… little less sleep. Hard to sleep when worry about money. But no big change. Just… normal tired. Everything normal. Please… test now? Is there a fee for this? I don’t have much money.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. I will proceed with a brief physical exam. It won't be as comprehensive as a full check-up, but it will allow me to assess your basic cardiovascular and respiratory health, and I will check your reflexes and musculoskeletal system. We will start with your vital signs. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes… yes. That okay. Quick, please. My boss… he is not happy I’m gone long. Hurry, doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat here. I need to check your blood pressure and pulse first. Please keep your arm still. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, please take a deep breath… and another one… good. Your breathing sounds clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Hurry, please. Is… is everything okay so far? I don't like doctors. Bad memories.
DOCTOR: Heart rhythm is regular, no murmurs detected. Pulse is still 72 and regular in both wrists. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. I’m now going to briefly assess your range of motion. Can you please raise both arms above your head?
PATIENT: Like this? Is… is that okay? Hurts little in shoulder, but… I always work hard. Maybe from work. Don't worry about shoulder. Need paper. That is all. Please hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs again, both front and back. Please take slow, deep breaths in and out. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi detected. Overall, Mr. Shanor, your physical exam is largely within normal limits. However, I noted some mild discomfort in your shoulder. To be thorough, and given your insistence on a fitness-for-duty clearance, I recommend a simple X-ray of your shoulder to rule out any underlying issues. Would you be willing to proceed with that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Is… is that expensive? I don’t have money for expensive tests! Is X-ray necessary? I just want to referee games. I’m strong. Always work. No time for tests. Can you just… give me the paper? Please? I’ll be careful. I promise. I need the money.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand your financial concerns. However, I cannot ethically provide a fitness-for-duty clearance without addressing your shoulder discomfort. Providing a paper stating you are fit for strenuous activity when there’s a potential underlying issue would be irresponsible. I do have a couple of options. I can write a note stating you present with mild shoulder discomfort and recommend follow-up with an orthopedist. That won’t be a full clearance, but it will acknowledge the issue. Or, we can discuss a payment plan for the X-ray. The cost is $250. Alternatively, I strongly recommend you consult with a primary care physician who may be able to address your concerns at a lower cost. I cannot, in good conscience, simply give you the paper without further investigation. It's a matter of patient safety.
PATIENT: $250… I don’t have that money. No. I… I’ll just… I’ll take the note. The note saying… discomfort. Is that all? Can I get the note now? Please… just the note. I need to go. My boss… he is very angry. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Shanor. I will write a note stating you present with mild shoulder discomfort and recommend follow-up with an orthopedist or primary care physician. Here you are. Please, do follow up with a doctor as soon as possible. Ignoring the discomfort could lead to a more serious injury. I understand you need to return to work. Please take care of yourself, Mr. Shanor. .
