DOCTOR: Good morning, San Sciarrotta. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card... a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. You know, like Uber or taxis. I want to make sure I’m allowed to do that, legally. I hope I'm at the right place.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're in the right place. It sounds like you're referring to a medical fitness determination to drive commercially – which would include ride-sharing services like Uber and taxis. We can certainly assess that for you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s a relief. Well… let’s see. Generally, I'm okay, I suppose, for seventy. I have a little arthritis in my hands, mostly. Makes gripping things a bit difficult sometimes, but nothing too bad. And my knees aren’t what they used to be, but I manage. I walk every day, if the weather’s good. Otherwise, I think I'm pretty healthy. I had some high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s controlled with medication now. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Thank you for sharing that. It’s good to hear you’re staying active with your daily walks. And it’s also good that your blood pressure is well-controlled. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me which medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s… Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for, oh, maybe five years now? My old doctor prescribed it. I haven't changed anything about it, I promise. I'm very careful with my pills. I have a little pill organizer.
DOCTOR: That's excellent—being consistent with your medication is very important. And ten milligrams of Lisinopril daily is a common dosage. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me see. No, I don’t think so. I used to have hay fever when I was a child, but I grew out of that. Nothing that requires an EpiPen or anything dramatic, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I haven't had any bad reactions to any medicine I can recall. I'm pretty lucky, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your medical history more broadly – have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or neurological issues?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I had a gallbladder removed many years ago, maybe thirty years. And… oh! I had a bout of diverticulitis a few years back, but that cleared up with antibiotics. Other than that… nothing major, I don’t think. My memory isn't perfect, you know. I had a lot of tests done when my blood pressure was first diagnosed, but the doctor said everything else looked fine.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. Gallbladder removal and a prior episode of diverticulitis. We can access records from your previous doctors, but it’s good you remember those details. Now, regarding your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, stroke, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a tough one. My mother had high blood pressure too, as I recall. And she had arthritis, like me. My father… he was healthy as a horse, honestly. Never sick a day in his life. He lived to be eighty-five, which is pretty good. My brother… he had some problems with his heart later in life, needed a pacemaker. But, honestly, we weren't very close. I don’t know a lot of the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s useful information. Family history of high blood pressure, arthritis, and heart disease. We'll keep that in mind. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Like… what do I do for fun? Honestly, Doctor, I'm seventy years old. It's not a very exciting life these days. But go ahead, ask me whatever you need to know. I just want to get this card and get back to my garden, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. When I ask about social history, I'm referring to things like your living situation, whether you smoke or drink alcohol, and your general level of activity. It helps me get a complete picture of your health. To start, do you live alone, or do you have someone who lives with you?
PATIENT: I live alone. My husband passed away about ten years ago. I have a daughter and a grandson, but they live a few hours away. They visit when they can, but it's not often. I manage just fine on my own, thank you. I keep busy with the garden and some light housework. It can get lonely sometimes, but I have my routines.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your husband, and I'm glad you have a good support system with your daughter and grandson, even if they're not nearby. It sounds like you’re very independent, which is wonderful. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I've never smoked. Never had the desire, thankfully. My husband tried it for a while, but he quit years before we got married. I always thought it was a silly habit. It smelled awful, too.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s excellent. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two, if it’s a special occasion. Nothing more than that, I promise. I don't drink to excess. It helps me relax. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, San. Occasional, moderate alcohol consumption is generally fine. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else about your health that you think I should know?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Oh! I sometimes get a little dizzy when I stand up quickly. Not often, but it happens. And I wear glasses, as you can see. I need them for reading and driving. Otherwise… no, I think that’s everything. Honestly, Doctor, I try to stay healthy. I eat my vegetables, I walk every day, and I try not to worry too much. Can we get this card now? I'm starting to get anxious.
DOCTOR: Yes, we absolutely can. It's good you mentioned the dizziness when standing – that's something we'll check during the exam. And I appreciate you being so open about your health. Before we begin, please understand this exam will assess your general physical condition, including your vision, reflexes, and coordination. It is necessary to determine if you meet the medical standards for safe commercial driving. First, let's take your blood pressure. Could you please remove your jacket and sit comfortably?
PATIENT: Alright. Just get it over with quickly, please? I don't like doctors. No offense. It's just… stressful.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. We'll be as efficient as possible. No offense taken at all. Please try to relax and don't talk while I'm taking the reading. It might slightly elevate it. 142 over 88. Hmm. A little elevated, but not significantly. We'll take it again in a few minutes. Now, let's check your pulse. 72 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Good. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Everything sounds good so far. Now, can you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can do that. Is this taking long? It's making me a bit dizzy just focusing like this. Not the standing up kind, just… focused dizzy.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. We are almost finished with this part. Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Good. Now, could you please read the letters on this eye chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Okay… let me see. Um… F… P… T… L…? Is that right? The bottom line is really hard to see. Oh dear… is something wrong?
DOCTOR: No, nothing is wrong, San. It appears you have some difficulty reading the smaller letters, which is not unexpected given your age and the fact that you wear glasses. It simply indicates a need for a stronger prescription. Now, let's check your reflexes. Left knee… good response. Right knee… good response. Both are equal and within normal limits. Finally, let's assess your balance and coordination. Could you please stand up and walk a straight line for me, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Alright… here goes. This is harder than it looks! I used to be a very good dancer, you know. There. I did it. But I’m a bit dizzy again, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed a slight wobble and some difficulty maintaining a perfectly straight line, and you mentioned feeling dizzy. That’s good information. Let’s have you sit down for a moment. Everything we've done so far gives us a good baseline. Now, I’m going to review your chart and my findings. Then, we'll discuss the next steps.
PATIENT: How long will this take, Doctor? I have a garden to get back to. And honestly, I’m starting to feel a little stressed. If I don’t pass this test, what happens then? Will I lose my license? Oh dear… this is a nightmare.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, San. It’s perfectly natural to feel stressed in this situation. Let me assure you, we are not trying to fail you. We simply need to determine if you meet the medical standards for safe commercial driving. Based on my examination, your vision is slightly impaired and you experienced some dizziness during the balance assessment. These are things we need to investigate further before making a determination. I recommend we schedule a consultation with an ophthalmologist to evaluate your vision thoroughly. Additionally, I would like to order a blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the dizziness. In the meantime, I’m not able to provide a definitive determination on your medical fitness to drive. We need the results of these tests first. I will provide you with a referral to the ophthalmologist and a lab requisition for the blood test. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An ophthalmologist… and a blood test… Oh dear. This is more complicated than I thought. I just wanted a simple card so I could drive people around. Alright… alright, I suppose I have no choice. I’ll go to the ophthalmologist and get the blood test. But how long will it take? I really need to get back to my garden. And will this cost a lot of money? I’m on a fixed income, you know. I hope this doesn't take too long. And I really hope I pass this test, eventually. I need to be able to drive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, San. Let's address those one by one. The ophthalmologist appointment should be scheduled within the next week or two, depending on their availability. I can help you with that if you’d like, and my office will assist with any insurance pre-authorization needed. The blood test can be done at any local lab, and the results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Regarding costs, your Medicare insurance should cover a significant portion of both the ophthalmology visit and the blood test. However, there may be some co-pays or deductibles depending on your specific plan. My office staff can also help you understand those costs and explore any potential financial assistance programs if needed. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid driving for commercial purposes until we have the results of these tests and a clear determination of your medical fitness. I will print out the referral to the ophthalmologist and the lab requisition for the blood test. I will also provide you with a summary of our conversation and a list of resources that may be helpful. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… acceptable. I suppose. Alright. Just please hurry with the paperwork. And thank you… for being patient with me. It’s just… stressful, you know? I hope everything goes well with the tests. And I really hope I can get back to driving soon. My garden needs me. It’s a lot of work, you know. A lot of work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I understand your stress, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Here is the referral and lab requisition, along with a summary of our conversation and contact information for the lab and ophthalmology office. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We will follow up with you once we have the results of the tests. And I wish you all the best with your garden. It sounds like a very important part of your life. Take care, San, and please drive safely in the meantime.
