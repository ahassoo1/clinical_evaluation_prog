DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Batara, nice to meet you too. It’s this itching, really. Just… all over. Started a couple weeks ago, I guess. It’s not painful, exactly, just… really annoying. Drives me a bit mad, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Itching, you say. And it's been going on for about two weeks now?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly two weeks. Maybe a little longer. It comes and goes, but it’s pretty consistent now. I thought it might be the laundry detergent, so I switched brands… didn’t help a bit. It's everywhere, arms, legs, back… even my stomach. Not my head, thankfully. That would be… difficult.
DOCTOR: Everywhere except the scalp, good to know. Is it worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t know if it’s worse at a specific time… but it definitely feels more intense after I shower. Like, really itchy right after I get out, then it calms down a little bit. It's odd. And I'm using the same soap I've always used. Maybe it’s the water? We've had some strange weather lately.
DOCTOR: The water… interesting. And you said it doesn’t seem to be related to any new detergents or soaps. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, no travel. Not since… well, not since my wife passed, actually. Just staying put here. Been keeping busy with the garden, mostly. Trying to, anyway. The itching makes it hard to concentrate sometimes. It’s just… frustrating. I don’t think I’ve been exposed to anything new. It’s a puzzle.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you're certain it's just itching?
PATIENT: Just itching, as far as I can tell. No rash, no bumps, no blisters… nothing visible, anyway. It’s just… a constant feeling like something’s crawling on me, even when nothing is. It doesn't feel like bug bites, or anything like that. I've checked a couple of times, really closely. It's just... really irritating. I keep thinking it's something simple I'm missing. Honestly, I’m starting to lose sleep over it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Let's have a look at your skin. I'm going to do a quick examination. Please sit up and loosen your shirt if you don't mind. I need to see your back, arms, and stomach. You can change in the room if you’d like.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. I was wondering when we'd get to that part. Just let me know if you see anything… strange. It's hard to see myself, you know? I'll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes… skin appears normal. No visible rash, lesions, or excoriations. No wheals or swelling. Temperature is within normal limits. Capillary refill is normal. It’s… perplexing. I don’t see anything obvious. Your skin is… well, it looks remarkably healthy, actually. But you're clearly bothered by this itching. Have you changed any medications recently?
PATIENT: No, no medication changes at all. I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, but I’ve been on that for years. Same pharmacy, same doctor prescribing it, everything. And I’m very careful about keeping track of my pills. Hmm… let me see. I did start using a new hand cream a couple of weeks ago. Lavender scented. Thought it might be nice… but I haven’t been using it very long, and it's just on my hands. Could that be it? It seems unlikely, but… I’m grasping at straws here, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Lavender scented hand cream… interesting. It’s possible, although uncommon. Allergies can present in… unusual ways. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, not food, not plants, not… anything. I grew up on a farm, you know? Exposed to everything. Bees, pollen, hay… I'm pretty tough. My wife used to say I was like an old oak tree, just kept on growing. But that was… a while ago now. Anyway, allergies seem unlikely, but I suppose anything is possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, since there’s no visible rash, and no clear triggers, and your medical history is… unremarkable, we’ll need to consider some other possibilities. It could be a manifestation of stress. Or… a more systemic issue. Have you been particularly stressed lately, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Stress… well, yes, I suppose. Losing my wife was… difficult. Still is. I try to keep busy, like I said with the garden, but it's… lonely. And dealing with everything afterward, the paperwork, the house… it’s a lot for one person. I don’t usually dwell on it, but… it's always there, in the back of my mind. Could that be causing this? It seems… a bit far-fetched. I’d think I’d have other symptoms, if that were the case. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a bit lost.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history, and the lack of any other findings, I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. Just to rule out anything… obvious. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to be thorough. I'll also write you a prescription for a topical hydrocortisone cream. Apply it to the itchy areas twice a day. It might provide some temporary relief. We’ll review the results when they come back, and discuss further steps if needed. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, alright. That sounds… sensible. Hydrocortisone cream… okay, I can do that. Twice a day, right. Actually, yes… one question. How long will it take to get the results back? And… what if the tests do show something? What would that mean? I don't want to jump to conclusions, but… it's always something, isn't it?
DOCTOR: The results should be back in about three to five business days. You can access them through the patient portal online, or my office will contact you if anything requires immediate attention. As for what it would mean… well, it could be a number of things. It could indicate a mild vitamin deficiency, or a slight hormonal imbalance. Or… it could be nothing at all. The important thing is to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’m not going to speculate about worst-case scenarios, Mr. Ferneding. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we're taking precautions. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Three to five days… I’ll check the portal. Thank you, Doctor Batara. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It’s… unsettling, not knowing. I'll try the cream and see if that helps. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll see you in a week to discuss the results. And please, try to manage your stress levels. It can have a significant impact on your overall health. Goodbye, Mr. Ferneding. .
