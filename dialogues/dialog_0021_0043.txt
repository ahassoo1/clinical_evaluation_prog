DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel, welcome. I’m Dr. Havird. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Havird. It's nice to meet you. Been havin’ this headache, right in the back of my head. Not a terrible one, but… persistent, you know? It's been goin’ on for a couple weeks now, and it just won't go away. Feels like a dull ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: A couple weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Started maybe around the 18th of July, give or take a day. I remember 'cause my granddaughter, Mai, she came to visit then. We were pickin’ berries, and it started kinda subtle while we were out. Didn’t think much of it at the time, figured it was just the sun or somethin’. But it hasn’t really gone away since.
DOCTOR: And it’s just… a dull ache, consistently?
PATIENT: Mostly, yeah. It's not like a throbbing pain, not like a migraine or anything I’ve ever had. It’s… constant, but not intense. Some days it's a little worse than others. When I get really tired, or if I’m walkin’ uphill for too long, it feels heavier. But most of the time, it’s just… there. It doesn't keep me up at night or anything, but it's definitely noticeable. It's just… annoying, you know? I’m a pretty active guy, even at my age, and it’s slowin’ me down a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything for it?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. A little bit of everything, really. I took some ibuprofen, you know, the regular stuff. Didn't really do much. My daughter, she gave me some of those fancy herbal things… ginseng, I think? Didn’t seem to help either. I tried resting, drinkin’ lots of water, the usual. Honestly, Doctor, I’m startin’ to wonder if it’s somethin’ serious. I’m not a fella who usually complains, so… it's got me a little worried.
DOCTOR: Hm. Herbal remedies… right. And you said it's been consistently there since around the 18th?
PATIENT: Yep. Pretty much. Now that I think about it, it wasn’t instant on the 18th. It started kinda faint that day, and got a little stronger each day after that. It wasn't like bam, headache. More like… creep, headache. And like I said, gettin' tired makes it worse. I was helpin' my grandson build a fence last week, and by the end of the day, I had to lie down. Usually, I could just power through that sort of thing. I’m a retired financial advisor, so I mostly just sit at a desk now, but I try to stay active. It’s just…this headache is stickin’ around.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… no fever, no dizziness. My vision’s been okay, as far as I can tell. No trouble talkin’ or walkin’, like you see on those TV shows. No nausea or anything like that. Honestly, Doctor, that's the frustrating part. It’s just… the headache. That's it. It doesn’t feel like anything serious, but it won’t go away. And I’m gettin’ up there in age, you know? I like to keep an eye on things. It's just a nagging little pain at the back of my head. I haven’t noticed any change in my appetite either. Still eatin’ regular.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you’re currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Never really been much of a medicine man, you know? I try to stay healthy, eat right, get some exercise. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but I got it under control with diet and exercise. Been off the pills for… oh, maybe five or six years now? Doc told me I was doin' so well, I didn’t need ‘em anymore. I take a multi-vitamin every day, that’s about it. Nothing else. I try to avoid puttin’ too many chemicals in my body, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a quick exam, just to rule things out. Could you sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. No problem. Happy to do whatever you need. Just point me in the right direction. It’s been a while since I’ve been to a doctor, to be honest. I usually just try to tough things out myself, but this headache… it's been stickin’ around too long to ignore.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your reflexes and your neurological function, just a quick check. Please, try to relax. Deep breaths in and out… everything sounds within normal limits. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon for your age, but symmetric. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves… can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yep, no problem. Just point it wherever you need, Doctor. I'm tryin' to focus, but my eyes ain't what they used to be, you know? It’s a little harder than it used to be, but I can do it. Hopefully, I’m not messin’ anything up. I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… It's… 2025, right? August 2nd, 2025. My daughter keeps me up to date on things, so I try to remember. It's hard sometimes, you know, gettin' older. The dates… they kinda blend together. But yeah, 2025. Definitely 2025. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Is that enough? I don’t want to break anything. It's kinda hard, you know, these old hands ain't as nimble as they once were. I used to be able to grip a hammer all day long, buildin' fences and whatnot. But now… they get tired pretty easy. Everything alright?
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, everything seems within normal limits for your age. But given the persistence of the headache, and the fact that it's causing you concern, I think we should get a CT scan, just to rule out anything serious. It's probably nothing, but better safe than sorry. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A CT scan, huh? Well… if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then I guess so. I'm not a fan of radiation or any of that stuff, but I understand you want to be careful. I just want to know what's causing this headache. If it’s something serious, I want to catch it early. So… yeah. Let’s do the scan. When can we schedule it?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse schedule it for you. It’s best to do it as soon as possible. You’ll need to abstain from caffeine for 24 hours before the scan, and let them know if you have any allergies. In the meantime, I'll prescribe you a mild pain reliever, just to manage the discomfort. It’s probably just a tension headache, but we’ll know for sure after the scan. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. No caffeine, mild pain reliever… I can do that. Thank you for takin' the time to listen to me, and for runnin' the tests. I appreciate it. I’ve been worryin' about this headache for a while now, and it's good to know we're takin' steps to figure out what's goin’ on. I’ll let the nurse know about my allergies when she schedules the scan. Thanks again, Doctor Havird. I hope it’s nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly. Don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms. Have a good day.
