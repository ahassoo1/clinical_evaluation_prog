DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor recently, and it’s…different. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it’s not my usual smell, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. It's good you brought it to my attention. Changes like that can be due to a number of things. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe a month ago? Around the end of June, I’d say. I didn’t really pay much attention at first, just thought maybe it was the heat, you know? I work outside a lot, laying floors, and it gets pretty sweaty. But it hasn’t gone away, even when it’s cooler. It's…almost metallic, if that makes sense. Not strong, just a hint of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, around the end of June. And you describe it as…a hint of metallic odor. That’s helpful. Do you notice it all the time, or is it more noticeable after activity, like when you’ve been laying floors?
PATIENT: It’s definitely more noticeable after I’ve been working. Like, I can smell it on my clothes, even after I shower. But I think… I think I can sometimes smell it even when I haven't done anything strenuous. It's faint then, though. It's hard to say for sure if I'm just being paranoid, honestly. It's just…not me.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re paying attention to your body and noticing these changes. It’s never a bad thing to investigate. And it doesn’t sound like you’re being paranoid at all. Let's try to rule out some possibilities. Now, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes…let me see. I've been a little more tired than usual, I guess. Not exhausted, but just…dragging a bit more at the end of the day. And I think my appetite has been a bit smaller. I used to be able to eat a good-sized lunch, but lately, I'm just not as hungry. Nothing major, just…less. Oh, and I’ve had a few headaches, but they come and go. Nothing I’d usually take anything for, just mild ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue, decreased appetite, and some mild headaches. Those could be related, or they could be completely separate things. Do you have any trouble catching your breath, Kerriann?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I can breathe just fine. I do a lot of physical work, remember? Laying floors is pretty demanding, and I haven't had any problems with shortness of breath or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, I remember you mentioning that. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox, measles… but nothing serious. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that’s it. And I’m on Medicare now, just the basic coverage. I don't take any regular medications, just over-the-counter pain relievers when I need them for my back. It gets sore sometimes from the work.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removed ten years ago, otherwise healthy. No regular medications. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. And I haven’t had any problems with pollen or dust or anything like that. I've always been pretty lucky, allergy-wise.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes. He had it for a long time, towards the end of his life. And my sister has arthritis, but that's about it. Nobody else in my immediate family had any major health problems, as far as I know. We weren't really big on talking about medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis in the family. That's helpful to know. Now, one last thing before we do a quick exam. What is your social history like?
PATIENT: Social history…well, I’m divorced. It was a long time ago, though. I live alone. I work a lot, mostly. I don't really have a lot of hobbies, if I’m honest. Just…work and trying to keep busy. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that's about it. I don’t do any drugs.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that with me, Kerriann. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and skin. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Finco. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your vital signs. Alright, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds normal—no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear on both sides. Your throat looks healthy, no signs of infection. Skin appears normal, although I do notice a very faint, metallic scent on your skin…almost like a faint iron smell. It’s very subtle. Now, I'd like to check your iron levels with a blood test, just to rule out anything unusual. We'll also do a complete blood count to check for any other abnormalities. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly okay. If that's what you think is best, Dr. Finco, then let’s do it. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what's going on, and if a blood test can help, then definitely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the order for the lab work now. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. It's a pretty standard procedure. It’ll take a few days to get the results back, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you notice any significant changes in your condition—like fever, shortness of breath, or severe fatigue—please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you, Dr. Finco. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not dismissing my concerns. It's a little embarrassing talking about body odor, but you made me feel comfortable. I’ll wait for the phlebotomist.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. It’s important to me that my patients feel comfortable discussing anything that’s concerning them. That’s what I’m here for. We'll get to the bottom of this. Just relax, and we'll take it one step at a time. The phlebotomist should be with you shortly. Thank you for coming in today.
