DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Bulaong, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... my chest hurts. Not all the time, but... sometimes. It's in my breast.
DOCTOR: "Sometimes." Right. And how long has this "sometimes" been going on?
PATIENT: Maybe... two, three weeks? I don't keep good track of dates. It comes and goes. Not every day.
DOCTOR: And can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Uh... it's not a sharp pain. More like... a dull ache? Sometimes it feels full, like it's heavy. Not really bad bad, just... uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: “Heavy,” alright. And does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... I think when I'm working on the roof, if I move my arms a lot... it feels more sore. But I always move my arms at work.
DOCTOR: The roof, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I’m a roofer. It's hard work, you know? Lots of lifting and reaching.
DOCTOR: Well, naturally it's going to ache if you’re doing manual labor. Let’s just… see. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll feel around. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are… normal. Lungs are clear. Chest wall feels… tender, as expected. You’re a thin young man, doing strenuous work. Probably just muscle strain.
PATIENT: Strain? You mean... like I pulled something?
DOCTOR: Precisely. A common occurrence with your line of work. I’m going to recommend you take some over-the-counter ibuprofen, 600 milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain. And try to… pace yourself. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Um... no, I don't think so. My wife usually gets the medicine. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, if you develop a rash or difficulty breathing, stop taking the ibuprofen immediately and go to the emergency room. Otherwise, monitor it for a week. If it doesn’t improve, or gets worse… then, I suppose, you can come back. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: No... I guess not. Just... it worried me, you know? Because... it's in my chest. Men don't usually get chest pain, right?
DOCTOR: Men do get chest pain, Mr. Bulaong. It's just… less common for it to be a serious issue. But you're young and otherwise healthy. Muscle strain is the most likely explanation. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I’m going to print out a discharge summary for you.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: There. Take it easy, and try not to overdo it. Next! .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you. .
