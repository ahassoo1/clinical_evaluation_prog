DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Tomassoni. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Dr. Alanes. It is a pleasure to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… That’s a bit difficult to recall precisely. I believe it has to do with some… swelling? Yes, swelling somewhere. I apologize, my memory isn’t what it once was. I only have vague recollections, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Tomassoni. We’ll take our time and try to piece things together. Swelling is a good starting point. Can you tell me where you’ve noticed this swelling?
PATIENT: Oh… where is it? It feels… on my face, I think? Perhaps my jaw? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. It isn’t terribly painful, more… noticeable. And it seems to come and go. I’m truly sorry for being so vague. It’s frustrating for both of us, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Tomassoni. It's perfectly alright. We'll get to the bottom of it. So, swelling in the face and jaw area that comes and goes. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it a recent development?
PATIENT: Recent, I believe. Though, time… it slips away, doesn’t it? I’d say within the last few weeks, perhaps a month? It didn't start suddenly, more… gradually. It was subtle at first, and now it's become more… apparent. I haven’t been able to identify anything specific that triggers it, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset of swelling in the face and jaw area over the past month. And no obvious triggers that you’ve noticed. Let’s see… according to your chart, you haven’t seen a doctor here before. That’s alright. Just helps me get a better picture. To help me understand a little better, can you describe the swelling?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It’s… soft, I suppose. Not hard or firm. And it’s not… uniformly distributed, if you understand what I mean. Some days it’s more pronounced on one side than the other. It doesn’t feel hot to the touch, and as I mentioned before, it’s not particularly painful. Just… there. I hope that makes sense. It's hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Mr. Tomassoni. Soft, non-uniform swelling, not hot or painful. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. I… I have been feeling a little more tired than usual, perhaps? And my appetite hasn’t been quite what it once was, but I attributed that to the summer heat. Nothing drastic, mind you. No fever, no chills, no… I don’t believe so. Just a general feeling of being… slightly off. It’s difficult to pinpoint anything concrete, I apologize. My recall is… spotty, as I’ve mentioned.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Tomassoni. We'll take things slowly. Fatigue and a decreased appetite along with the swelling. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant medical problems… Hmm. I… I had a bout of bronchitis a few years ago, I believe. Nothing serious, resolved with antibiotics. And I broke my arm as a child, but that was a long time ago. As for anything chronic… I don’t recall anything significant. I’ve always been relatively healthy, thankfully. Though, my memory… it’s making this rather difficult. Are you able to access any records from previous doctors, perhaps? That might be helpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly look into that. Let me check if there are any records available in our system. While I do that, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… That’s another good question. I don’t take anything regularly, no. Perhaps an occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing prescribed. Just over-the-counter. I generally try to avoid medication if possible. I pride myself on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, though lately… well, I’ve been feeling a little less like myself. I truly apologize for being so unhelpful. This is all very frustrating.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Mr. Tomassoni. It's perfectly alright. It's more common than you think to have difficulty recalling details. No regular medications, just occasional pain relievers. And no known allergies?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Food, medication, anything. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. Though, again, my memory… it’s difficult to be completely certain. But I’m fairly confident I don’t have any allergies. Is there anything else I should be recalling? I want to be as helpful as possible, despite my… limitations.
DOCTOR: No, that’s very helpful, Mr. Tomassoni. We’ll proceed from here. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that's alright with you. I’ll just take a look at your face and neck, and perhaps feel your lymph nodes. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that’s perfectly alright, Dr. Alanes. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment completely. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my… ramblings. And I apologize again for being so vague. I hope the examination provides some clarity. Please don't hesitate to ask if you need anything further from me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tomassoni. I’m just going to feel along your jawline and neck to check for any swelling or tenderness. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. I’m noting some mild, diffuse swelling along your jawline, consistent with what you’ve described. The swelling is soft and non-tender to the touch. I don’t detect any enlarged lymph nodes. Your thyroid feels normal as well. I’m also not hearing any bruits with my stethoscope. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Alanes, no pain at all. It's… just a little pressure, perhaps? But certainly no discomfort. It feels… normal, honestly. It's just there. I appreciate you being so thorough. I know I'm not making this easy for you. Is there anything else I can do to assist? Perhaps try to recall any specific incidents that might be relevant? I'll do my best, though I can't make any promises.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not making it difficult at all, Mr. Tomassoni. And you’ve been very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, we need to consider a few possibilities. The swelling, fatigue, and decreased appetite could be related to a number of things, including a viral infection, mild inflammation, or potentially even stress. To help narrow things down, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel . These tests will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Dr. Alanes. A complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel… yes, that seems reasonable. If that will help determine the cause of this, then please, proceed. I trust your judgment completely. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience and understanding. When can I expect the results?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. Try to avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any worsening symptoms—such as fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain—please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Tomassoni?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Alanes, I don't believe so. You’ve answered all my questions, and you’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience, especially considering my… limitations. I will follow your recommendations and contact the office if anything changes. Thank you again for your time and assistance. I feel much better knowing that we’re taking steps to determine the cause of this. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tomassoni. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I’ll see you back here once the lab results are available. Have a good day, and get some rest. .
