DOCTOR: Hi Avril, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… I am here for this… telehealth thing. My daughter, she made the appointment. I am not very good with the computers, so she did it for me. It is… a check-up, yes? Just to see how I am doing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general check-up. That's perfectly fine. It’s great your daughter helped you get this scheduled. Just to confirm, the system says it's August 2nd, 2025, and you're here for a routine physical?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. August second. And… a physical, yes. Routine. My daughter said it was important. I… I feel okay, mostly. Just… old, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, “mostly okay” and sometimes feeling “old” – that’s a good starting point. Let’s start with a little more detail. Can you tell me about any specific things that are bothering you, even if it’s just a little thing?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my knees. They ache, especially when it is cold. And… sometimes my hands are a little stiff in the mornings. It does not last long, but… it is there. And my back… when I bend over, it makes a little pop sound. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, knees aching with the cold, morning stiffness in the hands, and a popping sound in your back when you bend over. Let's break these down a little. How long have you been noticing the knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Maybe… five years? It comes and goes. Worse in the winter, like I said. It is not… a sharp pain. More like a… dull ache. Sometimes I take ibuprofen, and it helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, five years of intermittent knee pain, worse in winter, relieved somewhat by ibuprofen. And the stiffness in your hands - how long does that usually last when it happens in the mornings?
PATIENT: Just… a few minutes. Maybe ten, sometimes. I move them around, make a fist, open them… and it goes away. It is not so bad, really. But… it is there, and it bothers me a little. I used to do a lot of sewing, but… it is harder now.
DOCTOR: Okay, morning hand stiffness lasting up to ten minutes, relieved with movement. And it's making your sewing more difficult. Let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Let me think… The doctor, my old doctor, he said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back. He put me on a pill, but I stopped taking it. I did not like taking pills. It made me feel… funny. And… I think he said something about my cholesterol. I do not remember very well. Was it bad? Is it still bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure treated with medication that you discontinued, and a possible issue with cholesterol. It’s okay that you stopped the medication if it made you feel unwell. We can definitely check both your blood pressure and cholesterol today. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes, I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Maybe twenty years? And… I broke my wrist when I was a young woman. It healed okay, but… sometimes it aches when it rains. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal about 20 years ago and a wrist fracture that occasionally aches with changes in the weather. Not a problem at all, that's good information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen, when my knees bother me. And… sometimes I take a vitamin D pill in the winter. My daughter says I need it. She worries about me not getting enough sunshine. I do not take much else. I try to eat healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed and a Vitamin D supplement in the winter. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I touch certain flowers, but… that is not a real allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Avril, that gives me a good start. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. We'll need to keep an eye on that. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me, and tell me where it hurts?
PATIENT: Yes, I can bend them. It hurts… right here, on the inside of both knees. It’s not a sharp pain, just… an ache. It feels worse when I bend them all the way. And… when I go down the stairs, it is very difficult. It feels… creaky. Like old wood.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain on the medial side of both knees with bending and going down stairs, described as an ache and creaky. There’s some mild tenderness on the inside of both knees, and a slight restriction in your full range of motion. Now, I’m going to check your wrists. Can you move them around for me, and tell me if anything hurts?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It does not hurt all the time. But… sometimes, when it is cold, or… damp, it gets a little stiff. And… if I use them too much, like when I am gardening, it aches a little. It is not a bad pain, just… annoying. Like an old twinge. It feels better when I move them around.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness and occasional aching in both wrists with cold weather and overuse, relieved with movement. No swelling or tenderness to the touch. Alright, Avril, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you are likely experiencing some osteoarthritis in your knees and possibly some mild arthritis in your wrists. Now, we can talk about some options for managing these symptoms, and I may order some X-rays of your knees just to confirm the diagnosis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. X-rays… okay. I do not mind. Arthritis… that is what my mother had. She had terrible pain. Will I have terrible pain too? And what… what can we do about it? I want to be able to… to still do my gardening, and… and not be so stiff.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, especially knowing your mother's experience. However, arthritis affects everyone differently. The goal isn’t necessarily to eliminate the pain entirely, but to manage it so you can continue to do the things you enjoy. There are a number of options. We can start with some lifestyle modifications like gentle exercise – things like walking, swimming, or water aerobics – to strengthen the muscles around your knees and wrists. Losing even a little bit of weight can help too. We can also consider over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed, but since you mentioned not liking the way those made you feel, we can explore other options like topical creams or supplements like glucosamine and chondroitin. I think ordering those X-rays would give us a clearer picture, and then we can create a more tailored plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good, Doctor. Gentle exercise… I think I can do that. Maybe walking. I used to walk a lot. And… I will try to lose some weight. The X-rays… yes, please. I want to know what is going on. And what about these creams? Are they… strong? I do not want anything that will make my skin… itchy. It is good to know there are options. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a great attitude. The creams are generally quite mild, and there are many different types available. We’ll start with a simple one – a topical NSAID – and see how your skin reacts. If you experience any itching or irritation, we can switch to a different option. Alright, I’m going to write an order for X-rays of both knees. The radiology department will call you to schedule an appointment. I also want you to start with those gentle exercises – maybe 20-30 minutes of walking a few times a week. And try to incorporate some stretches for your hands and wrists. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the X-ray results and see how you’re doing with the exercises. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks is fine. Thank you very much, Doctor. Walking and stretching… I can do that. And the X-rays… yes. I feel better knowing we are doing something. Will the X-rays show… how bad it is? Will they show if I need… something more serious?
DOCTOR: The X-rays will give us a clearer picture of the cartilage in your knees and help us assess the severity of the arthritis. It will help us determine if there is any joint damage and how much. It's unlikely that we'll need anything more serious right away. Most people with osteoarthritis can manage their symptoms effectively with lifestyle modifications, pain relievers, and physical therapy. However, if the X-rays show significant damage, we may consider other options, like injections or, in rare cases, surgery. But let’s focus on getting the X-rays done first and see what they show. Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient with me. And thank you for not… making me feel like I am just an old woman with aches and pains. I appreciate your kindness. I will make the appointment for the X-rays as soon as I can. I think that is all.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Avril. I’m glad I could help. Remember, it's important to stay active and listen to your body. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
