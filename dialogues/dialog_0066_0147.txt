DOCTOR: Hi Amy, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Well, I’ve been noticing a lump, or a mass, in my lower abdomen for a little while now. It’s been… concerning me, so I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. That’s definitely worth getting checked out, you're right to come in. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to describe. It doesn’t really hurt, not usually. Sometimes a little discomfort, like after I’ve been… active, but it’s not a sharp pain. It feels… firm, and it’s maybe the size of a plum? It's been there for, oh, I'd say about six weeks now, maybe a little longer. I haven’t noticed it getting much bigger, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, six weeks, plum-sized, firm, and generally not painful except for maybe some discomfort with activity. That gives me a good starting point. Now, when you say "active," can you be a little more specific about what kind of activities trigger that discomfort?
PATIENT: Well, I’m a choreographer, as you know. So, a lot of twisting, bending, lifting… even just long rehearsals can bring it on. It’s not crippling pain, more like a… a dull ache. And it seems worse if I’m doing a lot of floor work, you know, tumbling or anything like that. It doesn’t bother me when I’m just walking around normally.
DOCTOR: Choreography, okay, that explains the twisting and bending. So it's really related to the physical demands of your work. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this lump?
PATIENT: That’s right. And no, not really. No fever, no weight loss. My appetite is normal, and… well, everything else seems to be working as it should, if you know what I mean. I haven’t noticed any changes in my bowel habits or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: Good, that's helpful to know. No fever, no weight loss, normal bowel habits - those are all good signs. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox and things like that, but nothing serious. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything, and I don’t take any regular medications. My wife keeps telling me I need to be better about preventative care, but… I’m always so busy.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you've been generally healthy. It's never too late to start prioritizing preventative care, your wife sounds like a smart woman. Now, have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve managed to avoid all of that, thankfully. I have a… slight aversion to hospitals, if I'm honest. I try to stay away if I can. My mother always said I was a bit of a worrier.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, that's good. And it’s perfectly okay to be a worrier – it means you're thoughtful! Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father had high blood pressure, I believe, and my grandmother on my mother’s side had diabetes. Nothing… major, as far as I know. My mother’s side is Palestinian, and we don't have a lot of information about the health history of relatives back there, unfortunately. It’s a bit… difficult to trace things back.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your father, diabetes in your grandmother. That's helpful to know. It’s understandable about the difficulty tracing things back on your mother’s side. Now, just to complete the picture, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m married, as you know. My wife, Layla, and I live in the city. I’ve been a choreographer for about ten years now, mostly working with local dance companies. I don’t smoke, and I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat a healthy diet, but it can be hard with my schedule. And… well, that’s pretty much it. I keep pretty busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, married, choreographer, occasional wine, generally healthy diet. That gives me a good sense. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood vaccinations, and… I think that’s everything. I’m really not much of a medical person, Doctor. I hope I haven’t left anything out.
DOCTOR: You haven’t left anything out at all, Amy. Thank you for being so thorough. Okay, with your permission, I'd like to do a physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to gently feel your abdomen to get a better sense of this lump. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement. I’m a bit nervous, naturally, but I’m glad I came in.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable or painful. Okay… I'm feeling a firm mass in your lower abdomen, roughly the size of a plum, as you described. It doesn’t appear to be overly tender to the touch. It seems to be located… approximately two inches below your navel, and slightly to the right. There's no guarding or rebound tenderness, which is reassuring. Okay, Amy. Based on the exam, it’s definitely a mass there, as you noticed. While it doesn't seem immediately concerning, it's important to investigate further to determine what it is. I would like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. That will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. A CT scan and blood work. Yes, I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best. It’s just… waiting is always the hardest part, isn’t it? But yes, please, let’s do whatever is necessary to figure out what’s going on. And… will I need a referral for the CT scan?
DOCTOR: You're right, waiting is the hardest part. We'll get these tests ordered as quickly as possible. And yes, you will need a referral for the CT scan. I'll send that electronically to the radiology department at City General Hospital. They're excellent there. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your bowel habits, please go to the emergency room immediately. It's unlikely, but it's always best to be safe. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. So, I just wait for someone from the hospital to contact me to schedule the CT scan? And the blood work… can I do that here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. You'll receive a call from City General Hospital to schedule the CT scan. And yes, we can do the blood work right here at the clinic. I'll write you a requisition form, and our lab technician, Maria, will take care of it. It will just be a standard blood draw. Here you go. Maria is just down the hall, in room three. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. Do you have any work restrictions I should note?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very helpful. No, I don’t think so. I mean, I’m a choreographer, so I’m always moving around. I suppose I should probably avoid anything too strenuous until we know what’s going on, but I don’t want to completely stop working. Is that alright? I can modify my rehearsals, focus on less physically demanding choreography…
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Amy. Modifying your rehearsals and avoiding anything too strenuous is a good idea until we have the results. Listen to your body – if something feels uncomfortable, stop. I’ll write a note recommending that you avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity. Is there anything else I can document for you - a work note, perhaps?
PATIENT: Actually, yes. A short work note would be helpful, just stating that I’m under medical evaluation and should avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity. It might help explain things to my colleagues. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and reassuring.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Amy. I'm glad I could help. Here you go. So, just to recap: you'll be hearing from City General Hospital to schedule a CT scan, and Maria will take your blood work now. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment. Again, if you experience any concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to go to the emergency room. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Condray. I really appreciate your time and your thoroughness. I’ll go find Maria now. And… I’ll try not to worry too much.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Amy. And don’t worry too much – we’re going to get to the bottom of this. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions at all before your follow-up. Have a good day.
