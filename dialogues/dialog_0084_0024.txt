DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sayar. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Just… a letter, really. I need a letter confirming I'm able to fly. My insurance company – Medicare, in this case – needs it for a trip I’m planning. It's a bit of a hassle, but they require it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fit-to-fly letter. I understand. Medicare can be… particular sometimes. Let me just quickly review your records here. Have you been seen by another doctor recently, or has anything significant changed with your health since your last visit with us?
PATIENT: No, nothing significant. No other doctors. Last time I was here was… October 2024, for a check-up. Everything was normal then, as far as I remember. I’ve been feeling okay, just… normal. It’s really just this letter I need to sort out. I’m trying to keep things simple, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. October 2024… yes, a routine check-up, all within normal limits. Okay. To be thorough, and to make sure I can accurately complete this form, could you tell me a little bit about where you’re planning to travel?
PATIENT: Mongolia. I’m going back to visit family. It’s… been a while. About a 12-hour flight, with a layover in Seoul. Nothing too strenuous, I don’t think. I just… want to make sure this letter covers everything they need so there aren’t any problems at the airport. It’s a long trip to have a surprise at check-in.
DOCTOR: Right, Mongolia. A long flight, yes. Just to confirm, have you experienced any issues with blood clots, lung problems, or heart conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Never. I’ve always been pretty healthy, actually. My husband… he had some heart trouble, but that was him, not me. I've never had any problems with my lungs or blood clots either. I'm really just trying to get this paperwork done, if that makes sense. It feels a bit silly to be asking a doctor for a letter just to confirm I can fly, but… they insist.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Insurance companies often have specific requirements, even if it seems unnecessary. And just quickly, have you had any recent swelling in your legs or ankles, or any chest pain or shortness of breath, even with normal activity?
PATIENT: No swelling. And no chest pain or shortness of breath. Honestly, Doctor, if I had any of those problems, I wouldn’t be planning a 12-hour flight! Everything’s been… completely normal. Routine, you could say. I really just want to make this as quick as possible, if that’s alright. I have a lot to do before the trip.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That's reassuring. Just one final check – any history of recent surgery or hospitalization in the last six months?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. No surgery, no hospital visits. It’s been… a quiet year, thankfully. Just family matters. No medical issues at all. Is this enough information, Doctor? I’m happy to provide anything else you need, but I’m really just trying to keep it straightforward.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar. It sounds like you’re in good health and fit for travel. Here’s the fit-to-fly letter. It confirms your ability to travel by air, and states that you have no known medical contraindications. Please review it to make sure all the information is correct. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Perfect, thank you so much, Doctor. No, this is exactly what I needed. Everything looks fine. I really appreciate you getting this done so quickly. I think that’s all. Thank you again. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. Safe travels, and enjoy your visit with your family. Have a good day as well.
