DOCTOR: Hi Sasha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my leg. It’s been swelling up. It’s… after the cancer, you see. The treatment. It just won’t go down. It’s a bit annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Swelling in your leg after cancer treatment can definitely be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when the swelling started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Let me think… It was… maybe a month ago? After I finished all the… the medicine. Everything. It started small, just my ankle, really. But now… well, you can see. It goes up my calf a bit. Is that… is that bad? I don’t really know these things.
DOCTOR: No, it’s good you’re asking. It's not necessarily bad, but it's definitely something we need to look into. A month ago, after finishing treatment… okay. And was there anything specific that you were doing when you first noticed it, or did it just come on gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. I didn’t… fall or anything. I was just walking, you know, normal walking. Doing the groceries. Then I noticed my shoe felt a little tight. And then… well, it got bigger. I haven’t changed anything, really. Same shoes, same walks… same everything. It’s just… there. Is it the cancer coming back? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually onset with normal activity. That’s helpful. It’s understandable to be worried about the cancer coming back, and we will certainly consider that as we figure things out. But swelling like this can have many causes, and it doesn't automatically mean the cancer has returned. Let’s do a quick exam of your leg and then I'll ask a few more questions about your medical history, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that sounds good. Please, go ahead. I just want it to… stop swelling, really. It’s uncomfortable, you know? And it makes it hard to find shoes!
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to feel around a bit. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I’m checking for warmth and comparing the swelling to your other leg. Okay. Your leg is warmer than your other one, and there's definite swelling in your calf and around your ankle. Your pulses feel good – strong and regular. There's some mild tenderness when I press here, along the calf muscle. No redness that I can see. I’m also going to measure the circumference of both legs just above the ankle, to get a better idea of the difference in size. Okay, your affected leg is about 2 centimeters larger in circumference than your other leg. Now, a few questions. Have you noticed any pain with walking, or just discomfort from the swelling?
PATIENT: Just discomfort, really. No sharp pain. It’s more… heavy, you know? Like my leg is full of water or something. And it feels… tight. Walking isn’t painful, just… harder. I get tired quicker. Oh, and sometimes it tingles a bit. Not all the time, just… sometimes. It’s funny, really. A leg. After everything… it’s just a leg.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating, especially after everything you've been through. Heavy, tight, tingling sometimes… okay. And does elevating your leg help at all?
PATIENT: Elevating? Hmm… I tried it once. Put it on a pillow when I was watching television. It maybe… maybe helped a little. But it goes down again as soon as I move. It doesn’t really stay up. It’s more comfortable when it's up, but it doesn’t fix it. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Some relief with elevation, but it doesn’t last. Okay. Now, I want to ask a bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. I see here you were treated for cancer… do you mind telling me what type of cancer it was, and what kind of treatment you received?
PATIENT: Oh… the cancer. Yes. It was… breast cancer. Stage two, they said. I had… chemotherapy. And radiation. And… a lumpectomy. It was a long time ago. Well, not that long, but… a few years. It was the radiation that really knocked me around, I think. But they said it was all clear. That's why I'm so worried now, you see. If it’s… back.
DOCTOR: Okay, breast cancer, Stage two, treated with chemotherapy, radiation, and lumpectomy. That’s very helpful. And how long ago was your treatment completed, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think… It finished… about two years ago. Maybe a little more than two. I had the surgery in the spring, and then the chemo finished in the fall. So… two years, give or take. I had check-ups for a while, but then they said I was good. Everything was fine. Until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, two years ago. And you've been having regular check-ups since then?
PATIENT: Yes, for about a year. Every six months. But the last one… was about six months ago, and they said everything looked fine. They didn’t feel anything. And then… this started a few weeks later. It just… crept up on me. I haven’t seen them since. I probably should have called sooner, but I thought it would go away. You know? It's silly, really.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all. It's common to hope things will resolve on their own. Okay, so no other significant medical problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I have a bit of trouble with my knees sometimes, getting old, you know? But nothing serious. The doctor gave me some cream for it. And… I take a little pill for my blood pressure. But that’s it. Honestly, I was very healthy before all this. Well, as healthy as you can be, I suppose. It's all a bit… much.
DOCTOR: Okay, some knee trouble, and a medication for blood pressure. What's the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I have it written down somewhere… Ah, here it is. Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. 10 milligrams, once a day. I hope that’s enough information. I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years. The chemo was rough, of course, but they gave me things to help with that. No reactions or anything. I’m a pretty good patient, really. I take my pills and… try to eat healthy. Although, sometimes I have a little chocolate. Everyone needs a little chocolate, don't they?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, everyone needs a little chocolate! Okay, so no known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be causing the swelling, I’d like to order a few tests. I’m thinking we should do a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any infection. And an ultrasound of your leg to look at the veins and see if there’s any blood clot. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh. Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t mind. As long as it… finds out what’s wrong. Ultrasound… is that… painful? And the blood test… I hate needles. But… if you think it’s best. Please, go ahead. I just want this leg to… stop swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay. The ultrasound isn't painful at all. It just involves a gel on your skin and a probe moving around. It can be a little cold, but it shouldn't hurt. And I understand about the needles. We'll get it done as quickly as possible. I'll also want to rule out any other potential causes, just to be thorough. We can discuss the results when they come back, usually in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg as much as possible and wearing compression stockings, if you can tolerate them. That can help reduce the swelling. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Compression stockings? Oh dear. Will they… make it worse? I’m a bit worried about that. And… how long will it take for the results to come back? A few days… that feels like a long time. I just… I keep thinking the worst, you see. Is it definitely not the cancer? I’m sorry. I’m being silly. I should just let you do the tests. But… it's hard not to worry.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all to worry, Sasha. It’s completely understandable, especially given your history. And I want to reassure you, we’re doing these tests to rule things out and get to the bottom of what’s going on. Compression stockings can actually help reduce swelling by improving blood flow. They won’t make it worse, but if they feel uncomfortable, you can take them off. It’s okay if you don’t like them. The lab usually takes 2-3 business days to get the results back to me. I will call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss them then. I know waiting is difficult, and I’ll do my best to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – pain, redness, warmth in your leg, or shortness of breath – please call the office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… 2-3 days. And call if it gets worse. Yes, alright. Compression stockings… I’ll try them. I don’t like them, but I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… kind. I appreciate you taking the time. It's just… a lot to take in. I think… I think that’s everything. For now, anyway. I'll try not to worry.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. It is a lot, and you’re doing a good job. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll get this figured out together. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and get you fitted for compression stockings. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon.
