DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Theriot is fine, please. Look, it’s…family history, really. My mother’s side, a lot of heart trouble. She just passed last year, and…well, it’s got me a bit on edge, I guess. Just want to make sure I’m not heading down the same road. I keep thinking about it, and it's distracting.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Theriot. I understand your concern, particularly given your mother’s recent passing and the family history of heart trouble. It's very prudent of you to address this proactively. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about your mother’s heart trouble?
PATIENT: Honestly, I wasn’t really paying attention to the specifics when she was sick. I was…busy, you know? Work, the arrangements…it was a whole thing. Something about…blockages, I think? And she was always tired. Really tired. She kept saying it felt like she was running a marathon just walking to the mailbox. But I don't know the names of things, if that makes sense. She saw a cardiologist, obviously, but I wasn’t involved in those appointments. My sister handled most of it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Theriot. It’s very common to be overwhelmed during difficult times, and it's perfectly alright that you weren't able to focus on the medical details then. Don't feel any guilt about that. Okay. So, blockages and significant fatigue. That gives us a starting point. Do you know if she had any specific diagnoses – like coronary artery disease, heart failure, or arrhythmia?
PATIENT: Arrhythmia…that sounds familiar. I think the doctor said something about her heart not beating…regularly? Look, I’m not a medical person, alright? I teach engineering. Bridges, circuits, that’s my area. I just know she ended up with a pacemaker. Does that help? And she was always complaining about her cholesterol, so maybe that was part of it. Honestly, it was a mess. My sister would try to explain things, but I’d just nod and try not to look like I was completely lost.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mr. Theriot. A pacemaker and high cholesterol certainly add to the picture. And please, don’t apologize for not being a medical professional – it’s perfectly reasonable, and I’m happy to explain everything in plain language. Let's shift focus to you now. Have you experienced any symptoms that are concerning you?
PATIENT: No, not really. Not like…chest pain or anything dramatic. Just…a bit of anxiety, I guess. Thinking about it too much. And I get tired faster than I used to, but honestly, who doesn't these days? I'm not exactly springing around like I'm twenty anymore. I just…want to know I'm okay. I don't want to end up like her, constantly worried about dropping dead. Is that so much to ask? I exercise, I eat reasonably well…I just want some reassurance, you know?
DOCTOR: No, that is not too much to ask at all, Mr. Theriot. It's very responsible of you to want to be proactive about your health, especially with your family history. Anxiety and fatigue, even if subtle, are worth investigating. To get a more complete understanding, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, strep throat, but I haven’t been seriously sick in…well, I don’t even remember. I get a physical every year with my primary care doctor, just the standard stuff, blood work and all that. He always says I’m “perfectly healthy,” which is…nice, I guess. But he doesn’t know about my mother, does he? He just sees numbers on a paper. I'm starting to think those things aren't enough.
DOCTOR: You are right to question things and seek further evaluation, Mr. Theriot. A yearly physical is excellent, but sometimes a focused assessment is necessary given specific concerns like family history. Do you recall what your cholesterol levels were at your last physical?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly? No. I vaguely remember the doctor saying they were “good,” but I don't pay attention to the actual numbers. I just assume if he doesn’t tell me to worry about it, it’s fine. I’m a practical guy, Doctor, I deal with concrete things. Stress, load-bearing capacity, that’s what I understand. Numbers on a lab report…not so much. I'm really hoping we can get past this paperwork stuff and just…tell me if I'm going to drop dead or not. Is that terrible?
DOCTOR: No, that is not terrible at all, Mr. Theriot. I completely understand your frustration and desire for a clear answer. We will get there. And I apologize if the questions feel tedious, but gathering information is essential for accurate assessment. Let's try a different approach. Have you ever had any surgical procedures or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a tree, but that’s it. Nothing serious. Look, I'm a healthy guy. I eat my vegetables, I exercise…I just…worry. And it’s probably stupid to worry, but my mother…it’s hard to shake. I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting your time, honestly. Maybe I should just go home and try to forget about it. Is that an option?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely not wasting my time, Mr. Theriot. Your concerns are valid, and I am happy to address them. It’s very common to experience anxiety after a loss, particularly with a family history of heart disease. We are not done yet. Alright, let’s talk about your family history a bit more specifically. Besides your mother, did any other family members – father, siblings, grandparents – have heart problems?
PATIENT: My grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had…something. A stroke, I think? He was pretty old when it happened. And my aunt, her sister, she had bypass surgery about ten years ago. But that’s it, really. No one else that I can think of. My father’s side is…healthy, as far as I know. They all lived to be pretty old, mostly. Just…normal old people stuff. Arthritis, that kind of thing. Nothing like my mother. Honestly, it feels like she got the bad luck gene.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Theriot. That’s helpful information. So, stroke in your maternal grandfather and bypass surgery in your aunt. Now, let’s discuss your lifestyle a bit more. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have, never will. I can't stand the smell of it. It’s disgusting. And bad for you, obviously. I tell my students that all the time – basic engineering principles, you know? Stress fractures, material degradation…same concept. Smoke destroys your lungs, it’s a simple equation. I drink…occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe a beer on the weekend. Nothing excessive. I'm not a big drinker, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Theriot. And I appreciate your clear explanations. Now, one final question about your lifestyle. How would you describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: Look, it's reasonably healthy, okay? I try to eat a lot of vegetables, lean protein, whole grains. I avoid processed foods as much as possible. I cook most of my meals at home, so I know what's going into them. I have a sweet tooth, admittedly. I like chocolate. But I try to keep it under control. I'm not one of those people who lives on fast food and soda. I'm an engineer, I like things to be…efficient. And healthy eating is efficient, you know? Fuel for the machine. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Theriot. It sounds like you maintain a very healthy lifestyle overall. Now, let me quickly review your primary care physician’s records. I see your last physical was six months ago, and the results were within normal limits. Cholesterol was 180, blood pressure 120/80, and your EKG was normal. However, I don’t see any detailed family history documented here. Given your mother’s recent passing and the family history of heart problems, I think it would be prudent to perform a few additional tests to get a more comprehensive assessment. Would you be agreeable to an EKG today, and some blood work, including a lipid panel and a complete metabolic panel?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever it takes to get some peace of mind. EKG, blood work…do whatever you think is necessary. I just want to know I'm not heading down the same road as my mother. I'm starting to get anxious just talking about it. The sooner we get this done, the better. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mr. Theriot. If you could please have a seat on the examination table, we'll start with the EKG. It’s a simple, painless procedure. We'll just place a few electrodes on your chest to record your heart's electrical activity. I'll explain everything as we go along. While I'm doing this, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. Nothing like that. I've been pretty careful to watch for it, actually, because my sister mentioned something about that being a sign…with my mother. But no, my feet feel fine. Perfectly normal. Look, I'm not one to worry about the small stuff, alright? I'm an engineer, I deal with big problems, structural integrity, that kind of thing. Swollen ankles…that's a problem for someone else. But I've been paying attention, just in case. I’m a practical guy, remember?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Theriot. It's helpful that you're observant and proactive. Alright, let’s get this EKG done. Please lie still and breathe normally. Okay, the EKG looks within normal limits. No significant abnormalities detected. However, as I mentioned, it's just one piece of the puzzle. We’ll need the blood work to get a clearer picture of your cholesterol levels and overall metabolic health. I’ll write the lab order now. You can go to the lab just down the hall. They’ll draw a few vials of blood. It will take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Blood work, follow-up…whatever it takes. I just want to get this sorted out. Down the hall, you said? Alright. I guess I'll go get stuck with a needle. Hopefully, it won't hurt too much. I always hated needles. Look, I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my anxieties, Doctor. It’s a relief to finally be doing something about it. I’ll go get the blood work done now. Let me know when you want to schedule the follow-up.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Theriot. I understand your apprehension about the needles, but it will be quick. Here’s the lab order. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of everything. Once the results are available – usually within 24-48 hours – my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Chest pain, shortness of breath…got it. I'll be careful. And thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little better just knowing we're taking steps to figure things out. It's…a weight off my shoulders, honestly. I'll see you at the follow-up. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Theriot. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
