DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 80 years of age. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, eighty… seems like yesterday, honestly. Well, it’s this pain… when I breathe deep. It’s… hard to explain. It just hurts when I take a good breath. It’s been… a while now, I guess. Not too bad all the time, but it bothers me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Ruocco. It's helpful to get a sense of what you're experiencing. You mentioned pain when you breathe deeply, and that it's been going on for some time. Could you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: More about it… It’s… a sharp pain, mostly. Right here… Not a real bad, stabbing pain, just… uncomfortable. Like something’s tight. It doesn't go all the way through to my back, though. And it doesn’t hurt when I’m just sitting still, mostly just when I try to take a big breath. Does that make any sense? I’m not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Mr. Ruocco. And please don’t worry about explaining; we’ll work through it together. A sharp pain in the chest that worsens with deep breaths… and it doesn’t radiate to your back. Does anything specifically trigger it, besides deep breathing?
PATIENT: Trigger it… Hmmm… not really. Not that I’ve noticed. Maybe… if I’m lifting something heavy? But I don’t lift much anymore, you know. Old age. Sometimes when I walk up the hill to the store, it feels a little worse. But mostly just breathing. I don't think anything specific sets it off, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Ruocco. So, it seems to be exacerbated by exertion, like walking uphill, and definitely with deep breaths. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Oh, goodness. Let me think. I get a little… short of breath sometimes, maybe? But I always figured that was just… being old. And I cough a bit, now and then. But I’ve always coughed. Nothing really with the pain, though. Not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath and a chronic cough, in addition to the chest pain triggered by deep breaths and exertion. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, boy. That was a long time ago. I don’t really remember much, to be honest. I think… I think I had pneumonia once, a long, long time ago. When I was a young man, maybe? And the doctor told me I had a bad cough when I was a kid, but that’s about it. Never anything serious. Never been told I had heart trouble. I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Ruocco. Pneumonia in your youth and a history of a chronic cough. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was young, I think. That’s about it. And… I was in the hospital once, a long time ago. Something with my stomach, maybe? But it was so long ago, I barely remember. It wasn’t anything serious, I don’t think. Just a few days. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Ruocco. We have your records here as well, and we can clarify anything if needed. Appendectomy and a brief hospitalization for a stomach issue. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s a tough one. My wife… she passed away a long time ago. And I don’t really keep in touch with many relatives. I know my father… he had trouble with his breathing when he got old. Something with his lungs, maybe? But I don't know what exactly. And my mother… she lived a long life, but I don’t remember any specific health problems. It was a long time ago, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Ruocco. A father with breathing difficulties and a mother who lived a long life without known health issues. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, I used to work in construction, managing crews. That was a long time ago. Now I mostly just stay home. I live alone. My wife… she passed away several years ago. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much anymore. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Not every night. Mostly just… quiet these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Ruocco. No smoking, minimal alcohol, and a relatively quiet lifestyle. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with allergies. I can eat anything. And I don't take any medications, not regularly. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but that's about it. Never been allergic to anything, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: Very good. No known allergies and no regular medications. Now, Mr. Ruocco, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your chest for any tenderness. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I just want to get this pain figured out, you know? I’m not a fan of doctors, but I know you’re trying to help. Just… be gentle, okay? My ribs are probably a bit fragile these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Ruocco, I will be as gentle as possible. Please take slow, deep breaths for me when I ask. Okay, breathing sounds are… slightly diminished in the lower lobes bilaterally, but no wheezing or crackles noted at this time. Front chest… sounds are similarly diminished bilaterally. I do hear some mild rhonchi in the lower lobes, which can be common with a chronic cough. Now, I'm just checking for any tenderness. A little tenderness upon palpation of the lower sternum, but no acute pain. Your heart sounds are regular and within normal limits. No murmurs or gallops detected. Overall, your lungs sound a bit congested, and there's some tenderness to your sternum, but no significant findings at this time. I would like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and rule out any other underlying causes. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… Oh, goodness. More tests. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then alright. I just want to know what’s causing this pain, you know? If it will help figure things out, then yes, go ahead and do the X-ray. I don't like being poked and prodded, but I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Ruocco. I believe it’s a prudent step given your symptoms and the findings on the exam. I'll have the nurse schedule that for you right away. While we wait for the results, I’d also like to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter to see how well your lungs are transferring oxygen to your blood. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oxygen saturation… If you think it’s a good idea, Doctor. I don’t really understand all this medical stuff, you know? I just want to feel better. Go ahead. Whatever you think is best. Just… try not to take too long, okay? I have a little appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I understand. It's a quick, painless test. Your oxygen saturation is currently 92%, which is slightly below the optimal range. A normal saturation is typically between 95% and 100%. Given your slightly diminished lung sounds, the low saturation, and your history of a chronic cough, I suspect you may have some mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , possibly exacerbated by a recent mild respiratory infection. However, this is just a preliminary assessment, and we need the chest X-ray results to confirm this and rule out other possibilities. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It’s a common medication for COPD and can often provide significant relief. I’ll also recommend some breathing exercises to help strengthen your lungs. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Bronchodilator… Oh dear. COPD? That sounds… serious. I just thought it was old age! Well, if you think it’s what I have, Doctor, then alright. An inhaler… I guess it’s worth a try. Breathing exercises… I’m not very good at exercises these days. But I’ll try my best. Just… tell me what I need to do, okay? And is this… serious? Will I need a lot more tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Ruocco. COPD is a progressive lung disease, but it's very manageable with proper treatment. Many people with COPD live full and active lives. It's not a death sentence, and we’ll work together to keep your symptoms under control. The inhaler, which is called albuterol, will help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It’s a common medication and has minimal side effects. We’ll start with one to two puffs as needed when you feel short of breath, and we can adjust the dosage if necessary. As for additional tests, we’ll need to perform a pulmonary function test to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of your COPD. This test measures how much air you can inhale and exhale and how quickly you can breathe. We can schedule that after we receive the chest X-ray results. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding smoking and secondhand smoke, staying hydrated, and getting regular exercise as tolerated. I’ll also give you a handout with instructions on how to use the inhaler and some breathing exercises. Does that sound alright, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Alright… That’s… a lot of information. No smoking, I already do that. Hydrated… I try to drink enough water. Exercise… I’ll try. Handout… Yes, that would be good. I need something to remind me of all this. Pulmonary function test… More tests. But alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, then I’ll do it. I just want to feel better, you know? And I trust you to help me. Thank you… for explaining everything. It’s still a little scary, but I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. I understand it’s a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule the chest X-ray and provide you with the handout and instructions on the inhaler. I’m also going to write you a prescription for the albuterol inhaler. Before you go, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. Just… thank you again. I appreciate you listening to me and trying to figure out what’s wrong. I just hope this inhaler helps… and that the tests aren’t too bad. I should probably get going. I have that appointment, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. You’re very welcome. I’m hopeful the inhaler will provide some relief. The tests are generally straightforward, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. Here are the prescriptions. The nurse will provide you with more information on filling them. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you for your follow-up appointment. Take care, Mr. Ruocco.
PATIENT: .
