DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. Why don’t you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Gegan, is it? That’s a pretty name. Um… well, to be honest, I mostly just remember a paper I had to fill out said somethin’ about a drug test. My… my husband, bless his heart, used to handle all this sort of thing. I’m not entirely sure why I’m here, just that I need to get it done. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Hughston. It's very common to feel a little confused about appointments when things change, and it sounds like your husband usually takes care of these matters. So, let me clarify. You were asked to come in today for a drug test, but you’re not entirely sure the reason behind it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Somethin’ about… work? I operate heavy machinery, you see. Big pavers and such. Maybe it has to do with that? Honestly, my memory's not what it used to be. It's a bit fuzzy. I just want to get this over with, if you know what I mean. It's just a test, right? Nothing to worry about?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this test is a requirement of your job, given the heavy machinery you operate. That's perfectly reasonable, and yes, it's usually a standard procedure. We will get this over with. To make sure everything goes smoothly, and to document things properly, could you tell me a little more about why you think this test is being requested now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're askin' things I really don't know! I think… I think maybe a new rule at the site? They sent out some papers, but I honestly just skimmed them and signed where they told me to. I was more focused on getting back to work, to be honest. It’s been slow lately, and everyone needs the hours. Did they not tell you why I'm here? I'm sorry, I feel like I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re being perfectly helpful, Ms. Hughston. It’s very common for these details to get lost in paperwork, and you shouldn’t feel bad at all. Let me check your electronic health record to see if there's any additional information about the reason for this drug screen. Just one moment... Ah, okay. It seems there was a recent policy change at the worksite requiring all heavy machinery operators to undergo random drug testing. It’s a new program, and the notification process wasn’t as clear as it should have been. It also says here you had a recent change in insurance, and this might be related to confirming coverage for work-related health screenings. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… about right. Yes, I switched over to Medicare a few months back, after… well, after George passed. Everything’s been a bit of a blur, honestly. A new policy and the insurance… that makes sense. So, it’s just a routine thing then? Nothing to worry about? I really don’t like needles, if you’re wondering… or anything complicated. Just a simple test, hopefully?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hughston, and I’m very sorry for your loss. It's completely understandable that things have felt overwhelming lately. Yes, this is a routine drug screen, as far as I can tell. And you're right to mention your aversion to needles – that's important to know! We’ll certainly make it as comfortable as possible. To confirm, this is a urine drug screen, which is a very standard procedure. It will check for a panel of commonly abused substances. Do you have any medical conditions that might affect the results, like kidney problems?
PATIENT: Kidney problems? Hmm… not that I know of. George always handled the doctor stuff, so… I’ve never been told I have anything like that. I mean, I'm a fairly healthy woman, considering. I get around, I work hard… I just get tired easily, sometimes. Old age, I suppose. I don't take any medications, if that matters. Just a little ibuprofen now and then for my back. Does ibuprofen show up on those tests? I really don't want to get in trouble over somethin' like that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the ibuprofen – it usually doesn’t cause any issues, but it’s always best to check. And it's excellent that you generally don’t take any medications. Okay, so no known kidney problems, generally healthy, and just occasional ibuprofen. To be absolutely thorough, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me think... I don't think I have any serious allergies. I get a little itchy sometimes, when I'm around cats, but that's just a mild reaction, nothing dangerous. And I can't really eat shellfish, makes me sick to my stomach. But those aren't really allergies, are they? Mostly just things I avoid. I don't react to any medications, as far as I know. George used to say I was a tough old bird. Does that help? I really hope we're gettin' close to finishin' this paperwork. I'm startin' to get a little anxious.
DOCTOR: You are very helpful, Ms. Hughston, and you are a tough old bird! So, a mild reaction to cats and avoidance of shellfish – that’s good to know. No known medication allergies. It sounds like you've given me a very complete picture. Alright, now that we’ve covered the medical history, let’s talk about the test itself. It's a simple urine sample. I'll provide you with a cup and instructions, and there’s a private restroom right down the hall. Do you have any questions about that process?
PATIENT: A simple urine sample… oh, thank goodness. That's… manageable. A private restroom? That's good. Yes… well, how much do I need? I drink a lot of water, you see. And… is there anything special I need to do? I don’t want to mess it up. I really just want to get this over with. Honestly, the thought of someone lookin' at my… well, never mind. Just tell me what I need to do, step by step.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask! We want to make this as comfortable as possible. You don’t need a full bladder, just enough for a standard sample – about 2-4 ounces is perfect. And no, nobody needs a “look” at anything, it’s all handled privately and respectfully. Here are the steps: I’ll give you a sterile cup. Please wash your hands thoroughly first. Then, collect a mid-stream sample. That means you start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup mid-way through, and finish urinating afterwards. There are instructions in the restroom if you need a reminder. Do you think you're comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Mid-stream… oh dear. Okay, okay. Start, then… collect, then finish. Like pourin’ a glass, almost? I suppose I can manage that. Is there anything I should avoid doin’? Like, should I drink more water, or less? And… is there a lid on the cup? I really don’t want to spill anything. You're very patient with me, Doctor. Thank you. I’m just… a bit flustered, I suppose. It's been a long day already.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It's perfectly understandable to be flustered, and you’re doing wonderfully. Yes, thinking of it like pouring a glass is a great way to visualize it. You don't need to drink more water than usual – just stay normally hydrated. And yes, there is a lid on the cup! I’ll make sure it’s secure before you leave. I have a cup here, with a lid, and a set of instructions. I'll also give you a small privacy screen you can take with you if you’d like, just for extra comfort. Do you feel ready to head to the restroom now?
PATIENT: Yes, I think… I think I’m ready. A privacy screen? That’s thoughtful, thank you. I really appreciate it. Just… let me double-check, one last time… start, collect mid-stream, finish. And a lid on the cup. Okay. Yes. Let's get this over with. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You've got this, Ms. Hughston! Take your time, and don't hesitate to call out if you have any questions or need assistance. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. I’ll be right here when you get back. Take a deep breath, and we'll get through this.
