DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day. It's… well, it's my stomach. Just… constantly running to the bathroom. They’ve given me something for it, but it doesn’t do a thing. It’s been going on for weeks. It’s really inconvenient, and frankly, embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weeks of that would be quite disruptive, and I apologize that what you’ve been given isn’t helping. We’ll figure out what’s going on. “Constantly running to the bathroom” – can you tell me a little more about how constant?
PATIENT: Ugh, “how constant”… like, I can barely leave the house. If I do, it's a whole operation. Knowing where every bathroom is, planning routes… It's ridiculous. Probably five or six times a day, easy. Sometimes more if I eat something. And it’s… not normal. It’s watery, you know? Not just… a quick trip. I don't need details asked, but it's bad. Really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, five to six times a day, or more, and watery stools… and you're having to plan things around finding bathrooms. That does sound incredibly disruptive to your life, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Let’s try to get a better picture of things. When did this start?
PATIENT: Around… hmm. Early July, I think? Right after… well, never mind. It was after a trip. I went up to visit some relatives. It started a couple of days after I got back. Honestly, I thought it was just something I ate, you know? Like a bad clam or something. But it just… hasn’t stopped. They keep telling me it's a virus, but viruses end, right? This is just… lingering.
DOCTOR: You’re right to question it if it's lingering. Most viral gastroenteritis resolves within a week or two. Early July… so roughly a month now. And it began shortly after a trip visiting relatives. Was there anything specific you ate on the trip that you haven't had before, or that anyone else who travelled with you ate?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't see what that's going to do. I ate what I always eat when I visit. Fried bread, salmon… normal Tlingit food. Everyone else ate the same thing and they’re fine. I don’t appreciate you implying I got sick from my people’s food. It’s just… embarrassing, okay? I'm a grown woman, constantly running to the bathroom. It’s not like I'm handling raw chicken.
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize if I caused offense. That wasn't my intention at all. It’s standard to ask about potential dietary triggers, especially with travel, but you are absolutely right – it’s important to consider everything, and I respect your culture and what you eat. I wasn’t implying anything negative about your relatives’ food. Let's move on then. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, I'm tired. Really tired. More tired than usual, I mean. And… a little crampy, sometimes. But mostly just… exhausted from dealing with this. And hungry, always hungry, but if I eat too much, well, you know. It’s a lovely cycle. No fever, no vomiting, thankfully. Just… this. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and abdominal cramping alongside the diarrhea, and it's impacting your appetite – or rather, your ability to keep food down comfortably. No fever or vomiting, which is good. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Honestly? Yes. A little. Not… a lot. Just… sometimes. That’s why I even bothered coming in, honestly. It’s not like I'm thrilled talking about this. It’s… brownish, you know? And… well, it's there. It's not constant, but it's been happening. I’m not stupid, I know that's not good. Is that what you were getting at?
DOCTOR: You’re not stupid at all, and thank you for telling me, despite being uncomfortable. That’s very important information. Seeing blood or mucus in the stool is definitely something we need to investigate. It could be a number of things, and it’s good we’re being thorough. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just… the usual old lady stuff. High blood pressure, I guess. But it's managed with medication. And I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. Other than that? No. I’m not a sickly person. Or wasn’t a sickly person before this. And my husband… well, he’s gone now. So, no, no other medical conditions. Is that what you need to know? Do you really need a life story?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal ten years ago. No, I don’t need a life story, just the information that might be relevant to what’s going on now. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: It’s Lisinopril, 20 milligrams. I take one a day. I’ve been on it for… years. I can’t even remember now. It works fine, or was working fine before this mess. And I take a multivitamin, if that matters. But that’s it. Honestly, I don't take a lot of pills. I prefer just… being healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20 milligrams daily, and a multivitamin. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – food, pollen, animals, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing major. I get a little sniffly with cats, but that’s it. No drug allergies, no food allergies, nothing. I’m pretty resilient, honestly. And I don't really go in for all that new-fangled stuff. I don’t need a list of everything I’m allergic to. I just want this to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, just a couple of questions about your family history. Is there anyone in your family with a history of inflammatory bowel disease – Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis?
PATIENT: Inflammatory… what? Look, my family… we didn’t go to doctors much. We took care of things ourselves. My grandmother had… arthritis, I think. And my uncle… he had a bad stomach once, but that was it. No one had anything fancy like… inflammatory whatsit. We were Tlingit, we didn’t have time for all that medical mumbo jumbo. We dealt with real problems.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. So, no known family history of inflammatory bowel disease, or similar conditions. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Are you serious? I’m 37 years old, widowed, and trying to deal with a constantly running stomach. Do I look like I have time for all that? No. Absolutely not. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And no, I do not smoke or do drugs. I have some dignity, thank you very much. This is ridiculous. Are you trying to imply something?
DOCTOR: I apologize again if my questions feel intrusive or judgmental, Ms. Woodring. I'm simply trying to get a complete picture of your health. And no, I wasn't implying anything. Okay, let's move on. Now, to help me understand what’s going on, I’d like to do a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and gently press on it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. But don’t expect me to be comfortable. I don’t like people poking around. And no, I don’t want to know what you’re looking for. Just tell me the results. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you lie back on the examination table, that will be the most comfortable position. I’ll keep explaining as I go, and you can stop me at any time. Okay, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Your bowel sounds are… active. A little bit too active, actually. And there's some mild tenderness in your lower left quadrant. Not severe, but noticeable. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Everything else feels normal. No masses or organomegaly. So, active bowel sounds and some tenderness in your lower left quadrant. Those findings, combined with what you’ve told me about the diarrhea, blood in the stool, and fatigue, are concerning enough that I want to order some tests.
PATIENT: Tests? Of course. More waiting. Look, what kind of tests are we talking about? Are they going to make me more sick? And how long is this going to take? I have things to do, you know. This is just… great. Just great. I knew I should have just stayed home and suffered in silence.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The tests are necessary to help us figure out what’s causing your symptoms so we can get you feeling better. I want to order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection or anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, a stool culture to look for any bacterial infections, and a stool analysis to check for parasites and blood. The blood tests can be done right here in the clinic. For the stool samples, I will give you instructions and containers to collect them at home. The blood results should be back within 24-48 hours, and the stool tests will take a little longer, maybe 3-5 business days. These tests are generally not invasive and shouldn’t make you feel sick. They’re just standard procedures to help us pinpoint the cause of your issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can go home. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And if these tests don't show anything, I’m not coming back. I'm not wasting my time on endless tests that go nowhere. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask? Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. You deserve to feel normal again, and that's what we're trying to achieve. I understand your frustration and I promise to do everything I can to get you some answers quickly. Alright, I've just ordered the blood tests and I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw them now. I’ll also print out the instructions for the stool samples. Please let me know if you have any questions. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or see a significant amount of blood in your stool – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Just… let’s get this over with. I want to go home. And make sure someone explains everything clearly. I don't want to be told a bunch of medical mumbo jumbo I can’t understand. Just… simple English, okay? Now, where's the lab technician?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll make sure the lab technician explains everything to you clearly, and I will personally review the results with you in simple English during your follow-up appointment. I understand how frustrating medical jargon can be. "Could the lab technician please come to examination room three?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright. While we wait for the technician, is there anything at all I can get for you?
