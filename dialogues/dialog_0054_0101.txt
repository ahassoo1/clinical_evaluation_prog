DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this headache I've been havin'. Right at the back of me head, you know? Been botherin' me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head. And when you say "a little while," could you tell me roughly how long it’s been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think now... It started maybe… three weeks ago? Give or take a few days. It wasn't bad at first, just a dull ache, but it’s gotten a bit more persistent lately.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, alright. And has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Not that I can rightly say, no. I haven't been doin' nothin' different, really. Same work – cuttin' and filin' nails, you know? Same routine. Sometimes it feels worse when I’m bendin’ over for a long time, doin’ a pedicure, but that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be aggravated by bending over. And would you describe the pain as constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly constant, yeah. Not a sharp pain, more like a heavy pressure. But it does get worse throughout the day, especially if I’m busy. And sometimes, when I lie down, it eases up a little. Not completely gone, mind you, just… less bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, a constant, heavy pressure that worsens throughout the day and eases somewhat when lying down. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the headache?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I have been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. And me vision's been a little blurry sometimes, especially in the evenin'. I put that down to me age, though. I’m 87, you know. Things start goin’ a little wonky. But maybe it’s connected?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that, Mr. Popova. The fatigue and blurry vision are important to note. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, bless you for askin’. Not much, really. I had a bit of high blood pressure years ago, but it's been under control with diet, the doctor said. And me knees aren’t what they used to be – arthritis, you know. But other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky. No serious illnesses, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just one, years and years ago. Appendicitis when I was a young man. A simple operation, recovered quickly. Nothing since then, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… me mother, she had diabetes, I think. And me grandfather on me father’s side, he suffered with something to do with his heart. But other than that, nothin’ that I can recall. We weren't ones for keepin' detailed records, you know? More practical folk.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. I prefer to steer clear of 'em if I can. And allergies… not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anythin’ they’ve given me in the past. I’m a pretty strong man, you know. Usually can handle things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, eh? Well, I work six days a week at the salon. Keeps me busy, keeps me movin’. I eat pretty healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. Me wife, she's a wonderful cook. We don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion. And I try to get a good night’s sleep whenever I can. It's not always easy, but I do me best.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Go right ahead, Doctor. I’ve got nothin’ to hide! Just let me know if you need me to do anythin' special.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Popova. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 145/90, but not drastically. Your pulse is regular at 78. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little diminished, which isn’t uncommon for your age, and your balance is fairly good, although a bit unsteady. I noticed some mild tenderness to palpation at the base of your skull. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Right there, at the back of me head. Not a sharp pain, but a dull ache. Like a pressure. That’s where it's been botherin' me the most. You've found it, Doctor, you've found it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings from the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a tension headache, potentially aggravated by your work and the repetitive bending over. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we'll need to monitor as well. However, the blurry vision and fatigue, combined with the headache, warrant further investigation. To rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a CT scan of your head to ensure there’s no underlying structural problem. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan, eh? Sounds… serious. But if it's to make sure nothin' bad is goin' on, then yes, Doctor, go ahead. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. But tell me, what exactly are we lookin' for? Is it somethin' I should be worryin’ about?
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking, Mr. Popova. A CT scan will allow us to visualize your brain and rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms, such as a tumor, aneurysm, or bleeding. It's a precautionary measure, and most likely everything will be normal. However, it's important to be thorough, especially with the presence of the blurry vision and fatigue. We’ll also check your blood work for any signs of infection, inflammation or electrolyte imbalances that could be contributing to your headache. I will give you a referral to the radiology center nearby, and they can schedule the scan for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it's best, then I trust you, Doctor. A referral to the radiology center, you say? I’ll get that sorted. And then we’ll see what the results say. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to me. And thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowin’ what’s goin' on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. I will print out the referral and some instructions for the CT scan now. It’s important to stay hydrated before the scan. I’ll also give you a prescription for a mild pain reliever, ibuprofen, to help manage the headache in the meantime. I'd like to see you back in one week to discuss the results of the scan and bloodwork. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe headache, fever, weakness, or vision changes – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Ibuprofen, a referral… and come back in a week. I appreciate your thoroughness. You're a good doctor. Thank you again. And… … no, I don’t think I have any more questions at the moment. Just gettin' through this scan, really. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. Here are the referral and the prescription. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Take care, and I’ll see you in a week. .
