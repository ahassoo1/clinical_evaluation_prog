DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a… a lump, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, and I thought it was best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand. And when you say “a little while now,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably about six weeks, maybe a little longer. It wasn’t painful at first, just… there. Now, sometimes it feels a bit uncomfortable, like a dull ache. Not sharp, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, six weeks, with a progression from no pain to a dull ache. And where exactly in your lower abdomen would you say you notice it?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to pinpoint exactly. Somewhere around here, I think. It's not right on my belly button, but a few inches down and to the side. It’s not super obvious when I’m lying down, but when I stand up or move around, I can feel it more easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few inches down and to the right of your belly button. I appreciate you showing me. Has anything made it better or worse – certain activities, positions, or times of day?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific making it worse, thankfully. If I’ve been sitting for a long time, it feels a bit more noticeable when I stand up. But nothing really makes it go away completely, or suddenly become much more painful. It's pretty consistent, just... there.
DOCTOR: Alright, consistent and more noticeable after sitting. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes in… my bowel habits? Let me see. Not really, no. Everything seems pretty normal there, if that makes sense. Regular as usual. No constipation, no diarrhea, nothing like that. I haven’t noticed any blood or anything concerning either.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, thankfully. And… weight loss, hmm. I might have lost a pound or two, but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. It could just be the summer heat, you know? I haven’t been eating as much as usual. It's hard to say. Nothing dramatic, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant weight loss. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I've always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox, measles, but nothing serious. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything, and I don’t have any ongoing health problems. My wife might remember better, but I'm fairly certain.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries at all. I’ve been lucky enough to avoid those so far. I try to stay active and eat well, so hopefully I can keep it that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. What about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s a little more complicated. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he passed away a few years ago from heart disease. On my wife’s side, her grandmother had something with her stomach, but I don’t know the specifics. It was a long time ago. Nothing that I’m aware of that would necessarily be related to this, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother and heart disease in your father. That's helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m married, as I mentioned. Been married for fifteen years now. I work as a choreographer - mostly dance, you know, teaching and creating routines. I don't smoke, and I only drink occasionally – maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat a fairly healthy diet, though I admit I have a sweet tooth! And I try to stay reasonably active, although my work keeps me on my feet a lot already.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat pretty much anything. My wife always checks labels just in case, but I haven’t had any problems. I'm pretty boring when it comes to allergies, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for providing all of that information, Mr. Raghunathan. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. We'll start by listening to your abdomen and then I'll gently palpate the area you described to get a better sense of the lump. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Absolutely. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem normal, active in all four quadrants. Alright, I’m going to gently press here. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Hmm, I do feel a small, soft mass in your lower abdomen, about two inches to the right of your belly button. It doesn’t appear to be particularly tender to the touch. It feels… mobile, not fixed to any underlying structures. It's approximately two centimeters in diameter. Do you feel any pain when I press here specifically?
PATIENT: It’s… a little uncomfortable, yes. Not painful, exactly, but I can definitely feel it when you press there. It’s similar to what I’ve been feeling on my own. It's not sharp, just… a dull pressure. It doesn’t feel any different than usual, just… there. The movement doesn't bother me either.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull pressure, consistent with what you've been experiencing. And it's mobile, which is good. I'm also palpating your other quadrants, and everything feels normal there. No tenderness or masses detected. I don't feel any enlarged lymph nodes in your groin area either. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it's difficult to say definitively what this is without further investigation. It could be a number of things – a lipoma, a hernia, or even a muscle strain. However, to be certain, I would like to order a few tests. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I understand. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’d rather be safe than sorry, so please, go ahead and order whatever tests you need. What kind of tests are you thinking?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm going to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or inflammation. I’m also going to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better visualization of the mass and determine its size, shape, and composition. Finally, I will also order a urinalysis to rule out any urinary tract issues. These tests should give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. I will send the orders to the lab, and they will contact you to schedule the appointments. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds reasonable. Ultrasound, blood work, and a urine test… I understand. Will the results take long to come back? And… what happens after the tests? Will you call me with the results, or will I need to schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question. The lab typically takes 24-48 hours to process the results. I will review them as soon as they become available. I will call you with the results, and we can discuss the next steps at that time. If the ultrasound shows something concerning, I may recommend a consultation with a general surgeon for further evaluation. However, let’s not jump to conclusions yet. We'll wait to see what the tests reveal first. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Wait for the results, then discuss the next steps. That’s a good approach. 24-48 hours… I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I feel a bit better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. I understand your concern, and I want to assure you that we’re doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or any significant changes in your bowel habits, please don't hesitate to contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I'll wait for the lab to contact me, and I’ll be sure to let you know if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. It was my pleasure. I will be in touch soon. Take care, and have a good day.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you.
