DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Or is it Stoegbaeur?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor… Batara, yes? It’s Stoegbauer. S-T-O-E-G-B-A-U-E-R. A little hard to say, I know. My wife, she always said it best. But she… she’s gone now.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let's focus on you today, Mr. Stoegbauer. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. My foot, Doctor. It’s… it’s been botherin’ me. A sore, you see. A bad sore. Been there a little while now, and it hurts to walk. I try to wear slippers, but… it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long exactly has this “sore” been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Time… it slips away, you know? But I’d say… maybe two, three months now? It started small, I thought it was just a little cut from stepping on something. But it didn’t get better. It just… stayed. And got a little bigger, a little redder.
DOCTOR: Okay. And where exactly on your foot is this sore?
PATIENT: It’s on the bottom, Doctor. Right here… Near my heel, but not on it. More toward my toes, I guess. It’s hard to see, you know, being on the bottom like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is it painful all the time, or only when you’re walking?
PATIENT: It’s mostly when I walk, yes. But even when I’m sittin’ still, sometimes… it kinda throbs. Not a bad pain all the time, more like… a reminder that it’s there. And if I press on it… …then it hurts a good bit.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you noticed any changes in the sore itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Well… it’s gotten a little deeper, I think. And… maybe a little wider. Sometimes it feels warm to the touch. I haven’t noticed anything… dripping from it, if that’s what you mean. But it doesn’t look good, Doctor. It really doesn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m going to need to take a look at this foot of yours. Could you please remove your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. There it is. Not a pretty sight, is it? I try to keep it clean, but… it’s hard when you’re older.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It appears to be an ulcer, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s not actively infected right now, but it’s deep enough to be worrisome. It is on your weight bearing surface and you have some decreased sensation. Do you have diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes…? Oh, yes… the doctor told me… years ago. Something about sugar. I take pills for it. Every morning, with breakfast. I can't remember the name of the pill, though. Old age, you know… things just… fade.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no. Not anymore. I used to… a long time ago. When I was younger. But I quit. My wife… she didn’t like it. Good thing too, I suppose. A bad habit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age, diabetes, and the location and appearance of this ulcer, I’m concerned about potential complications. This needs to be properly assessed and treated to prevent infection and potential limb loss. I'm going to order some blood work to check your blood sugar levels and assess your overall health. I'm also going to order an x-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. We will also need to get some fluid from the wound for a culture. I'm going to refer you to a podiatrist for specialized wound care. They will be able to debride the wound and apply appropriate dressings. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… serious. Blood work, x-rays, a… podiatrist? A specialist, you say? Is it… is it bad? I just want to be able to walk again. I like to walk down to the beach, you see.
DOCTOR: It could be serious, Mr. Stoegbauer, which is why we need to take these steps. We're not saying it is serious, but we need to rule out complications. Untreated ulcers, especially in patients with diabetes, can lead to infections that are difficult to treat and could potentially require amputation. We need to be proactive and get this addressed now. The podiatrist is the specialist best equipped to handle this. I'll have my nurse schedule you an appointment. You will get a call with the details. I'm also prescribing you a special dressing for the wound to keep it clean and protected until you see the podiatrist. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Amputation…? Oh dear. No… no, that… that can’t happen. I need my feet. The dressing… yes. That sounds good. Will it hurt to put it on? And… will the podiatrist… will they be gentle? I don't want a lot of poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, let's not jump to conclusions. Amputation is a last resort, and we are nowhere near that point. We're doing everything we can to prevent that from happening. The dressing should not hurt. It will just be a bit uncomfortable as the nurse applies it. And the podiatrist will be as gentle as possible, of course. They are specialists and will be experienced in dealing with delicate wounds. They will explain everything to you before they do anything. I will also put in an order for a walker for you to protect your foot while it heals. Do you have any other questions, or are we finished here today?
PATIENT: A walker…? Oh. I haven’t used a walker since… well, since my wife… No, I think… I think that’s all. Just… please, make sure they’re gentle. And… thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. I just want to be able to walk again.
DOCTOR: Alright. My nurse will be in shortly to apply the dressing and go over the discharge instructions. She will also schedule your appointment with the podiatrist. Please follow the instructions carefully, and if you experience any signs of infection – increased pain, redness, swelling, fever – go to the emergency room immediately. Have a good day, Mr. Stoegbauer.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
