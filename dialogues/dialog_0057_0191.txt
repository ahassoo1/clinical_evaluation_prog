DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I requested to come in… to get tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub, that’s a very responsible thing to do. It’s good you’re taking this step. To give you the best care, I'm going to ask you a few questions, if that's alright. First, have you had any recent illnesses or been feeling unwell lately?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I’ve been feeling quite well, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, you know? Nothing serious at all. No fevers, no coughs, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. This is my first time. I… I always meant to, but life gets in the way, you know? And then I’d forget. Now, I just decided it was time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's never too late to get tested. Now, can you tell me about any sexual activity you've had?
PATIENT: Oh… well. That’s a bit personal, isn’t it? I’ve been married for… forty years, now. To the same man. We haven't… been very active lately, if that's what you mean. It’s just… things change as you get older. Before that… well, it’s been a very long time. Why do you ask? Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Shaub, and I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. It’s important for me to understand your risk factors to ensure I provide the most appropriate testing and care. Knowing your history helps me interpret the results accurately. Everything you tell me is confidential, of course. Since you've been married for forty years and haven't been sexually active outside of that relationship, that lowers your risk significantly. Has your husband ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: No, he hasn’t. We… we never really talked about it, to be honest. Back when we were younger, it wasn’t something people discussed openly, you know? And then… well, it just never came up. I suppose I should have asked him, but… it felt awkward. Do you think I should ask him now? Would it be… rude?
DOCTOR: It's not rude to discuss your health with your spouse, Ms. Shaub, especially when it comes to something like HIV. In fact, it’s very responsible. Open communication is key. It would be good to have that conversation with him. However, for the sake of getting you tested today, we can proceed. We’ll discuss options regarding your husband later. Before we move forward with the test itself, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve been quite lucky in that regard, really. No food allergies, no medication allergies… nothing. Just the usual aches and pains, as I said.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. It’s called… amlodipine, I think. A small dose, just to keep things stable. And sometimes I take paracetamol for headaches, but that’s about it. Nothing else, Doctor. Oh! And a vitamin D supplement, during the winter months. The sun doesn’t shine much where we live.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine for blood pressure and vitamin D occasionally, and paracetamol as needed. Thank you for letting me know. Now, to proceed with the HIV test, there are a few different options. We can do a blood test, which is very accurate, or a rapid test, which involves a finger prick and gives results in about 20 minutes. Would you prefer one over the other?
PATIENT: Oh… a finger prick? I don’t really like needles, Doctor. Even the small ones. I suppose… the blood test would be better, then. Even if it takes a little longer. I'd rather have the full one, if that's alright. Is that… is that okay? I can manage a blood test, it's just the pricking that I don’t like.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shaub. A blood test is perfectly fine. We’ll take a small sample from your arm. It’s a very quick procedure. Before we go do that, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I just… I hope everything is alright. It's silly, I know, after forty years of marriage. But… one always worries, doesn't one? No, I think I'm ready. Let’s get it over with. Thank you for being so kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. It’s perfectly natural to be anxious, and you’re not silly at all. We’ll get this done quickly. If you'll follow me, we can head to the lab. The phlebotomist will take the blood sample. It should only take a few minutes. I'll be right here to discuss the results with you when they are available.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. Let’s get it done, then. I’ll follow you.
DOCTOR: Good morning, Sarah. Ms. Shaub is here for an HIV test. Sarah explains the procedure to Ms. Shaub, and I quietly observe, ensuring Ms. Shaub feels comfortable. Okay, Ms. Shaub, all done. The results should be back within a couple of hours. I’ll let you know as soon as they are available. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all. Thank you both very much. I appreciate your kindness. It wasn’t as bad as I thought, actually. I’ll just… wait here, I suppose. Is there a waiting room? Somewhere comfortable? I just… need a few moments to calm my nerves. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shaub. There’s a comfortable waiting room just down the hall. I'll come and find you as soon as the results are ready. Please, make yourself comfortable and try not to worry. I'll also have a nurse bring you a glass of water. Do you have any mobility concerns that would make it difficult for you to get to the waiting room?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thank you. I’m alright. I can walk perfectly well. Just a little… shaken, that’s all. I’ll just go and sit down, then. Thank you for asking. I appreciate your concern. I'll be right here.
