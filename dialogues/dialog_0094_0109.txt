DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Gegan. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thank you. My head… back of my head… hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now? It’s not… a bad pain, but it’s there. Always there. Like someone is… pressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about three days, constant pressure at the back of your head. I understand. And you said it's not severe, just… consistently present. To help me understand a little better, can you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Not sharp, Doctor. Not like… when I hit my thumb with hammer. More… dull. Like a weight. And… it doesn't go away when I lie down. Usually, when I lie down, things feel better. Not this. This stays.
DOCTOR: A dull, constant pressure, like a weight, and it doesn't improve when you lie down. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmmm… walking, maybe? When I walk a long way… at the rail yard… it feels a little stronger. But even when I’m sitting… it’s there. Not much makes it better, either. I take… little pills. For the ache. Don't seem to do much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so walking seems to exacerbate it slightly, but it's present regardless of activity. And the little pills you’re taking aren't providing much relief. Can you tell me what those pills are, if you know?
PATIENT: They… white. Small. My wife… she always got them. For… everything. I think… aspirin? Maybe? I find the bottle… but it’s old. Very old. I just take one or two when the head bothers me. She kept them in the kitchen.
DOCTOR: Alright, small white pills, possibly aspirin, that you've been taking from a bottle in the kitchen. It’s good you’re trying to manage it, but an old medication might not be as effective, and we need to be sure of what you're taking. Now, besides the headache, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the head. No… dizzy. No… blurry seeing. No… sick to my stomach. Just the ache. And… sometimes, I feel… tired. But I am old, you know? Maybe just old.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to rule things out. Feeling tired at your age is certainly common. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… The doctor… back in Guatemala… he said my blood… a little high. High pressure, he called it. He gave me some pills for that, too. But… I stopped taking them. They made me feel… strange. Then when I came to this country… I didn’t see a doctor for a long time. Just… the work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were diagnosed with high blood pressure in Guatemala and were prescribed medication for it, but you stopped taking it because of the side effects. And you haven’t seen a doctor regularly since moving here. Do you remember the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not remember. Small blue pill, maybe? My wife… she kept the pills. She remembered everything. I just… took them when she told me. It was a long time ago. I work hard. Rail yard. Long hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small blue pill for blood pressure, taken some time ago. That’s alright, we can certainly look into that later. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never surgery. Never in hospital. I broke my arm when I was a boy… climbing a tree… but they just put it in a cast. That’s all. I’m a strong man. Work hard. Not much time for being sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations, just a broken arm as a child. That’s good to know. Now, can you tell me about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My wife, she passed away five years ago. We have… a son. He lives in the city. Doesn't work. Always… problems. I don’t see him much. And… a daughter. She has children. I see them sometimes. But they live far away.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife. And it sounds like you have a son and a daughter. Do either of them have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: My son… he has… trouble with his mind. Doctor says something about… sadness. He takes pills for that. My daughter… she has… high blood pressure, I think. Like me. She takes pills, too. Always something with the pills, it seems.
DOCTOR: Okay, your son has a history of sadness and is taking medication, and your daughter has high blood pressure and is also taking medication. That's helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Never had any trouble. I eat everything. I work outside, get dirty, everything. Never a problem with… allergies. Maybe a little dust, but everyone gets dusty at the rail yard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we proceed, let’s clarify those pills you mentioned. You take small white pills for the headache, and you used to take small blue pills for high blood pressure. Do you still have either of those pills with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have them. Here. These are the white ones. For the head. And these… these are the blue ones. My wife kept them. I don't take them anymore.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Brum. Let me just take a look... These white pills are aspirin, 325 milligrams. And these blue pills are hydrochlorothiazide, 25 milligrams - a diuretic, often used for high blood pressure. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your current health status and then conduct a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Ask your questions. I will answer the best I can. Physical… that is fine too. I am strong, you know?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Seeing is… okay. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but that is just… old age. I can still read the newspaper. And I can still see the trains coming. That is important at the rail yard, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant changes in vision. Do you have any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No trouble swallowing. I eat everything. Soup, meat… everything. Sometimes, the food is a little dry… but I drink water with it. No trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, no difficulty swallowing. Have you experienced any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain in the chest. And I can breathe… fine. I work hard, you know? Lots of lifting, walking… I can breathe. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that is just… the work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain or shortness of breath. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Hmmm… no, Doctor. Everything is… regular. I eat… and things happen. No trouble there. Maybe a little… when I eat too much fruit… but that is just… the fruit.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant changes in bowel habits. And finally, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Weight is… the same. Maybe a little less… after I get sick with the cold… but I always get back to the same. I eat good food. I need the strength for the rail yard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent weight loss. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Go ahead. I am ready. You do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and I heard some mild crackling in your lungs. Your heart rhythm is also a little irregular. I'm going to document these findings. Now, do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Sometimes, Doctor. Especially at the end of the day. After the work… my feet feel… puffy. I put them up. Helps a little. I don’t think much of it. Just… old age.
DOCTOR: Alright, some swelling in the ankles and feet, especially after work. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay, your abdomen feels a bit full, but there’s no tenderness. Now, I’m going to do a neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and coordination. Okay, your reflexes are normal, but your coordination is a little off. That could be due to several factors, including age and fatigue. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your memory. Can you tell me the current date and year?
PATIENT: Hmm… today is… August 2nd. And the year is… 2025. Yes, 2025. My son… he told me. He likes to keep track of dates.
DOCTOR: Okay, you know the date and year. Now, can you recall three words I’m going to say?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Tell me the words. I will try my best. Sometimes… the memory… not so good. But I will try.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: table, penny, cloud. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Table… penny… cloud. Yes. I think I remember. Table, penny, cloud.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more questions. Can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: We are… in the doctor’s office. Yes. In the clinic. With you, Doctor Gegan. A nice office, very clean.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let's go back to your headache. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… always there, Doctor. Not a sharp pain, like when I hit my head. Just… a dull ache. Like someone is pressing on the back of my head. It doesn’t go away completely, even when I rest. Just… stays there. It’s been three days now. Maybe four. I lose track.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the information you’ve provided, your physical examination findings, and your history, it appears you’re experiencing a chronic headache, potentially a tension headache. The elevated blood pressure and mild crackling in your lungs are also concerning and need to be addressed. I want to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray to get a better understanding of what's going on. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions and determine the best course of treatment for your headache and other symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an X-ray… Yes, Doctor. If that helps… then yes. Do what you need to do. I just want the headache to go away. And… I don't want to feel so tired all the time. If the tests help with that… then yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. I'm going to write the orders for the blood tests and the chest X-ray. The blood tests will check your kidney function, liver function, and complete blood count. The chest X-ray will allow us to examine your lungs more closely. The nurse will schedule you for these tests. They'll draw blood from your arm, and the X-ray will be done at the imaging center across the street. Do you have any questions about these tests or the process?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Blood tests and X-ray… I understand. The nurse will help me… schedule them? Good. That is good. I trust you, Doctor. Just… tell me what the results mean when they come back. And… if the headache will go away. That is all I want.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. I understand. I will explain the results to you in detail when they come back, and we’ll discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to take aspirin for your headache as needed, but please do not exceed the recommended dosage. I'm also going to recommend you start a low-sodium diet to help lower your blood pressure. I can provide you with a handout on low-sodium foods. Additionally, I recommend you increase your water intake and get regular, moderate exercise, as tolerated. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I can eat everything. I told you that already, I think. Everything is okay. I am a strong man. Just… old. And tired. But strong.
DOCTOR: Yes, you did mention that earlier, and I apologize for repeating the question. It’s just standard procedure to confirm. Now, before we finish, I want to discuss the possibility of a referral to a neurologist. A neurologist specializes in conditions affecting the nervous system, and they may be able to provide further insight into your headache and recommend additional treatment options. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A… neurologist? A specialist? Hmm. I don’t know, Doctor. More doctors? I just want the headache to stop. And… to feel better. Is it… necessary? Will it help more than the tests and… the diet? I don't like going to many doctors.
DOCTOR: That's a valid concern, Mr. Brum. It's not necessary right away. Let's see what the results of the blood tests and chest X-ray show first. If your headache persists despite lifestyle changes and if the tests don’t reveal a clear cause, then I would strongly recommend consulting a neurologist. They have specialized tools and expertise to diagnose and treat complex headache conditions. We can hold off on the referral for now, but I want you to keep it in mind as a possibility. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all. Thank you. You have been very kind. I hope… I hope the tests help. And… I hope I can get rid of this headache. That is all I want.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I understand. I’m here to help you get better. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your tests and provide you with the handouts on low-sodium diet. If you have any questions or concerns after you leave today, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s a summary of our plan: 1. Blood Tests: To assess your kidney and liver function, and complete blood count. 2. Chest X-ray: To evaluate your lungs. 3. Low-Sodium Diet: To help lower your blood pressure. 4. Consider Neurology Referral: If your headache persists after initial treatment. Take care, and I’ll see you again after your tests.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
