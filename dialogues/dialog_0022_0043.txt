DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been having this headache… right in the back of my head. It's been going on for a little while now, and I figured I should get it checked out. It's not the worst pain, but it's… persistent, you know? Like a dull ache that just won't quit.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell, a persistent headache… I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It usually starts in the afternoon, I’d say around 2 or 3 o'clock. And it doesn’t really feel like a pounding headache, more like… pressure. Like someone’s tightening a band around my head. It’s right at the base of my skull, kinda where your neck meets your head. Does that make sense? And sometimes, it’ll go down into my shoulders a little bit. Not always, but sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A pressure sensation at the base of the skull, sometimes radiating into the shoulders… and it typically starts in the afternoon. Is there anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Honestly? Not really. I haven’t noticed anything specific that makes it better. Resting sometimes helps a little, but not much. And worse… well, maybe if I’m really stressed. But I try not to get too stressed! I used to work a lot with numbers, you know, financial advising. That could be stressful sometimes, but I'm mostly retired now. Thinking too hard maybe? That seems to bring it on sometimes, if I'm really concentrating. But it's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, so resting offers minimal relief, and possibly concentrating or thinking hard could be a trigger. Has the headache been getting progressively worse, staying the same, or has it fluctuated?
PATIENT: Oh, good question again. I’d say it’s been… fluctuating. Some days it’s barely noticeable, just a little pressure. Other days it’s enough that I have to take a little nap to get rid of it. But I don't think it's gotten worse overall, if that makes sense. It's just… unpredictable. It'll be good for a couple of days, then come back. It started maybe a month ago, I think? Around the beginning of July, maybe. I keep pretty good track of things, you know, with my work background. Dates are important.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fluctuating in intensity since the beginning of July. No significant worsening overall. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really… well, sometimes my vision gets a little blurry when it's really bad, but I figured that was just my old eyes acting up. I’m 84, Doctor, things aren't what they used to be! And maybe a little bit of dizziness sometimes, but not enough to fall or anything. Just a little woozy. I haven't had any fever or anything like that. No nausea, either. Just the headache, and sometimes a little blurry vision and dizziness. Nothing major, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, headache with occasional blurry vision and mild dizziness. No fever, nausea, or other significant symptoms. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. Well, let's see... I had high blood pressure for a while, but I’ve been managing that with medication for years now. The doctor took me off of it a couple years ago, said it was under control. My knees are pretty bad, arthritis, you know? Makes walking a little difficult sometimes. And I had a bit of a heart flutter a few years back, but they said it wasn't serious, just something to keep an eye on. Other than that… I think that’s about it. Nothing major, hopefully. I try to stay active, even with the knees. It’s important to keep moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of hypertension - currently off medication, arthritis in the knees, and a past episode of heart flutter. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… I had my appendix taken out when I was a young man, back in the war, actually. And I had a cataract removed from my right eye a few years ago. That’s about it. Nothing too major, nothing recent. They said the cataract surgery went well, and my vision in that eye is much better now. I'm still waiting on the other one, but the doctor said it’s not bad enough yet to warrant surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and cataract surgery. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Ah, that's a tough one. My wife… well, my ex-wife, she had some problems with her heart later in life. And her mother had diabetes. My father… he lived a long life, but I think he had some trouble with his memory in his later years. Nothing too specific that I can think of, honestly. We didn't really talk about medical things much in my family. It wasn't something we were comfortable with, I guess. I'm an only child, so there wasn't much comparing notes to be done, either. I wish I could be more helpful, but that’s about all I know.
DOCTOR: Alright, so history of heart problems in a former spouse, diabetes in her mother, and possible memory issues in your father. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything regularly right now?
PATIENT: Good question! Let me think... just some vitamins, really. A multivitamin, and some Vitamin D. The doctor said I wasn't getting enough sun. And sometimes I take some ibuprofen for my knees, when they're really acting up. That's about it. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter stuff. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I've seen enough of those in my life! And I haven't been to the doctor much lately, honestly, other than my regular checkups. I like to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamins, Vitamin D, and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. No other regular medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. No food allergies, no reactions to any pills… I’ve been pretty lucky in that regard, actually. I remember being a little allergic to bee stings as a kid, but that was a long time ago, and I haven’t been stung in decades. So, no, no allergies that I’m aware of. I think I'd remember if I was allergic to something! It’s hard to forget something like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, before I do a quick physical exam, let's just briefly talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not anymore. I used to smoke when I was younger, back during the war, but I quit a long time ago. Must be… oh, 50 years ago now? Maybe more. And I don’t drink much alcohol either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, but that’s about it. And recreational drugs? Never touched them, never had any interest. I was always a pretty straight-laced fella. I prefer a good book, you know? Or a nice walk in the park. That’s my kind of recreation. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Really simple.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Percell. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a much better picture of your overall health. Now, if you don’t mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m ready when you are. I always figured a good check-up was a good idea. It's better to be safe than sorry, you know? Especially at my age. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. I'm not hearing any unusual sounds. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackling. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. I'm noting some mild clouding of the lenses, consistent with cataracts. And finally, I'm feeling your neck muscles. They are a little tense, which could be contributing to your headache. I don’t feel any significant swelling or tenderness. Overall, your physical exam is fairly unremarkable for your age, but the tense neck muscles and slightly diminished reflexes are worth noting. Alright, Percell. Everything seems within normal limits for your age. However, given your headache, the tension in your neck, and your history of high blood pressure, I'd like to order some blood work just to rule out anything serious. We'll check your thyroid levels, kidney function, and also do a complete blood count. I also think a CT scan of your head might be helpful to get a better look at what’s going on. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood work and a scan… if that’s what you think is best, then I trust your judgment. I’d rather be safe than sorry, like I said. A little scan and some blood work… no problem at all. Just let me know what I need to do. Where do I go for those tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a few appointments next week, so I'd like to make sure I can fit it all in. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. It's nice to have someone who takes the time to figure things out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I can help. For the blood work, you can go to the lab just down the hall, they’re open until 5:00 PM today. They'll send the results directly to me. As for the CT scan, we can schedule that at the imaging center across town. Let me have my assistant, Sarah, call them now and find a convenient time for you next week. She’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the scan. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, so I’d expect to hear from me within a week or so. In the meantime, if your headache gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, weakness, or vision changes, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with the tension in your neck. It’s a low dose, and it should help ease some of the discomfort. And I recommend you continue with the ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay, so blood work down the hall, scan scheduled by Sarah, muscle relaxant prescription… got it. That sounds like a plan. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you for being so thorough. And thank you for not dismissing my headache as just "old age," you know? It's nice to feel like someone is actually listening. I appreciate it. Should I call Sarah before I leave, or will she come find me? And is there anything I should avoid doing before the scan? Like, should I eat anything special, or…? I always worry about these things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. It's my job to listen and figure things out, and I take that seriously. Sarah will come find you before you leave to schedule the scan, so you don't need to worry about that. As for the scan, you can eat and drink normally beforehand. There are no special preparations required. However, if you have any metal implants or pacemakers, please let her know when she calls you. It’s just a standard precaution. And again, if your headache worsens or you develop any new symptoms, don't hesitate to call. I want to emphasize that these tests are just to rule out anything serious. It’s very likely that your headache is related to muscle tension, but it's always best to be thorough. I'm optimistic we’ll get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better soon. Do you have any other concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very patient and helpful, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man like me. I feel much better just knowing what's going on, and knowing that you’re on top of it. Thank you again for everything. I’ll wait for Sarah to come find me, and I’ll schedule that scan. And I'll call if anything changes. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. It was my pleasure meeting you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, if anything changes, please call the office immediately. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
