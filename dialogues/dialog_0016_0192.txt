DOCTOR: Hi Delron, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I'm here 'cause... well, the army. They want me to take this test before they even think about letting me join. Seems silly, but, you know. Gotta do what they say. It's a pre-test thing. I guess you gotta check I ain't fallin' apart before they let me near anything important.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A pre-enlistment physical. Perfectly reasonable, actually – they want to make sure everyone is healthy and fit for service. No problem at all, we can definitely get that done for you. Let me pull up a form here... So, just to confirm, this is for the United States Army, correct?
PATIENT: United States? No. Sweden. Swedish army. Honestly, sometimes people just assume... It's a bit annoying, really. I mean, do I ask everyone if they're from America? No. It's just... common sense. But, yes. Swedish army. And I'm perfectly fit, just so you know. I work with engines all day. It's not like I'm sat around eating biscuits.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to point that out, Delron. My apologies; that was a poor assumption on my part. Sweden, of course! And working with engines is good physical work. I didn’t mean to imply otherwise. Okay, Swedish army pre-enlistment physical… Let’s get some background information first, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? What does that even mean? Look, I've had the usual colds, a bit of flu now and then. Nothing a good lay down and a strong coffee couldn't fix. Broke my wrist when I was a kid, fell off a bicycle. But that was ages ago. Fully healed. I wouldn’t be workin’ with engines if I was broken, would I? I think I'm pretty solid, to be honest. Are you gonna ask me about every sniffle I've ever had?
DOCTOR: No, not every sniffle! I just need to get a sense of your overall medical history. “Significant” just means anything that required a doctor’s visit, or kept you from your usual activities for a while. Okay, so broken wrist as a child, healed completely – that’s good to know. And just occasional colds and flu. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. Absolutely not. I don't do hospitals. Waste of time, mostly. You sit around waiting for hours and they tell you to drink water. I can drink water perfectly well at home, thank you very much. I've never needed hospitalizin’ in my life. A bit of ice and a bandage usually does the trick. What's this all about anyway? You're making it sound like I’m falling apart.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Delron. You seem very robust, I assure you. The army just has protocols they need to follow. Okay, no hospitalizations. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions currently – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? Look at me! Do I look like I have diabetes? I work with metal all day. And no, I don’t have high blood pressure. I don’t spend my life sat around worryin’. I get up, I work, I eat, I sleep. That's it. I'm perfectly healthy. Honestly, it's a bit insulting you're askin' me these things. Like I’m some sort of weakling. I'm a mechanic, for goodness sake.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions are coming across that way, Delron. It’s just standard procedure to rule things out. You're right to be offended if it feels like I'm questioning your health, and I assure you that isn’t my intention. We just need to cover all the bases. Okay, let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. None. Vitamins? Sometimes I take a multivitamin, the cheap ones from the supermarket. Doesn’t really matter, does it? It's just a bit of extra somethin’. I don’t rely on pills to keep me goin’. And that’s it. No fancy stuff. Just… a vitamin, now and then. I eat a reasonably balanced diet, mostly. I'm not one of those people who needs all sorts of potions and powders to function. Is this all you're gonna do? Ask questions? When do we actually do something?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Delron. I'm just gathering information before we move onto the physical exam. We're almost there. Okay, occasional multivitamin. Last question for now: do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not really. I get a bit itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but that's just… normal, isn’t it? Everyone gets a bit itchy around cats. It's the fur. Nothing serious. No life-threatening stuff. I can eat anything, I don’t react to any pills, and I haven’t been stung by a bee in years. I’m pretty robust, remember? This is all very… thorough. Are we finished with the questions now? I’m startin’ to feel like I’m back in school.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are finished with the questions for now. You are right to feel like you're back in school! It is thorough, as it should be. Okay, excellent. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure – which I suspect will be perfectly normal – and a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But if you try to poke me with a needle, I'm walkin’ out. I hate needles. And honestly, I don't see why you need to listen to my heart. It's beatin', isn't it? What more do you need to know? But, yeah. Get on with it. Just… be quick. I've got things to do. And no needles. Promise me, no needles.
DOCTOR: No needles, I promise. Absolutely no needles today. We're just doing a basic exam. Alright, if you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It's cold, I warn you! Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Blood pressure is 128/76. Perfectly normal, as I suspected. Now, let's just take a quick look in your ears… and your throat… everything looks clear and healthy. No signs of infection or inflammation.
PATIENT: See? What did I tell you? Perfectly healthy. You’re wasting your time. I told you I was solid. All this pokin' and listenin' was unnecessary. Honestly, I could be fixin’ engines right now. Are we finished? Can I go now? I’ve got a customer waitin'. A Volvo, needs a new timing belt. Important job.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Delron. Everything does sound and look perfectly healthy. The exam confirmed what you already knew – you’re in excellent condition. We’ve completed the pre-enlistment physical. I’ll need you to sign this form confirming the results. The army may require some additional bloodwork, but that would be scheduled through them directly. I’ll also provide you with a summary of today’s findings. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? Oh, for goodness sake. Not more pokin'! I suppose I don’t have a choice. No. No questions. Just… can I have a copy of that summary thing? For my records, you know. And tell the army to hurry up. I’ve got a Volvo waitin'. A very important Volvo. And, honestly, I don't need any lectures about healthy livin’ from anyone. I know my body. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, here’s a copy for your records. And I'll make a note to expedite the results to the army. Have a good day, Delron. And good luck with that Volvo! Let me know if you have any questions later.
