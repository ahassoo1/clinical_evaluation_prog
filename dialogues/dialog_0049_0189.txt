DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my…bathroom habits, I suppose you could call it. Not something a man likes to discuss with a…a woman, but here we are. There was blood. In my stool. Quite alarming, really. Not a small amount, either. I’ve seen enough in my life to know what’s normal and what isn't, and this definitely wasn’t normal.
DOCTOR: Blood in the stool, you say. And you’ve noticed this recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Goodness, I don’t know exactly. I’m not one for keeping calendars of my…digestive events. A few days, maybe? A week? It’s all a blur when you’re getting on in years, you know. I just noticed it when I…well, when I was finished. It wasn’t a little speck, either. A proper amount. And it’s not like I’ve been eating beets, if that’s what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: Right. A few days to a week. And it wasn’t related to anything you ate. Do you recall if it was bright red blood, darker, or… something else?
PATIENT: Bright red. Definitely bright red. Like…well, like you’d expect blood to look, I suppose. Not dark and…congealed. Fresh, you understand? Which is…worrying, isn’t it? A man doesn’t want fresh blood coming out of there, let me tell you. It makes you think. Makes you think about… things.
DOCTOR: Bright red blood suggests bleeding closer to the rectum. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort with bowel movements, or any pain in your abdomen at all?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. A bit of…pressure, maybe? Like straining a bit more than usual. Old age, you know? Things don't work quite like they used to. But proper pain? No. And my abdomen…feels alright, I suppose. I don’t go poking around in there, if that’s what you’re asking. Why would I?
DOCTOR: Of course. No poking around. Have you noticed any changes in your stool consistency?
PATIENT: Consistency? What do you mean, consistency? It’s…stool. It goes in soft, comes out…not soft. Usually. A bit hard, sometimes. You’re asking a lot of…personal questions, you know. A man used to just tell the doctor what’s wrong, not describe every detail of his…excretion.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom. But these details are important. Has it been harder than usual lately?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it…yes. A bit harder. And smaller amounts, perhaps? I haven't been…regular, shall we say. Not like the old days when I was flying. You eat at proper times then, you understand? Kept everything moving. This…retirement life isn't good for a man's insides, I tell you. It’s all sitting and…thinking.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Now that is a thought. My wife…well, my ex-wife, she always used to keep track of such things. I haven’t been on the scale myself, truthfully. My trousers feel a little…looser, maybe? But that could just be the heat. It’s been awfully warm this summer. A man loses his appetite in this heat, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I’m going to need to conduct a physical exam. Specifically, a rectal exam. This is necessary to determine the source of the bleeding. It’s a standard procedure, and it will provide valuable information. Are you agreeable to this?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Good heavens. Look, I appreciate your…thoroughness, Doctor, but…is that absolutely necessary? Couldn’t we just…send a sample? Or something? I’ve lived a long life, seen a lot of the world, flown a lot of miles. I don’t particularly care for the idea of…that. It's…undignified.
DOCTOR: A stool sample will only tell us if there's blood present, not where it's coming from. To properly assess the situation and rule out anything serious – and given your age and the bright red blood you've described – a rectal exam is the most appropriate first step. I understand your discomfort, but it’s a crucial part of the evaluation. It will take only a few moments. We can proceed in a private and respectful manner. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Look, I…I suppose. I don’t like it. Not one bit. But if you insist it’s necessary… alright. Just… be quick about it, would you? And no… unnecessary poking around. I’ve got things to do, you know. Important things. Used to fly important people. This… isn’t important.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie on your side with your knees drawn up. I’ll explain each step as I go. It will be as quick and comfortable as possible. I need to assess the rectum for any abnormalities, such as hemorrhoids, polyps, or other sources of bleeding. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort during the exam. If you're ready, we can proceed.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with. Just… try not to make a spectacle of things. And don’t go sticking your whole arm up there, if you don’t mind. .
