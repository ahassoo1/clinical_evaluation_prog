DOCTOR: Hi Lakiya, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. My back… it is painful. It has been this way for some time now. I would like to know what can be done about it, if anything. I do not want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain can be really disruptive. No need to worry about wasting my time, that’s what I'm here for. “Some time now” is a bit vague – could you tell me roughly how long you've been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Approximately three months, Doctor. It started after I was helping to put up a new fence on the reservation. A very long fence. I thought it was just a strain at first, but it has not gotten better. It seems to… worsen with activity.
DOCTOR: Alright, three months. And it began after putting up a long fence… that gives me a good starting point. You mentioned it worsens with activity. Can you describe the activity that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Lifting, mostly. And bending. It is difficult to… to even stand straight for very long sometimes. Also, if I try to twist. It is a sharp pain, not a dull ache. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Sharp pain with lifting, bending, and twisting... okay. Is the pain radiating anywhere – like down your legs, or into your hips?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. It stays in my lower back. Right across the small of my back. It does not go down my legs. It feels… tight there, like a muscle is always pulled. I have tried some warm compresses, but they do not help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so localized to the lower back, no radiating pain. And warm compresses haven’t provided much relief. Have you noticed anything that does make it feel a little better, even temporarily?
PATIENT: Rest. Doctor. When I sit very still, it is… less painful. But I cannot always sit still. My work… requires movement. I also find that lying flat on my back helps, but again, that is not practical for very long.
DOCTOR: Alright. So rest and lying flat offer some relief. Let’s talk a bit about your work… what kind of movement does it require?
PATIENT: We put up fences. Mostly post and wire. A lot of digging holes, setting posts, stretching wire… lifting the posts is the worst part, I think. They are quite heavy. And sometimes we have to work on uneven ground, which makes it harder to balance. I have been doing this work for… nearly twenty years.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy lifting, digging, working on uneven ground…twenty years of that’s a lot of strain on the back. Do you remember anything specific about how the pain started that day with the fence?
PATIENT: I was lifting a post, and I felt a… a pop. Not a loud pop, but something shifted. Then the pain started almost immediately. It was not a gradual thing. It was quite sudden. I tried to keep working, but it quickly became too much. That is when I knew something was wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, a "pop" sensation with the sudden onset of pain… that’s helpful information. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll need you to lie down on the exam table. I'll check your range of motion and see if I can pinpoint where the pain is coming from. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly acceptable, Doctor. I would like to know what you think is causing this, if you can determine that. I trust your judgment. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could lie face up for me, please. I'm just going to gently feel along your spine and have you move in a few different directions. Let me know immediately if anything causes sharp pain. Okay, just relaxing. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Right… there. When you press on that spot. It is a sharp pain. Not constant, but when you push… yes, that is it. It feels like a knot, almost. A very tender knot. Please be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm being very careful. Yes, I feel a definite tenderness there, and I can feel some muscle spasm. Now, could you slowly try to bend forward at the waist, keeping your legs straight?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That is… painful. It is not unbearable, but it is quite uncomfortable. It hurts more the further I bend. I can only go so far. It feels like something is… blocking me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion and pain with forward bending. Now, if you could lie on your side, with your knees bent up towards your chest, please. I’m going to gently rotate your leg and see how that feels.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I am ready. Please be gentle, if you would. It is difficult to stay still for very long, but I will try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how does that feel?
PATIENT: It feels… tight. Not sharp pain, but a pulling sensation in my hip and lower back. Like the muscle is resisting the movement. A bit uncomfortable, but not… terrible. It is difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay. That gives me a better idea. Alright. Just relaxing again. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain, possibly with some facet joint irritation in your lower back. The “pop” you felt suggests some initial injury to the muscle, and the tenderness and limited range of motion support that. The pulling sensation could be related to tightness in the surrounding muscles. Do you have any other medical conditions, like arthritis, that you know of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have arthritis, or any other significant medical conditions. I have Medicare, and I see my regular doctor for checkups, but I have not had any major health problems. My husband… he passed away several years ago. It was a long illness. But other than that… no. I am generally quite healthy, despite my work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications regularly. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but that is all. I prefer to avoid medications if possible. I believe in letting my body heal naturally, if it can.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's helpful. Alright, so no medications. Based on everything we’ve discussed, I think a conservative approach is best. This means rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen if you can tolerate them. Gentle stretching can also help, but avoid anything that causes sharp pain. I'm going to recommend physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you specific exercises to strengthen your core and back muscles, improve your range of motion, and prevent future injuries. Would you be interested in a referral to physical therapy?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A referral to physical therapy sounds very reasonable. I would like to try that, if you think it will help. I am willing to do whatever it takes to get my back better. I need to be able to work, you see. That is how I support myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. Wonderful. I'll go ahead and write you a referral to a local physical therapy clinic. They'll assess your condition and create a personalized treatment plan. I'll also give you a handout with some gentle stretches you can start at home. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not believe I do. You have answered all of my questions, and you have explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your time and your attention. I will schedule an appointment with the physical therapist as soon as possible. Thank you again. I think… that is all. I should get going.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lakiya. I'm glad I could help. Just remember to listen to your body, don't push yourself too hard, and follow the instructions from the physical therapist. Here's the referral and the handout. If you have any concerns or your pain worsens, please don't hesitate to contact my office. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. .
