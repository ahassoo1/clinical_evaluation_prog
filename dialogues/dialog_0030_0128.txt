DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor...Quicksey, right? Yes, that’s a nice name. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think... It's my joints, I think. They're just…stiff in the mornings. It’s been happening for a while now, but it's getting a little bit worse, maybe? I don't really know how long, exactly. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Quicksey is correct. It’s perfectly alright if the timing is a bit fuzzy. We can work through it. So, stiffness in your joints, especially in the mornings. Could you tell me which joints are bothering you the most?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… It's mostly my hands, I think. And my knees… yes, my knees are bad too. When I get up, it's like… creaky, you know? Like an old door. And it takes a bit to get going. It’s not a sharp pain, just…uncomfortable. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. I used to be able to do so much more around the house, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. “Creaky” and “uncomfortable” are very helpful descriptions. So, stiffness and discomfort primarily in your hands and knees, worse in the mornings. Does this stiffness improve throughout the day, or does it remain fairly consistent?
PATIENT: Oh, it gets better, yes. It's much better by afternoon, usually. Like… after I’ve been moving around for a while. If I sit for too long, it comes back a bit. But it’s not as bad as first thing in the morning. Definitely better after I've done things. I used to love gardening, but now… well, getting up and down is tricky. I don’t want to fall! Do you understand? It's just...old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lilliana. It’s not necessarily just “old age,” though. Many things can cause joint stiffness. It’s good that it improves with activity; that gives us some helpful information. Now, aside from your hands and knees, have you noticed any stiffness or discomfort in any other joints – your elbows, wrists, shoulders, hips, ankles, or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Shoulders, sometimes. Not every day, but… yes, my shoulders get a bit achy if I reach up too high. Like when I'm trying to get something off a shelf. And maybe… my feet a little, but I always thought that was just from being on them so much. I do a lot of walking, you know, when the weather is nice. Everything just feels a bit… worn out, if that makes sense. I don’t know if that helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely helps. So, we have stiffness and discomfort in your hands, knees, shoulders, and possibly your feet, improving with activity. Now, let's talk a little bit about other symptoms. Have you noticed any swelling in any of these joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t really looked for swelling, to be honest. I just know when they hurt! But… sometimes my knuckles look a little puffy, maybe? Especially after I’ve been doing things for a while. But it’s not like… a big balloon or anything. Just… a little bit bigger than usual, perhaps? I don't know if that counts as swelling. Everything is blurry these days, you know? I forget to notice things.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Lilliana. It’s very common to not notice subtle changes. “A little puffy” is helpful information. Now, have you experienced any redness or warmth in those joints, alongside the discomfort and puffiness?
PATIENT: Redness… no, I don't think so. And warmth… no, not that I’ve noticed. They just… ache. Sometimes more than others, but not usually red or hot. I haven’t felt any fever or anything like that either, if that’s what you're asking. Just tired, mostly. Everything feels a bit heavy, you know? Both my body and my mind. I get confused easily these days. Is this taking too long? I don’t want to bother you.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Lilliana. You’re not bothering me in the slightest. It’s important to gather as much information as possible, and you’re doing a wonderful job. It’s helpful to know there’s no redness, warmth, or fever. So, no fever, no redness, no warmth—just fatigue, discomfort, and stiffness. Now, let's switch gears a bit. Have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… Well, my husband, God rest his soul, always handled the doctor’s appointments. I mostly just went along. I had… something with my blood pressure, I think? Years ago. The doctor put me on a pill, but I stopped taking it eventually. It made me feel… dizzy. And… oh! I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. That was scary. But other than that… I don’t really know. I have a bit of trouble remembering things. Is it important? I don’t want to leave anything out. I just... forget.
DOCTOR: It is important, and you’re doing great. We’ll get everything we need. So, high blood pressure in the past, and gallbladder removal. Do you remember approximately when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a long time ago. Let me think… My husband, George, was still alive. He… he loved to go fishing. So it must have been before he… passed. Oh, dear. I’m getting all confused now. Maybe… twenty years ago? Or more? It’s all a blur. I was so worried about George, everything feels… distant. It was definitely before 2010, I think. Does that help? I really can't be sure. I apologize. I wish my memory was better.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Lilliana. Approximately twenty years ago. And you were still with your husband, George, at that time. It's perfectly alright that the details are blurry, we’ll work with what you remember. Now, have you had any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don't think so. I had a… a bad fall a few years ago, and I went to the emergency room, but they didn't operate. Just x-rays and a bandage. Oh! And I had my wisdom teeth taken out when I was young, but that doesn't really count as surgery, does it? Everything feels like such a long time ago. I just… can't recall anything major. I really wish I could be more helpful. My memory is just… terrible these days. Is it okay if I sit down? I'm feeling a bit lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Of course, please do sit down. It’s perfectly alright, Lilliana. We're making progress. No major surgeries besides the gallbladder removal and the fall. You’re being very helpful. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… I used to take something for my blood pressure, but I stopped, like I said. Now… I take a little pill for my arthritis, but it doesn’t seem to do much. It’s a white pill… small, round. And I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, when I remember. My neighbor told me I should. That’s all I can think of. I really don’t take many medications. I try to avoid them if I can. Is that enough? I’m afraid I’m forgetting something important. It’s just… all a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilliana. You're doing wonderfully. So, a pill for arthritis, a white, round pill, and vitamin D occasionally. Do you know the name of the arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. It’s a small bottle… blue and white. Let me see if I can remember what the doctor said… I think it started with an “N”? No… maybe a “C”? Oh, I’m so sorry. I really should write these things down, shouldn’t I? I just… forget. It’s one of those things the pharmacist gives me, and I just take it. I don't know the name. It’s probably something simple. I’m really not much help, am I? Is this frustrating for you? I apologize.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Lilliana. You're not frustrating me in the slightest. It’s very common to have trouble remembering medication names, especially with multiple medications. We’ll figure it out. Let's not worry about the name right now. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. My husband, George, always said I had a cast iron stomach. He used to joke that I could eat nails and not get sick! So, no allergies, as far as I know. I've never been one to worry about that sort of thing. But now that you mention it… sometimes my skin gets a little itchy after I use a certain soap. But it's not a serious allergy, just a little irritation. Does that count? I apologize if I'm rambling. It's just… my mind isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilliana. It’s helpful to know about the itchy skin reaction to the soap. We can make a note of that. So, no known drug allergies, just a mild skin reaction to a certain soap. Now, finally, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My mother always said it was terrible for you, and I always listened to her. My husband, George, smoked a little when he was young, but he quit years ago. He said it was the best thing he ever did. No, I’ve never smoked, and I don't drink much either. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing strong. Is that enough? I apologize if I'm taking up too much of your time. I really wish I could be more clear. It's just... everything feels so fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: You are not taking up too much of my time, Lilliana. And you're being wonderfully clear. So, no smoking, very limited alcohol consumption. Okay, thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a really good picture of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look at your hands and knees. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. My husband, George, always said doctors knew best. He was a very practical man. Just… be gentle with my knees, please? They're a bit sensitive these days. And if I get a little confused, please don't hesitate to explain things slowly. I apologize in advance. I'm a bit of a worrier, you know. But thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's nice to have someone to talk to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilliana. I will absolutely be gentle with your knees, and I'll explain everything slowly and clearly. Please don't hesitate to tell me if anything is uncomfortable, or if you have any questions at all. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: There you go. It's a little chilly in here, isn't it? My circulation isn't what it used to be. But I'm ready when you are, Doctor. Just... don't be surprised if I ask you to repeat things. My mind wanders sometimes. Thank you for being so patient. It's very kind of you.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. It’s something we can certainly monitor and discuss. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No unusual sounds detected. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. Could you please hold them out for me, palms up?
PATIENT: There you go. They're a bit arthritic, as you can see. They used to be so nimble, but now… not so much. I used to love knitting, but it’s too painful now. Is something wrong? They feel a bit swollen sometimes, but I always thought it was just from age. Please don’t hesitate to tell me if I’m being silly. I apologize if I’m rambling again. It's just… I get nervous at the doctor’s office. It reminds me of my husband, George. He always took care of these things. Thank you for being so patient.
DOCTOR: I see some mild swelling and redness around your knuckles, particularly on your right hand. There's some tenderness when I press here. This is consistent with what you described – discomfort and stiffness, especially in the mornings. It appears to be osteoarthritis, which is a common condition, particularly as we age. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please bend your knees as much as is comfortable for me?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a bit uncomfortable, I must admit. They creak a lot, as you can probably hear. And they feel a bit stiff, even now. I can’t bend them as far as I used to. My husband, George, used to say I had the knees of a ninety-year-old, even when I was younger! Is something wrong? I always thought it was just wear and tear. Please don’t hesitate to tell me if I’m being silly. Thank you for being so patient. It's nice to have someone to talk to.
DOCTOR: I feel some mild swelling around both knees, and there’s some tenderness when I press here, particularly on the inner side. You have some crepitus – that’s the clicking sound you hear – which is also common with osteoarthritis. Your range of motion is slightly limited, but not drastically so. Based on what I’m seeing and hearing, this also appears to be consistent with osteoarthritis. Okay, Lilliana. Based on the examination and your history, it appears you have osteoarthritis in your hands and knees. It's a common condition, and there are a number of things we can do to help manage the symptoms. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Osteo…arthritis? Is that serious? Will I end up in a wheelchair? My husband, George, always said I worried too much. I always thought it was just getting old. What can we do about it? Will I have to take a lot of pills? I really don’t want to take a lot of pills. And will it get worse? I’m a bit scared, I must admit. Is there anything I can do to help myself? Please don’t hesitate to explain things slowly. Thank you for being so patient. It's nice to have someone to talk to. I'm a bit confused, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Lilliana, and it's perfectly normal to feel scared and confused. Let’s take them one by one. First, osteoarthritis is not life-threatening, and it's unlikely you’ll end up in a wheelchair. It's a degenerative condition, meaning it gets worse over time, but we can manage the symptoms and slow down the progression. As for getting worse, that’s why we need to start a plan now to help minimize the impact. Regarding pills, we don’t necessarily need to start a lot of medications. There are many non-medication options we can try first. Things like physical therapy, exercise, weight management if needed, and over-the-counter pain relievers. We can also discuss topical creams or injections if needed down the line. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Physical therapy? What’s that? Will it hurt? I’m a bit afraid of exercise, because my knees are so sensitive. And I don’t think I can lose any weight, because I don’t eat much as it is. I always thought my knees were just getting old. Is it something I did? Please don’t hesitate to explain things slowly. I’m a bit confused, if you don’t mind. My husband, George, always said I worried too much. He’s… gone now. Thank you for being so patient. It’s nice to have someone to talk to. It's just… everything feels so overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you feel overwhelmed, Lilliana. And it’s okay to be scared and confused. Let’s take things one step at a time. Physical therapy involves exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knees and hands, improve your range of motion, and reduce pain. It won't necessarily be painful, but it might be a little uncomfortable at first. The therapist will tailor the exercises to your specific needs and abilities. We’ll start slowly and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. And you don’t necessarily need to lose a lot of weight. Even a small amount of weight loss can help reduce the stress on your joints. We can discuss healthy eating habits if you’re interested. And no, this isn’t something you did. Osteoarthritis is often related to wear and tear over time, genetics, and age. It’s not your fault. Let’s start with a referral to physical therapy. They’ll assess your condition and create a personalized plan for you. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… okay. That sounds… manageable, I suppose. As long as it’s not too painful. And if it doesn’t help, can I stop? My husband, George, always said I had a low pain tolerance. I’m a bit of a worrier, if you don’t mind. And if it’s expensive, I don’t know if I can afford it. I’m not very good with money, if you don’t mind. I'm a widow, you know. It’s just… a lot to think about. Thank you for being so patient. It’s nice to have someone to talk to. What else do we need to do?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask those questions, Lilliana. It’s important to feel comfortable and in control. Yes, you can absolutely stop physical therapy if it’s not helping, or if it’s too painful. It’s completely your decision. Regarding cost, I'll have the office staff check with your insurance to see what’s covered. If cost is a concern, we can also explore some lower-cost options, like community-based programs. In addition to physical therapy, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to help manage pain and inflammation. We can also discuss some simple exercises you can do at home. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen… I think I’ve heard of those. But I don’t want to take too many pills. My husband, George, always said pills were bad for you. And I don’t want to get addicted or anything. And I’m not very good at remembering to take pills, if you don’t mind. And I don’t want to forget, and then take too many, and then get sick. And simple exercises… what kind of exercises? I don’t want to fall and hurt myself. My knees are so sensitive, and I’m a bit wobbly on my feet. And… what about the cream? You mentioned cream earlier. What kind of cream? And does it smell funny? I don’t like smelly creams. Oh dear. It’s just… a lot to think about. Thank you for being so patient. It’s nice to have someone to talk to. What about seeing my neighbor? She's a nurse. Do you think that's okay?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Lilliana. Let's address them one by one. First, acetaminophen and ibuprofen are generally safe when taken as directed. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. And no, they're not addictive. We'll focus on taking the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. Regarding exercises, we'll start with very simple, gentle exercises that you can do at home. Things like walking, stretching, and leg lifts. We'll focus on exercises that improve your strength and balance without putting too much stress on your knees. As for the cream, it's a topical cream containing capsaicin, which is derived from chili peppers. It can help reduce pain and inflammation. It does have a slight odor, but it's not overwhelming. We can try a small amount to see if you tolerate it. And yes, it’s perfectly okay to talk to your neighbor, the nurse. She can offer some additional support and advice. Let’s focus on getting you scheduled for physical therapy first. Then we can discuss the pain relievers and the cream at your follow-up appointment. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Physical therapy first… okay. That sounds… manageable. And then we can talk about the pills and the cream later. That’s… good. I don’t want to be overwhelmed. And if it doesn’t work, can I see someone else? My husband, George, always said it’s good to get a second opinion. And if it’s expensive, can we talk about that first? I’m not very good with money, if you don’t mind. Oh dear. It’s just… a lot to think about. Thank you for being so patient. It’s nice to have someone to talk to. What about my gardening? Can I still do that? I miss my flowers.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You can certainly see someone else if you’re not happy with the first therapist. Getting a second opinion is always a good idea. And we’ll definitely discuss the cost before starting anything. We’ll explore all your options. As for your gardening, that’s a great question. We’ll need to modify it a bit to protect your knees and hands. We can talk about using raised garden beds, kneeling pads, and taking frequent breaks. We’ll focus on gardening techniques that minimize stress on your joints. It’s important to continue doing things you enjoy, but we’ll need to do it safely. For today, let’s focus on getting you scheduled for physical therapy. Then we’ll tackle the other issues one step at a time. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… yes. That sounds… good. And then we can talk about the other things later. One step at a time. That’s… good. My husband, George, always said slow and steady wins the race. Oh dear. It’s just… a lot to think about. Thank you for being so patient. It’s nice to have someone to talk to. Are we finished now? I’m a bit tired. I think I need a nap. And maybe some tea.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lilliana, we are finished for today. You’ve done a wonderful job, and I’m very proud of you for taking this first step. The office staff will schedule your physical therapy appointment and follow up with you regarding any questions you may have. Please, take a nap and have some tea. You deserve it. And don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. It was lovely meeting you, Lilliana. Take care, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. It was lovely meeting you too.
