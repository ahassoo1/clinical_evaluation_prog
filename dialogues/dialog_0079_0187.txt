DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Chest… it hurts. And my heart… feels like it’s jumping. Doctor said blood pressure too high last time. I no like feeling this way. Want to be quick, okay? Busy man.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Sobkowicz. We will be as efficient as possible. You mentioned chest pain and a sensation of your heart “jumping.” Can you describe the chest pain for me?
PATIENT: Describe? It… ache. Not sharp. Dull ache. Sometimes… feels tight. Like someone sitting on my chest. And it comes and goes. Not all the time, thankfully. I eat, it happens. Worry too much, it happens. Everything happens! Just… tell me what test I need, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand you’re experiencing discomfort related to eating and stress. To get a clearer picture, could you rate the pain on a scale of one to ten, with one being very mild and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Ten? Doctor, what is this, school? One to ten… hmph. Usually… maybe a four? Sometimes five when I really upset myself. But I don't like numbers. Just… feeling bad. Makes me tired. Very tired. Now, what next? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. We’ll proceed. Given your description and the history of elevated blood pressure, I’d like to begin with a physical examination. I will listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again. Afterward, we'll likely need to order some tests. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests… always tests. Fine. Whatever you need. Just… don’t take all day. My wife, she make good food. Don’t want to miss it. Hurry, please. And be gentle, okay? Old man. Not strong anymore.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie back on the examination table. Heart sounds are somewhat diminished, but regular rhythm detected. No murmurs appreciated at this time. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 168 over 92. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, can you tell me if you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Sometimes… a little. After I sit too long. Wife says it’s the water. Old age, she says. I don't know. Mostly just tired. And this chest… it bothers me. What does blood pressure mean anyway? Is it very bad? Just tell me straight, doctor. No fancy words.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, Mr. Sobkowicz. Think of your blood vessels like pipes. When the pressure is too high, it puts strain on those pipes, and can lead to problems with your heart, brain, and kidneys over time. That's why it’s important to manage it. Now, have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, dizziness, or nausea recently?
PATIENT: Nausea? No. Short of breath… sometimes. When I walk up the stairs. Not so fast anymore. Stairs are… enemy. Dizzy… not really. A little lightheaded sometimes when I stand up quick. Like everything spin for one second. But old man things, you know? What is next, doctor? I can feel my wife yelling already. She doesn't like me gone long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms and medical history, I'd like to order an electrocardiogram – an EKG – to check your heart’s electrical activity. We'll also need some blood work to assess your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and rule out any other potential causes for your discomfort. Finally, a chest X-ray will help us evaluate your lungs and heart size. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: X-ray… blood… more tests! Hmph. Fine. Whatever you think. But can't be all day, okay? And… is this going to cost a lot of money? My wife, she worry about money. Just… get it done quickly. I want to go home. Now, where do I go for these… tests? Do I need appointment? Tell me straight, doctor. No run around.
DOCTOR: The tests will take some time, Mr. Sobkowicz. It's difficult to give an exact cost estimate without knowing your insurance coverage, but the lab and radiology departments can provide you with detailed billing information. Here is a list of our preferred labs and radiology centers. You will need to schedule appointments, and the phone numbers are listed on the pamphlet. You'll need to bring your insurance card and a photo ID. Once the results are available – typically within 24 to 48 hours – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Treatment plan… more things. Insurance… ID… hmph. Yes, yes, I understand. Lab… radiology… appointments. My wife will handle it. She always does. Just… tell me one thing. Is it… serious, doctor? Is my heart… broken? Just give me straight answer. I'm old man. Not need to worry about everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, it’s too early to say definitively whether anything is “broken.” Your symptoms do warrant investigation. The tests will provide us with more information, and we can determine the best course of action from there. It's important to remain calm and address this proactively. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. Just… get the tests done quickly. Broken heart… hmph. My wife will be mad. .
