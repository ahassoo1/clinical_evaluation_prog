DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. IUZZOLINO. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, it’s my legs. They’re… swelling. It started after the cancer treatment, you see. It’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Swelling in the legs, alright. And it began after your cancer treatment… Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about that treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, it was… a long time ago now. Maybe six months? It was chemo, mostly. And radiation. It was for… breast cancer. I don’t really remember all the details, to be honest. They gave me lots of things, and I was… not feeling well. It’s just the legs now, though. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Six months ago… chemo and radiation for breast cancer. Okay. It's perfectly understandable you wouldn't recall every detail – those treatments can be quite… impactful. You said “mostly” when you mentioned your legs. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the swelling?
PATIENT: Well… my ankles feel a little sore sometimes. Not all the time, but when I walk a lot. And… I get tired easier, maybe? But I’m 59, you know! So it could just be old age. It’s hard to tell. The swelling is the biggest thing, really. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, ankle soreness with walking and increased fatigue. We’ll definitely look into both. Now, let's focus on the swelling. Can you describe where exactly on your legs you're noticing it?
PATIENT: Mostly here, around my ankles. And a bit on my shins, too. It’s not… all the way up my legs, just the lower part. It gets worse if I stand for a long time. I used to be able to walk for hours, but now… not so much. It feels… heavy, you know? Like my legs are full of water.
DOCTOR: Heavy and full… alright. And is the swelling worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it’s worse in the evening. After I’ve been on my feet all day. It seems to go down a little bit when I sleep, but then it comes back. It’s… annoying, honestly. It makes it hard to wear my shoes!
DOCTOR: Okay, worse in the evenings after being on your feet. Let's do a quick exam, if you don't mind. Just want to take a look and feel your legs, check your pulses. Nothing to worry about, just routine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Get it over with, please. I have a bit of a schedule today. I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be quick. Please, have a seat here. Okay… I am feeling some definite swelling in both ankles and shins. And yes, there is some pitting edema present – meaning the swelling leaves a little indentation when I press on it. Pulses are present and feel normal, but a little diminished compared to what I’d expect. Skin temperature is normal. Do you experience any pain when I touch your legs?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit, yes. Not bad pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And it feels… warm, sometimes? Not feverish, just… warmer than the rest of my leg. It’s hard to explain. Is that bad? Is something wrong? I just want to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache and warmth to the touch. That's helpful information. Given your history of cancer treatment and the swelling, warmth, and ache in your legs, it sounds like we could be dealing with a few possibilities. One is lymphedema – a build-up of fluid in the tissues due to damage to the lymphatic system, which can sometimes happen after cancer surgery or radiation. Another possibility could be a venous insufficiency – meaning the valves in your veins aren't working properly. We need to rule out something more serious, like a blood clot, as well. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a couple of tests. An ultrasound of your legs to check for blood clots and assess the veins, and a D-dimer blood test. That can help us rule out a blood clot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… of course. More waiting. But… if it rules things out, then okay. Ultrasound and blood test. Yes, that’s fine. When can I have them done? And how long will it take to get the results? I really just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to write you a requisition for both tests. You can go to the lab at St. Luke’s Hospital – it’s just down the street, and you don’t need an appointment. The ultrasound should take about 30-45 minutes, and the blood test will only be a few minutes. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible – when you’re sitting or lying down – and wearing compression stockings. That can help reduce the swelling. I’ll write you a prescription for those as well. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… okay. I think I’ve heard of those. And elevating my legs… yes, I can do that. 48 hours, you said? That feels like a long time. But… alright. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… get the tests done, I guess. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing serious.
