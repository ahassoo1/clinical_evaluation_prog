DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Sieh. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been… getting weaker, little by little. It's been happening for a while now, and my wife thought it was time I came to see someone about it. They told me it was something called… Multiple Sclerosis? Is that right? I don't remember all the words the other doctor said.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore. It's good you're here, and it’s smart of your wife to encourage you to come in. And it’s perfectly normal to not remember everything a doctor says – there's often a lot of information! Just to clarify, another doctor mentioned a possible diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A doctor at the hospital… about six months ago, maybe? He did some tests, and he said something about that… Multiple Sclerosis. He gave me some pills, but they didn't seem to do much, and I haven't been back since. It’s just… getting harder to do things. Like walking, and… holding things. It worries my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, with some tests done at the hospital and a medication started that wasn’t helpful. And you’re noticing increasing difficulty with walking and holding things. To help me understand better, can you tell me more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it started in my legs, I think. Just feeling a little… wobbly. Now, it’s in my arms too. Sometimes my hands feel like they don't listen to me. Like they have a mind of their own. It's hard to explain. And it comes and goes, you know? Some days are better than others. But it’s mostly… getting worse. I used to be strong, very strong. I was an athletic trainer for many years, working with the football team. But now… it’s hard just to get out of a chair.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started in your legs, now affecting your arms and hands, with a feeling of them not being under your control. It comes and goes, and it’s been progressively worsening. A significant change from your previous activity as an athletic trainer. And you said it’s been getting worse over time. Can you think of anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think anything makes it better, really. But… being tired makes it much worse. If I don’t get enough sleep, the weakness is really bad. And hot weather… that doesn’t help either. It feels like my legs just… give out in the heat. Cool weather is better. And… being stressed. When I worry too much, it seems to get worse. But mostly, it just… happens. I can’t really figure out a pattern to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, hot weather, and stress seem to exacerbate the symptoms. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a bit more generally. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes my vision gets blurry, but I thought that was just my eyes getting old! I wear glasses, you know. And… I get tired easily, even when I sleep. More tired than usual, I mean. And sometimes… my balance is off. I stumble a little. My wife has noticed that too. She says I walk funny sometimes. Oh, and… I forget things. Not everything, but… little things. Like where I put my keys. Is that… part of it?
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision, increased fatigue, balance issues, and some forgetfulness. All of those are good things to tell me. It sounds like you've been experiencing quite a bit. Have you had any fever, unexplained weight loss, bowel or bladder problems, or any numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And I haven’t lost any weight. I still enjoy my food too much for that! As for… bowel or bladder problems… no, not really. Everything is… regular. And numbness or tingling… sometimes my feet feel a little… cold. But not always. It’s not a bad feeling, just… cold. That’s all. I think. It’s hard to remember everything!
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no weight loss, regular bowel and bladder function, and occasional coldness in your feet. It sounds like you're being very thorough, and it's good you're telling me everything you can recall. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take pills for that every day. And… my knees are bad. Old football injuries. They ache sometimes, but I’ve had them for years. Nothing new there. Other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve been pretty healthy, mostly. I used to walk a lot, before my legs started acting up. But that was before everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some chronic knee pain from old injuries. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, I had my appendix out when I was young. A long time ago. And… I had surgery on my knee, a long time ago too. Just one. To fix the cartilage, the doctor said. That was after a football injury. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major. I've been lucky, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and knee surgery in the past. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had… arthritis, I think. Bad arthritis in her hands. And my father… he had heart problems. He died of a heart attack when I was young. And my brother… he had diabetes. But other than that… I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. We didn’t talk about it much, back then. It wasn’t something we did. Sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Astore. Knowing what you do know is helpful. So, arthritis in your mother, heart problems in your father, and diabetes in your brother. And finally, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the pills for my blood pressure. The doctor said they were very important. I take one every morning. And sometimes I take something for my knees, when they are really aching. Just an over-the-counter pain reliever. Like ibuprofen. But not every day. Only when I need it. That’s all. I don’t like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so one medication for high blood pressure daily, and ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Alright, Mr. Astore, I see some notes from the hospital visit six months ago. It does mention a possible diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis and a trial of a medication called… glatiramer acetate. It also notes that you didn’t feel it was very effective. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I just want to know what’s happening, and how to feel better. The pills didn’t do much, so I'm hoping you can figure something out. A physical exam sounds good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad you trust me. We'll take things one step at a time. Okay, let’s start with your reflexes. I’m going to gently tap on some areas of your body. Just relax your legs. Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished in both legs, but not significantly. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I’ll try my best. It feels a little weaker than it used to be, but I’m trying. I used to be very strong, you know. Lifting weights and everything. Now… it’s harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And I do notice some weakness in your hand grip. Now let’s do the same thing with your legs. Can you try to push against my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. It's a little hard to push. My legs… they feel tired already. I don't know if I can push very hard. It's getting harder to do these things. I feel a little embarrassed, honestly. I used to be so strong.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Astore. There’s no need to be embarrassed. I appreciate you trying. I notice some weakness in both legs as well. Now, let's check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try that. It's a little… shaky. I used to be very precise. Now, it's harder to control my hand. Sorry if that’s not very good. I feel a little clumsy.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. And I do notice some mild tremor and slight difficulty with coordination. Finally, I'm going to check your gait and balance. Can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. It’s… harder than it used to be. I have to think about each step. I don’t want to fall. My wife worries about me falling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore. Thank you. Alright, based on the exam and your history, you are experiencing progressive weakness in your arms and legs, along with some difficulty with coordination, balance, and some tremor. The diminished reflexes and unsteady gait are also significant findings. Given your previous visit and the possible diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, along with these exam findings, we need to consider further investigation to determine the cause of your symptoms. There are other conditions that can mimic MS, so it’s important to rule those out. I'm thinking an MRI of your brain and spinal cord would be the next step. It will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, that sounds… thorough. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. I want to know what’s happening. I’ve been worrying about this for a long time. I trust your judgement. An MRI sounds good. Will it… hurt? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Astore. An MRI is non-invasive, meaning it doesn't involve any needles or incisions. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain and spinal cord. You'll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it can be a little loud, so we’ll provide you with earplugs. It typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes to complete. As for the results, it usually takes a few days for the radiologist to interpret the images, and then I'll review them with you in detail. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a plan. In the meantime, I want to reassure you that we're going to work through this together. It's important to get an accurate diagnosis so we can determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions about the MRI procedure or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think that explains it pretty well. No needles, and it won't take too long. That's good. And you'll explain the results to me… that's good too. I appreciate you taking your time and listening to me. It’s been worrying me a lot, and it’s a relief to finally be getting some answers. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. When can we schedule the MRI?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. And I understand your worry – it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you’re dealing with something like this. Let me see… we have an opening on Tuesday of next week at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10:00 AM… yes, that sounds good. That gives me a few days to… prepare, I guess. Yes, Tuesday at 10:00 AM is fine. Thank you, Doctor Sieh. I appreciate everything you’ve done today. I feel a little better already, just knowing what the next step is.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve scheduled you for an MRI on Tuesday at 10:00 AM. You’ll receive a confirmation email with instructions on how to prepare. Just make sure to leave any metal objects at home, such as jewelry, watches, and keys. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Astore. I look forward to discussing the results with you next week.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor Sieh. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I appreciate everything. I look forward to speaking with you next week. Have a good day.
