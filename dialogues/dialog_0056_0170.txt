DOCTOR: Hi Waleed, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know? For the paperwork. I just want to get it over with, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A life insurance physical. No problem at all, we can definitely get that done for you. Just to start, is there anything specific you’ve been told to mention, or any health concerns you have that we should address while we’re at it?
PATIENT: Not really, no. They just gave me a list of things to expect, like blood pressure and… stuff. I feel alright, I guess. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I don’t have any big problems, not that I know of. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. We’ll do a basic check-up, covering what the insurance company needs, and then we can see if anything else jumps out. It shouldn’t take too long. To start, have you had a primary care doctor before?
PATIENT: Yeah, I used to see Dr. Chen back on… well, back home. But that was a while ago. Moved here a few years back and haven’t really gotten around to finding a new one. Mostly just go to urgent care when I need something. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, that’s pretty common. No, it doesn’t necessarily matter, but it’s good to know. It just helps me get a better picture of your health history. Okay, so let's start with some basics. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I think I was a little itchy once after eating some shellfish, but I don’t even remember when. Nothing serious. I can eat pretty much anything. I don’t take any pills or nothing like that either.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No known allergies or current medications. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing. And I had my tonsils out when I was younger, I think. Other than that… not really. Nothing that I remember needing to see a doctor for a long time. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child and tonsillectomy. That’s good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? What do you mean? Like, are they sick? I haven't seen most of them in years. My mom… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he just, you know, got old. Nothing real specific. They're back home, and it's hard to keep up with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mother with high blood pressure, father passed away. Do you know if he had any other health problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. He just… got weaker, you know? Old age, mostly. He didn't really talk about doctor stuff much. I don't think he went to the doctor a lot. Is this important for the insurance thing? I just want to get this done if possible.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, we'll get through it. It can be helpful to know, but we can move on if you don’t have a lot of information. Okay. Let’s talk about your lifestyle a little. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched any of that stuff. I drink a little juice sometimes, but that’s it. I used to work pretty hard, but now I mostly just… take it easy. Not a lot of excitement these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, lungs, and take a listen. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, okay? I got some things I need to get back to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please sit back and relax. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. <Waleed shifts slightly in his chair. Uh, no, that's fine. It doesn’t hurt or nothing. Just… weird feeling, I guess. Is that blood pressure number bad? What does that mean?
DOCTOR: It's good you let me know. It’s not necessarily bad, but it’s a little higher than we’d like to see. It could be a number of things – stress, even just the visit itself can raise it. We’ll want to check it again later, and may want to monitor it over time. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let’s just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Please open wide and say “ah.”
PATIENT: <Waleed opens his mouth and says “ah” dutifully. Uh-huh. Everything feels okay. Are you almost done? I’m starting to get a little fidgety.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Ears look clear, throat is normal. Alright, everything looks generally good. Given your elevated blood pressure, I'd like to do a little bit of blood work, just to get a baseline and rule out anything serious. It's a standard panel, and it’ll give us a better picture of your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh. Look, I just need this done for the insurance. I don’t want to get into a whole thing with tests and stuff. Is the blood pressure number really bad? Can’t we just… write something down? I really just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I don’t want to make things more complicated than they need to be. The blood pressure is a little high, and it’s always better to be safe. The blood work would help me determine if it's something we need to address right away, or if it’s just a one-time thing. It’s a pretty standard panel, including cholesterol and blood sugar, and could help with your insurance paperwork as well. If it's all normal, we can just complete the physical. But I would strongly recommend it. Would you at least let me take a quick look at your weight and height?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just… get it over with. Weight and height, okay. But that’s it. No extra tests if you can help it. I got things to do, you know? <Waleed sighs heavily.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Alright, your weight is 97 kilograms and your height is 174 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 31.8, which is in the obese range. This, combined with the elevated blood pressure, makes me even more concerned about doing the blood work. It's a simple test, and it will give us a lot of information. Would you be willing to reconsider?
PATIENT: Look, I know I'm not skinny, okay? I don't need you to tell me that. I've always been this weight. And I told you, I just need this done for the insurance company. They didn't ask about my weight. They didn't ask about blood work. I just want you to sign the paper and let me go. Is that too much to ask? <Waleed crosses his arms, looking frustrated.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I respect your wishes. I'm not trying to make you do anything you don't want to do. However, as your doctor, I have a responsibility to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes addressing potential health concerns. While the insurance company may not require specific tests, ignoring these issues could be detrimental to your health. Given your concerns, I will complete the life insurance physical form as requested, based on the information we’ve gathered. However, I strongly recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment to discuss your blood pressure and weight. We can review your lifestyle and create a plan to improve your overall health. Do I have your consent to complete the form?
PATIENT: <Waleed visibly relaxes a little. Fine. Just finish the form. And no, I don’t want a follow-up appointment. I got things to do. Just… get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, here you go. I’ve documented our discussion and findings today. As I mentioned, I strongly encourage you to consider scheduling a follow-up appointment, but I respect your decision. Here's some information on healthy eating and exercise. Thank you for coming in today. Do you have any other questions for me?
