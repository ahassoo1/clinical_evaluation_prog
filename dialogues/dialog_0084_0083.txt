DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Voytek. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Kammer is the name, Early Kammer. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, if you want to know the truth. But my… well, my daughter, she said I should come. She thinks I need a little… encouragement. A card, she said. From you. A “get well” card. Seems silly, but she worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kammer. It’s good of you to come in, even if it was at your daughter's insistence. We appreciate that. And it’s perfectly alright to seek a second opinion, or just to get things checked out. No need to feel embarrassed. So, if you’re not feeling particularly unwell, can you tell me what’s been going on that prompted your daughter to suggest a visit?
PATIENT: Prompted? She just… thinks I’m down. A little low. I been retired a few years now, see? From the power plant. Stationary Engineer. Good job, good money. But now… mostly I just sit. Watch the television. She says I need to… do something. But what is there to do? Everything seems… pointless, if you ask me. Not sick, Doctor. Just… not happy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve been retired from the power plant for a few years, and you’re feeling a bit… unmotivated, a little down. It sounds like you're adjusting to a big life change. That's very common. And it's good that your daughter is looking out for you. When did you start feeling this way, Mr. Kammer?
PATIENT: Adjusting? Hmph. It’s not like adjusting a carburetor, Doctor. It's… everything. It started… oh, maybe six months after I stopped working. At first, it was nice. Sleep in, do what I want. But then… the days just started blending together. Like one long Sunday. And nobody needs a Stationary Engineer anymore. Everything is automatic now. Pointless, I tell you.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the loss of purpose is really weighing on you. It’s completely valid to feel that way when a big part of your life changes. Six months after retirement is often when things can start to feel… different. Have you noticed any other changes since you stopped working?
PATIENT: Other changes? Well… I don’t see much of my friends anymore. They’re all still working, busy with their jobs and families. I tried to call a few times, but they always seemed rushed. “Can’t talk now, Early, got a meeting.” Or, “Busy with the grandkids.” It’s like… I’m not part of their world anymore. And my appetite ain’t what it used to be. Don't have much of a taste for things. But I’m not sick, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re feeling socially isolated, and you've noticed a decrease in your appetite. These are important things to tell me, Mr. Kammer. It’s good you're sharing this. Even if you don't feel physically sick, these feelings can definitely affect your overall well-being. Have you had any trouble with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Hmph. I sleep too much. That’s the problem. I wake up, watch a little television, and then I’m tired again. Go back to bed. It’s… a waste of time. Used to be, I’d get up early, fix something around the house. Now… what’s the point? Everything just gets dusty again. It’s like… I’m just waiting for something to happen. And nothing does.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased sleep and a general lack of motivation. That paints a clearer picture, Mr. Kammer. Have you noticed any changes in your weight, even with the decreased appetite?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… my pants are a little looser. Not a lot, but… noticeable. I haven't been weighin’ myself, mind you. Don't see much point in that either. Everything’s just… going downhill, I guess. But I keep tellin' my daughter, I’m not sick. Just… old. And bored.
DOCTOR: I understand you feel that you’re not sick, Mr. Kammer, and I appreciate you telling me that. However, the changes you're describing – the decreased appetite, weight loss, increased sleep, social isolation, and loss of motivation – those are things we need to investigate further. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes for these symptoms. Before we do that, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Hmph. Not much to tell, Doctor. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a mango tree. And I had the flu a few times, like everybody else. Nothing serious. Never been one for doctorin’. Always figured I could tough it out. Used to work in the boiler room, you know? Hot, dirty work. Builds character. But that was a long time ago. My blood pressure’s probably a little high, my daughter keeps tellin' me, but I feel fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical issues in the past, and your daughter has mentioned some concerns about your blood pressure. We’ll definitely check that today. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, never. Never needed ‘em. I always took care of myself, you know? Ate right, stayed in shape. Well, mostly. Before I retired, that is. Now… not so much. Everything just seems… easier to ignore. What’s the point in worryin’ about things? It’s not like it’s gonna change anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And you mentioned you've noticed some changes in your habits since retiring. That’s helpful to know. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmph. My father… he died young. Heart attack. Worked too hard, they said. My mother lived a long life, but she had arthritis, couldn’t move too well in her later years. My sister… she's still alive, lives in Florida. Seems happy enough. Always was the social one, though. Not like me. I always preferred my own company.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father passed away from a heart attack, and your mother had arthritis. Your sister is doing well. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with any medicine. I don’t take much, mind you. A little aspirin now and then for a headache. But that’s about it. I always figured fresh air and hard work was the best medicine. But I guess things change when you get old.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you rarely take any medication. Alright, Mr. Kammer, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Hmph. What’s the point? You’re not gonna find anything. I told you, I'm not sick. But… alright. Do what you have to do, Doctor. Just don't expect miracles.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Kammer. I’m not expecting miracles, just trying to gather some information. We'll start with your blood pressure, pulse and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears and throat. Alright, just relax your arm for me… Okay, that's 148 over 82. A little elevated, as your daughter mentioned. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Ears look normal. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything seems within normal limits, but the slightly faint heart sounds and elevated blood pressure are things we need to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. I’d also like to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work… EKG… Hmph. It’s all a waste of time and money, if you ask me. But… alright. Do what you have to do, Doctor. Just get it over with. My daughter will be happy, I guess. But don't expect me to start feelin' any better just 'cause you poked me with a needle.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Kammer. I’m not making any promises, just ruling out potential causes for your symptoms. The lab results will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Here's a form with the tests I’m ordering. You can go to the lab downstairs after this appointment. They’ll take some blood samples. The EKG technician is also downstairs, in room 3. They'll just attach some electrodes to your chest to record your heart rhythm. It doesn’t hurt. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, is there anything else you’d like to tell me?
PATIENT: A plan… Hmph. What kind of plan? I don’t need a plan, Doctor. I just… want to feel normal again. But I guess that's too much to ask. I suppose… no, nothin' else. Just get it over with. And maybe… maybe don't bother with any fancy pills or treatments. I don't like takin' medicine.
DOCTOR: I understand you don't want any unnecessary medication. We’ll focus on finding the root cause of your symptoms first. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss all your options and create a plan that you’re comfortable with. We can also talk about some lifestyle changes that might help you feel better, like getting more exercise and eating a healthier diet. In the meantime, if you start experiencing any new or worsening symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness – please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the emergency room immediately. Alright, I’ve documented everything we’ve discussed today. I'll have the lab results sent to my office, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. I got things to do. Well… nothin’ to do, really. But still. Don't keep me waitin' too long. And… could you maybe… just write a little somethin' on a card? Like my daughter asked? A “get well” card. Even though I'm not sick. Just… somethin’ to show her I came.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kammer. I’m happy to do that for your daughter. It’s good of you to come in, even if it was just to keep her happy. Here you go. Alright, I think that’s everything for today. The lab technician will be expecting you downstairs. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Kammer. And I hope you feel better soon. And remember, it’s okay to ask for help. We’re here to support you.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Whatever. Alright. Goodbye. Waste of time… but she'll be happy… .
