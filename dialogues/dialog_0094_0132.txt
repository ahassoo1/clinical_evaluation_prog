DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Coby’s the name. Heat, that’s what brings me in. Can’t stand it anymore, this heat. Never used to bother me, worked outside all my life, building things, painting... but now? Feels like I’m melting just stepping outside. It’s ridiculous, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Coby. It has been a particularly hot summer. It's good you came in. It's definitely worth investigating when a change like that happens, especially with your history of outdoor work. When did you first start noticing this increased sensitivity to the heat?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t you worry about my “history”. I’m a strong man, always have been. But, uh... let me think. It started… maybe last year, a little bit. But it really got bad this June, I’d say. Couldn’t even finish painting Mrs. Henderson’s fence. Had to stop every five minutes, sit in the shade. Pathetic, really. Never had to do that before.
DOCTOR: It’s not pathetic at all, Mr. Coby, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. It takes courage to admit when something is changing. It’s good we’re addressing it. So, it sounds like it started gradually last year, but significantly worsened in June. Can you describe what you feel when you're exposed to the heat?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m going to faint or anything. It’s just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. I get all flushed, you know? Face gets red. And I start sweating, but not like a normal sweat. It’s like… sticky. And I feel weak. Not like I’m gonna collapse, but just… drained. Like all my energy’s been sucked out. And I get a headache, right behind my eyes. It's a nuisance, really. A big nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushed skin, sticky sweat, weakness, headache behind the eyes… that’s helpful information, thank you. And is this happening with any particular level of heat exposure, or is it even mild warmth that brings it on now?
PATIENT: Mild warmth! That's the problem, Doctor! Even just walking to the mailbox these days is enough to get me going. Used to be, I’d be out in the blazing sun all day, no problem. Now? A little bit of sunshine and I’m feeling like I’m in a furnace. It’s… frustrating. People don’t understand. They say, “Oh, it’s summer, everyone gets hot.” But this isn’t normal, I tell you. This isn’t normal.
DOCTOR: You’re right to question it, Mr. Coby. It sounds like this is a significant change from your usual experience, and it’s good that you’re paying attention to it. To get a better understanding, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. I’ve always been a healthy man. Maybe a little arthritis in my knees, getting older, you know? But nothing serious. Never been one for going to doctors, to be honest. Waste of time, usually. Just tell you to take a pill for everything. My wife… she used to drag me to the doctor, but… well, she’s gone now. So, no, not really. Nothing much to report there. Just a bit creaky in the mornings.
DOCTOR: I understand, and I'm sorry to hear about your wife. It sounds like you've been quite resilient throughout your life. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. When I was a boy, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. Had to get a cast, but that was ages ago. Apart from that… no. Nothing. Never needed surgery. Always been lucky, I suppose. Or tough. Probably both. I heal quick. Always have.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… just the occasional ibuprofen for my knees. Nothing regular. And a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor made me take it a couple of years back. But I stopped taking it. Didn’t feel right, made me dizzy. I just manage with… being careful, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for your knees, and you previously tried a blood pressure medication that didn't suit you. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife used to say I had the stomach of a goat! Never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a bit of a sniffle with pollen in the spring, but that’s all. Everyone gets that, don’t they? Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my father, he had… problems with his heart, I think. He died young, suddenly. And my mother, she had diabetes. But that was a long time ago. And my sister… she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. But apart from that… not much. We weren’t a family that talked much about health, to be honest. More interested in getting on with things.
DOCTOR: I see. Heart problems in your father, diabetes in your mother, and arthritis in your sister. That’s helpful information, thank you. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I live a pretty normal life. I keep busy, you know? I do a little bit of painting when the weather allows. And I like to putter around in the garden. Nothing fancy. I used to be more active, but… well, things slow down as you get older. I eat alright, I suppose. Not a big fan of all this fancy health food. Give me a good plate of dal bhat any day.
DOCTOR: Dal bhat sounds lovely. And do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife hated them. And alcohol… I used to have a little beer with dinner sometimes. But not much. Haven't had a drink in… well, since my wife passed. Didn't feel right, drinking without her.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, Mr. Coby, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Fine, fine. Get it over with. Don’t see the point of all this poking and prodding, but… if you think it’s necessary. Just… don’t take too long. I have things to do, you know. Painting doesn’t do itself.
DOCTOR: I'll be as quick as possible, Mr. Coby. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That's a little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear some mild crackles in your lungs. I’m going to check your skin now. Your skin is warm and dry, but I notice some flushing on your face. And finally, I’ll just check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems generally okay, but the elevated blood pressure and mild crackles in your lungs are worth investigating further.
PATIENT: Crackles in my lungs? What does that mean? Sounds serious. And my blood pressure… I told you I felt alright. It’s just the heat! This is what I've been saying all along! Don't go giving me pills for something that's just… the weather!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Coby. It’s not necessarily serious, but it's important we investigate. Crackles in the lungs can sometimes indicate fluid buildup, and that can be caused by a few different things, including heart problems, but also things like a mild infection. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address, as uncontrolled hypertension can lead to more serious complications over time. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. Specifically, I recommend a complete blood count to check for infection, a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs, and an EKG to assess your heart function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… more poking and prodding. Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. I just want to be able to paint without feeling like I’m going to melt! But… fine. If you insist. But no unnecessary tests, understand? Just the basics. And I want the results quickly. I don’t have time to sit around waiting for weeks.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Coby. I understand your frustration, and I will only order the necessary tests. We'll start with the complete blood count, chest X-ray, and EKG. I will put in the orders right away. The lab and radiology department are in the same building, so it shouldn’t take long. The results typically come back within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity, staying well-hydrated, and avoiding direct sun exposure as much as possible. And, if you start experiencing any shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Avoid sun, drink water, no exertion. I can manage that. But if this means I can't even finish painting Mrs. Henderson’s fence… Well. I'll be very displeased. You said 24 to 48 hours? Make sure it's closer to 24. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I’ll do my best to expedite the results, Mr. Coby. I understand your need to get back to work. As soon as the results are available, my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… get those results quickly, Doctor. And don’t give me any unnecessary pills. That's all. I suppose I'll be going now then. Thank you… I guess.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Coby. We’ll get those results back to you as quickly as possible. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try to stay cool.
PATIENT: .
