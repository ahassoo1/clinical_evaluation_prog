DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, a pleasure. I am here for… the check-up before the insurance starts, yes? Medicare told me I need this done. It is all very confusing, but they said this doctor… you… would do it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Barban. That’s a common requirement with Medicare enrollment – a welcome-to-Medicare visit, often called an initial preventative physical exam. It’s a good way for us to get a baseline of your health and ensure everything is functioning as it should. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to seek care now, beyond the insurance requirement?
PATIENT: Seek care? I do not seek care. Medicare requires it. I am a healthy man. I work every day. Food processing is hard work, you know. Not sitting behind a desk like… some people. I do not understand why I need to explain this. It is for the insurance, not because I feel… unwell.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mr. Barban. My apologies. I didn’t mean to imply you were here because you were unwell. It’s simply standard procedure for us to gather a complete medical history even for preventative exams. It helps us understand your overall health and identify any potential risks, even if you're feeling perfectly fine. So, let’s put it this way: To fulfill the Medicare requirement, and just to be thorough, could you tell me about any past medical issues you’ve had?
PATIENT: Past issues? Hmm. Let me think. My grandfather… he had problems with his stomach. Very old man, though. And my cousin, she broke her arm when she was a child, climbing a tree. Not very important, no? I myself… I have had no serious problems. A few colds, perhaps. Nothing a strong tea cannot fix. I do not believe in going to the doctor for every little thing. It is a waste of time and money.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Barban. It's good to be mindful of resources. And family history is certainly helpful information. Thank you for sharing that. Now, thinking about your health specifically – have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I told you, I am a healthy man. I eat good food – we make it ourselves, very fresh. I work hard. I do not sit around. I do not need diagnoses. What kind of question is this? Are you implying something? I am beginning to think this whole thing is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions are frustrating, Mr. Barban. I assure you, I’m not implying anything at all. I’m simply trying to gather a complete picture of your health history as part of the required Medicare exam. It’s standard protocol. Perhaps we can approach it differently. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. And… hospitalized? Only when I was a very small boy. I fell from a tree, a very small tree, and broke my arm. It was a long time ago. They fixed it, quickly. Nothing serious. I do not like hospitals. They smell… unpleasant. And all the people, sick people everywhere. It is a very… depressing place. I avoid them whenever possible. Is this… is this all you will ask?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Barban. It's helpful to know. We’re getting a clearer picture. Just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I drink tea. Sometimes, when I am feeling a cold coming on, I take… what is it called… eucalyptus drops. For my throat. But that is it. I do not trust those… pills. They have too many… chemicals. I prefer natural remedies. And tea. Strong tea fixes everything. Really. Everything. I do not understand why you keep asking these questions. It is a waste of time. Are we finished now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. We’re almost through the initial questions. Just a few more quick ones to complete the required exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had one. I eat everything. We grow many things ourselves, you know. Fresh, natural food. No strange chemicals. I am not a delicate flower. I am a strong man. What is the point of this? Are you trying to find something wrong with me? I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. This is… insulting, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Barban, and I apologize if these questions feel unnecessary. It's simply our protocol to rule out any potential issues as part of the Medicare exam. It is not intended to be insulting. One final section before we move on to a brief physical exam, if you’re agreeable. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that even mean? I work. I eat. I sleep. I am a simple man. I do not have fancy hobbies or… I do not go to the… the gym. I work with food all day, that is enough exercise. I do not drink… much. Perhaps a little tea at night. It helps me sleep. Is this about tea now? Are you going to tell me I should not drink tea? This is ridiculous. I have wasted enough of my time here.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, I'm not going to tell you to stop drinking tea! It sounds like you have a very healthy routine, and a strong work ethic. When I ask about lifestyle, I’m simply trying to get a broader picture of your daily habits. For example, do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not. Never. Disgusting habit. Makes you weak. My father smoked, and he… well, let us just say it did not end well. I avoid people who smoke. It smells unpleasant, and it is bad for your health. I do not understand why anyone would want to do such a thing. It is foolish. Are we finished yet? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, we are almost finished. Just one final question, and then we can move on to a very brief physical exam – if you’re agreeable. Do you have any family history of serious illnesses like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: We already discussed family history! My grandfather had stomach problems, my cousin broke her arm. What more do you need to know? This is… it is becoming quite tiresome. I do not appreciate being questioned like this. I came here because Medicare required it, not because I wanted to. Are you sure there is no way to simply… sign something and be done with it? I have important things to do. This is a waste of a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: You are right, Mr. Barban, we did briefly touch on family history. I apologize for the repetition; I am trying to ensure I have a complete and accurate record for Medicare. To clarify, I’m looking for information about more serious illnesses that may run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes. Even if you’re not aware of anything specific, that’s perfectly fine. We can simply note that you have no known family history of these conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. No. No known history. My family is… strong. They work hard. They do not sit around worrying about… illnesses. They eat good food. They drink tea. Is that sufficient? Can we finally be done now? I need to return to work. I am losing money sitting here. This is… frustrating. Really, very frustrating. I do not understand why Medicare makes this so difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, that is perfectly sufficient. Thank you for your patience. Now, if you are agreeable, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look in your ears, eyes, and throat. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I have work to do. And be gentle. I do not like being… poked and prodded. And do not ask me to… undress. I am a modest man. Just get it over with quickly, please. This is… inconvenient. Very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Barban. No need to undress at all. We’ll keep everything fully clothed. It will be a quick and simple exam, I promise. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. I have better things to do. And do not squeeze my arm too tightly. I need it for work. I lift heavy things. This is… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I will be as quick and gentle as possible, Mr. Barban. Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s within the normal range. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Hmph. It is cold. And this thing… it tickles. Are you finished yet? I do not like having things pressed against my chest. It feels… intrusive. Just get it over with. I have work. Important work. This is… a waste of my afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears with the otoscope. Everything looks clear in your ears as well. And finally, I’ll just take a quick look in your throat. Could you please say “Ah”?
PATIENT: Ah. There. Is that sufficient? It is… unpleasant. Are we finally done now? I feel… violated. This is ridiculous. I need to return to work. I have important things to do. And I do not appreciate being… examined like this. It is… demeaning.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, we are all finished. Everything looks good. Based on the exam, you appear to be in good health. Your blood pressure is normal, your heart and lungs sound clear, and your ears and throat are clear. I will document these findings in your medical record. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Just… give me the paperwork. Whatever paperwork is needed to satisfy Medicare. I need to be done with this. And do not expect me to return for… follow-up appointments. I am a healthy man. I do not need your… poking and prodding. Just the paperwork, please. I have work to do. Important work. This has been… a waste of my time. A complete waste.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Barban. This is the summary of your welcome-to-Medicare exam. It includes the findings we discussed today. You may want to keep a copy for your records. Since everything appears to be normal, a follow-up appointment is not immediately necessary. However, I encourage you to schedule a routine check-up in a year, just to ensure everything remains in good health. Here’s my card, should you ever need to reach out. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Barban. I wish you a good afternoon and success with your work. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Thank you. Or… whatever. Good day. .
