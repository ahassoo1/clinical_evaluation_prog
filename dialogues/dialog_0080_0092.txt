DOCTOR: Hi Oreste, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh. Rosanova, you say? Sounds… foreign. Anyway. Well, I been… short of breath, I guess. And my mouth feels like the desert. Eyes too. Real dry. It's been happenin' for a while now, not sure exactly how long. Old man problems, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Short of breath and dry mouth and eyes – that's good information to start with. "Old man problems" can be a lot of things, and we want to figure out exactly what's going on. You said it’s been happening for a while… can you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Doctors always want specific. Look, it's been… months. Maybe six? More? I don’t keep track of things like that. It just… got worse, little by little. Used to just be when I walked up those stairs to my apartment, now it's… just kinda always there. Not bad all the time, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, months, gradually worsening, noticeable even at rest sometimes. That helps. And the dry mouth and eyes – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Mostly dry at night, wakes me up sometimes. Gotta keep a glass of water by the bed. And during the day... when it's hot, for sure. Really hot. Florida heat, you know? Makes everything worse.
DOCTOR: Right, Florida heat definitely doesn’t help. So, dry mouth worse at night and with the heat. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shortness of breath and dryness?
PATIENT: Hmm... other symptoms... let me think. I get tired. Real tired. More than usual, I mean. But I'm an old man, I'm supposed to be tired, right? I also… cough sometimes. Not a bad cough, just a little tickle in my throat. Happens mostly when I lay down.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and a cough that's worse when lying down. Those are good things to note. Now, have you had any fevers, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fevers? Not that I know of. I don't check my temperature or nothin'. Chills… maybe sometimes when the AC is too cold? And night sweats… well, Florida is humid. I sweat every night. Hard to tell what’s normal and what ain't.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's fair. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, lung disease, or anything else a doctor has told you about?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, the heart doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high years ago. Put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped takin’ ‘em. Didn’t feel like I needed ‘em. And… I had a bad case of pneumonia when I was younger. Real bad. But that was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, and pneumonia a long time ago. Any surgeries or hospital stays besides the pneumonia?
PATIENT: Surgeries… nope. Never had surgery. Too scared of hospitals, frankly. The only time I been in a hospital was for that pneumonia. And I don’t like rememberin’ it much. Not a good time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has had similar problems – like heart or lung issues?
PATIENT: Family… My mother, she died of somethin' with her heart, I think. When I was young. My father… he smoked too much. Didn't live to be old. Didn't take care of himself. And my sister... she had bad allergies. Always coughin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with heart issues, father with smoking-related problems, and a sister with allergies. That's helpful. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smokin’? Nah. Never touched the stuff. Smelled bad, always made me cough. My father did, though. Like a chimney.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… just some ibuprofen sometimes, for my knees. They ache, you know? Old age. And… maybe a multivitamin, if I remember to take it. My daughter buys ‘em for me, says I need ‘em. But I forget half the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed and a multivitamin occasionally. Last question for now, are you allergic to anything – medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. Not that I know of. I eat whatever I want. Never had a reaction to nothin’. My daughter always asks me this too, but I always tell her the same thing. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when the mosquitoes bite, but that's Florida.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you, Oreste, that’s a lot of helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and oxygen levels, and take a look at your throat. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just don't poke me too much. My skin is old and fragile, you know.
DOCTOR: I’ll be gentle, I promise. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Your pulse is 88 and regular. Your respiratory rate is 20. Your heart sounds a little quiet and I do hear a murmur. I'm going to listen again. Your throat looks a little dry, but no obvious redness or swelling. Your oxygen saturation is 94% which is acceptable, but on the lower end of normal. I also notice you seem a little dehydrated.
PATIENT: Dehydrated? I drink plenty of coffee! Maybe I need a cafe con leche right now, that'd hydrate me. What does "murmur" mean anyway? Sounds serious.
DOCTOR: Coffee isn’t the best for hydration, unfortunately. It actually has a diuretic effect, meaning it can make you lose fluids. A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes. It doesn’t always mean something serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further. It could be due to a number of things, including age, high blood pressure, or changes in your heart valves. Given your shortness of breath, dry mouth, fatigue, and the murmur, I’d like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would you be okay with a chest X-ray and some blood work?
PATIENT: Tests? Ugh. More poking and prodding. Look, I don't like tests. They always find somethin' wrong. But… I guess. If you really think it's necessary. What will the blood work tell you? And that X-ray… is it safe?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It's never fun to go through tests. The blood work will give us a lot of information about your overall health – your electrolytes, kidney function, and if there’s any sign of infection. It can also help us rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. The chest X-ray is very safe. It uses a small amount of radiation, but it's a very low dose and the benefits of finding out what's going on in your lungs outweigh the risks. It will help us see if there's any fluid buildup, inflammation, or other issues. I'm going to order both tests. The lab is right down the hall, and we can get the X-ray done quickly. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend that you increase your fluid intake – water is best – and try to get some extra rest. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fluids and rest. I can manage that, I guess. But don't expect miracles. Old man bodies don't bounce back like they used to. Just get it over with quickly, okay? I have a game of dominoes scheduled for this afternoon. Don't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We’ll get it done as quickly and efficiently as possible. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and then we’ll head over to the X-ray department. We'll call you with the results as soon as they are available, usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, if your shortness of breath worsens, or you develop a fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Now you're scaring me! No, no questions. Just... get it over with. And make sure that X-ray machine is properly calibrated! I don't want no extra radiation. I'm already old enough. Where's this nurse, then?
DOCTOR: I assure you, our equipment is thoroughly checked and maintained. We take every precaution to ensure your safety. Nurse Rodriguez?
PATIENT: Rodriguez, huh? Everybody's from somewhere else these days. Just get it done, quickly now. My dominoes are waitin'. And make sure they have a comfortable chair for me in that X-ray place. My back ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Nurse Rodriguez: Hi Oreste, Dr. Rosanova has explained what we’re going to do. I'll just need to draw a few vials of blood. It’ll only take a few minutes. Do you have a preferred arm?
PATIENT: Preferred arm? Honestly, they both feel pretty bad. The left one's been achin' a little more lately, so… I guess do the right one. Just be gentle, please. I bruise easy.
DOCTOR: Nurse Rodriguez: Absolutely, I'll be very gentle. Okay, all done. Just a little pressure for a minute or two. Here’s a bandage. Dr. Rosanova, he's all set! Dr. Rosanova: Thank you, Nurse Rodriguez. Alright, Oreste, let's head over to the X-ray department. It's just down the hall to your left. A technician will be waiting for you. Do you need any assistance getting there?
PATIENT: No, no assistance. I can walk. Slow, but steady. Just tell that technician to hurry it up, will you? And no bright lights, my eyes are sensitive. And maybe a cushion for my back… Just get me to those dominoes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll let the technician know your preferences. I'll walk with you to the X-ray department, and make sure they have a cushion waiting for you. Just take your time. We’re almost there. It’s just around the corner. And don't worry, we'll get you back to your dominoes as quickly as possible.
