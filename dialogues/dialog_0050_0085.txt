DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re thirty-one years of age. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, thirty-one. It’s… well, it’s this patch on my skin. It’s rather unsightly, honestly. I noticed it a few weeks ago and it just doesn’t seem to be going away. I keep hoping it will, but… it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: A patch, you say. “Unsightly” is rather subjective, Ms. Bartock, but I understand your concern. Could you describe it for me, please?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… brownish. Not a nice, even tan, mind you. It’s… mottled. Like someone took a paintbrush and just… dabbed it on. And it’s flat. Not raised or anything. Just… there. It's on my left forearm, just above the wrist. Honestly, it looks terribly common, but I’d rather be safe than sorry, you know? My grandmother always said… well, never mind. It just bothers me.
DOCTOR: “Terribly common” can still be problematic, Ms. Bartock. It's prudent to investigate any new skin changes, certainly. And while family history is often… unreliable, it's good you're thinking about it. Now, has it changed in size or shape at all since you first noticed it a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Oh, it has gotten slightly bigger, I think. It’s hard to say for sure, because I don’t stare at it all day, naturally. But if I had to guess… perhaps a millimeter or two? It's not like it doubled overnight, don't worry. And the color… it’s maybe a little darker now. But honestly, Doctor, I’m not a doctor. I just know it wasn’t quite like this before. It’s probably nothing, really. But my husband insisted I come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Husbands often do. While it's good you have someone looking out for you, Ms. Bartock, it’s my job to assess these things objectively. A millimeter or two is enough to warrant attention. Let’s have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. It's just… I have a rather busy schedule, you understand. I’m an archivist, and we’re in the middle of cataloging a rather important collection. I do hope this won’t take too long. It’s on my left forearm, as I said.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see it. Approximately 6 millimeters in diameter, irregular borders, mottled brown coloration. No palpable elevation. No surrounding inflammation. Have you noticed any itching, bleeding, or crusting associated with this lesion?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. It doesn't itch. Doesn't bleed. Doesn't… crust. It's just there, as I said. Quite stubbornly, I might add. It's really not causing any discomfort, Doctor. It's simply… aesthetically displeasing. And I do have a charity gala next month, and I was hoping to wear a sleeveless dress.
DOCTOR: Aesthetic concerns are… understandable, Ms. Bartock, though I do find the focus on a gala somewhat… distracting from a proper medical evaluation. However, since you insist. Given its characteristics, and the reported slight increase in size, I believe a biopsy is warranted. It’s a simple procedure, really. We’ll remove a small sample of the lesion and send it to pathology for analysis. It’s the only way to definitively determine what we’re dealing with. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh dear. Is that really necessary? I mean, couldn’t you just… prescribe something? A cream, perhaps? I’d really prefer to avoid anything… invasive. It sounds rather unpleasant. And what if it leaves a scar? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure I like the sound of this at all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, with all due respect, simply prescribing something without knowing the nature of the lesion would be… irresponsible. This isn’t a matter of convenience. We are dealing with the potential for skin cancer, and while many skin cancers are easily treatable, early detection is paramount. A small biopsy is a very low-risk procedure. Local anesthetic is used, so you will feel minimal discomfort. And while there is always a possibility of scarring, we take every precaution to minimize it. I understand your apprehension, but I strongly advise against delaying proper diagnosis. Are you aware of any family history of melanoma or other skin cancers?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. If you insist. It's just… I really dislike needles. And the thought of a scar… well, you wouldn't understand. My husband will be furious if I come home looking… altered. As for family history… … my great-aunt Elara, on my mother’s side, she had a mole removed, I think. But that was ages ago, and I don’t know what the results were. She didn’t talk about it much. Honestly, she was a rather eccentric woman. It probably wasn’t anything serious. But I suppose it's worth mentioning. Are you sure you can’t just… monitor it for a while longer?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, with respect, “monitoring” a lesion that is increasing in size, even slightly, is not an acceptable medical practice. And the fact that your great-aunt had a mole removed, regardless of whether it was “serious” or not, further supports the need for a biopsy. Family history, even distant family history, is relevant. Look, I understand your concerns about needles and scarring. We will do everything we can to make the procedure as comfortable and cosmetically pleasing as possible. But I am obligated to prioritize your health and safety. So, yes, we will proceed with a biopsy. Do you have any allergies to local anesthetics, such as lidocaine?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you’re so insistent. Honestly, you doctors are all the same. Always wanting to poke and prod. Allergies… Hmm. Let me think. I don’t believe so. I’ve had injections before, for vaccinations, and I didn’t have any reaction. But I did have a rather bad rash once, after using a new hand cream. It was lavender scented, if that makes any difference. But I doubt it was lidocaine. It was probably just the lavender. So, no allergies to lidocaine, as far as I know. But please be gentle. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Very well. Lavender allergies are noted. We will proceed with the biopsy on your left forearm. I will use a local anesthetic to numb the area, and a small punch biopsy to remove a sample of the lesion. It should take approximately fifteen to twenty minutes. I will need you to lie on the examination table, and I will clean the area with an antiseptic solution. Please inform me immediately if you experience any discomfort during the procedure. After the biopsy, I will apply a small bandage to the site. You will need to keep the area clean and dry for the next few days, and avoid direct sun exposure. We will send the sample to pathology, and I will contact you with the results within one to two weeks. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: One to two weeks? That’s a long time to be walking around with a bandage on my arm! Honestly, Doctor, is that really necessary? And what if it… hurts? I’ve heard horror stories. And will it… bleed a lot? I really don’t like the sight of blood. And what if it's… something serious? Don't tell me it's something serious. I have a charity gala, remember? This is simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, your anxiety is… understandable, but it is also hindering our ability to address this matter rationally. The waiting period for pathology results is standard procedure. It allows the lab sufficient time to analyze the sample accurately. The procedure itself will cause minimal discomfort. You may feel a brief stinging sensation when the anesthetic is injected, and a slight pressure when the biopsy is taken. Bleeding will be minimal, and I will apply pressure to the site to stop it. And while I cannot definitively rule out the possibility of malignancy without the pathology results, I want to reassure you that many skin lesions are benign. We are taking this precaution to ensure your health and well-being. Now, are you prepared to proceed with the biopsy, or would you prefer to schedule another appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Just… please be quick. And gentle. And try not to make a mess. I have a very important gala to attend, you know. Honestly, this is simply ruining my day. And if it is something serious, don’t tell me right before the gala. That would be just dreadful. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. This will sting for a moment. Try to relax. There. That’s done. Minimal bleeding, as expected. Keep this clean and dry for the next few days. Avoid direct sun exposure. And I will contact you with the pathology results within one to two weeks. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Ouch. That was a bit more than a sting. Honestly, Doctor. And what if the bandage comes off? Can I just… put another one on? Or does it need a special kind? And what if I get it wet accidentally? I’m taking a water aerobics class next week. Is that alright? And will it… leave a scar? A big, ugly scar? Honestly, you haven’t been very reassuring. And can I at least have a note for work? Just in case I need to… explain the bandage.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, with all due respect, you are fixating on inconsequential details. If the bandage comes off, simply apply a clean, dry bandage. A standard adhesive bandage will suffice. Avoid prolonged water exposure for the next few days, and postpone your water aerobics class until the site has healed sufficiently. The likelihood of significant scarring is minimal, though some minimal discoloration is possible. We take every precaution to minimize cosmetic impact. And yes, I can provide you with a note for work. Here. This note explains that you underwent a minor skin procedure and may require a bandage for a few days. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Well… what should I do if it starts to… throb? Or if it gets… red and puffy? And what if I feel… faint? I get faint easily. And… is there anything I should be looking for? Like, a sign that something is really wrong? Honestly, you haven’t explained any of this very well. I feel completely unprepared. And… can I get a second opinion? Just in case?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, you are understandably anxious, but your concerns are beginning to exceed the scope of a routine biopsy. If the site experiences excessive throbbing, redness, or swelling, or if you experience any signs of infection, such as pus or fever, contact my office immediately. Feeling faint is unlikely, but if it occurs, lie down and elevate your legs. As for a second opinion, you are certainly entitled to one. I can provide you with a list of dermatologists in the area. However, I assure you that I have performed countless biopsies, and I am confident in my assessment. Now, I have other patients waiting. I will contact you with the pathology results within one to two weeks. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any urgent concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I suppose not. Just… please hurry with the results. And I really hope it doesn’t leave a scar. Honestly, this has been a dreadful experience. Thank you… I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Bartock. .
