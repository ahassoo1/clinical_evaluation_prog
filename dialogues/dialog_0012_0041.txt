DOCTOR: Hi Dorman, it's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. It’s making things… difficult. I was hoping you could have a look.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness. I understand. And you said it's been coming on gradually?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Not like a sudden fall, or anything. Just… less strength. Especially in my legs, I think. Hard to explain… like trying to walk through water sometimes. It’s been going on for… oh, maybe six months now, or longer? Time… it gets away from an old man.
DOCTOR: I understand, six months or longer. That is a while. And you feel it mostly in your legs, like walking through water... that's a helpful way to describe it. Are you noticing it with other things too, besides walking?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, now that you mention it, my hands aren't as strong as they used to be. Dropping things more often. And… sometimes my words don’t come out clear. Like my tongue is… heavy. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Dorman. Weakness in your hands and some difficulty with your speech… okay. Has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Not that I’ve noticed, Doctor. It doesn't seem to get worse after I do something, or after I rest. It just… is. Some days are a little better than others, but it's never really gone. The heat sometimes feels worse, but that could just be… the heat. We get a lot of it here.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's fairly consistent, not really linked to activity or rest, and the heat might make it feel a bit worse. Now, let's talk a little bit about your health history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was diagnosed with… multiple sclerosis, many years ago now. I forget the exact year. It was a long time back. I've seen doctors over the years, had some treatments, but… it’s always been there, you see. That’s why I’m here now. It seems to be… getting worse again.
DOCTOR: Okay, multiple sclerosis. That's important information. And you said you’ve had treatments for it in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A long time ago. Injections, I think. And some pills. It was at the hospital in Honolulu, mostly. It helped for a little while, I think, but then… it stopped. The doctors said there wasn’t much more they could do at the time. It was years and years ago, though. I don't remember all the details. My wife, Leilani, she might remember more.
DOCTOR: Okay, treatments in Honolulu, injections and pills. That's helpful. Are you currently taking any medications, besides anything you took for the MS in the past?
PATIENT: Just some things for my blood pressure, Doctor. A little white pill, every morning. And sometimes a pain reliever for my knees, when they act up. That's all, I think. Leilani keeps track of most of it, to be honest. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and pain relievers as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything. But, like I said, Leilani keeps better track of things. She always reminds me what I can and can't take. It's best to ask her, really. She’s got a good memory.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Alright, Dorman. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your strength, reflexes, and coordination. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. My old bones aren’t as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your reflexes, and we’ll do a few simple strength tests. Do you have any trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast, but that's just getting old, I think. It passes pretty quickly. My balance is okay, mostly. I still like to garden, you see. That takes some balance.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Gardening is excellent. Heart sounds are a little… distant, but regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please sit with your legs dangling, and relax your arms?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay… a little diminished on both sides, but symmetrical. Biceps reflexes are also a little diminished. Triceps are normal. Now, let's check your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is that enough? It’s not very strong, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Dorman. It's helpful to know what's comfortable for you. Now, could you please try to push your hands against mine like you're trying to lift something heavy?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. This is… harder than it looks. My arms feel like they’re getting tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now let’s check your legs. I’m going to hold your legs still, and you push your feet against my hands, like you’re pressing on a gas pedal. Don't strain yourself.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. This is… very difficult. My legs just don’t have the strength they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, let’s check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is that alright? It’s not very precise.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s all for the physical exam for now, Dorman. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like your multiple sclerosis may be having a flare-up. The weakness in your legs and arms, along with the slight difficulty with coordination, is consistent with that. The diminished reflexes also fit the picture. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as vitamin deficiencies or other neurological conditions. I’m going to order some blood tests, including a vitamin B12 level and a complete blood count. I’d also like to order an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to see if there’s any new activity in the MS. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If that’s what you think is best, then please do. An MRI… I had one before, years ago. Not pleasant, but if it will help, then yes. Blood tests are fine too. Whatever you need to do to find out what’s going on. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’ll also write you a prescription for physical therapy. Strengthening your muscles will help to improve your function and quality of life. We can discuss the frequency and intensity of the therapy with the therapist. In the meantime, it’s important to avoid overexertion and get plenty of rest. If you notice any new symptoms, such as vision changes, severe pain, or difficulty breathing, please come back to see me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Physical therapy sounds good. I used to do some exercises years ago, but I stopped. Maybe it's time to start again. Thank you for listening to me, and thank you for taking the time to examine me. It gives me some peace of mind knowing that you’re looking into this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dorman. I'm glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. We'll schedule the MRI as soon as possible. I’ll call you as soon as the results are back and we can discuss them. Here's a summary of our visit and the prescriptions I’ve written for you. Please read it over and let me know if you have any questions. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or you’re feeling worse. Leilani is welcome to call as well, if she has any concerns. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all. Thank you again for your kindness. I appreciate you taking the time. I’ll let Leilani know what you’ve said. We’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dorman. Take care of yourself, and please don't hesitate to reach out. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
PATIENT: .
