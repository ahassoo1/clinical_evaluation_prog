DOCTOR: Alright, Lacreasha. I see you’re here today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: My nails. They… look funny. Not good funny. Just… funny. I don’t know why they look funny, that’s why I’m here, right? It’s been… a while. Maybe a month? I don’t really look at my hands, you know?
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, around there. Maybe longer. Time gets away from you, doesn't it? They’re… different colors. And one feels kinda thick. Like it could… break, maybe? I don’t know. I just want them to look normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Different colors and one feels thick… Okay. Let’s take a look. Can you hold out your hands for me, palms up?
PATIENT: There. See? It’s awful. That one… this one, it's all bumpy. And that one's kinda… yellowish. Not a nice yellow, like sunshine. A sickly yellow.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see what you mean. There is some discoloration and thickening, particularly on the… third nail from the left. And some pitting. Hmm. Have you noticed any changes in your skin elsewhere?
PATIENT: Skin? I dunno. I moisturize. Sometimes. What kinda changes? Like… wrinkles? I mean, I'm not getting any younger, but what's that got to do with my nails? I use that lotion with the cocoa butter. It smells nice. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: No, not wrinkles. I'm asking about rashes, scaling, or any unusual spots on your arms, legs, or torso. Anything at all out of the ordinary. And have you had any recent injuries to your hands?
PATIENT: Injuries? No! I don’t do things that cause injuries. I’m an audiologist, remember? I work with ears, not hammers and nails. Maybe I bumped them a little, doing dishes? But that was ages ago. Rashes… I think I had a little itchy patch on my elbow last spring, but that went away. Probably just allergies. There's a lot of pollen this year. Honestly, I don't know why my nails are doing this. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Alright. It could be a fungal infection, a reaction to something, or a number of other things. It's hard to say definitively just by looking at them. We'll need to do a scraping to send to the lab, just to be sure. It’s a quick and painless procedure. We'll also want to rule out anything more systemic. Do you have any family history of nail problems, or skin conditions like psoriasis?
PATIENT: Psori-what? Look, my family is from… far away. We didn’t really talk about skin stuff. My grandmother had… strong hands, from working the land, I guess. That’s about it. And my uncle… he had a cough. A bad one. But nails? No. I don’t think so. This lab thing… does it hurt? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles, I assure you. It's just a small scraping of the nail, like filing them a little. It doesn't usually cause any discomfort. As for your family history, it's good to know. We'll proceed with the scraping, and then we’ll see what the lab results tell us. It could be nothing serious, but it's best to get it checked. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. I had a bad reaction to something once. Years ago. I think it was an antibiotic. I got a rash and felt really sick. I don’t remember what it was called. My doctor at the time… she moved away. I don’t really take much, just a little something for my blood pressure sometimes. But not lately. Everything’s been fine. Just… these nails. Can we just fix them?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll do the scraping now. It will take just a few minutes. Afterwards, we'll discuss what the lab results might indicate and formulate a plan. And while it's frustrating to wait, it's crucial to have accurate information before we start any treatment. Please, sit back and relax. I’ll need to sterilize these tools first.
PATIENT: Sterilize? What does that mean? Are they dirty? I don't want anything from other people on my nails. This is starting to sound… complicated. Can’t you just… put some polish on them? A really strong color? Maybe red? That would cover everything up.
DOCTOR: Sterilizing means cleaning them thoroughly to prevent any infection. It’s standard procedure, a safety measure. Polish won’t address the underlying issue, it will just mask the problem. And masking the problem could make it worse in the long run. We need to know what we're dealing with before we can determine the appropriate course of action. I understand your frustration, but I assure you, this is the most responsible way to proceed. Now, if you'll allow me to perform the scraping… it truly is a simple procedure.
PATIENT: Fine. But be gentle. And don’t take too long. I have appointments, you know. People rely on me to hear. I can’t be sitting here all day fiddling with my nails. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. This may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Just try to relax. It's almost done… there. Now we'll collect a sample from another nail, just to be thorough. Okay, we're finished. I'll send these to the lab, and the results should be back in about a week. In the meantime, try to keep your hands clean and dry. And avoid any harsh chemicals or excessive moisture. I'll call you as soon as I have the results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A week? That’s a long time! What if it's something awful? Like… contagious? Oh dear. I really hope it’s not contagious. I touch a lot of people’s ears. And what if I need… medicine? I don’t like taking medicine. A week… fine. I guess I’ll just have to wait. But call me as soon as you know. And make sure it’s not contagious. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Lacreasha. We'll rule out anything serious, and if treatment is necessary, we'll discuss all options. I’ll contact you as soon as the results are available. .
