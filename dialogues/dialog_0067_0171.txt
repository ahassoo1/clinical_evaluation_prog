DOCTOR: Good morning, Lacreasha. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin’. Nails. They… look funny. Not right. Been that way a bit now, I guess. Don't remember exactly when they started, but… yeah. Nails.
DOCTOR: Okay, “nails not right.” Can you tell me more about what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Well… they're kinda… bumpy. And some are… discolored. Like, not just a little bit, ya know? Not painted or anything, just… changed. I don’t do much with ‘em, really. Mostly just try to keep ‘em short. Is that… helpful? I don’t know what you want to know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly helpful, thank you. Bumpy and discolored – that gives me a starting point. And it’s good to know you don't use any nail polish or anything like that. When you say discolored, what colors are you seeing?
PATIENT: Colors… hmm. Some are… yellowish. And one, maybe two, got kinda… dark. Like, not black, but… brownish? It’s hard to say exactly. I ain't lookin' at 'em that close all the time, ya know? I just noticed they don’t look like they should. And they feel… thicker, maybe? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Yellowish, brownish discoloration, and feeling thicker… okay. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with your nails?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. No pain. Maybe a little… sensitive if I bump 'em, but that's it. It's more… ugly than painful. I ain’t one for fancy nails, but these… they just look wrong. You think it's somethin' serious? I don't go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just changes in appearance and a slight sensitivity to bumping them. I understand your concern. It’s good you came in to have them checked. Let me take a quick look at your medical history… Alright, I see you’ve had Medicare for a few years, and no major medical issues listed. Do you have any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat most things. Dust kinda bothers me sometimes, makes me sneeze, but… that’s just dust, right? Not a real allergy. Never had a bad reaction to anything, that I can recall. I don't take any pills, if that matters. Just… mostly healthy, I guess. For my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or current medications. That's good to know. Now, let's take a closer look at your nails. Would you mind extending your hands for me, palms up?
PATIENT: Sure. There they are. Don't mind if they're a bit rough, I do my own housework.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see what you mean. There is some noticeable discoloration – a yellowish hue on several nails, and some brownish patches on a couple of them. I also see some thickening and a slightly ridged texture. Do you notice any separation of the nail from the nail bed?
PATIENT: Separation… huh. Let me see… I think… maybe a little? At the very tips, on that one… and maybe that one too. But not much. It's hard to tell. I don't spend a lot of time lookin' at my nails, ya know? Is that bad? Should it be separated?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly fine that you don’t spend a lot of time looking at your nails! It's not something most people do. And some minor separation isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm, but it’s good we’re noticing it. I don't feel any tenderness when I touch around the nail beds, which is good. Given what I’m seeing, and the fact that you have no pain, it's likely this is a fungal infection of the nails, also called onychomycosis. It's quite common, especially as we get older. However, to be certain, we need to do a test to confirm. We can do a nail clipping and send it to the lab for a culture. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Fungus, huh? Sounds… gross. But I guess better to know than not, right? If that’s what it is… what do you do about fungus? Does it come off? I don't want nothin' spreadin' around. And I don’t wanna be takin' a bunch of pills if I can help it. A little clipping sounds okay. As long as it don’t hurt.
DOCTOR: It’s not pleasant, but it’s very treatable. And you're right to be concerned about it spreading – that’s why it's good we’re addressing it. The clipping itself won’t hurt much – it's like trimming your nails, just a little bit more focused. There are a few treatment options. Often, it involves an antifungal medication applied directly to the nail. In some cases, oral medication is needed, but we’ll start with the topical treatment first. I’m going to clip a small sample from a couple of nails, and then we'll send it to the lab. It will take about a week or two to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your nails trimmed short and dry, and avoiding sharing nail clippers or files. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Keep 'em short and dry... I can do that. I already do try to keep 'em short. And I definitely don't share clippers. Always used my own. Alright, let's get this over with. The sooner I know what it is, the better. Don't be gentle too much, I ain't a baby. Just get a little piece off, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, we have what we need. Just a tiny bit from each nail. I’ll send these to the lab, and we’ll get the results back as soon as possible. Here you go. Just keep these clean and dry for the rest of the day. Once we have the lab results, we’ll discuss the best course of treatment. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just… what if it's bad? Like, really bad? Do people lose their nails from this fungus? I just wanna know the worst-case scenario, ya know? I don't like bein' surprised. And… how much is all this gonna cost? Medicare cover fungus stuff? .
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, and I appreciate you asking. While onychomycosis can be persistent and sometimes difficult to treat, it's relatively rare to lose a nail entirely due to the infection. In most cases, treatment is successful with either topical or oral medication. If the infection is very severe or doesn’t respond to initial treatment, there are other options we can explore, but we'll cross that bridge if we need to. As for cost, Medicare does typically cover treatment for onychomycosis, but the extent of coverage can vary depending on your specific plan. Our billing department will verify your coverage and let you know any potential out-of-pocket costs. I can have them contact you after the lab results come back. For now, let’s focus on getting the lab results. I’ll have my nurse come in and give you instructions on where to pick up the lab requisition form. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
