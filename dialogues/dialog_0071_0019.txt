DOCTOR: <stage>I adjust my glasses, looking at the chart with a slight frown. It's… Manuel Carlotta, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. Carlotta. A nice office you have. Is… is this about having a baby? My wife… she wants to, you know. We… we been married a long time.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Carlotta, I’m Dr. Galena. And no, this isn’t… typically where one would go for that sort of thing. But we can certainly talk about whatever's on your mind. Perhaps you could tell me what brought you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. My wife… she made the appointment. Something about… making sure everything is okay before… you know. I forget so much these days. She said… planning. Is it something wrong with me? I feel… alright. Old, maybe, but alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, it’s good you’re being proactive. It sounds like your wife is very thoughtful. We can definitely do some checks to make sure everything is alright. Just to be thorough. Can you tell me a little more about what's been going on?
PATIENT: Going on? Not much. We work, we eat, we watch the news. Sometimes we visit family. Nothing special. We want a baby… but she worries I am… too old. Is that it? She says things change when you get older. I don't feel much different, but… she is a good woman. Very smart.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Carlotta. It’s perfectly reasonable for your wife to be thinking about these things. Getting older does bring changes, that's true. Let’s talk about your health overall. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Conditions? I… I had my knee fixed, a long time ago. And… sometimes my blood pressure gets a bit high, the nurse tells me. But I take the pills. Mostly, I just feel… tired. Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: Okay, knee surgery, and we’re managing your blood pressure. That’s good. And yes, feeling tired can be a sign of something, or it can just be part of getting older. Let's try to pinpoint it a bit more. When did you start feeling more tired than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm. Maybe… six months ago? Yes. Six months, after the winter. It gets dark so early, you know? Makes a man sleepy. But it hasn’t gone away, even with the sun. I just… don’t have the energy I used to. My wife says I nap too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of fatigue. I understand. And aside from the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… I… I get thirsty more. And… sometimes I need to go to the bathroom in the night. That happens a lot now. Is that a change? My wife says I snore too. A very loud snore, she says.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst, going to the bathroom more at night, and the snoring. That’s helpful. Do you have any trouble with your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? I need glasses, you know. I have had them for years. Everything is… blurry without them. Has been blurry a long time. Maybe a little worse lately? But I just… get new glasses when I need them.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how’s your appetite been?
PATIENT: Appetite? I like to eat. Always have. My wife makes good food. I eat what she gives me. Maybe… a little less than before? But not much. I still enjoy a good meal.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you happen to know approximately how much you weigh, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Oh. Not really. I haven’t weighed myself in… a long time. Maybe 90 kilograms? 95? Something around there. My wife knows. She keeps track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of everything. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you, Doctor. My wife says you are a very good doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. That's very kind of you to say. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little high, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds good and regular. Lungs are clear, although I did hear a little crackling towards the base. I want to check your thyroid next. Thyroid feels a little enlarged. Now, I'm just going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears, nose, and throat look fine. Finally, I’ll just check your reflexes and strength. Reflexes and strength are a little weaker than usual, but nothing too concerning. Okay, Mr. Carlotta, that was quick. Now we have some baseline information.
PATIENT: Okay. It was… not too bad. Is something wrong, Doctor? My wife is worried about having a baby.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Carlotta, it’s too early to say definitively. But I’m seeing a few things that warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. We'll also do a chest X-ray to get a clearer look at your lungs. Those tests will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. I also think it would be wise to consult with an endocrinologist – a specialist in hormone disorders – to get their opinion on your thyroid. This doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it's best to be thorough, especially given your wife’s concerns about starting a family.
PATIENT: An endocrinologist… that sounds serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? My wife… she will be very upset. And the baby…
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, please try not to worry. Seeing a specialist doesn’t automatically mean there’s something terrible wrong. An endocrinologist specializes in the thyroid and hormone imbalances, and these can often be managed effectively with medication. The tests will help us determine if there is an imbalance, and if so, what the best course of action is. As for the baby… we need to address your health first. If there is a hormone issue, it can certainly impact fertility and pregnancy, but it doesn't mean you won't be able to have a family. Here are a few specialists I recommend. I'll also make sure the lab results are sent directly to them. In the meantime, try to get some rest, drink plenty of water, and please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Carlotta.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. My wife… she will be so relieved to hear you say that too. I will… I will make an appointment with one of these doctors. And I will try to rest. Is there anything… anything I should tell my wife right now? About the tests, or… the specialist?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think it's best to be upfront with her. Tell her we’re doing some tests to get a clearer picture of your overall health, and that I’ve recommended seeing a specialist to rule out any potential hormone imbalances. Emphasize that this is a precautionary measure, and that we don't have any definitive answers yet. You can also tell her that I’m here to answer any questions she may have. And remind her that we’ll work through this together, and prioritize both your health and her desire to start a family. Do you have any questions for me before you go, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You explained everything very well, Doctor. Thank you. I will make the appointment. And I will tell my wife. Thank you again, Doctor Galena. You are a good doctor. I hope… I hope everything will be alright. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I’m glad I could help. And I sincerely hope everything turns out alright as well. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I wish you and your wife all the best.
