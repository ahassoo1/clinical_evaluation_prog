DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Croonquist, yes, that's me. Look, I just need some… some tests done, alright? The usual. Medicare sent something in the mail, said I needed to get some lab work. Don’t really remember what for, to be honest. Just want to get it over with if we could.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. It’s quite common for Medicare to send out notices for routine preventative testing. No problem at all. To ensure we order the correct tests, could you perhaps recall if the notice mentioned anything specific – perhaps a particular body system or concern?
PATIENT: Body system… concern… Honestly, no. They send so much stuff. It was probably about… something old. My… joints, maybe? Or something with my… insides? I really don’t keep track of these things. It’s just a check-up, right? A general thing? Just tell me what needs doing, Doc. I’ve got things to do today.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Croonquist. It can be a bit overwhelming. A general check-up is a good starting point. Given your mention of joints and “insides,” and to be thorough, let’s start with a comprehensive metabolic panel – that checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. We’ll also do a complete blood count to look at your red and white blood cells, and a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol. Would that sound reasonable as a beginning?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Kidneys, livers… doesn't really matter to me. As long as it's quick. Just… where do I go to get this done? And how long will it take? I've got a lunch appointment, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab is just down the hall, third door on the right. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes for those tests, including the time to sit and wait. They're quite efficient over there. Before you head over, though, may I ask a few quick questions to get a better overall picture of your health?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I appreciate it, I really do. But I'm not much for chatting. Just had my 73rd birthday, single, never been much of a talker. Medicare, as I said. Just want the tests, get the results, and be on my way. Is that alright? Don't want to hold you up.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. I completely understand and respect your wishes. We can proceed with just the lab work then. However, just for my records, could you briefly confirm if you have any known allergies to medications, and if you’re currently taking any prescriptions or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Taken a lot of pills in my life, never reacted bad to any. And… no, I don't take anything regularly. Maybe some aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's it. Really, that’s it. Can we please just get this over with? I'm starting to feel a bit… restless.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. No problem at all. Just one final quick question then, to clarify. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past - anything you’ve been treated for, like heart trouble, diabetes, or lung issues?
PATIENT: Lung issues… Well, I worked at the power plant for… oh, a long time. Lots of dust, lots of noise. Had a cough a few times, but nothing serious. Doctor gave me some pills. Can’t remember what for. Everything aches a little, you know, getting old. No heart trouble, not that I know of. Diabetes… maybe? I think my mother had that. But me? Not sure. Honestly, Doctor, it was a long time ago. Can we just… go? I'm really not good with remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. We can proceed. Considering your history at the power plant and your mother’s diabetes, it's good we're getting these baseline tests done. I'll write an order for a comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, lipid panel, and a basic urine analysis. It might be helpful to also include a chest X-ray, given your work history. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: X-ray… look, Doc, I’m starting to get a headache. You’re asking too many questions. Just the first three things, alright? The… the blood and the… whatever. No X-rays. I’m not a fan of radiation. Just get it done. Seriously. This is taking forever. Third door on the right, you said?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. Comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lipid panel it is. Here’s the lab order. Third door on the right, as you mentioned. The phlebotomist will take care of you. Please let them know if you have any difficulty sitting or lying down. After the tests, the results will be sent to me, and my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me before you head over?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. Thank you, Doctor. Hopefully, this won’t take too long. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. Have a good day. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns. .
