DOCTOR: Hi Louine, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. This sore… it just won’t heal. It’s been bothering me for months, and frankly, I've seen better days with it. I’ve had… complications, you see. The sugar, mostly. Though, I do try to watch what I eat. It’s just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, months, that's a while. And you mentioned “sugar,” so I'm assuming you have diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Diabetes. Type 2, they tell me. Though, honestly, I don’t pay much attention to the details. Doctors always talking about numbers and… things. It's just… it makes my feet hurt, and this one spot… it’s really bad. It’s not like I haven’t tried things, you know? Salves, creams… my daughter brings me things, but nothing seems to work. It's just getting worse, and I don't want to lose my foot! People do lose feet, don't they?
DOCTOR: Yes, people can, and that’s exactly why you’re right to get it checked out. We want to prevent that. So, this sore… where on your foot is it exactly?
PATIENT: It’s on the bottom, right here… … near my heel. It started small, just a little red spot, but now… now it’s… well, it’s quite deep. And it smells. Not a pleasant smell, I assure you. My daughter says I shouldn’t have let it go so long, but frankly, she doesn’t understand these things. She’s always telling me what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, near the heel on the bottom of your foot. And you've noticed it’s getting deeper and has an odor. Has there been any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? …Well, sometimes. It’s… not a lot. A little bit of… yellowish stuff. It gets on my socks. My daughter changes the bandages, mostly. She’s very good about that part, I suppose. Though, she always makes such a fuss. And she keeps telling me about this… “circulation” thing. Is that important? Honestly, all this talk is just… confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish drainage. And your daughter is right to mention circulation; that’s very important, especially with diabetes. It can affect how well your foot heals. Let's do a quick exam of your foot, if that's alright with you. I’ll just need to take a look and feel around. It will help me get a better idea of what's going on. I'll also check your pulses. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Pulses? What do pulses have to do with my foot? I mean, I feel fine, mostly. Just this sore is a nuisance. But, alright. Go ahead. But be gentle, young man. My skin is delicate. And don’t go poking around too much. I don’t want to bleed all over everything. Honestly, I don't understand why you need to feel my pulses, but… do what you must.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very gentle. Checking your pulses helps us understand how well the blood is flowing to your foot. Reduced blood flow can make it harder for wounds to heal and increase the risk of infection. Okay, I'm feeling the pulses now. They are a little faint, which we'll need to keep an eye on. The sore itself is about this big – roughly an inch and a half across – and about a quarter of an inch deep. There’s some redness and warmth around it, and I see a little drainage as you mentioned. I’m also noticing your skin is quite thin. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your foot?
PATIENT: Numbness? …Sometimes. Not all the time. Mostly at night. It's like… pins and needles. But it goes away. My daughter says it’s the sugar again. She keeps telling me I need to watch my blood sugar. Honestly, I feel like all she does is nag. But, yes, sometimes my feet feel… funny. Like they're asleep. And cold. They get cold easily, even in the summer. Is that bad? Everything seems to be bad these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness, tingling, and coldness – that’s consistent with what we call neuropathy, which is often caused by diabetes. It affects the nerves, and can definitely contribute to the problems we’re seeing with your foot. I'm going to order a couple of tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. First, I want to check your blood sugar levels, just to confirm what your daughter is saying. Then, I’d like to do a simple test called a monofilament exam. It's just a gentle touch to see if you can feel light pressure on your foot. And finally, I want to send a sample of the drainage from the sore to the lab to see if there’s an infection present. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests. Honestly, I feel like a pincushion these days. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Blood sugar, the… mono-whatsit, and the drainage. Just try to be quick, alright? And don’t poke too hard. I don’t want any more discomfort than I already have. And what if it is an infection? What happens then? Do I have to go to the hospital? Because I do not want to go to the hospital. Honestly, hospitals are dreadful places. They smell like… everything. And the food is terrible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine. We'll take things one step at a time, and I'll be as gentle as possible. The monofilament exam is completely painless – it's just a soft touch, like brushing against your skin. And we'll get the lab results back quickly. If there is an infection, it depends on how severe it is. Mild infections can often be treated with antibiotics, usually pills you take at home. More serious infections might require a hospital stay, but we'll cross that bridge if we come to it. Right now, let's focus on getting the tests done and seeing what the results show. Okay, all done. I’ve sent the drainage sample to the lab, and I've written down the order for the blood sugar test. It should only take a few minutes for the nurse to come in and draw some blood. While you're waiting, I'm going to write a preliminary note and go over some general foot care tips for people with diabetes. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they come back. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Foot care tips? I've been taking care of my feet for eighty-nine years, young man. I think I know a thing or two about it. But… alright. Go ahead. I suppose it can't hurt to hear what you have to say. Just don't tell me anything I already know. And hurry up about it. I'm getting tired of sitting here. This chair isn't very comfortable, you know. And I have an appointment to watch my stories later. It's very important.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. And I apologize for the uncomfortable chair. You're right, eighty-nine years of foot care is a lot of experience! I just want to reinforce some key points, especially for someone with diabetes. The most important thing is to check your feet every day for cuts, blisters, redness, or swelling. Even a small cut can become a big problem if it doesn't heal properly. Wash your feet daily with warm – not hot – water and mild soap. Dry them thoroughly, especially between the toes. And never go barefoot, even indoors. Always wear socks and shoes that fit well. And if you see anything unusual, like a cut that isn't healing, or a blister, come see me right away. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Familiar? Of course it’s familiar! My daughter lectures me about all of that constantly. Wash, dry, socks, shoes… it’s like a broken record. Honestly, she treats me like a child. I know to wash my feet! I'm not stupid, you know. And I wear socks. Usually. Though sometimes it’s too hot. And shoes… well, sometimes they rub. It's difficult to find comfortable shoes when you're eighty-nine years old. Everything aches. But I do try to take care of my feet. I really do. It's just… difficult. And frankly, all this worrying doesn't help. It makes my blood sugar go up. Is it any wonder things are so complicated?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, it is complicated. And I apologize if it feels like I'm lecturing you. I understand your daughter is already on top of things, and you've been taking excellent care of your feet for a long time. I just want to make sure we're covering all the bases. And you're also right about the worrying – stress can absolutely affect your blood sugar. We'll try to keep things as calm and straightforward as possible. Ah, here's the nurse now to draw your blood. It will just be a quick prick, and then we'll have the results shortly. Once we have those, we'll discuss them and make a plan. Sound good?
PATIENT: A prick? Honestly! I hate needles. But… alright. Get it over with quickly, alright? And don’t poke around too much. I bruise easily, you know. And don't expect me to be cheerful about it. This whole thing is very upsetting. Honestly, I came in for a sore foot, not a bloodletting. Just… hurry up. The sooner it's over, the better. And then I want to know the results. I don’t want to wait all day. I have my stories to watch, you know. It’s very important.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Louine. The nurse is very skilled, and it will be over before you know it. And we’ll get the results to you as quickly as possible. I promise. Thank you, Nurse. Please take good care of Louine. Just try to relax, and take a few deep breaths. You're doing great. Once the blood draw is done, we'll have a better idea of what's going on, and we can make a plan to get that foot feeling better. It will be alright. .
PATIENT: .
