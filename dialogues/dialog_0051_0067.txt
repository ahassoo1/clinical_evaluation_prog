DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… well, it’s my chest, I think. It hurts when I… when I breathe deep. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it’s… well, it’s just bothersome, you know? I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall specifics. We’ll take our time. So, it's a chest pain that worsens with deep breaths... can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Describe it… It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, thank goodness. It feels… tight, almost. Like someone’s squeezing it a little when I try to take a big breath. It doesn't last long, usually. Just when I breathe in. And it's not all the time, you see. Sometimes I forget all about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, tight ache in your chest that happens with deep breaths… and it’s not constant. That’s helpful. Does anything else seem to make it worse, besides taking a deep breath?
PATIENT: Hmm… You know, I don’t think so. I do a lot of… well, I used to do a lot of construction work. Heavy lifting, things like that. But it doesn’t seem to bother it more when I’m working. Or… well, I don't really work much anymore. Just… puttering around the house. I mostly sit, to be honest. Maybe that's why it bothers me? I don't know. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we’ll try to piece things together. Sitting for long periods can sometimes contribute to discomfort. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Like what, Doctor? I get tired, of course. I'm eighty years old! But… no, I don’t think so. No cough, no… what do you call it… shortness of breath besides when it hurts to breathe. I haven’t felt dizzy or anything like that. Just the ache. Mostly just the ache. I haven’t been eating much lately, either. But that’s just… old age. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, no dizziness, no shortness of breath except when the pain occurs, and a decreased appetite. I appreciate you telling me all of this. Now, have you had any medical problems in the past that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical problems… Oh boy… that’s a long time ago. I had a bad fall when I was younger, broke my arm. And… I think I had pneumonia once, a long, long time ago. But… that was before I came to this country. I don't really remember much about it. And… honestly, I haven't been to the doctor in… well, a very long time. I mostly just try to tough it out, you know? I don’t like going to doctors. Not much good ever comes of it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to avoid doctors if you haven't had positive experiences. We'll do our best to make this a comfortable visit. Did you have any surgeries in the past, besides the broken arm?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Now that you mention it… I think… yes. I had my appendix out, a long time ago. Very long ago. And… I think I had something on my knee taken care of, too. Something about cartilage, the doctor said. But it was a long time ago. I don’t remember much detail. Everything gets… fuzzy. I apologize. It's difficult to recall.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Ruocco. It’s very common for memories to fade over time. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Family… My wife… she had some problems with her heart, I remember. She passed away many years ago. And… My brother… he had some trouble breathing, too. Something about his lungs. But… that was a long time ago, and in a different country. We didn't have much in the way of doctors back then. It was a long time ago… I’m sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I? It’s hard to remember all those things.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Ruocco. It's alright if you don't remember everything. Knowing about your wife’s heart condition and your brother’s lung problems is useful information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I mostly stay at home now. I used to be very active, you know? Construction work, lots of lifting and moving around. But… that was a long time ago. Now I mostly sit and watch TV. I don't smoke, never did. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a little beer with dinner sometimes. I used to garden a bit, but my knees aren't what they used to be. Mostly… just sitting. A quiet life. It's… peaceful. But… boring, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet lifestyle, no smoking, limited alcohol, and some past gardening. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmmm… I don’t think so. Never had any problems with any medications that I remember. No trouble with food, either. I eat pretty much anything. I don’t have any pets, never did. Oh, wait! I got a bad rash once, from a plant. A long time ago, when I was still working outside. But I don't know what kind of plant it was. It just… itched. A lot. But that was a long time ago. Other than that, I don't think I have any allergies. No, I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies to medications, foods or pets, just a past rash from a plant. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications… No, Doctor. I don’t take anything. Not regularly, anyway. I used to take something for my knees, a long time ago. But the doctor took me off of it. Said it wasn’t doing much good. Now I just… deal with the pain. I don't like taking pills. They never seem to help much, and they always make me feel… strange. No, I don’t take any medications. Not a single one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Thank you for all this information, Mr. Ruocco. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your chest. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… alright. I suppose it’s alright. But… don’t poke around too much, please? My chest… it’s a little sensitive, you know? And… go easy, alright? I'm an old man. But yes, go ahead. Do what you need to do. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I will be very gentle. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. Sounds are a bit quiet, but regular rhythm. Now, take a few deep breaths for me. I’m listening to your lungs. I hear a little bit of wheezing, but nothing too concerning at this point. I’m just feeling your chest now. There's some tenderness here, along the lower ribs. Does that feel particularly painful?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That’s… that’s where it hurts the most, Doctor. Right there. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like someone’s squeezing it. It’s worse when I breathe deep, you know? And it feels… tight. Like a band around my chest. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, but I just thought it was old age. I apologize for being a bother, Doctor. I don't mean to waste your time.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Mr. Ruocco. It’s my job to investigate these things. Alright, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some musculoskeletal pain in your chest wall, possibly with a component of mild bronchospasm – the wheezing I heard suggests some narrowing of the airways. However, given your age and symptoms, we need to rule out some other possibilities. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better look at your lungs and heart. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… and EKG… what are those? Are they… painful? I don't like hospitals. Or… whatever this is. Will it take long? I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? And… is it serious, Doctor? Please, just tell me straight. I don't want to be poked and prodded all day. It's just… my chest hurts. That's all. And I’m an old man. I don’t bounce back like I used to.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, Mr. Ruocco. It’s important you understand everything. An X-ray is a picture of your lungs and heart – it doesn’t hurt at all. You just stand or sit still for a few moments while the machine takes the picture. An EKG is a test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. We’ll place some small stickers on your chest, arms and legs. It also doesn’t hurt, just a little cool feeling. These tests will help us rule out things like pneumonia or a heart problem. They are standard tests and take only a few minutes each. I understand you’re worried, and you’re right to be cautious. It’s impossible to say definitively what’s wrong without these tests, but I don't believe it's an emergency at this moment. We are doing this to be thorough and make sure we know exactly what's causing your chest pain. We’ll get the results quickly, and then we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: I… alright. If you think it’s necessary. But… no poking and prodding, please? Just the pictures and the stickers. And… quick, alright? I don’t want to be here all day. I have things to do. Or… I used to have things to do. Will it cost me much, Doctor? I don’t have much money. I apologize for all the trouble. I just want to feel better, you know? That's all I want.
DOCTOR: You're not causing any trouble at all, Mr. Ruocco. And we’ll keep it as quick as possible. Regarding the cost, let me check with the billing department to see what your options are, given your financial situation. We can discuss payment plans if needed. We don’t want that to be a barrier to getting you the care you need. Now, I’ll have the nurse come in and take your vitals and prepare you for the X-ray and EKG. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
