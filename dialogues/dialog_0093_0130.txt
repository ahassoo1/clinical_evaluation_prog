DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well… it’s my family, you see. Lots of sickness, always. My mother… heart trouble. My brother… something with his lungs. I… I just want to make sure I am okay. Want to be safe, you know? I don't want the same thing to happen to me.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you, Mr. Schwer. It’s always best to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of illness. We'll certainly do our best to assess your well-being. To start, could you tell me a little more about your mother’s heart trouble?
PATIENT: She… she got tired very easy. Couldn't walk far. Then her legs started to swell. Doctor said it was her heart, something about not pumping good. She was in the hospital a few times, then… then she passed. It was… a long time ago now. I was young. I don't remember all the details, sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t recall all the details – memories fade with time, and it’s understandable that it’s difficult to revisit those experiences. Knowing that she experienced shortness of breath and leg swelling is helpful. And your brother’s lung condition – do you know what diagnosis he received, or what treatments he underwent?
PATIENT: He… he smoked a lot. Always did. Doctor said his lungs were bad, like… black. He had trouble breathing, always coughing. He used a… a machine to help him breathe, at the end. Then he had to go to a special place. A long time ago, too. I don't know what it was called, exactly. I was never very good with those… doctor words.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like your brother was diagnosed with a smoking-related lung disease, and required assistance with his breathing. That provides important context. Now, let's focus on you. Have you experienced any symptoms yourself – perhaps shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No… not really. I get tired sometimes, but everyone does, right? I work hard. Sales… it's a lot of walking. And I’m… older now. Maybe that’s why. No coughing, no pain. Just… worried, you know? I eat okay, I think. Not much fast food. I try to walk every day. I don't smoke. Never did.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Schwer. It's excellent that you maintain an active lifestyle and haven't smoked. It's understandable to be concerned given your family history, even without specific symptoms. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing. And I had the… the flu a few times, like everyone. Nothing serious. Never been to the hospital, except to visit. Oh! I had my shots, when I was younger. For traveling. Doctor made me get them. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else. I’m pretty healthy, usually. Just… this worry.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know, Mr. Schwer. No major medical issues or surgeries is a positive sign. And it's responsible of you to have received vaccinations. Now, have you ever been allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. My wife… she was allergic to shellfish. But I’m divorced now. I never had any problems with medicines. No rashes, no trouble breathing. I take a little pill for my… for my water. The doctor said my blood pressure was a little high, a few years ago. But that’s it. Just that one little pill.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schwer. So you take a medication for high blood pressure. Do you happen to know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Umm… let me see… I have it at home. It’s a little white pill. I think it starts with an “A”? Or maybe a “B”? I just ask the pharmacist to give me the same one every month. I don't remember the full name, sorry. It's hard for me to remember things like that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Schwer. We can easily verify the medication name through your pharmacy records. Now, just to be thorough, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… what does that mean? Like… friends? I used to have more friends. I work a lot. Mostly alone, traveling. My wife… we don't talk much anymore. I don't drink much. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. Never done drugs. I don't go to parties. I just… work. And try to stay healthy. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schwer, that's exactly what I mean. I was just asking about your lifestyle habits – your work, your social connections, and anything like alcohol or tobacco use. You’ve provided very helpful information. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I just want to know if I'm okay. I want to be around for a while longer, you know? This worry… it’s getting to me. So, yes. Go ahead. Whatever you need to check.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Schwer. I understand your concerns, and we will do a thorough check. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay. Here I am. Do I need to… take my shirt off? I never did this before.
DOCTOR: No, you don’t need to remove your shirt, Mr. Schwer. Just a light examination through your clothing will be sufficient for now. I’m just listening to your breathing and heartbeat. Your heart sounds regular, and I'm not hearing any unusual murmurs or extra sounds. Your breathing sounds clear, but a little diminished on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. It's slightly elevated. We may need to adjust your medication if it remains consistently high. I'll also check your pulse. Your pulse is 76 and regular. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. There is slight diminished sensation in your feet and ankles. And there is no edema present in your extremities. Now, could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Diminished… what does that mean? My feet and ankles? I walk a lot. Maybe that’s why. They feel okay, I guess. Just a little tired sometimes, like everything else. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Diminished sensation simply means reduced feeling, Mr. Schwer. It’s not necessarily a cause for immediate alarm, but it’s something we need to investigate further, given your age and family history. Walking a lot can contribute to some fatigue, but we want to rule out any underlying causes. I'd like to order some blood work and an EKG to get a more comprehensive picture of your health. The blood work will check your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. The EKG will assess your heart's electrical activity. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and… EKG. Sounds good. I just want to know if I'm okay. When will I get the results? And… will it hurt? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Schwer. I understand your concerns. The blood work will involve a small prick with a needle, but it's usually very quick and only causes minimal discomfort. We can use a smaller needle if that helps. As for the EKG, small stickers will be placed on your chest, arms, and legs – it doesn’t involve any needles at all. The results should be available within a few days, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I'd like to review your past medications again to verify the name and dosage of the pill you are taking for your blood pressure. I’m not finding any record of a blood pressure medication in your file. Could it be possible you obtained it through a different pharmacy, or perhaps it was prescribed by another doctor?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. That’s… strange. I get it from the pharmacy down the street. The one on Main Street. And… yes, I think… yes! I saw another doctor, a few years ago. When I first started having trouble. Maybe… maybe it’s with him. I don’t remember. I don’t go to the doctor much. I just keep getting the same pills every month. This is… complicated. I just want to know if I'm okay.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Schwer. It's not uncommon for records to be incomplete. It’s perfectly reasonable to see multiple doctors, and sometimes information doesn't transfer seamlessly. To be on the safe side, I’m going to recommend a consultation with a cardiologist – a heart specialist. They can perform a more thorough evaluation and determine the best course of treatment for your blood pressure and overall heart health. They will also review your medication list and ensure you’re on the appropriate dosage. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A… cardiologist? Another doctor? Okay… if you think it’s necessary. I just want to get this sorted out. I'm getting too old for all this. But… yes. If you think I need to see another doctor, I will. Can you… can you help me make the appointment? I don't want to have to deal with all the paperwork and phone calls. This is… a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. That’s what we're here for. I’ll be happy to help you schedule an appointment with a cardiologist. I have a list of excellent specialists in the area. I can make the call for you and handle all the paperwork. There is Dr. Anya Sharma, who has excellent reviews and a convenient office location. She is accepting new patients and has an opening next week on Wednesday afternoon. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Wednesday… afternoon? Yes… yes, that should be okay. I don’t usually work afternoons. That’s good. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do. Thank you. Thank you for helping me with this. I was getting very worried. So… Wednesday afternoon. With Dr. Sharma. And you’ll make the appointment for me? That’s good. That’s very good.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schwer. I’m happy to help. I’m just confirming: that’s Wednesday afternoon with Dr. Anya Sharma. I’ll handle all the paperwork and confirm the appointment details for you. I will also send the results of your blood work and EKG to her office. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful. I was getting very confused. Just… thank you. Wednesday afternoon. With Dr. Sharma. I guess I'll see you later. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and I’m confident Dr. Sharma will provide excellent care. Here is a summary of your visit and the referral information for Dr. Sharma. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Schwer, and I wish you all the best. .
