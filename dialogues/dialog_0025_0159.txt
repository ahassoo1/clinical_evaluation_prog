DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it's kinda weird, honestly. I'm just...having trouble gettin' up from chairs. Not always, but often enough it's a pain. Like, I'll be sittin', feelin' fine, then when I go to stand, it’s like…my legs just don't wanna cooperate. It's been goin' on for a couple months now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A couple months, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. Maybe a little longer? It started slow, just feelin' a bit stiff, ya know? Now it’s…more than that. Sometimes I gotta really push with my arms to get goin'. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it’s definitely a struggle. And it's kinda embarrassing, to be honest. I work out in the oil fields, you know? Supposed to be strong.
DOCTOR: Right. Oil fields... that is physically demanding work. So, no pain with this, just weakness or difficulty?
PATIENT: Not pain, no. It's more like…my legs feel heavy, and like they’re stuck for a second. Sometimes they feel kinda shaky when I do finally get up. It’s weird. Like they forgot how to work for a beat. Happens with most chairs, doesn't matter what kinda chair it is, really. Even my kitchen chair.
DOCTOR: Okay. And does this happen if you’ve been sitting for a long time, or even after just a few minutes?
PATIENT: It seems to be worse the longer I’m sittin’, yeah. If I just get up after five minutes, it’s usually okay. But if I'm relaxin’ for, like, an hour, watchin’ TV or somethin', that’s when it’s really bad. And it's definitely worse if I'm tired, I think. After a long day at work, forget about it. It feels like my legs are lead weights.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you noticing any weakness in your legs when you are standing or walking?
PATIENT: No, not really. Once I'm up, I'm up. I can walk and work and everything like normal. No stumble-y stuff or anything. It's really just the getting up part. I can lift heavy things, climb stuff, the whole nine yards. It just feels…stubborn to start movin' sometimes. Does that make any sense? It feels like a really silly problem.
DOCTOR: It makes sense, Mr. Fratoni. It’s not silly at all; it’s something we need to figure out. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Any history of medical problems – anything at all that I should know about?
PATIENT: Well… my wife, bless her heart, she passed away about a year ago. Car accident. That’s been…rough, obviously. But as for actual medical stuff… nothin' major. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but it healed fine. And I had the flu a couple times, like everyone does. I haven’t really been to a doctor much, to be honest. I usually just tough things out. I'm not insured, so…I try to avoid it when I can.
DOCTOR: I see. I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Fratoni. That's a significant thing to go through. And I understand the issue with insurance. Let's see…any family history of anything like this – muscle problems, weakness, or things like arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom, she had bad knees when she got older, real bad arthritis. Needed a couple replacements. And my grandpa… he kinda just slowed down when he got old, real achy all over. But I don’t know if that’s the same kinda thing. They weren’t oil field workers, like me, so… different kinda wear and tear, I guess. I don’t really know much about their medical histories, to be honest. We didn't talk about that stuff much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothin' at all. I don't like takin' pills if I can help it. I drink water, try to eat okay… but that’s about it. I don't do any drugs or anything like that, either. Just kinda try to stay healthy the old fashioned way, ya know? Mostly just hard work and good sleep when I can get it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to have you sit here, and then I'd like you to stand up and sit back down a few times. I’ll be observing how you do it. Then, I'm going to check your reflexes and muscle strength. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. I figured you’d wanna take a look. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm ready when you are. Feels kinda silly bein' examined for gettin' outta a chair, but… here we go.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, just stand up and sit back down five times for me, at your normal pace. I’ll be watching. …Okay. Hmm. That’s…not as fluid as I’d like to see. Noticeable effort, and a bit of a slow start each time. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please lie back on the exam table. I’ll start with your knees.
PATIENT: Okay, done. It’s… definitely easier doin’ it when I know I’m bein’ watched, not gonna lie. Feels a little less…stubborn. Knees, you said? Go ahead. I’m not good with medical stuff, so just let me know if somethin’ feels weird.
DOCTOR: Okay… reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, that’s normal. Now I'm going to test your strength. Can you push your leg against my hand?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Here we go. Is that enough? I can push harder if you need me to. I'm pretty strong, usually. But like I said, it's this gettin' started that’s the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good, 5/5 strength in both legs. That's normal strength. Hmm… Now, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Sure. No problem. How’s that? Feels pretty normal, like I said. No trouble walkin' or anything. Just this gettin’ up is the tricky part. It’s like my legs are…hesitant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, Mr. Fratoni, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing something called “effortful rise syndrome.” It's where you have difficulty standing up from a seated position, not due to weakness, but because of how your brain signals your muscles. It's often seen in people who are physically active, and it can be aggravated by fatigue or stress. It's not usually a sign of a serious underlying condition, but we should rule a few things out to be certain. I'd like to order some basic blood work to check your vitamin D levels and rule out any thyroid issues. And, I may recommend a consultation with a neurologist just to get their opinion and rule out anything neurological. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Effortful rise syndrome… huh. Never heard of that. Sounds kinda weird, but… it kinda makes sense, actually. Brain signalin’ my muscles wrong. I have been more stressed lately, thinkin' about… well, everything. And work’s been busy. Blood work and a neurologist… yeah, that sounds good. Better safe than sorry, right? I don’t mind gettin’ poked if it helps figure things out. I just wanna get back to not feelin’ like an old man when I try to stand up. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. I'll have the nurse draw some blood before you leave. And I’ll send a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist I work with. His office will call you to schedule an appointment. It may be a few weeks out, as he's quite busy. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on stress reduction techniques – anything that helps you relax. And try to stay hydrated and get enough sleep. We can also discuss some simple exercises you can do to strengthen your leg muscles, but we'll hold off on that until after we get the blood work results and the neurologist’s opinion. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Stress reduction… yeah, I could definitely use some of that. Sleep’s been rough, too. Guess I should probably try harder on that front. Hmm… let me think. Is there anything I should avoid doing right now? Like, should I take it easy on the heavy lifting at work? I don't wanna make things worse. And… how long does all this usually take to figure out? I got bills to pay, you know? Can’t be off work for too long.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. For now, I wouldn’t necessarily say avoid heavy lifting altogether, but definitely listen to your body. If you notice it’s making things worse, then take it easy. Try to pace yourself and avoid straining. We want to rule out anything serious, and excessive strain could potentially exacerbate things, even if it’s unlikely. As for how long it’ll take, the blood work should come back within a few days. Getting an appointment with Dr. Ramirez could take a couple of weeks, as he’s quite busy. Once you see him, he’ll likely do some further testing, and it could take another week or two to get those results. So, realistically, it could be 4-6 weeks before we have a definitive answer. I can write you a note for work excusing you from any particularly strenuous tasks while we’re figuring this out. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Four to six weeks… that’s… not ideal, but I guess it is what it is. Gotta get it figured out eventually. A note for work would be really helpful, actually. They don’t always understand when I say I'm not feelin' 100%. Something official would probably go a long way. I appreciate that. Is there anything else I should be lookin' out for? Any symptoms that mean I should call you right away? Just wanna make sure I'm not missin' somethin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll get that note written up for you right away. As for things to look out for, if you experience any of the following, please call me immediately: sudden weakness in your legs, difficulty walking, loss of bladder or bowel control, or severe pain in your back or legs. Those are signs that something more serious could be going on. Otherwise, just continue to listen to your body, focus on stress reduction, and get enough sleep. If your symptoms worsen or change in any way, don't hesitate to call. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Sudden weakness, trouble walkin', bladder problems… got it. Thank you, Doctor Fourney. You’ve been a big help. I appreciate you takin' the time to explain things and not just brush it off. I feel a lot better knowin' there’s a plan. I guess I’ll let the nurse draw some blood now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Fratoni. I'm glad I could help. And remember, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. The nurse will be right with you. Have a good day, and try to relax. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
