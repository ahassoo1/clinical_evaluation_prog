DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about my legs, really. They just… gave out, more or less. It started a few days ago, after I had a really nasty cold. Not that nasty, you understand, just a regular head cold, but now my legs feel like jelly. It’s quite inconvenient, I assure you. I’m a tour guide, you see. Can't very well show people around if I can't walk.
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly sounds troublesome, especially with your profession. "Gave out," you say... can you describe what that felt like exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, it wasn’t dramatic, Doctor, not like I collapsed in the street or anything. It was… gradual. I was walking, perfectly normally, and they just felt weaker and weaker. Like trying to wade through mud, almost. Then, suddenly, they wouldn't hold my weight anymore. I had to sit down. It's both legs, mind you, which is… unsettling. It's not like a pulled muscle or something. It's… even. And it hasn't gotten better, even with rest. I've been trying to take it easy, but it’s just… there.
DOCTOR: “Even,” you say…that is good to know. And it hasn't improved with rest. That’s important information. You mentioned having a cold recently. Did you notice any other symptoms with that cold?
PATIENT: Oh, the usual, really. Runny nose, sore throat, a bit of a cough. Nothing special. No fever, though, thankfully. I always get a terrible fever with a cold, so that was a nice change. I used some of those over-the-counter decongestants, you know, the ones with… pseudoephedrine, I think? They helped with the congestion, but they certainly didn’t prevent this leg business. And I made sure to drink plenty of fluids, as one should. I'm very careful about my health, Doctor. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Staying hydrated and taking care of yourself is always important. And you used pseudoephedrine... okay. Now, Ms. Firestone, can you tell me about any past medical problems you’ve had?
PATIENT: Well… let me see. I had my gallbladder removed years ago, when I was still living in Honduras. And…oh, a rather nasty bout of shingles a few years back, that was quite unpleasant. Other than that, nothing much. I’ve always been a pretty healthy person, Doctor. A little arthritis in my hands, perhaps, as one gets older, but nothing that requires regular treatment. And, you know, the usual female things. Nothing dramatic. I had all my vaccinations, of course, and I’m on Medicare now. I’m careful about those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, shingles, and some arthritis... I see those notes here. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications on a regular basis, besides those over-the-counter decongestants?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis medication, Doctor. It's… naproxen, I think. The little white pills. And a Vitamin D supplement, my daughter keeps reminding me to take. Says I don’t get enough sun. She worries too much, if you ask me. I take them religiously, though. She's a nurse, you know. So, I humour her. Otherwise, no. I'm not one for popping pills unless absolutely necessary. I prefer natural remedies when possible. Though, admittedly, a natural remedy isn't helping my legs at the moment.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m not particularly sensitive, I don't believe. Though… years ago, when I was a child, I think I broke out in a rash after eating some… mangoes, perhaps? But I’m not sure it was a proper allergy. It could have been the sun, or something else entirely. I wouldn't say I'm allergic to anything. Definitely not to any medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, Ms. Firestone, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your strength and reflexes, and to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand you need to see what's going on. Just don’t expect me to be doing any cartwheels, alright? I'm a tour guide, not an athlete. And please be gentle. I may be sturdy, but I’m not invincible. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly not expecting cartwheels. And I will be as gentle as possible. First, could you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: There we go. Not as nimble as I used to be, but I manage. Try not to poke too much, alright? And do tell me what you’re doing as you go. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. I'm just going to check your reflexes now. This might feel like a little tap. Okay... good reflexes here on the right, and… good reflexes on the left as well. They seem symmetrical. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? I don't want to break your hand, Doctor. I've always had a surprisingly strong grip, actually. It's useful when fending off overly aggressive souvenir vendors. So, how am I doing?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly sufficient. Excellent grip strength, indeed. Now, let's check your legs. I'm just going to ask you to push against my hand as I try to bend your knee. Just resist as much as you can. Okay... good. Now the other leg... and again. Hmm… the strength in both legs is a bit diminished, but again, fairly symmetrical. Not profoundly weak, but noticeably less than expected. Do you feel any pain when I do that?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Just… a bit of effort. It's like pushing against a heavy weight, more than anything. A bit of fatigue, perhaps? My legs do feel tired, even after resting. I'm not sure if that's normal or not. It’s difficult to say, really. I haven't done much strenuous activity lately, given…well, the leg problem. So, the fatigue could be a symptom, or it could just be lack of use. Is that making sense? I tend to overthink things sometimes.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Firestone. It's helpful to hear your observations. Alright, just a couple more things. Could you stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: There. A bit wobbly, perhaps. Don't mind my age showing. Now, what do you want me to do? Walk? Heel-to-toe? I'm ready when you are, Doctor. Just…go easy on me. It’s like trying to walk on marshmallows.
DOCTOR: Just a few steps, Ms. Firestone. That's all I need. And it's alright if you wobble. Okay… Just a few steps forward, then back. Hmm… Your gait is a little unsteady, as you said. It appears symmetrical, but there’s a slight weakness, and you're taking smaller steps than usual. No noticeable pain with walking, correct?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Just…effort. Like walking through thick mud, or trying to navigate a very steep incline. And a bit of…wobbliness. I suppose it's not surprising, given the circumstances. It feels…unnatural. I'm normally a very steady walker. Years of leading tours, you see. I need to be. Can’t very well show people around if I'm tripping over my own feet. It's quite embarrassing, honestly. So, what does this all mean? Is it something serious? Is it my age finally catching up with me? My daughter will have a field day with this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone, have a seat. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, several things could be causing this. The fact that it followed a cold is significant. It could be something called post-viral weakness. Sometimes, a viral illness can temporarily affect the nerves and muscles, causing weakness. We also have to consider other possibilities. Given your age, some arthritis is not unexpected, though I don’t think that’s the primary driver here. To rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some blood work. We'll check your vitamin levels, look for any signs of inflammation, and make sure everything else is normal. I'm also going to order a basic nerve conduction study, just to see how your nerves are functioning. It’s a simple test, doesn’t hurt much. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and a nerve study… Oh dear. Sounds…involved. But I suppose if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. My daughter would insist on it anyway. She's very thorough, you know. Just…please don't draw too much blood. I faint easily. And tell me… what will these tests actually show? Will they tell us definitively what’s wrong? Is it something I need to worry about? Will I be able to go back to work? I have a tour booked next week, and I really can't afford to cancel it. It's a very lucrative tour, and… well, I need the money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone. We won’t draw a lot of blood, I assure you. And the nerve conduction study is quite simple - it just involves some small electrical impulses, and shouldn’t be painful. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but not severe. As for what the tests will show... the blood work will give us a broad overview of your overall health and rule out things like vitamin deficiencies or inflammation. The nerve conduction study will assess how well your nerves are transmitting signals to your muscles. Together, these tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the underlying cause of your weakness. It's difficult to say definitively whether it's something to worry about at this stage. Post-viral weakness is often temporary and resolves on its own. But it's important to rule out other causes, just to be safe. As for going back to work… that depends on the results of the tests. If it is post-viral weakness, you may be able to return to work sooner rather than later. But if we find something else, we’ll need to develop a treatment plan. I’ll explain everything in detail once we have the results. I'm going to write you a referral for the blood work and the nerve conduction study. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions before I finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Just…please make sure they understand I’m not a fan of needles. And thank you. You've been very…thorough, and reassuring. It's always unsettling when your body decides to betray you, especially when you rely on it for a living. I suppose I should call my daughter and warn her about the results. She'll be wanting updates every five minutes, I'm sure. Alright, then. I’ll see you again once we have the results, I suppose. And please, remind me not to trip on the way out. That would be a disaster.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. I'll make a note about your aversion to needles, and I’ll emphasize that we want to be gentle. And don’t worry, we’ll take it slow. Here are the referrals. And please, take your time getting out. No need to rush. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Firestone. I hope you feel better soon. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your next appointment. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And hopefully, I won't need to come back again anytime soon. .
