DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. Started yesterday, and they’re still going strong. It's a bit silly, really, coming to a doctor for hiccups, but they’re quite persistent.
DOCTOR: Persistent hiccups can be bothersome, definitely not silly to get them checked out. Yesterday, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, yesterday. About midday, I think. I was having lunch – a bit of fish, actually – and hic – one just popped up! And then another, and another… They haven’t really let up since. It’s mostly just annoying, but it’s tiring, you know? Hic Sorry about that.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mirriam. We'll figure this out. So, just to clarify – they started during lunch yesterday while you were eating fish?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Right as I was taking a bite of the fish. It wasn’t anything special, just a normal fillet. I always get fish on a Tuesday, you see. Been doing that for years. Oh, and I had a glass of lemonade with it, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, fish and lemonade yesterday. Have you experienced hiccups like this before, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, I’ve had hiccups plenty of times! But usually they go away after a little bit – maybe a glass of water, or someone startling me. But these… these are different. They’re much more stubborn, and they’re happening so frequently. Hic See? It's relentless. I don't think I've ever had them last this long before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the hiccups, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I’ve been feeling perfectly fine otherwise. No pain anywhere, no trouble breathing, no dizziness… just these pesky hiccups. I’ve been a bit tired, now that you mention it, but that's probably just because they keep interrupting my sleep. Hic It's a bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms besides the tiredness and, of course, the hiccups. Do you have any trouble swallowing or any heartburn or indigestion?
PATIENT: No trouble swallowing at all, Doctor. And no heartburn or indigestion either. I have a pretty good stomach, usually. I eat pretty regularly, nothing too spicy or rich. I did feel a little bit of bloating yesterday afternoon, but I thought that was just from eating too much. Could that be connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: Possibly. Bloating could be related. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a little something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small dose, been on it for years. And I don’t have any allergies, no. No trouble with food or anything like that. I'm a pretty simple case, usually! Just these hiccups throwing me off.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure. And no allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam just to rule out anything obvious. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Hic Hopefully, you can figure out what’s going on with these things! They’re really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds good with your heart and lungs. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender when I press here, under your ribs. Not particularly worrying, but worth noting. Are you experiencing any pain specifically when I press there?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly where it feels a little… odd. Not sharp pain, just a bit of discomfort when you press. It's not constant, just when you poke around in there. Hic Oh, and now it feels a bit worse! Funny, isn’t it? I wonder if it's something I ate. But I can’t think of anything unusual.
DOCTOR: It's not unusual for palpation to temporarily worsen discomfort, Mirriam. And it's good you're thinking about what you ate. Given the tenderness and timing with lunch, it could be something gastrointestinal. Let’s run a quick blood test just to rule out anything else, and I think an upper abdominal ultrasound would be a good idea to take a look at your gallbladder and liver. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A blood test and an ultrasound… if that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgment. Hic Hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this soon! It’s just… a bit frustrating, you know? I haven't been this bothered by hiccups in decades.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. We'll get it sorted out. I’ll order the blood work now, and we can schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning. It's a non-invasive scan, nothing to worry about. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids. And if the hiccups become significantly worse or you develop any fever, nausea, or vomiting, please call the office immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very good, Doctor. Plenty of fluids, and call if things get worse. I'll definitely keep that in mind. Thank you for taking such good care of me. Hic I’m already feeling a little better just knowing we’re figuring things out. Do I need to do anything special before the blood test tomorrow? Like fast or anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. As for the blood test, yes, please fast for 8 hours beforehand – no food or drink except for water. We’ll send you a reminder text tonight with all the details. I'll also have my nurse schedule the ultrasound for you before you leave. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything perfectly, Doctor. Fasting for 8 hours, and the nurse will schedule the ultrasound. You’ve been very thorough. Hic I suppose I’ll just have to put up with these hiccups for a little while longer! But at least now I know we're on the right track. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburroough.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. Glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse come in to schedule that ultrasound for you now, and she'll go over the blood test instructions again to be sure everything is clear. In the meantime, try to relax and get some rest. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
