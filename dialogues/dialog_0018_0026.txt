DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s… it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it’s like… like someone’s drained all the life right out of me. I don’t even have the energy to… well, you know. It’s just… exhausting. And the young man at the lab said something about… creatine… something? I don’t keep up with these things. My husband, he tries to explain, but… honestly, it just goes in one ear and out the other.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Oitker. That sounds very frustrating. Fatigue can be quite debilitating. And it’s perfectly alright not to keep up with lab results – that’s what I’m here for. You mentioned the lab results included something about “creatine”?
PATIENT: Yes, creatine…kinase, I think he said. Sounded very important, the way he was going on about it. But honestly, I’ve been diving for… well, a long time. Muscles get tired, don't they? It’s part of the job. I don't see what all the fuss is about. My husband keeps saying it’s different this time, but… men always worry too much, don't they? It’s probably just a bit of a slump. I’ve had worse.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re so active, Ms. Oitker. Staying engaged is wonderful. However, you’re right to question it if it feels different this time. Creatine kinase is something we need to investigate further. It’s an enzyme released when muscle tissue is damaged, and elevated levels can indicate various things. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. “Investigate”? Now you’re making me nervous. Well… it’s not like a normal tiredness, you see. It’s… deep. Like it’s in my bones. And it doesn’t go away with rest, not really. I can sleep for eight hours and still feel like I haven’t slept a wink. And… and my muscles ache. Not like after a good dive, a pleasant ache, but a… a dull, heavy ache. It's hard to explain. I try to keep busy, you know, around the house, but even simple things… like gardening… become a huge effort.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Oitker. That sounds significantly more concerning than simple fatigue, and the fact that it’s not relieved by rest is important. The bone-deep ache is particularly noteworthy. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a more detailed history. First, how long have you been experiencing this deep tiredness and muscle ache?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… well, it started gradually, I suppose. Maybe… six months ago? At first, I thought it was just getting older. You know, a bit of stiffness here and there. But it’s gotten steadily worse over the past few months. Definitely worse in the last… two, maybe three months. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. My husband says it’s been quite noticeable lately, that I’m slowing down. He’s always observing, that man. Always has been.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful that your husband has noticed, Ms. Oitker. It’s often good to have another perspective. And don’t worry about pinpointing an exact date – an approximate timeframe is perfectly fine. Now, besides the tiredness and muscle ache, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… Let me see. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit… clumsy, I suppose. Dropped a few things lately. Nothing major, just little things. And… and my skin feels a bit dry, I think. It’s hard to say, the weather has been so strange. And… oh! My urine has been… darker than usual, I noticed that this morning. Not alarmingly so, but definitely not its normal color. Is that important? I do drink a lot of water, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Oitker, all of those are important to note. The clumsiness, dry skin, and particularly the darker urine are things we need to investigate further. Dark urine can sometimes indicate dehydration, but it can also be a sign of other underlying issues. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no fever, no chills. Definitely no chills. I get cold easily, but that’s just old age, I expect. And… weight loss… well, I haven’t been trying to lose weight! But I haven’t been eating as much either, to be honest. Not because I don’t want to, but because… I just don’t have the appetite. Everything seems… tasteless, you know? And I’ve been feeling a bit… nauseous sometimes, especially in the mornings. Not enough to actually be sick, but just a queasy feeling.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Oitker. This is all very helpful. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, the doctor told me years ago I had slightly high blood pressure, but he put me on a little pill for it. I’ve been taking that ever since. And… and I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be thirty years ago now. Other than that… no, not really. I’ve always been a strong, healthy woman. I’ve always been able to take care of myself. My husband worries too much, honestly. He keeps suggesting all sorts of things are wrong with me.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’ve been managing your blood pressure, and it’s understandable your husband worries. Now, can you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. I just… I just take the little white pill every morning. I don't really pay attention to the name. My husband handles all the refills. He knows all those things. I just tell him when I'm running low. I'm not good with remembering names and numbers, never have been.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Oitker. We can easily look that up in your records. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or other substances?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've always been able to eat anything and everything. And I've never had a reaction to any medication. Never. I don't like taking pills anyway, so I try to avoid them whenever possible. My husband always jokes that I'm the healthiest 81-year-old he knows.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… Let me see. My mother… she lived to be 92, a very strong woman. She died of… well, just old age, I suppose. My father… he died younger, in his 70s, of a heart attack, I think. And… and my brother… he had some sort of trouble with his kidneys, I remember that. He was always sick.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Oitker. That’s helpful information. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, goodness no! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol. Never have. It’s bad for you, you know. And… and recreational drugs? Oh dear, no! I’m a respectable woman! I just… I enjoy a quiet life with my husband. We used to travel a lot, when we were younger, but now we mostly stay home and garden.
DOCTOR: That’s lovely. Now, let’s move on to a physical examination. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know? It makes me nervous. And I get cold easily, so please be gentle. My husband always says I’m too sensitive. But he’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Oitker. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll take everything slowly. <stage>I begin by checking her blood pressure. “158/92,” I say softly, making a note. “A little elevated, but not surprising given your reported history. Now, if you’ll please take a deep breath for me…” I proceed to listen to her heart and lungs with my stethoscope. “Heart sounds are regular, but a slightly weak S1. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s move to your abdomen.” I gently palpate her abdomen, starting in the upper quadrants. "Any tenderness here, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little tender, yes. Right… about there. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like a heavy feeling. It's been getting worse lately, especially after I eat. My husband says it’s probably just indigestion, but it doesn’t feel like indigestion. It feels… different. And… and I think I felt something hard there, a few days ago. But it might have just been my imagination.
DOCTOR: “I do feel some fullness in your right upper quadrant, Ms. Oitker, and it’s tender to the touch, as you mentioned. It’s important we investigate this further. Now, let's check your extremities for any swelling or changes in skin color." "Your skin is a little dry, which could be contributing to the fatigue. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes."
PATIENT: Oh… well, my husband always says I have soft hands. He likes to hold them. And yes, my skin has been dry lately. The weather has been so strange. And… and my reflexes… well, I’ve never been very quick. I always tripped over things when I was younger. My mother used to say I was all thumbs.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Oitker. Now, based on your history and the physical examination, I’m concerned about several possibilities. The fatigue, muscle ache, tenderness in your right upper quadrant, dark urine, and decreased reflexes are all concerning findings. Given your age and symptoms, we need to rule out several conditions. I’d like to order some blood work to assess your liver function, kidney function, and creatine kinase levels. We’ll also check your complete blood count to rule out anemia. Additionally, I recommend an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your liver, gallbladder, and other abdominal organs. Would you be agreeable to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… More tests. Well… if you think it’s necessary. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but I don’t want anything serious, do I? My husband will be glad you’re being thorough. He always says I should get everything checked out. But… will these tests take long? And will they be painful? I get nervous easily, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Oitker. We’ll take things one step at a time. The blood work is relatively quick – just a few vials of blood drawn from your arm. There will be a brief pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. The abdominal ultrasound is non-invasive – a technician will simply glide a probe over your abdomen to create images. It shouldn’t be painful either, but it may be slightly uncomfortable if your abdomen is tender. The results typically take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood now and schedule the ultrasound for you. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or difficulty breathing – please contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A few days… I suppose that’s not too long. And non-invasive… that sounds good. My husband will be relieved to hear that. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… please be gentle. And try to explain everything clearly. I don’t understand all those medical terms, you know. Perhaps I should have just stayed home and had a nice cup of tea. But I suppose it’s best to get it checked out. Thank you, doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Oitker. I will be as gentle and clear as possible. My goal is to make you feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. I'll personally review the results with you when they come back and explain everything in plain language. Let’s get the blood work started, and then my nurse will schedule your ultrasound. You’ve done the right thing by coming in today. We’ll figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better.
