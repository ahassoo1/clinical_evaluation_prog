DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I can’t seem to figure out why. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest. I haven’t changed my diet or exercise routine, and yet… here we are.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Selbitschka. Unexplained weight gain can certainly be unsettling. It’s good you’ve noticed this and are seeking answers. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask you a few questions. First, about how long have you been noticing this weight gain?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started, I believe, sometime in late February, perhaps early March. So, around five months now. It’s been… gradual, at first. Not a huge amount each week, but enough to notice my clothes fitting a little tighter. And now… well, now it’s quite noticeable. I keep expecting it to stop, but it hasn't.
DOCTOR: Okay, five months of gradual weight gain. That’s helpful. And you mentioned you haven’t changed your diet or exercise routine. Could you describe a typical day for me—what do you usually eat, and what kind of physical activity do you get?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, my husband and I, we usually have a simple breakfast – perhaps some toast with jam and a cup of tea. Lunch is often a sandwich, maybe ham and cheese, and a small salad. Dinner… that varies. Sometimes it’s soup, other times it’s a meat dish with potatoes and vegetables. We try to have a balanced meal. As for exercise… I do a bit of gardening. Not strenuous, but it keeps me moving. And I walk to the shops maybe three times a week. It's not a marathon, Doctor, but it’s something. I certainly haven't started less activity, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Ms. Selbitschka. It sounds like you maintain a reasonably active lifestyle and eat a fairly balanced diet. Let's explore this a little further. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think carefully. I have been… more tired lately, yes. Not debilitatingly so, but I find myself needing more naps, and I don't have the same energy I used to. And… I suppose my skin feels a little drier than usual. I’ve been using more lotion. Oh! And sometimes… my hands feel a bit cold, even when it's not particularly cold outside. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all relevant observations, Ms. Selbitschka. Increased fatigue, dry skin, and feeling cold—those can certainly be associated with various underlying conditions. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing major. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, all that. But as an adult, I’ve been remarkably healthy. I haven’t had any serious illnesses or surgeries. I do get occasional headaches, but nothing that over-the-counter pain relievers can’t handle. I’ve never been prescribed any regular medications, either. My husband, he… well, he has high blood pressure, but that’s his issue, not mine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No significant past medical history. And you're not currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, as I mentioned. I prefer to avoid medication if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! Though, I do sometimes get a bit of indigestion if I eat something too spicy, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, indigestion isn't an allergy. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—for example, diabetes, thyroid problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… well, my mother, she had some trouble with her thyroid when she was older. She needed medication for it, I believe. And my father, he developed diabetes later in life, as well. He was quite careful with his diet after that. My brother, he’s healthy as a horse, thankfully. No major health issues on his side. I suppose thyroid problems and diabetes are the most significant ones, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Selbitschka. A family history of thyroid problems and diabetes is important information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, we live a quiet life. My husband and I have been married for twenty-five years, and we enjoy spending time in our garden. We don't smoke, and we only drink alcohol occasionally – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. We don’t have any pets. We are not particularly stressed, I don't believe, though I do worry about my brother’s travels sometimes. He goes to rather remote places. That's about it, really. A rather uneventful life, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet and generally healthy lifestyle. That's good. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your thyroid gland. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I understand it’s necessary. I just… I do hope it’s nothing serious. I’d like to get back to my garden, if you don’t mind. It’s the best part of my day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Selbitschka. We'll take things one step at a time. If you could please have a seat on the examination table, we'll begin. Okay, your blood pressure is 135/85, which is a little elevated, but not significantly concerning. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. However, your thyroid gland feels slightly enlarged, and it’s a bit tender to the touch. And as I noted earlier, your weight is 83 kilograms and your height is 155 centimeters. This gives you a BMI of 34.5, which falls into the obese category. I think it would be prudent to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. We'll check your thyroid function, blood sugar levels, and a complete blood count. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Blood tests… well, if that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just… I’d like to know what’s causing this. It’s unsettling not knowing. So, yes, please, go ahead with the tests. When will I have the results? I hope it won't be too long. I have a few tomato plants that need tending to, you see. They're rather delicate.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Selbitschka, and I’ll do my best to expedite the process. The lab usually takes 2-3 business days to return the results. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, let's discuss some potential causes for your symptoms. Given your family history and the slight enlargement of your thyroid gland, hypothyroidism—an underactive thyroid—is a possibility. The blood tests will help us determine if that’s the case. It could also be something else, of course, but we need those results to have a clearer picture. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hypothyroidism… I’ve heard of that, I think. Is it… serious? And what are the symptoms, exactly? You mentioned weight gain and fatigue, but… are there others? I must admit, I’m rather worried now. And… if it is hypothyroidism, is it treatable? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I’ve never been particularly good with medical things. It all sounds so… complicated.
DOCTOR: You have every right to be concerned, Ms. Selbitschka, and you're not bothering me with questions at all. It's important to understand what's going on. Hypothyroidism, if left untreated, can lead to complications like high cholesterol and heart problems, but thankfully, it’s very treatable. As for symptoms, besides weight gain and fatigue, you might experience things like constipation, dry skin, feeling cold even when others don’t, muscle aches, and hair loss. Some people also experience depression or difficulty concentrating. It's important to remember that not everyone experiences all of these symptoms, and they can vary in severity. The good news is, treatment typically involves taking a synthetic thyroid hormone replacement pill daily. It's a very common medication, and most people feel much better once their hormone levels are normalized. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that does make sense. A pill… daily. That doesn’t sound too dreadful, honestly. Much better than… well, than more complicated things. And so, if the blood tests confirm it, that’s all I’d need to do? Take a pill? And… you said it was common. So, lots of people have this? That… that’s somewhat reassuring, if I’m honest. Knowing I wouldn't be alone. I suppose my tomato plants will have to wait a little longer, then. If I need to get medication, that is. Perhaps they'll be even bigger and juicier by the time I can attend to them properly. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I feel a little less anxious now, though I still look forward to those test results. Is there anything I should avoid doing while we wait? Any particular foods, or activities?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s a relief to know I’ve eased some of your anxiety. Yes, hypothyroidism is quite common, particularly in women. While we wait for the results, there’s no need to drastically change your lifestyle. I wouldn't restrict any particular foods. However, staying hydrated and getting moderate exercise—like your gardening—is always a good idea. Avoid strenuous activity if you're feeling particularly fatigued. We’ll monitor your symptoms and repeat the blood tests if needed to ensure you're on the right dosage of medication, should it be required. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve answered everything I was worried about, and you’ve been very kind and patient. I appreciate your taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I believe that’s all. I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse to contact me. Thank you again, Doctor Alanes. You've put my mind at ease. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before the results arrive. And do enjoy your gardening—and those tomatoes! Have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon.
