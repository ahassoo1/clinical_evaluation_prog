DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. My name is Dr. Yackey. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, is for the… the place. For old people? My husband, he think is time. I need paper, yes? To say I am okay for go there. Is good place, I think?
DOCTOR: Very well. So, your husband feels it's time for you to consider a… residential facility?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. He worry too much. I am okay! But he… he want me close. Is far from his house. He visit every day, but… is long drive for him. I just need the paper, yes? So he not worry so much.
DOCTOR: I see. So, to clarify, you are seeking documentation to support your husband's desire for you to enter assisted living?
PATIENT: No, no! Not… not his desire. He just… he worry. I am strong lady! I cook, I clean… I help in the garden. But is hard, yes? Sometimes I forget things. Small things. Like… what I eat for breakfast. Or… names. Not important names, just… people at the store. He just want me safe. And he worry if I fall.
DOCTOR: Right. And you're here because he's concerned about memory lapses and potential falls. Let’s try to be precise, Ms. Abdollahi. When did you first notice these… “small things” you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm… is hard to say. Maybe… six months? A little more? I think when the rainy season start. Everything is… cloudy then. Not just the sky, but… in my head too. But I still remember most things! I remember my children’s birthdays. I remember my husband's face. Important things, yes?
DOCTOR: Approximately six months. And these lapses...do they interfere with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Like… I try to make my special bread. The one with the cinnamon. But sometimes I forget the sugar! Or I put too much salt. My husband laugh. He say is still good, but… is not the same. And sometimes… I go to the store for milk, but forget the milk! Then I come home with… with bananas. He laugh again. Is not so funny for me!
DOCTOR: I see. So, occasional difficulty with recipes and minor forgetfulness. Have you experienced any falls, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: No, no falls. But… almost. One time, I was in the garden, picking the tomatoes. And the ground was wet. I… I wobble. My husband, he run and catch me. He say I was dizzy. But I just think I was tired. Is hot, you know? The sun. Very strong. He worry too much.
DOCTOR: And is this dizziness a frequent occurrence, or was it an isolated incident?
PATIENT: Hmm… not very frequent. Maybe two, three times in the last few months? Always when is very hot. Or… when I stand up too fast. Sometimes I feel a little… floaty. Like I am on a boat. But is not so bad. I just sit down for a minute and is okay. Not a big problem, Doctor. Really. Is just… getting old, I think. My mama, she was the same.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: Just the one. For my blood pressure. The little white pill. My doctor in town, she give it to me. I take it every morning. Is… amlodipine? I think that is the name. I have it with my water. Small pill, easy to remember. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not to pills, not to food, not to… anything! I eat everything. My husband, he try to make me eat more vegetables, but… I like everything. I am not picky. My mama always say I have a strong stomach. Is good thing, yes? I never get sick from food. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Abdollahi, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you might have?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My knees, they ache sometimes. Especially when is cold. And my back… is not so strong anymore. I used to carry heavy things, but not now. And… oh! My eyes. The doctor say I need glasses. I have them, but sometimes I forget to wear them. Is silly, I know. But everything is… blurry without them. Mostly far away things. And… I think that is all? I am old lady, Doctor. A little ache here, a little forgetful there. Is normal, yes?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s do a brief physical examination. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is okay. A little slow, maybe. But is okay. I used to walk faster, but… is hard now. The knees, you know?
DOCTOR: Steady but slightly slow gait. Mild instability noted. Please stop and turn around slowly. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Okay. I try, Doctor. Is… blurry. Even with my eyes. Maybe I need new glasses. Or… the light is too strong? Is a little bright in here. I am trying, Doctor. Really. But my eyes… they are not so good today.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit down, Ms. Abdollahi. I will now listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140 over 85. Now, regarding your request for documentation… based on my brief examination and your reported symptoms, I can state that you present with mild age-related cognitive decline and some balance issues. This does not necessarily preclude you from independent living, but further evaluation may be warranted.
PATIENT: Oh. Cognitive… what? Is that bad, Doctor? Independent… you mean, I can still live in my house? My husband, he just want me safe. But I want to stay in my house. Is my house. And the garden… I just planted the tomatoes. Is that mean I need to go to the… the place? With all the old people? But I am not that old!
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, please remain calm. "Cognitive decline" simply means some expected changes in memory and thinking that can occur with age. It does not necessarily mean you require immediate placement in a facility. However, given your concerns about balance and the reported forgetfulness, I recommend a neurological evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions. A physical therapist evaluation would also be beneficial to address the balance issues. We can proceed with those referrals, and I can provide documentation stating my findings and recommendations to your husband. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay. Neurological… that is a lot of words, Doctor. But… if it make my husband happy, is okay. And the physical… to make me not fall? Is good. Yes, that is good. Can you write the papers? So he not worry so much? He worry too much, you know. But is sweet. He just want me safe. You think is okay? If I go to these… evaluations? And still stay in my house?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Abdollahi. I believe that undergoing these evaluations is a prudent course of action. It will allow us to better assess your condition and ensure your continued safety and well-being. This note details my findings and recommendations for neurological and physical therapy evaluations. Please schedule those appointments at your convenience, and follow up with me in one month to discuss the results. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all. Thank you. You are very kind. And… thank you for not saying I am too old. My husband, he will be happy. I go now. Is… long drive. And I need to plant more tomatoes. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Abdollalli. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns.
