DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Vodzak, is it? Fancy name. Um, right. I need a letter. For a… a pet. They want a letter saying I’m allowed to have one. Something about rules, you know? Landlord stuff. Honestly, the whole thing is a bit ridiculous. I've always had pets.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Landlord requirements can sometimes be… particular. So, to clarify, you're requesting a letter stating you're a suitable pet owner, correct?
PATIENT: Suitable? Well, I should be. I mean, I've never had any trouble with animals before. Not that I remember, anyway. It's just… paperwork, isn't it? I don’t even know what they need me to prove. A good track record? Is that it? I haven’t lived in one place long enough to have a track record, probably. Honestly, the whole thing is a bother.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re feeling a bit frustrated with the process, and that’s perfectly understandable. We can certainly address this. To help me write the most effective letter for you, could you tell me a little more about the pet you're hoping to have?
PATIENT: A pet… hmm. It’s a… a dog. Yes, a dog. A small one. Not one of those huge, yappy things. A quiet one, I think. Or… maybe it was a fluffy one? Honestly, the details are a bit… hazy. I saw it online, and it just… looked like a nice dog. A good dog. It’s a rescue, I believe. That’s important, isn’t it? Rescuing is good. But what kind of dog… that’s slipping my mind. They send pictures, you know? Lots of pictures. It’s all a bit… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you haven’t fully finalized the adoption yet, and you're focusing on getting the letter approved first. That's perfectly alright. To help me assess your suitability as a pet owner, could you tell me about any previous experience you've had with dogs, or other pets?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Previous experience… well, there was… Buster. I think that was his name. A golden retriever. Very friendly. Licked a lot. My children loved him. Or… did I have a cat? A Siamese, perhaps? It was a long time ago, you see. Things get mixed up. I definitely remember… walking dogs. And feeding them. And… cleaning up after them. The usual things, I suppose. It was a normal childhood, really. Lots of animals. Or maybe it was my parents who had the animals? Ugh. This is useless, isn’t it? I can’t remember a single thing properly.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Wrye. Memory can be tricky, especially with things from the past. It sounds like you grew up around pets, which is a good start. Let's try a different approach. Are you currently experiencing any physical limitations or health concerns that might affect your ability to care for a dog, such as difficulty with walking, bending, or lifting?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Nothing like that. Perfectly fit and healthy, thank you very much. Maybe a bit of creaking in the knees sometimes, but who doesn’t? I walk every day. Well, not every day. When the weather’s nice. And I can lift things. Groceries, mostly. And… well, things. Honestly, I'm very capable. It’s just… the remembering part. All this paperwork and questions… it's just a waste of my time, really. I should be picking out a nice dog collar.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like you are physically able to care for a dog, and you’ve expressed a history of being around pets. However, because you mentioned some difficulty with remembering details, and given that this letter is to ensure responsible pet ownership, I'd like to briefly review your current lifestyle and support system. Do you have family or friends nearby who could assist you with pet care if you were to be unwell or away?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Support system… Well, my daughter lives a few cities over. She's very busy, you know. With her career and everything. Doesn't really have time to… pop over and walk a dog. And my son… he’s travelling. Always travelling. I mostly manage on my own, really. Always have. It's just… I'm used to things. I can handle things. I don't need anyone to help me. I just want this letter so I can get on with it! Is it really so difficult? They’re making such a fuss over nothing. A small, quiet dog! What could possibly go wrong? Honestly… it’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to get this letter quickly, Ms. Wrye. And I appreciate your honesty. However, responsible pet ownership requires a degree of preparedness for various scenarios. Given your description of living independently and limited nearby support, I have some concerns about your ability to consistently meet all of a dog’s needs, especially in unforeseen circumstances. To ensure the well-being of both you and the potential dog, I recommend a brief consultation with a social worker who can help assess your support network and potentially connect you with local resources. It's a standard precaution, and it would provide you with peace of mind and the dog with a secure and stable home. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A social worker?! Oh, absolutely not! Are you serious? I don’t need a social worker! I am perfectly capable of looking after myself, and a small dog! This is… insulting, frankly. I came here for a letter, not a… an evaluation! I’ve lived a long life, I’ve managed just fine. I don't need anyone poking around my personal life. No, thank you. I think I’ll just… go somewhere else. Somewhere that doesn't involve… this. It’s a simple letter, Doctor! Why is this so complicated? .
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Wrye, and I apologize if my suggestion caused offense. It was only meant as a precautionary measure to ensure a successful and happy pet ownership experience. However, given your strong objections and your clear statement of independence, I am unable to provide the letter you requested at this time. I wish you all the best in finding a suitable pet and a landlord who trusts your capabilities. Thank you for your time. .
