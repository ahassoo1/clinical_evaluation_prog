DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Stoffregen, yes. Hmm… what brings me in? It’s… well, it’s a bit tricky to explain. My water… it doesn't come out so easy anymore. Like it’s stuck. That’s what my husband says, anyway. He’s the one who made the appointment. I forget why it's a problem, but he seemed worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, you’re having some difficulty with urination – it’s not flowing as easily as it used to. And your husband is concerned. That’s good he’s paying attention. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I notice? That’s a hard one. It feels like… a long time now. Maybe a few months? Or was it last winter? Everything blurs together, you know? I just know it’s been getting harder lately. I have to… push a little. And sometimes it stops and starts. Does that make sense? I don’t remember it being this bad before.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like it's been a gradual change. A few months, getting worse lately, needing to push, and starting and stopping… okay. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, no. It's not sharp or anything. Sometimes a little… discomfort, maybe? Like a pressure, down low. But not burning. Definitely no burning. I do feel like I don’t empty my bladder all the way sometimes, though. Like there’s still some left in there. Is that… is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, no sharp pain, some pressure, and feeling like you don't fully empty your bladder. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about how often you’re going to the bathroom. Is it more frequent than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I've always gone a fair bit, you know? Old age and all that! But… I suppose I am going more often now. Especially at night. I wake up a couple of times to go. It’s a nuisance, really. My husband doesn’t mind too much, he just sleeps through it. But it’s tiring for me getting up and down. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so more frequent urination, especially at night, keeping you up. Now, I'm going to ask you a few general health questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any fevers, chills, or lower back pain recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no fevers that I know of. And no chills either. My husband would have noticed those. Lower back pain… sometimes, yes. Just a little ache. It comes and goes. It's probably just my old bones, you know? I've always had a bit of trouble with my back. It doesn't keep me up at night or anything. It's not bad pain. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know. Just trying to rule things out. Now, have you noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Changes in my… stool? Oh dear. You mean… when I go to the bathroom that way? Well, I… I suppose it's been a little softer lately. But I eat a lot of fruit, you know? I try to stay regular. Is that… is that a problem? I don't want to talk about this too much. It's a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Stoffregen, these are important questions and I understand it can be a little uncomfortable. Soft stools are not necessarily a problem, especially if you eat a lot of fruit. Okay. One last question for now, before we do a quick exam. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness no! I don't think so. I haven't seen any blood. If there was, I’d certainly know! That sounds… scary. I haven't seen any blood, Doctor. I hope I haven't. That must mean something serious, right?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t necessarily mean something serious, but it's good you haven't seen any. Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like you’ve been having some difficulty with urination – it’s slow, you have to push, you feel like you don’t empty completely, and you're going more often, especially at night. No pain, no fever, no chills, some lower back discomfort, and no blood in your urine. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a quick check of your reflexes. It won’t be uncomfortable. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Listening to my tummy and checking my reflexes? That sounds… okay. As long as it doesn't hurt. My husband always says I’m a bit of a worrier. He’s probably right. Go ahead, Doctor. I trust you. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay. Everything sounds normal in your abdomen. Your reflexes are a little slower than average, which is fairly common at your age. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam just to be thorough. I'll check your strength and sensation. Strength is good, sensation is intact. Overall, the neurological exam is normal. Now, I am going to do a quick digital rectal exam. I need to check your prostate. This will give me an idea of its size and texture. It can be uncomfortable, but it will be quick. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a… what did you say? A digital… rectal… exam? You want to… check my… I… I don’t know, Doctor. That sounds… awfully personal. Is it absolutely necessary? I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that. Perhaps my husband could… Is there another way? I really don't think I can…
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Stoffregen, and I absolutely respect your feelings. It is a personal exam, and I would never push you to do something you’re not comfortable with. The reason I suggested it is that prostate enlargement is a common cause of urinary symptoms in women, and it can help me understand what’s going on. However, it's not absolutely necessary at this stage. Given your discomfort, we can proceed without it for now. We can start with a urine sample to check for infection or other abnormalities. Then, I can order a bladder ultrasound, which is a non-invasive imaging test that can show the size of your bladder and check for any blockages. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… much better. A urine sample and a picture of my bladder? Yes, that I can do. No poking or prodding? That’s very kind of you, Doctor. I appreciate you understanding. A picture sounds… safe. And if the picture shows something wrong, then we can talk about it, right? No rushing into anything? Yes, a picture sounds wonderful. Let’s do that.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. A picture, or an ultrasound, as we call it, is a great first step. No rushing, and we’ll discuss the results thoroughly before making any decisions. Wonderful. I’ll have the nurse bring you a specimen cup. Just a small sample, about two ounces, and please try to catch mid-stream. I’ll also get the order in for the ultrasound. It can be scheduled at the clinic down the hall. While we wait for the nurse, can you tell me a little about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. My husband helps me with it, he keeps track. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when my joints are acting up. A yellow one, I believe. But that’s it, I think. Nothing else regular. He’s very good at remembering these things, my husband. I mostly just take what he gives me. I’m not very good with names, you see. Everything blurs together.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Stoffregen, it's common to have trouble remembering medication names. Don't worry about it. We can get a list of your medications from your husband if you'd like. That would be the most accurate way to ensure we have everything correct. In the meantime, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway. I used to get stung by bees when I was a little girl, but that didn’t bother me too much. Just a little swelling, nothing serious. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. My husband would have told me if I did, he’s very careful. I’m a pretty hardy woman, you see. Don't get sick very often.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Stoffregen. No known allergies, and you consider yourself generally healthy. The nurse should be here shortly with the specimen cup. Once you've collected your sample, just let me know, and I'll send it to the lab. Then we'll schedule that ultrasound and talk about the next steps. Do you have any questions for me right now before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Oh… Well… Will the picture… will it hurt? And… is this something serious? I just want to know… is it something to worry about? My husband tries to shield me from things, but I can tell he’s been a little concerned. I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid questions, Ms. Stoffregen, and I’m happy to address them. The ultrasound itself doesn’t hurt at all. It uses sound waves, like an echo, to create an image of your bladder. It’s completely non-invasive, and there’s no radiation involved. As for whether it’s something serious… it’s too early to say. Difficulty with urination can be caused by a lot of different things, some more serious than others. The ultrasound will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on so we can determine the best course of action. We'll take things one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything to you along the way. You’re not a burden at all, and I’m here to answer any questions you have. We’ll figure this out together. Here comes the nurse now, with the specimen cup. Don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I feel a little better now. I’ll just… go and do that, then. And let you know.
