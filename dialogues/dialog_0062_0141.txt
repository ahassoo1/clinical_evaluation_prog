DOCTOR: Hi Brendan, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It’s… this itching, really. It’s all over. Not like a rash, exactly, just… constant itchiness. Been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of constant itchiness. That does sound frustrating! Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn't seem to be worse in any one spot, it's pretty much everywhere. My arms, legs, back... even my scalp sometimes. And it doesn't really look like anything. No bumps, no redness, just… itchy skin. I tried some lotion, you know, the regular stuff, but that didn't really help. It's… hard to explain. It’s not like poison ivy or anything obvious.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it's generalized itchiness, no visible rash, and over-the-counter lotions aren't providing relief. That helps narrow things down. Is the itchiness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty constant, yeah. It’s not like it flares up and then goes away completely. It’ll maybe be a little less intense at night when I'm sleeping, but even then I find myself scratching sometimes. It's… always there, just at different levels. It's really distracting. I keep thinking I missed a bug bite somewhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistently present, maybe slightly less at night. And you’ve been looking for any signs of bites or other skin changes?
PATIENT: Yeah, I've been checking. I really have. I mean, I used to spend a lot of time outdoors with my wife, you know, hiking and stuff. So I’m pretty good at spotting ticks and mosquito bites. But there’s just nothing. No little red dots, no welts, no anything. Just… itchy skin. It’s weird, isn’t it? I even had my daughter look, and she said she didn’t see anything either. She’s a nurse, so she knows what she’s looking at.
DOCTOR: That’s good you and your daughter have been checking thoroughly, and especially helpful knowing she’s a nurse! Okay, so no visible skin changes, and the itch isn’t related to any obvious outdoor exposure. Let's talk about other things that might be causing this. Have you started any new soaps, detergents, or lotions recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I’ve been using the same laundry detergent for years, and I usually just stick to a basic, unscented soap. I did try a new hand cream a couple weeks ago, maybe around the time the itching started, but I stopped using it when I realized it didn’t seem to be helping. It was some fancy stuff my daughter gave me, something with shea butter or something. I doubt that’s it, though, since it didn’t really seem to cause the itch, it just didn’t do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a brief trial of a new hand cream, but it wasn't particularly helpful and you don’t think it's the culprit. That's good to know. Now, thinking a little more broadly… have you been more stressed lately?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. That… that’s a good question. Yes. Actually, yeah. My wife… she passed away six months ago. It’s been… hard. I'm trying to keep busy, you know, keep my mind occupied. But… it’s always there. The missing her, the… everything. I didn’t really connect it to the itching, but… maybe? It just started around that time, I suppose. I haven't been sleeping great either.
DOCTOR: I'm so very sorry for your loss, Brendan. It sounds like you’ve been through an incredibly difficult time. And you’re right, grief can absolutely manifest in physical ways, including skin symptoms like itching. Itching can also be a side effect of stress and changes in sleep patterns. So, that certainly fits. Before we jump to any conclusions though, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else that might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. I just want to figure out what's going on, you know? Physical exam sounds good. I mean, if it’s grief… well, that’s… a different problem to solve. But I want to be sure. So yes, please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could go ahead and get comfortable up there, that would be great. I’m just going to take a look at your skin, and listen to your heart and lungs. Nothing too invasive, just a general check. Alright, so I'm not seeing any obvious rash, hives, or lesions. Your skin is generally dry, but that could be from the winter months, or just naturally dry skin. No signs of insect bites or other external irritants. Heart and lungs sound clear. I don't notice anything else of concern physically. Given your history, and the absence of any physical findings, it sounds like this itching could be related to stress and grief, potentially exacerbated by sleep disturbance. However, to be completely thorough, I’d like to order some basic blood work. Just to rule out things like thyroid problems or other underlying medical conditions that can sometimes cause itching. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. Very reasonable. Blood work to be sure. That’s what I’d want, I guess. Just to be certain. I’m not opposed to it at all. I mean, if it’s just… grief, well, I guess I’ll have to figure that out on my own. But it’s good to rule things out. Yes, let’s do the blood work. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. And I completely understand wanting to rule things out. Okay, I'll order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will get you set up. It will just be a quick blood draw. In the meantime, while we're waiting for the results, there are a few things we can do to help manage the itching. I recommend continuing to use a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day. Avoid hot showers or baths, as they can dry out your skin. And if it's possible, try to incorporate some stress-reducing activities into your daily routine, such as gentle exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature. And… if you don't mind me saying so, it sounds like you’re going through a lot. Have you considered joining a grief support group?
PATIENT: That… that’s thoughtful of you. A grief support group. My daughter suggested something similar, actually. I haven't really… I haven't wanted to, to be honest. It feels… strange. Like admitting defeat, I guess. But… maybe. Maybe it wouldn't hurt. I'll think about it. The moisturizer and avoiding hot showers… I can definitely do that. I always liked a hot bath, but I can switch to lukewarm. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. Really. It’s… good to talk to someone who understands. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge grief, and there's absolutely no shame in seeking support. It's not admitting defeat, it’s recognizing that you don't have to go through this alone. Okay, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together, and discuss a more comprehensive plan. In the meantime, if the itching becomes severe, or you develop any other symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And remember, I'm here to support you in any way I can. Do you have any questions for me before I let you get going?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've covered everything. Really. Thank you again, Doctor DeCosta. You’ve put my mind at ease, even if we don’t know exactly what’s causing it yet. Knowing we’re looking into it… that helps. I think I’ll just… go wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. And please, take care of yourself, Brendan. I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results. .
