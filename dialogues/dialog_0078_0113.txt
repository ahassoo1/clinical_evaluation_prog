DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, hello Doctor. Solero, you said? Hmm. Well, it’s this… going to the bathroom. Too much. That’s what my wife, bless her heart, told me to come about. She says I’m going all the time. It's a nuisance, really. I don’t recall exactly when it started, just… always seems to be going. A man’s got things to do, you know? Not sit around all day…
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. It sounds quite disruptive to your daily life, and I appreciate your wife encouraging you to come in. Frequent urination can certainly be bothersome. When you say “all the time,” could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? What kind of detail? Is that… is that important? Well, I go… after I drink something, mostly. And… before I leave the house. And… sometimes in the middle of the night. It's not painful, mind you. Just… frequent. Like a leaky faucet, I suppose. Is that good enough detail for you, Doctor? It's just… bothersome, that’s all. A man needs his sleep!
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. So, it sounds like it’s triggered by drinking fluids, and it happens before you leave the house and sometimes wakes you up at night. You mentioned it’s not painful, which is good. About how much fluid would you say you drink in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, fluids… now there’s a question. I drink… coffee, mostly. Black, strong coffee. A couple of mugs in the morning, maybe one after lunch. And… water, I suppose. When my wife tells me to. She’s always fussing about staying hydrated. Hard to say exactly how much water. A glass or two? Maybe. I don’t keep track of these things. A man has more important things to worry about than counting glasses of water.
DOCTOR: I understand. Coffee can certainly contribute to increased urination, as it has a diuretic effect. And while staying hydrated is important, it sounds like you may be drinking a good amount of fluid overall. Now, besides the increased frequency, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well, I… I get up at night, like I said. And sometimes… sometimes it’s a little difficult to start going. Not painful, mind you, just… takes a moment. And I don’t… I don't feel like I empty everything, sometimes. But that could just be my age, you know? A man doesn't have the same control he used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Segretto. It's helpful to know about the difficulty starting and the feeling of incomplete emptying. Those are important details. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color and smell? Goodness, Doctor, are you asking me to inspect my urine? A man doesn’t spend that much time looking at… well, you know. It looks like… urine, mostly. Yellowish, I suppose. And it smells… like urine. I haven’t noticed anything unusual. My wife might notice these things, she's always observant. But I certainly haven’t been paying attention. It’s just… a waste product, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto. It's not something most people spend a lot of time thinking about. I just ask to rule out any potential issues. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any problems with your kidneys or prostate?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… that’s a long story. I had a bit of a cough a few years back, but that cleared up. My wife keeps telling me my blood pressure is a little high, but I feel fine. And… I think I had a prostate check once, a long time ago. The doctor said everything was… normal, I think. Honestly, I don’t remember the details. It was so long ago. I mostly try to stay active and eat reasonably well. I haven't been a fan of doctors, so I don't visit often.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you've been generally healthy and active. It’s also helpful to know about your wife mentioning your blood pressure. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. I take a little something for my knees, sometimes. They ache when the weather changes. And… I think my wife gives me something for my cholesterol, but honestly, I'm not sure. She manages all that. I just take the pills she gives me. I don't bother asking questions. She knows best. I'm not good with names or dosages, doctor. Just… a couple of little pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. It's good to know you are taking something for your knees and possibly cholesterol. Knowing what those medications are would be helpful, if possible. Perhaps your wife could let us know?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, she probably could. She keeps a list of everything. Honestly, doctor, she runs the whole show. I'll ask her when we get home. It's just… I don't like to bother her. She's always busy. Is there anything else? I feel like I'm being interrogated. All this questioning… a man just wants to get back to his farm.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm asking a lot of questions, Mr. Segretto. It's just important to get a complete picture of your health. Before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My father… he lived a long life, I think. Worked hard, like everyone else. My mother… she passed away when I was young. I don’t really remember much about her health. My brother… he had some heart trouble, I think. But honestly, doctor, I don’t pay much attention to family history. It's all a bit hazy, to be honest. Everyone gets something eventually. I’m not a fan of dwelling on things. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, Mr. Segretto, but I understand it’s not always easy to recall. Alright. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief abdominal exam. I’d also like to check your prostate, if that’s okay with you. That will give me a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Well… I suppose so. But I don’t like doctors poking around. And checking my prostate… is that really necessary? I’m not comfortable with that, to be honest. It’s… a sensitive area. Can't we just… skip that part? I came about the frequent urination, not to have a stranger examining… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Segretto. A digital rectal exam can be unpleasant, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel hesitant. However, it’s a very important part of evaluating men with urinary symptoms, as it allows me to assess the size and texture of your prostate gland. It's important to rule out any potential issues, such as an enlarged prostate, which is a common cause of frequent urination in men your age. If you’re truly uncomfortable with it, we can skip it for today. However, please understand that it may limit my ability to determine the cause of your symptoms and could require further testing, such as a PSA blood test or a referral to a urologist. Would you like to take a moment to consider it?
PATIENT: A urologist… That sounds… complicated. And expensive. Alright, alright. Do it quickly, please. And be gentle. I’m an old man, you know. And I don’t have all day. But… just the exam. No other tests, understand? I don’t want any blood work or anything else. Just a quick look, and then we’re done.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. We will just do the exam today. I will explain everything as I go and be as gentle as possible. Please lie on your side with your knees bent. I will need you to relax as much as possible. I’m palpating your prostate now. It feels… slightly enlarged, and a little bit firm, but no obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. The rectal walls are normal. Okay, that’s done. I apologize for any discomfort that caused. Now, based on your symptoms and the exam findings, it’s likely you have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is an enlargement of the prostate gland. This is common in men your age and can cause frequent urination, difficulty starting, and feeling like you don't empty your bladder completely. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Benign… what was that? BPH? Sounds serious. Enlargement… so my prostate is getting bigger? Is that… dangerous? Will I need surgery? I don't want any surgery, doctor. I'm too old for that. And… will this get worse? Will I be stuck going to the bathroom all the time? This is not what I signed up for. I just wanted someone to tell me why I'm going to the bathroom so much!
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Segretto. BPH, or benign prostatic hyperplasia, simply means your prostate gland is enlarged. It’s very common as men age, and it’s not cancer. “Benign” means it’s not harmful. While it can be bothersome, it's usually not dangerous, and many men can manage it effectively without surgery. It can get worse over time, but we can take steps to slow it down and alleviate your symptoms. There are several treatment options available, including lifestyle changes and medication. For now, I recommend the following: Limit fluid intake, especially before bedtime. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Double voiding - Try to empty your bladder completely each time you go. Pelvic floor exercises - These can help strengthen the muscles that support your bladder. I'm also going to prescribe a medication called tamsulosin. It’s an alpha-blocker that helps relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to see how you're doing and adjust your treatment plan if needed. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… medication… More pills. Just what I need. And Kegels? What are those? Is that going to involve… strange exercises? And tamsulosin… what are the side effects? Will it interact with my other pills? My wife handles all that, you see. I don't keep track of these things. This is a lot to take in, doctor. I just wanted a simple answer, not a whole new routine. Can’t we just… try ignoring it for a while? Maybe it will go away on its own?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Segretto. It's a lot to take in, and I apologize if I'm overwhelming you. Unfortunately, BPH rarely goes away on its own. Ignoring it could lead to more bothersome symptoms and, in some cases, complications. Kegels are simple exercises to strengthen the muscles in your pelvic floor. You can do them anywhere, anytime. I have a handout with instructions, and there are also plenty of videos online. They don’t involve any strange movements, I promise. Tamsulosin is generally well-tolerated, but common side effects can include dizziness, lightheadedness, and retrograde ejaculation – that means semen goes backward into your bladder instead of out during ejaculation. It doesn't harm you, it just feels different. It’s important to take it as prescribed and let me know if you experience any bothersome side effects. We can adjust the dose or try a different medication if needed. I understand your wife manages your medications, and that's perfectly fine. I’ll send a list of your new medication, including instructions and potential side effects, to her. It's always best to have someone keeping track of things. I’m happy to answer any further questions you have, and we can take things one step at a time. Before you leave, do you have any concerns about your ability to manage these changes, or would you like a referral to a specialist who can provide more in-depth guidance?
PATIENT: A specialist… No, no specialists. Too much hassle. I think… I think I can manage. With my wife’s help, of course. She’s the smart one. Lifestyle changes… pills… Kegels… it’s a lot. But… I suppose I have to try, right? So, just the pills, the handout, and… try not to drink too much coffee. Is that it? And… can you write down everything again, just in case? My memory isn’t what it used to be. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. We'll just focus on the medication, the lifestyle changes, and the handout. I'm happy to write everything down for you again. Here you go. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. And remember, we can adjust the treatment plan if needed. I’m glad I could help, and I appreciate your willingness to try these changes. Have a good day, Mr. Segretto, and please take care. I'll see you in a month.
PATIENT: .
