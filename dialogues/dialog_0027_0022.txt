DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Fazzina, you say? A nice name. Well... it's my tummy. It feels… big. And I don't want much to eat lately. Not like before. It just doesn’t… feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, "tummy feels big" and not much appetite. I see. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear... how long? That’s a tricky one. A few weeks, maybe? Or was it longer? Time… it goes so fast. It's hard to remember. I think... after the summer started, maybe? I had some nice tomatoes from the garden, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, "after the summer started" is helpful. So, a month or so. And has the feeling in your tummy changed at all during that time?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm... It’s just… fuller, I think. And sometimes a little… uncomfortable. Not painful, really. Just… heavy. Like I ate too much, but I haven't! It's a strange feeling. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Soila. “Fuller” and “heavy,” not painful, just uncomfortable. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel... what now? You mean... going to the bathroom? Oh. Well... not really. Everything seems… normal there. Maybe a little less than usual, now that I think about it. But I don't keep track of such things, you see. It's not something I worry about.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. “A little less than usual.” And have you had any nausea, vomiting, or fever at all?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. I feel warm sometimes, like anyone does. But no shaking chills or anything. And… vomiting? Oh my goodness, no. I haven't been sick to my stomach, thankfully. I don’t like being sick. Never have.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Oh dear, probably. My clothes feel a little loose, but I thought that was just… getting older, you see. I don’t weigh myself anymore. It just upsets me. I used to be very careful, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Well, let's just take a quick listen to your tummy and feel it a little bit, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… sensible. Are you sure you need to feel it? It's a bit embarrassing, you know. But if you think it's important… go ahead. Be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds, which is good. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your tummy here… and here… Any discomfort when I do this?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a little… tender, yes. Right there. Not painful, but… noticeable. Like a bruise, almost. Not a real bruise, but… you know. A sensitive spot. Be careful, please. It's a bit sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a bit of fullness in your lower abdomen. Not anything alarming, but enough to investigate a little further. Given your age and the mild tenderness, I’d like to order a simple blood test and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… a CT scan? Oh dear. What’s that for? Is something seriously wrong? I don't like being poked and prodded. And blood tests... I always bruise so easily. Will it hurt? What will it show?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Soila. A CT scan is just a special kind of X-ray that gives us a more detailed picture of what's going on inside your tummy. It helps us see if there's anything causing the fullness and tenderness. The blood test will give us some information about your overall health and rule out any infection. It won’t necessarily show anything is wrong, it just helps us understand what's causing your symptoms. As for pain, the CT scan might be a little uncomfortable lying still for a short time, and the blood test will be a quick pinch, just like always. We'll take things one step at a time. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… one step at a time, you say? Yes, please. Explain it again. About the picture machine… and the blood. I’m not very good with… medical things, you see. It all sounds so frightening. Will I have to drink anything awful? I hate those sweet liquids they give you sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. Let’s start with the CT scan. It’s a big machine, like a large doughnut, that takes pictures of the inside of your body. You'll lie down on a table that slides into the machine. It’s important to lie very still during the scan so the pictures are clear. You won’t feel anything during the scan itself. As for the liquid, sometimes we need people to drink something to help the pictures come out clearer, but in your case, I don’t think we’ll need anything like that. We’re just going to take a few images of your tummy. As for the blood test, it's just a small sample taken from your arm. It will help us see if there's any sign of inflammation or infection. It will only take a few minutes. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: A machine… like a doughnut. And no awful drinks? That's... better, yes. Much better. And just a little pinch for the blood? Alright. I suppose... I suppose I can do that. But promise me you'll tell me everything you find, Doctor. No secrets. And if it's something bad... well, I want to know. I'm an old woman, I’ve lived a long life. I want to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise, Soila. I will explain everything to you in as much detail as possible, no matter what we find. You deserve to know what’s going on, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you have. We'll schedule the blood test and CT scan for tomorrow morning. My nurse will give you instructions on how to prepare. Do you have any questions for me right now, before we finish?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning... alright. Hmm... no, I don’t think so. Just... thank you, Doctor. For being patient with an old woman who forgets things. And for promising to tell me everything. That makes me feel a little better. I suppose I'll go home now and… try not to worry too much. Is there anything you need from me before I leave? Perhaps a name for your nurse?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Soila. And don't worry, it's my job to be patient. My nurse’s name is Maria. She’ll call you this evening to confirm the appointment details. If anything changes or you start feeling worse, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Now, let me walk you to the front desk.
PATIENT: Oh, Maria. A nice name. I will remember that. Thank you, Doctor Fazzina. You’ve been very kind. I do appreciate your help. I think… I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. Maria will be in touch shortly. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and try to relax.
