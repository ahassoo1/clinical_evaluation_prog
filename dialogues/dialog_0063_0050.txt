DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise; my schedule is rather…full.
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this cough. Been… a long time now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Feels like something’s tickling my throat, but nothing is there, you know? It just… happens. Especially when the air is… dry. Or… maybe when it’s cold. I can’t quite remember. It’s been… a while.
DOCTOR: A “long time,” you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific…? Oh dear. That’s… hard. Let me think. It’s been… since my wife, I think. Before she… passed. So… a good few years, at least. Maybe five? Six? It comes and goes. Worse in the winter, I believe. But it’s… always there, a little bit. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… annoying. And… tiring, sometimes. I have to… stop and catch my breath. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Very well. And has anything, to your knowledge, made it worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse…? Hmm. Not that I recall. Though… the dust. There’s been more dust lately. From the… the old garage. I still tinker with things, you see. Old cars. Not as much as I used to, but… I keep busy. Maybe the dust bothers it. I don’t know. It’s hard to say. Everything feels… dusty these days, if I’m honest. Old age, I suppose. Does dust… do that? Make a cough worse? I'm really not sure.
DOCTOR: We'll get to the bottom of it. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… Well, I get… tired easily. But I'm ninety years old, Doctor. Everything takes more effort these days. I… sometimes feel a little short of breath, like I said. But that might be the cough. Oh! And… my appetite isn't what it used to be. But I don't really need much food anymore, do I? It's hard to tell what's normal and what's… the cough. Everything’s a little… mixed up these days. Does that… help? I apologize if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you have any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… night sweats…? Oh, no. Not that I’ve noticed. I haven’t been sick sick, you see. Just this… cough. I don’t sweat much at night, no. And I don't think I’ve lost weight. My clothes… feel the same. Though… my wife always said I was too skinny. Maybe I've lost a little weight, but I wouldn’t know. Honestly, Doctor, I'm just… tired of coughing. That's the biggest problem. It keeps me awake sometimes. And… it’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any history of lung problems?
PATIENT: Lung problems…? Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I don’t… recall. I worked in the garage for… well, for most of my life. Lots of fumes, I suppose. But I never smoked. My wife, bless her, she didn’t either. We were careful. I don’t think I ever had… pneumonia or anything like that. Just… the garage. Lots of dust. Is that… a lung problem? I really don't remember going to the doctor about my lungs specifically. It was a different time then, you know? You didn’t go to the doctor for every little thing.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Medications… no, not really. Just a little something for my… joints, sometimes. But I don’t take it every day. It doesn’t seem to help much anyway. Allergies… hmm. I used to be allergic to something when I was a boy, I think. Pollen, maybe? But I haven’t had any trouble with allergies in… decades. Nothing I can recall, at least. It's all a bit foggy these days, Doctor. Everything blends together.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a listen to your lungs. Please, take a deep breath for me. Alright… a little wheezing, but not unexpected given your age and… history. I’m not hearing anything particularly concerning at the moment.
PATIENT: Wheezing…? Oh. Is that bad? I thought it was just… the cough. I try to breathe deep, but… it’s hard sometimes. Feels like there’s a weight on my chest. Not a pain, exactly. Just… heavy. I suppose I should be surprised it hasn't been more serious after all these years. But I'm not a doctor, am I? What does "not concerning" mean, Doctor? Does it mean… I just need to live with it?
DOCTOR: It means, Mr. Pavlovic, that it's likely a chronic cough, exacerbated by age and possible environmental factors. We can try a bronchodilator inhaler to open your airways and a cough suppressant to manage the symptoms. I'll write you a prescription. If it worsens, or you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, you will need to return immediately. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: A bron… what-dilator? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And a cough… suppressant? Will that… stop the cough? Completely? I just… I don't want to be a bother. I just want to be able to breathe without… hacking. And I don’t have insurance, Doctor. Will this… cost a lot? I don’t want to be a burden. As for the "worsening," you said. What would that look like? I'm not good at telling things apart these days.
DOCTOR: The inhaler will help open your airways, making breathing easier. The suppressant will reduce the coughing reflex. As for cost… I can write you a prescription for a generic brand; that should be more affordable. As for worsening… if you find yourself breathless at rest, experiencing chest pain, or developing a fever over 100.4 Fahrenheit, seek immediate medical attention. And if it doesn’t improve after a week, then we may need to consider a chest X-ray. But let's not worry about that now. We will start with these medications and see how you respond. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Breathless… at rest? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good. A fever… yes, I understand. I try to take things easy, Doctor. Mostly just… sit and watch television. I don’t go out much anymore. But sitting still and being breathless… that sounds frightening. I… I think I understand. Generic… that’s good. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to see me, Doctor. I know you’re busy.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. Try to get some rest. And if anything changes, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Now, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Yes, rest. I’ll try. Thank you again, Doctor. And… goodbye to you too. I hope you have a good day. .
