DOCTOR: Hi Angelle, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Dr. Yoshino. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s be quick. I want a baby. A healthy baby. I'm… not getting any younger, and frankly, I’d like to avoid any… complications. I want to make sure everything is… working properly, before I even try. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely clear. That’s a very sensible approach, Angelle. Planning ahead is great. So, we're talking about preconception counseling – making sure you're in the best possible health before getting pregnant. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? Honestly, doctor, I don't spend my days charting… things. I know they happen. Regularly. Mostly. What exactly do you need to know? Is there some sort of quiz? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: No quiz, I promise! It's just helpful to get a general idea. Roughly how long is your typical cycle – from the start of one period to the start of the next?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Roughly… about a month. Give or take. Sometimes a little shorter, sometimes a bit longer. Like I said, mostly regular. I don't obsess over it. I run a business, you know. I fix bicycles, not… calendars. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: Okay, “about a month” is a good starting point. And you're very busy – I appreciate you making time for this. Have you been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Once. A long time ago. It didn't… work out. Let's just leave it at that. It’s not relevant. I don't want to rehash old history. It’s why I'm here now, to avoid a repeat performance. Do you need a list of medications I’ve taken? Because I can get one, but it'll take a while to dig through the paperwork.
DOCTOR: I understand, and we don’t need to rehash anything you’re not comfortable with. Knowing about past pregnancies can be helpful, but it's absolutely fine to move on if you'd rather. Let's talk about medications then. If it's not too much trouble, could you tell me what you're currently taking – even over-the-counter things or supplements?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not much. I take a multivitamin, sometimes. Just a standard one, from the drugstore. And when my knees act up – which is often, thanks to this ridiculous job – I take ibuprofen. But that's it. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. I'm not a fan of loading up on chemicals. Is that enough detail for you? I have a customer waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed – good to know. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Medical history. Is this going to take all day? Look, I've broken a few bones over the years – fixing those bicycles isn’t easy work – and I had my tonsils out as a child. And… I think I had the flu a couple of times. Other than that? Nothing major. I’m generally healthy. I eat… reasonably well. I'm not one of those people who lives on junk food. Is there a specific ailment you're fishing for? Because I really don’t see what this has to do with having a baby.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Angelle, and I'll try to be as efficient as possible. We're looking for anything that might affect a pregnancy, or be affected by a pregnancy. You mentioned broken bones – were those recent?
PATIENT: Recent? No. Years ago. One was when I was a teenager, falling off a… well, never mind. And the other was a few years back, when a bike slipped off the stand. Nothing serious, I healed perfectly fine. I’m strong. I have to be, with the work I do. Honestly, doctor, I feel like I’m being interrogated here. Are you doubting my ability to carry a baby because I fix bicycles?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Angelle! I apologize if I’m coming across that way. You are very strong, and I admire your work. I’m not doubting your ability at all. I’m simply trying to gather information to make sure we cover all bases. Let’s switch gears. How about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my father… well, he smoked. A lot. Both are gone now. And I honestly don't know much about what my grandparents had. We weren't a particularly close family. Is knowing about great-aunts who had… bunions important? Because I could probably dig up some information on that, but I fail to see the relevance. Really, Doctor, are you sure you’re not just trying to fill up your time?
DOCTOR: I understand. Knowing about high blood pressure in your mother is helpful information, thank you. And no, I’m not trying to fill time. High blood pressure can sometimes run in families, and it’s important to be aware of potential risks during pregnancy. Okay, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness no! Do I look like someone who would? I have a business to run. I need to be clear-headed. I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes – a small one – and that's it. And I certainly don't smoke. The thought of it! And drugs? Absolutely not. I have standards. Are we finally getting somewhere useful, or are we going to dredge up my childhood hobbies next?
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Angelle. A small glass of wine occasionally is fine. Okay, last few questions, and then we can move on to a physical exam. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Is this necessary? I came here to discuss having a baby, not… personal details. Do you need to know if I’m married? Because I’m divorced. And frankly, my personal life is none of your business. I'm here to ensure a healthy pregnancy, not to provide a biography. Let’s just say I’m… exploring options. Is that sufficient? And can we please move on to the physical exam? I have a customer waiting and frankly, this is becoming rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to feel that way, Angelle, and I apologize if my questions are making you uncomfortable. They’re standard for preconception counseling, but I should have explained why I’m asking. It helps assess potential risks and ensure the best possible outcome. We can skip any question you're not comfortable answering. It’s entirely your choice. Knowing if you're sexually active helps us discuss potential exposure to sexually transmitted infections, which can affect fertility and pregnancy. But if you'd prefer to skip that, we absolutely can. Shall we proceed with the physical exam?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. Let’s just get on with the exam. The sooner I’m out of here, the better. I have a business to run, and frankly, this interrogation is wasting my time. And if you’re going to ask any more… personal questions, I reserve the right to leave. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Angelle. No further personal questions, I promise. Okay, let’s start with your height and weight. And then we'll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. If you could step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Fine. 86 kilograms. There. Happy? And just so you know, it's mostly muscle. I lift heavy things all day. Now, can we please get this over with? I don’t enjoy being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: 86 kilograms – noted. And I believe you about the muscle! It takes strength to run a business and fix bicycles. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. It’s slightly elevated. And I’m just listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds clear. Do you have any pain or tenderness anywhere in your abdomen?
PATIENT: No. No pain. I occasionally get a twinge in my lower back from bending over the bicycles, but that's it. And frankly, doctor, you're being rather… rough. Are you a new doctor? You seem… inexperienced. And I really don’t have time for a trainee to practice on me. Just tell me if there's something wrong or not. I don’t need a detailed explanation of every organ you’re poking.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m being too rough, Angelle. I'm not a trainee – I've been practicing Internal Medicine for thirteen years, but I understand your discomfort. I’m simply trying to be thorough. I’ll be much more gentle. Alright, everything feels normal here. I'm just checking your thyroid now… and everything feels normal there as well. Okay, that completes the physical exam for now. I'd like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a few tests to screen for sexually transmitted infections, if you're comfortable with that. It'll give us a much better picture of your overall health. What do you think?
PATIENT: Blood work… Fine. Whatever. If it's absolutely necessary. But I want the results quickly. And I’m still not comfortable discussing any… sexually transmitted infections. I’m a divorced woman. I’m not promiscuous. That’s all you need to know. Just do the blood work and tell me if there's a problem. And can we please just skip the small talk? I have a customer waiting. And frankly, I’m starting to regret coming here at all.
DOCTOR: Understood, Angelle. No further questions. We’ll focus on the essential blood work – complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. And we’ll get the results back to you as quickly as possible – typically within 3-5 business days. I'll have my nurse draw the blood before you leave. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely none. Just tell me when I can expect the results. And please, no unsolicited advice. I've managed perfectly well on my own for fifty-one years, and I don't need a lecture. Is there anything else? Because if not, I’d really like to go. I have a bike to fix.
DOCTOR: No, that’s all for now. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to draw the blood. She'll explain the procedure. We’ll call you as soon as the results are back, and we can discuss them then. Thank you for coming in today, Angelle. And don't worry – we’ll get everything sorted out. .
PATIENT: .
