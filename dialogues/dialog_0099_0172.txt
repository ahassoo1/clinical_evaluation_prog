DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I suppose it's this…social healthcare visit. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Honestly, I don't recall what exactly needs doing. It's all rather…unnecessary, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right. A "social healthcare visit," as you put it. Well, even if you feel it's unnecessary, Medicare requires a check-up within the first few months of establishing care with a new primary physician. It's a formality, really. But it does allow me to get a baseline of your health. Let's start with the basics. Can you tell me a little about why you and your husband decided to move to this area?
PATIENT: Oh, my husband. He…he wanted “fresh air.” Something about the city being too “stifling.” Honestly, I preferred the city. Everything was there. Now it's just…fields. And quiet. Dreadfully quiet. It's all rather…late in life to be making such changes, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Fresh air, alright. Well, let’s focus on you for a moment, Candice. I see you’re 79 years old. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly before this?
PATIENT: Regularly? Oh, I suppose. When something was wrong, naturally. Not for…preventative measures. All this fuss about preventing things. Honestly, I've lived this long haven't I? Seems to me I'm doing alright.
DOCTOR: That's…a perspective. Still, it’s helpful to know what's been going on when something was wrong. Can you recall any significant illnesses or hospitalizations you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Goodness, that was…a long time ago. There was…something with my gallbladder, I think. And a touch of pneumonia once. But it was so long ago, and frankly, it wasn't very serious. I was back on my feet quickly. I really don't concern myself with the past, Doctor. It's…unproductive.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder issues and a previous bout of pneumonia. And you recovered well from both. Any surgeries that you can recall?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Oh, heavens no. I've always been very careful about my health. I don't go around doing…unnecessary things to my body. A bit of discomfort is a small price to pay for avoiding a surgeon’s knife, if you ask me. Honestly, all these procedures…it's just modern medicine gone mad.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Good to know. Let's talk about your family. Do you know if any of your close relatives have had any significant medical problems – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family. A complicated matter. My mother…she lived to a ripe old age, I believe. But she didn’t discuss her ailments, you see. A very private woman. My brother…well, he wasn't one for sharing either. Honestly, I don't see what my family's medical history has to do with my health.
DOCTOR: It can give us clues, Candice. Patterns, you see. But alright, we can move on. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, just a small thing. For my…nerves. A little something the previous doctor prescribed. Helps me sleep, mostly. Honestly, I don't believe in relying on pills for everything. A good cup of tea is far more effective, if you ask me. I don't recall the name of it, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. So something for your nerves, helps with sleep. We’ll try to get the name from your previous records. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve never been one for sensitivities. A little dust bothers me, perhaps, but that’s hardly an allergy. Honestly, people these days are so quick to label everything as an allergy. A bit of discomfort is part of life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright, Candice. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, things like that. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh, must we? Honestly, all this poking and prodding…I’ve never been fond of doctors’ examinations. Very undignified. But…fine. Get it over with, I suppose. But do be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back, and I’ll start with your blood pressure. 140/85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Not immediately concerning, but we’ll want to monitor it. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but there's a slight decrease in breath sounds at the bases. Do you experience any shortness of breath, Candice?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Oh, hardly. Perhaps a little winded after climbing stairs, but that’s to be expected at my age, isn’t it? Honestly, I’ve never been one for strenuous activity. I prefer a quiet afternoon with a good book, thank you very much. All this fuss about breath sounds…it’s simply unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Slight decrease in breath sounds, occasional shortness of breath with exertion. Alright. Now, let's just check your reflexes and a quick neurological exam. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Can you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your vision or memory recently?
PATIENT: Memory? Oh, goodness. What doesn’t one forget at my age? I can't recall what I had for breakfast yesterday, let alone anything more significant. As for my vision...it's a little blurry sometimes, but I manage. Honestly, it's not something I dwell on. I have my routines, you see. I don’t need to remember everything perfectly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. So, to summarize, you’re 79 years old, recently moved to the area, no significant past medical history, no surgeries, limited family history available, taking something for nerves/sleep , no known allergies. Exam revealed slightly elevated blood pressure, a slight heart murmur, diminished reflexes, and some reported blurry vision and memory issues. Based on this initial assessment, I recommend a few things. First, we should try to get a list of all your medications and dosages. Second, a basic blood work panel to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. And third, a more thorough eye exam with an optometrist to assess your vision. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More appointments. Honestly, it’s all rather…exhausting. Fine. Do what you must. But I assure you, I’m perfectly fine. A waste of time, if you ask me. Just get it over with, and let me return to my quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. I'll get the orders for the blood work and provide you with a referral to a local optometrist. I’ll also have the nurse draw up a list of some resources for seniors in the area – support groups, social activities, things like that. I understand you may feel this is unnecessary, but it’s important to establish a baseline and monitor any potential changes. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Honestly, I’ve wasted enough time here already. Just…get it over with. And please, don’t bother me with unnecessary phone calls. I have my routines, you see. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Candice. Have a good day. The nurse will escort you to the lab and provide you with the referral information. .
