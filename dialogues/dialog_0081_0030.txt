DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, honestly. I've noticed a change in how I smell, my body odor. It's...different. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's not right. It just doesn’t smell like me, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly reasonable to seek medical attention for a change in body odor. It's good you're addressing it. "Not smelling like yourself," you say. Can you describe this change more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It's not bad, exactly. It's just...sweeter, I think. A little bit like… maybe fruit? It’s hard to explain. And it seems to be getting stronger, even with regular showering and everything. It used to be… just a normal body smell, if that makes any sense. I work hard, laying floors all day, so I expect to smell like something, but this is different.
DOCTOR: Sweeter, you say. And getting progressively stronger despite consistent hygiene. Interesting. Now, this is important: have you noticed this change coinciding with any other changes in your health, diet, or medications?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I did start taking a new vitamin a few months ago. It’s one of those multi-vitamins for women over 40, you know, with all the extra things in it. Can’t remember the exact name off the top of my head, but I got it at the pharmacy. And… no, nothing else really. My diet hasn’t changed, and I haven't started any other medications. Oh! Except, I did have a really bad cold back in March, but I’m completely over that now. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: The multivitamin is worth noting, and the recent cold is potentially relevant as well. Could you tell me a bit more about the cold?
PATIENT: It was just a really bad one, you know? Stuffy nose, sore throat, the whole nine yards. I was in bed for almost a week with it. I didn't go to the doctor for it, though. Just took over-the-counter stuff – lots of decongestants and cough syrup. It cleared up on its own eventually, thankfully. But it was the worst cold I've had in years. And it did linger for a little while, even after I started feeling better, a cough here and there for a few weeks.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while a few years back, but it went down with diet and exercise. The doctor took me off the medication for it about five years ago. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy when I was 42. But that was a long time ago, and I've had regular check-ups since then, everything's always been fine. Aside from that, I'm pretty healthy, honestly. I try to be, anyway. This whole smell thing is really throwing me off.
DOCTOR: A hysterectomy… and high blood pressure that resolved with lifestyle changes. Noted. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. My mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. And her mother, my grandmother, also had it. On my father's side, I think his brother had heart problems, but he didn't take care of himself, always smoking and drinking. Nothing else really stands out. We weren't a big family for talking about health stuff, if I'm honest. Mostly just kept things to ourselves. It's hard to remember everything, you know? I was pretty young when a lot of that happened.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. Definitely not regularly. And I absolutely do not use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I’m a working woman, Doctor, I need a clear head! I lay floors for a living, it's physical work, you gotta be sharp. And honestly, I don't have time for any of that. I have to get back to work, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Purtee, given your history, and this… unusual change in body odor, I think it's prudent to rule out a few possibilities. Although it could be something benign, we need to investigate. I'm going to perform a physical exam, and then I’d like to order some blood work, including a glucose level and a thyroid panel. We'll also check for ketones in your urine. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I mean, I just want to know what’s going on. It's unsettling, not smelling like myself. So, blood work and a physical exam. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know what I need to do. Is there anything I should avoid before the blood work? Like, do I need to fast?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours prior to the blood draw. That means no food or drinks other than water. And please bring a list of any supplements or vitamins you are currently taking, even if you’ve already mentioned them. Now, if you'll please follow me, we can begin the physical exam. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and check your reflexes. It’s fairly routine, but it will give us a baseline to work with. Please undress from the waist up, and I'll return shortly.
PATIENT: Okay, eight hours fasting and bring my vitamin list. Got it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking this seriously. It's just… weird, you know? I'll just… get changed.
DOCTOR: Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but not significantly. No palpable nodules. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no organomegaly. Skin is warm and dry. Now, please lie back. I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Alright. That concludes the physical examination for now. I’ll have the lab order sent to the lab now. Do you know how to access the patient portal to view results?
PATIENT: Okay. Everything sounded… normal, I guess? It's good to hear. No, I don't know how to access the patient portal. I'm not very good with computers, to be honest. I usually just get a call when something's ready. Could someone call me when the results are back? I don't want to have to bother anyone figuring out a website, if that's okay. I'm pretty busy with work. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist can assist you with a call when the results are available. It's preferable to use the portal, but I understand your preference. I’ll interpret the results when they come back and contact you directly with any significant findings and further recommendations. In the meantime, continue to monitor the change in odor. If it becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms – fatigue, weight loss, increased thirst – please contact the office immediately. I’m going to order a urinalysis as well, just for a comprehensive look. That is all for now, Ms. Purtee. I will be in touch. Have a good day.
