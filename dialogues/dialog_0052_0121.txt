DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pipolo is the name. Just... my eyes feel scratchy. Real scratchy. Been that way a bit now. Don't like it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Scratchy eyes. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Pipolo?
PATIENT: Hmm... a while. Maybe... two, three months now? Hard to say exactly. Time goes quick when you get old, you know? It's not always scratchy, just... often enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: I quite agree, time does seem to accelerate. And you said it’s not constant, but frequent enough to be bothersome. Are there any specific times of day it’s worse, or anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well... seems worse when it's windy. We get a lot of wind where I live, near the water. And... when I'm workin', maybe? Lots of dust with the cement, you know. Makes it real bad. Doesn't get much better, to be honest. I just try to blink it away.
DOCTOR: So, it’s exacerbated by wind and dust, particularly when you are working with cement. And blinking provides minimal relief. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the scratchiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think... Sometimes my eyes feel like there's somethin' in 'em, even when there isn't. And... blurry sometimes. Not all the time, just now and then. Mostly when I've been workin' a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a foreign body sensation, even when nothing is present, and intermittent blurry vision, particularly after prolonged work. Have you noticed any redness, discharge, or pain in either eye?
PATIENT: Redness... not really. Maybe a little, but I don't think so. No... no discharge. No pain, no. Just... uncomfortable. Like sand. That's the best way to describe it. And it's both eyes. Both of 'em feel like sand.
DOCTOR: Both eyes, feeling like sand, no redness, discharge, or pain. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as allergies, dry eye, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies... not that I know of. Never been told I had any. Dry eye... well, I feel dry, but I always figured that was just gettin' old. Never been to a doctor about it, never been told I had dry eye. Other than that... just the usual aches and pains for an old man.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or diagnosed dry eye. And you mentioned aches and pains, which is common with age. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or eye drops?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take nothin'. Never been one for pills. Tried some eye drops once, a long time ago, but didn't seem to help much. Just made my eyes sting. So, stopped usin' 'em.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications currently, and you had a negative experience with eye drops in the past. Now, regarding your work with cement – do you wear any eye protection while you're working?
PATIENT: Eye protection? Not usually. Been doin' it too long, you know? Always been careful. Dust just... comes with the job. I try to blink it away. It's not ideal, I know.
DOCTOR: I understand you've been doing this for a long time, but even with carefulness, cement dust can cause significant irritation and damage to the eyes. Now, let's perform a quick examination of your eyes to better understand what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Examination sounds good. Better to know, I guess. Though I don't expect it's good news. Always somethin' breakin' down when you get old. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very good. I'll start with a visual acuity test. Could you please read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Alright. Let's see... E... F... P... T... Okay.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. I do see some mild injection – redness – in both eyes, although it's not severe. Now, I'm going to gently evert your upper eyelids to check for any foreign bodies or damage to the conjunctiva. This might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. I don’t see any obvious foreign bodies, but there is some mild inflammation of the conjunctiva in both eyes. There appears to be some dryness as well. It's consistent with chronic irritation, potentially from dust exposure.
PATIENT: Consistent with chronic irritation, huh? Sounds about right. Dust, wind... never been good to my eyes. So, what does that mean? What can I do about it? I don't want to stop workin', you know?
DOCTOR: It means that the prolonged exposure to dust and wind has likely caused some irritation and inflammation of the surface of your eyes. The good news is that this is often manageable. Stopping work isn't necessarily the answer. First, and most importantly, we need to protect your eyes from further irritation. I strongly recommend wearing safety glasses with side shields at all times when you're working with cement, even if you’ve been doing it for years. I’d also recommend using artificial tears – lubricating eye drops – several times a day, even when you're not actively experiencing symptoms. There are many over-the-counter options available. I can recommend a brand if you’d like. Finally, we could consider a short course of topical anti-inflammatory eye drops to help reduce the inflammation. However, given your prior experience with stinging, we’ll start with the safety glasses and artificial tears and see if that provides sufficient relief. If those aren’t enough, we can discuss the possibility of a mild steroid eye drop. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Safety glasses... yeah, I should probably do that. Been puttin' it off too long. And the drops... alright, I can try those. No stingin', though, you hear? No stingin'. If that doesn’t work... well, I don't want no more drops. Just tell me I gotta quit workin', if that's what it comes to.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll start with the safety glasses and lubricating drops, and if you experience any stinging with the drops, we will stop immediately. We’ll avoid anything that causes discomfort. And we certainly won't jump to the conclusion of quitting work without exploring all other options first. I'm going to write you a prescription for a bottle of Systane Ultra lubricating eye drops. These are generally well-tolerated. I’ll also give you a written instruction sheet outlining the importance of eye protection and proper drop administration. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Systane Ultra... okay. Written instructions... good. Less for me to forget. Hmm... No, I think that covers it. Just... safety glasses and drops. And no stingin'. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you lookin' at 'em.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pipolo. It was my pleasure. Please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you experience any issues or have any questions after you’ve started using the drops. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your progress. And remember, consistent eye protection is key. Take care, and have a good day.
PATIENT: Alright. Two weeks... I'll remember that. And I'll try to get them glasses. Thank you again, Doctor. You too. .
