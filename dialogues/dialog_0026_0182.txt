DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, let’s get on with it. My…daughter scheduled this. Something about needing a check-up before I get a little…work done. Honestly, I don’t see what the fuss is about, but here I am. Just want to be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Your daughter is very thoughtful to make sure you’re all set before any procedures. We’ll certainly try to be efficient. “Work done,” you said… is that a scheduled surgery, or something else?
PATIENT: Surgery. Facelift. Not that I need one, mind you. Just…loosening things up a bit. Getting a bit of a sag, you understand. It’s the genetics, I tell you. My mother looked ten years younger than her actual age, right up until the end. But, yes. Facelift. Now, are we done with pleasantries? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. A facelift, good for you! It’s wonderful you’re taking care of yourself. We just want to make sure you’re in optimal health for the procedure. Before we proceed, I’d like to gather a little more information, if you don’t mind. It helps us ensure everything goes smoothly. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Honestly, I’m eighty-one years old! What do you expect? A little arthritis, maybe. Nothing a good soak in a hot tub can’t fix. And my blood pressure… well, it fluctuates. Mostly when my daughter starts talking about “sensible shoes.” Other than that, I’m as fit as a fiddle. A slightly older fiddle, perhaps, but a fiddle nonetheless. Don’t need to write a novel about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. “Slightly older fiddle” is a perfect description! Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with anything more significant, like heart problems, diabetes, or lung issues?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Now you're fishing. No, no heart problems. My father lived to be ninety-five, heart as strong as an ox. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I enjoy a good piece of lefse now and then, but I’m not a sugar fiend. Lung issues… smoked a pipe for a while, back in the war. Quit decades ago. Haven't had a cough since. Really, doctor, I'm a remarkably healthy man for my age. Can we move this along? I really don't enjoy rehashing my entire medical history.
DOCTOR: I certainly believe you, Mr. Orwin. And I apologize for taking up your time. Just a few more quick questions, then we can move on. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Appendicitis when I was a boy. A rather nasty affair, I recall. And a hernia repair…oh, must have been thirty years ago. Nothing since then. Small procedures, really. Nothing like this facelift business. Is that all? I feel like I'm giving away state secrets here.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and hernia repair. Thank you. And just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for the arthritis, occasionally. Ibuprofen. When it flares up. And a multivitamin. My daughter insists. Keeps telling me I'm not getting enough…something. Honestly, I barely pay attention. Is that what you need to know? Don’t want to bore you with details about the brand names. It’s all the same stuff in a different bottle, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I've eaten everything put in front of me. Grew up on a farm, you know. Exposure to everything. Dust, pollen, animals… built up an immunity to it all. Never had a reaction to anything. Absolutely none. Now, are we finished with this interrogation? I can practically feel my lunch getting cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Excellent. Just a few more questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Did your parents or siblings have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, here we go again. Family history. Well, my father lived to ninety-five, as I mentioned, strong as an ox until the very end. Mother… she had a bit of a weak heart in her later years, I suppose. But she lived a full life. My brother…he had high blood pressure, I think. Nothing dramatic. They were…sturdy people, mostly. Not prone to ailments. Honestly, I don't recall anything particularly noteworthy. Are we nearly done? This is becoming tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little heart trouble with your mother and high blood pressure with your brother. Thank you. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just a routine check to make sure everything is as it should be. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Look, I came here for a clearance, not a full medical overhaul. But fine. Get it over with. Just…be quick about it. I have a very important lunch appointment, and I don’t appreciate wasting my time. And please, try not to poke around too much. I’m an old man.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. I’ll be as efficient and gentle as possible. Alright, your blood pressure is 145 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given what you mentioned earlier. Heart sounds… a slight murmur, but nothing alarming, likely age-related. I’m listening to your lungs now. Sounds clear and even on both sides. Ears look good, no signs of infection. Throat is clear as well. Everything seems generally good, Mr. Orwin, but the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should discuss with your primary care physician after this visit.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure? Honestly. I told you it fluctuates. It's the stress of dealing with my daughter. Now, can we finally get to the clearance? I need a written confirmation that I’m fit enough to go through with this facelift. The sooner I get that, the sooner I can enjoy a nice, quiet lunch. And please, don’t try to lecture me about sensible shoes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I understand your frustration. Based on my examination today, and with the understanding that your blood pressure can fluctuate, I can provide a clearance for your scheduled facelift. However, I will include a recommendation in the note that you follow up with your primary care physician to monitor your blood pressure. Here is the clearance form. It outlines my findings and the recommendation. I’ll also send a copy to your surgeon’s office. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Looks… acceptable. Yes, alright. Good. Finally. No, I don’t have any questions. Just get me out of here. And remind your staff not to mention my blood pressure to my daughter. Honestly, the woman… Thank you… I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a lunch appointment to get to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. I will certainly make a note of your request regarding your daughter. I wish you a pleasant lunch and a smooth recovery from your surgery. It was a pleasure meeting you.
