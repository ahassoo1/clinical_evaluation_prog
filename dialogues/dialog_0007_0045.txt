DOCTOR: Hi Enrique, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I… well, my face gets very red. Like, flushing. It happens sometimes. Not always, you know? It's a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing – redness in the face that comes and goes. I understand that can be unsettling. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That's a good question. It's hard to say exactly. Sometimes when I’m talking to people. Not always, though. And sometimes… maybe after I eat? Spicy food, maybe? I don’t really keep track, sorry. It just… happens. I don't know why it happens. It’s been a few weeks now, I think.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Enrique. It’s helpful just knowing it’s been a few weeks. So, it seems to be triggered by social situations and possibly certain foods – spicy food in particular. Does it happen with all spicy food, or just some?
PATIENT: Oh. Just some, I think. Not the very mild stuff. Like… a really hot curry, maybe? Or if someone puts a lot of pepper on my plate. Not with… I don't know… with a little bit of chili powder. It's strange. And it’s not always after spicy food either. Sometimes I eat really hot food and nothing happens. It's very confusing.
DOCTOR: Right, so it’s not a consistent reaction to spicy food. That is useful information. And you mentioned it happens when talking to people – can you describe what that feels like emotionally when it occurs?
PATIENT: Emotionally? Hmm… I don’t know. I don’t get scared, not really. Maybe a little… self-conscious? Like, I worry people are looking at me. It makes me want to… stop talking, sometimes. It’s just… red face. It doesn't feel bad, exactly, just… noticeable. My wife… she used to say it just meant I was warm. But… she’s not here anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Enrique. That must be very difficult. It's completely understandable that this flushing feels more concerning now. Okay, so it's associated with social situations and potentially some foods, accompanied by a feeling of self-consciousness. Just to get a full picture, have you noticed any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No. Not really. My heart doesn't race. I don't sweat. I don't get dizzy. Just… red face. Maybe a little warm, but not… a fever warm. And it goes away pretty quickly, usually. A few minutes. Sometimes a little longer if I'm really… embarrassed, I guess. But mostly, just the red face. It's not painful or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms like racing heart, sweating, or dizziness. That helps narrow things down. Now, just to cover some basics, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I don’t take any medicine, usually. Just… sometimes I take something for my… for a headache, if it’s a bad one. But it’s just over-the-counter stuff. Like… ibuprofen, I think. That’s it. I don’t have any… serious allergies. Never had one.
DOCTOR: Good, no known allergies. And just ibuprofen as needed for headaches. Do you have any medical conditions that have been diagnosed in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. The doctor… my old doctor… he said my blood pressure was a little high once, a long time ago. But he said not to worry about it. He just told me to… eat less salt, I think. That was years ago. I don’t go to the doctor very often. And no, no diabetes, no heart problems. Just… getting old, I guess. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slightly elevated blood pressure reading in the past, but nothing officially diagnosed or treated. And no other medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had one. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Just… a few stitches when I was a boy. I fell off a bicycle. But not a real surgery. Nothing… big. No hospitals, except… when my wife… never mind. No surgeries. Not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And finally, a quick question about your family. Does anyone in your family have a history of similar flushing, or any skin conditions, or any conditions that affect the blood vessels?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a hard one. My family... they all lived far away. In India. We didn’t see each other very often. I don't really know much about their medical problems, sorry. My mother... she had… something with her stomach, I think. But I don’t know what it was. And no, I don't remember anyone having… red face like me. Or any skin problems. It's hard to say, really. We didn’t talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited information about family history. That’s alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and just take a look at your skin. It will help me get a better sense of what's going on.
PATIENT: That's okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. My blood pressure is probably a little high, like the old doctor said. But I'm sure it's nothing serious. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 148/92. Your pulse is regular at 78. I’m looking at your skin now, and I do notice some mild redness in your cheeks and nose. No visible rashes or other abnormalities. Your skin feels warm and dry. I’m also listening to your heart and lungs, and everything sounds clear. Do you feel any discomfort when I press on your forehead or cheeks?
PATIENT: No discomfort. Not at all. It feels… normal. Like always. Everything sounds clear? That's good. I worry sometimes, you know? Getting old… things start to break. But if everything sounds clear… that's a relief. 148? Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s a little higher than we'd like to see, Enrique. While one reading doesn’t give us the full picture, it does warrant further investigation. Given your description of the flushing – triggered by social situations and potentially spicy food – and the elevated blood pressure, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be something relatively benign, like rosacea – a common skin condition causing facial redness. However, we also need to rule out other causes, such as a condition called carcinoid syndrome, which can cause flushing and elevated blood pressure, or even a medication reaction, although you don't currently take any regular medications. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will help us assess your overall health, check for any underlying inflammation, and rule out any other potential causes for your flushing and elevated blood pressure. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh dear. I don’t like needles. But… if you think it’s important, Doctor, then yes. Okay. I trust you. I just… don’t like needles. Will they take a lot of blood? And… will it hurt? I've always been a little nervous around doctors. My wife… she always handled these things.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Enrique. Needles aren't pleasant for anyone. We'll only take a small amount of blood – a couple of vials, enough for the tests we need. And the phlebotomist – the person drawing the blood – is very skilled and will do their best to make it as comfortable as possible. It will be a quick pinch, and then it's over. We can talk through it, and I’ll be right here. The tests will check your basic blood counts, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and a few other markers to help us understand what’s going on. I'll also order a test to check for elevated levels of certain hormones that can sometimes cause flushing. Would you like me to explain what each test is for in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Hormones? Oh my. That sounds… serious. I don't want anything serious, Doctor. Just… red face. Maybe I should just try to avoid spicy food and… stop talking to people? But that’s no life, is it? If you could explain the tests, yes, please. Just… don't use too much medical talk. Keep it simple. And tell me if anything sounds… really bad. I’d rather know, you know? Even if it’s not good news. My wife… she always said it was better to know.
DOCTOR: You're right, Enrique, it's always better to know. And I promise to keep it simple. The hormone test, specifically a 24-hour urine test for metanephrines and catecholamines, is to rule out a rare condition called carcinoid syndrome, or pheochromocytoma. These conditions involve the overproduction of hormones that can cause flushing, high blood pressure, and other symptoms. It’s rare, but it’s important to rule it out. The 24-hour urine test means you’ll collect all your urine for 24 hours in a special container – the lab will give you instructions. The other blood tests – the basic blood counts, electrolytes, liver and kidney function – are just to get a general picture of your overall health and see if there’s any underlying inflammation or any other issues that could be contributing to your flushing. They'll help us see how well your organs are functioning. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: 24 hours? Collecting… all my urine? Oh dear. That sounds… messy. And what if I forget? What if I have to… you know… go somewhere? Messy is not good. And what if I spill it? My wife… she always remembered everything. I get confused easily, Doctor. Is this test really necessary? Can't we just… try something else? Maybe a cream for my face? Or a different doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Enrique. It does sound a bit daunting, but the lab will provide a very easy-to-use container and clear instructions. It's designed to be discreet, and you can carry the container with you easily. And if you do happen to spill a little, don't worry – it's not the end of the world. We can always repeat the test. The reason I'm recommending this test is to rule out a potentially serious condition. While it’s likely to be something much simpler, we need to be thorough to ensure we're not missing anything. A cream for your face might help with the redness, but it won't address the underlying cause of the flushing. And while you're welcome to seek a second opinion, I believe these tests are the best next step. To help make it easier, I can provide you with a written summary of the test instructions. I can also have the lab technician walk you through the process when you go to collect the container. We'll do everything we can to support you. Would you like me to schedule the blood tests for you?
PATIENT: Oh alright. If you think it’s best, Doctor. But please… help me remember everything. And please make sure the lab technician is very nice. I get nervous around new people. And the container… please make sure it doesn’t leak. If it’s leaking… I don’t know what I’ll do. Yes. Schedule the tests. But… not too early. I like to have my coffee first. And please… write everything down for me. Everything. My wife… she always kept everything organized.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Enrique. We’ll take care of everything. I’m scheduling the blood tests for 10:00 AM tomorrow morning – that gives you plenty of time to enjoy your coffee. And I'll write down detailed instructions, including a reminder about collecting your urine for 24 hours. I'll also make a note for the lab technician to be extra patient and explain everything thoroughly. And I’ll ensure they give you a leak-proof container. Here's the written information, and this is the lab address and phone number. Do you have any questions about it?
PATIENT: 10:00 AM… yes. That’s good. Not too early. Hmm… this writing is very small. My eyes aren’t what they used to be. Okay… “collect urine for 24 hours.” Yes. I see. And… “no spicy food.” Yes. That’s easy enough. But what if I forget? What if I eat a little bit of curry without realizing it? Will the test still work? My wife… she always remembered everything. I get confused easily, Doctor. I worry a lot. Is there a phone number I can call if I get confused? And… will this test be very expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's address your concerns one by one. If you accidentally eat a little bit of spicy food, just try to avoid it for the rest of the 24-hour period. It’s not a perfect science, but we can still get useful information from the test. And it’s okay to call the lab if you have any questions or concerns during the collection process. Here’s their phone number: As for the cost, I understand your concern about not having insurance. The lab does offer a discount for self-pay patients, and we can also explore some financial assistance options if needed. I'll have my receptionist, Maria, contact you tomorrow to discuss the costs and payment options in detail. She’s very helpful and can answer all your questions. We’ll take things one step at a time, Enrique. Don't worry about trying to remember everything perfectly. We're here to support you, and we’ll work through it together. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Maria? Yes. That's good. A helpful receptionist is very important. No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… please tell Maria to speak slowly. And… please remind me to collect the urine. My wife… she always kept me organized. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it. I’m still worried, but… a little less worried now. Perhaps a cup of tea will help. I think… I think I’ll go home now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Enrique. It’s my pleasure. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. I'll make sure Maria knows to speak slowly and remind you about the urine collection. A cup of tea sounds like a good idea. Get some rest, and we'll talk again tomorrow. Have a good day, Enrique. And remember, we’re here to help.
