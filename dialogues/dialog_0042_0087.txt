DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, I... it’s mostly just the lab work. The usual. I get it done, you know, every so often. Medicare sends me a notice. Can't really remember why exactly, just that I need it done. Is that alright? I'd like to get it over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. Routine lab work is perfectly alright. It’s good you’re staying on top of things. Let me pull up your records here to see what tests Medicare is requesting, and when you last had them done. Do you happen to know what specific tests they usually ask for?
PATIENT: Specific tests? No, not really. They just send a paper, with numbers and codes… I usually just hand it to the nice lady at the desk and she sorts it out. I don’t bother with the details. Honestly, it all blurs together after a while. Is that okay? I’m not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. It's quite common not to remember all the specifics. Okay, it looks like Medicare is requesting a Complete Blood Count, a Basic Metabolic Panel, a Lipid Panel, and a PSA test. These are fairly standard tests for men your age. Do you have any concerns about any of these tests specifically?
PATIENT: PSA test? Now that one… I think I’ve heard that name before. Something about… the prostate? Look, Doctor, I really don't like thinking about all that stuff. Is it… necessary? I just want to get the blood drawn and be done with it, if that's alright. I’m not feeling very well today, if I’m honest, and this is all a bit much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. It’s completely reasonable to feel that way. The PSA test is to screen for prostate issues. It’s a common test, but it’s your choice whether to proceed with it. We can certainly skip it if you’d prefer. Before we make a decision about the PSA, perhaps we could briefly discuss why it's recommended and the potential benefits and risks?
PATIENT: Benefits and risks… Look, Doctor, with all due respect, I'm an old man. I've lived a long life, and I just want to keep things simple. I don’t want to get bogged down in details about… things that might be wrong with me. If the Medicare paper says it's needed, I suppose it is. Just… can we just do the blood work and be done with it? I’m really not up for a long discussion right now. Is that alright? I appreciate you asking, though.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mr. Croonquist. Your comfort and wishes are the most important thing. We will absolutely just do the blood work. No need to discuss anything further if you’re not feeling up to it. We’ll get everything ordered, and the phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. Is there anything at all I can do to make you more comfortable while we wait?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s fine. I just… really appreciate you understanding. A glass of water would be nice, if it's not too much trouble. And maybe a chair closer to the door? Just in case I need to… you know. I get a little… fidgety sometimes. That's all. Thanks.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. I’ll get you a glass of water right away, and we can move you to a chair closer to the door. It’s no trouble at all. Here you go. And here’s a more comfortable spot for you. The phlebotomist, Sarah, should be with you in just a moment. She’s very good, and very gentle. Just let me know if you have any concerns at all, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. It’s just… needles, you know? Always been a bit squeamish. I appreciate you being patient with me. Hopefully, it’ll be quick. Is there anything… anything I need to do before the blood draw? Or just sit here and wait? I’m probably just rambling now. Sorry.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mr. Croonquist. It’s perfectly normal to be a little anxious about needles. No, you don’t need to do anything special. Just relax, and try to take some deep breaths. You can flex your arm if that helps. Sarah will handle everything. She’ll explain the process to you, and you can tell her if you’re feeling uncomfortable at any time. Do you want me to stay with you while Sarah gets set up, or would you prefer to chat for a moment to take your mind off things?
PATIENT: No, no, you don't need to stay. You've been very helpful already. I think I'm alright just sitting here. Maybe… do you have a radio? Something with music? Quiet music, not too loud. That might help. If it's not too much trouble, of course. I don’t want to be a bother. It’s just… quiet makes me think. And thinking isn’t always a good thing.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mr. Croonquist. Let me see... Yes, we do. Here we go. How’s that?
PATIENT: That's… perfect, actually. Thank you. It's just what I needed. Quiet music… takes me back. I think I’ll just sit here and listen for a bit. Hopefully, Sarah will be along soon. I appreciate you being so understanding, Doctor. You're a good one. Really.
