DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I'm Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a little silly, maybe. I just… I was hoping you could write me a card. A “Get Well” card. Or maybe one with some… encouragement. You know? My niece, she’s… going through some things. And a card from a doctor… it carries some weight, you understand?
DOCTOR: A card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A card. I just… it’s hard to explain. She doesn’t listen to me, you see? But maybe… maybe if it came from a professional… someone in a white coat… she’d pay attention. She thinks I don’t know anything. It’s disrespectful, really. I’ve lived a good life, worked hard my whole life. A little encouragement from you... it would mean a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’d like me to write a card to your niece, offering some encouragement… based on my professional opinion, perhaps?
PATIENT: Well, not opinion exactly, Doctor. Just… a nice sentiment. Something to tell her she should… be strong. And listen to her elders. That’s the important part. Listen to her elders. She’s a young woman, full of… ideas. Not always good ideas, mind you. But a card, that’s all I ask. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, while I appreciate you asking, my time is allocated for medical consultations. Writing a personal card isn’t really within the scope of my practice. I'm a physician, here to address health concerns. Perhaps a social worker could assist with a letter of support?
PATIENT: A social worker? What good is a social worker? They don’t know her. They haven't seen her grow up! Doctor, with all due respect, you’re a doctor! You understand people. You see sick people all day. Surely you can spare a few minutes to write a nice card? It’s not like you're doing brain surgery. I just… I thought it would carry some weight coming from you. It’s a simple request.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration, but offering medical advice – even indirectly through a supportive note – to someone I haven’t examined is unethical. It could be misconstrued as a diagnosis or treatment recommendation. And frankly, it takes time away from patients who do have medical needs I'm qualified to address. I can, however, offer resources for mental health support in the community. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Mental health support? She doesn't need mental health support! She needs to listen to her family! This is ridiculous. You’re a doctor, not a… a gatekeeper of feelings. I just want a card! A simple, encouraging card. Is that too much to ask? I come to a doctor, seeking help for my niece, and you’re telling me about… resources? I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I know what she needs. She needs respect. And a card from a doctor might just give her that. It’s… I don’t understand. You’re making this very difficult.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I truly am sorry, but I cannot fulfill your request. My professional obligations prevent me from writing a personalized card in this situation. It's not about making things difficult; it's about maintaining ethical boundaries and providing appropriate medical care. Perhaps speaking with her primary care physician, if she has one, would be a better avenue?
PATIENT: I see. So, you’re saying you won’t help. After I came all the way here. I suppose that’s your right. It’s a shame, really. A doctor should be willing to… offer a kind word. A little encouragement. But I guess not everyone is the same. Never mind. Thank you for your time, Doctor. .
