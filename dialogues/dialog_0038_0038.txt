DOCTOR: Alright, Evann, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. I apologize in advance if I am… less than forthcoming with details. My memory isn’t what it once was. I believe I’m here to discuss… arrangements for the future. Something about a form? My solicitor suggested I speak with a physician. An Advance Directive, perhaps? Or a POLST form… I don't quite recall the specifics, truthfully.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Evann. It's perfectly alright if things aren't clear. Many people find those forms a bit confusing, and it’s smart to get a doctor's input. It sounds like you're thinking about planning for your future healthcare wishes – that’s a very responsible thing to do. Let’s start with the basics. Just so I have a good understanding, when you say “arrangements,” are you thinking about what kind of medical care you’d want if you were seriously ill and unable to speak for yourself?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. That… that is what I meant. If I were to… become incapacitated, I’d want my wishes to be known. I don't wish to be a burden, and I’d prefer to have some control over the situation, even then. Though, I confess, I don’t recall what those wishes are specifically. It’s… frustrating. I believe my solicitor has some notes, but she felt it prudent to consult with a medical professional first.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. It sounds like we’re talking about either an Advance Directive – sometimes called a living will – or a POLST form. The Advance Directive covers a broader range of situations and your overall values, while a POLST is more specific, for people with serious illnesses already. We can definitely go through both, and see which is best for you. Before we dive into those forms, let’s just get a quick overview of your general health. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question, Doctor. I see a specialist for… back pain, I believe. It flares up periodically. And I had a rather unpleasant bout of pneumonia several years ago, but I seem to have recovered fully. Beyond that… I’m afraid my memory is hazy. I used to be quite active – I spend a great deal of time at my workbench – but I don't recall any significant illnesses. I have private insurance, if that is relevant. Does that help at all? I apologize for my lack of precision.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Evann. Back pain and a history of pneumonia are good to know. And insurance is relevant for referrals, should we need them. No need to apologize – we'll take things at your pace. Just to clarify, when you say "specialist," do you remember which type of doctor you see for your back pain?
PATIENT: I… wish I did. It was recommended by a colleague. Someone specializing in… musculoskeletal issues, perhaps? Or… orthopedics? I truly can't recall their specific title, or even the name of the practice. I go regularly, but the details… they simply don’t seem to stick. It's… disconcerting. Is it possible to obtain that information from my insurance provider? Perhaps they have a record of my visits?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can definitely request that information from your insurance provider – that’s a good idea. I’ll have the office staff send a request after our consultation. In the meantime, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: I… believe I take something for my back. A muscle relaxant, perhaps? A small, white pill. I take it as needed, when the pain becomes particularly bothersome. I also take a multivitamin, a standard dose, daily. Beyond that… I don't believe so. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. I used to brew herbal teas, but I haven’t had the energy for that lately. Again, I apologize for my vagueness. It's rather frustrating, this lack of recall. Is it possible this is a side effect of the medication itself? Perhaps the muscle relaxant?
DOCTOR: It's certainly possible, Evann. Some medications can have side effects that affect memory, although it's not always common. We can look into that further when we have a clearer idea of exactly what you're taking for your back pain. Let’s switch gears a bit. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. No known allergies to anything, thankfully. I can eat most things, and I haven’t had any adverse reactions to medications in the past, as far as I recall. I occasionally get a mild rash from certain plants when I’m gardening, but that’s more of an irritation than an allergy, I suppose. Nothing serious. Is that information helpful? It feels rather sparse, doesn't it? I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Evann. Knowing what you aren't allergic to is just as important as knowing what you are. And no history of rash beyond mild plant irritation is good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia you mentioned?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… other than the pneumonia… Let me see. I believe I had my tonsils removed as a child, a very long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was quite young, falling from a tree. But beyond those childhood incidents, I don’t recall any significant hospital stays. I've always been relatively healthy, thankfully. I did require stitches once, a rather nasty cut from glass while etching, but that wasn't an overnight stay. A quick visit to the emergency room, and then home. Is that helpful? It feels like I'm grasping at straws, doesn't it? I apologize for my… incompleteness.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Evann. Tonsillectomy and a broken arm as a child, and a cut that required stitches – all good to know. Don't apologize – we’re just trying to get a complete picture, and it takes time. Now, has anyone in your family had any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question, Doctor. My family… wasn’t particularly forthcoming with medical history. My mother passed away when I was quite young, and my father… was not one for conversation. I believe my grandmother suffered from… arthritis, perhaps? And my uncle had some sort of heart condition, but I don't recall the specifics. I’m afraid I don't have a great deal of information. They weren’t… a family prone to sharing personal matters. I apologize. It feels as though I’m being deliberately unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. It’s very common for family medical history to be incomplete, especially if it wasn’t discussed openly. You can’t control what you don’t know. We can work with what you do know – arthritis and a heart condition in family members are good starting points. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Certainly not. No, Doctor. I have never smoked, nor do I drink alcohol. And recreational drugs are… quite outside of my realm of experience. I prefer a quiet life, focused on my work. I find solace in the precision of etching, and the creation of beautiful things. I occasionally enjoy a cup of herbal tea, but that is the extent of my indulgences. I apologize if that sounds… austere. It simply reflects my… temperament, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That doesn’t sound austere at all, Evann. It sounds peaceful and fulfilling. That's very good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about your work?
PATIENT: I am an etcher and engraver. I create detailed artwork on metal – copper plates, primarily. It requires a steady hand, a keen eye, and a great deal of patience. I've been practicing for many years, and I take a great deal of pride in my craft. I used to have a studio downtown, but I now work primarily from home. It’s… isolating, at times, but it allows me to focus on my work without interruption. It keeps me busy, and it provides a sense of purpose. I specialize in… intricate floral designs, and occasionally portraiture. Though, my commissions have dwindled somewhat in recent years. It’s… a challenging profession, but it’s one I love. I apologize for rambling. It's rare I have the opportunity to discuss my work with someone.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all. It’s fascinating work, and it’s wonderful to hear you describe it. It sounds very demanding, both physically and mentally. How long, on a typical day, would you say you spend actively working at your etching?
PATIENT: That… varies, of course. On a good day, when I’m feeling energetic, I might spend six to eight hours at my workbench. But… lately, my energy has been… limited. I find myself needing frequent breaks, and I struggle to maintain concentration for extended periods. On those days, I might only manage three or four hours of focused work. It’s… frustrating. The precision required demands unwavering focus, and it’s difficult to achieve that when I’m feeling fatigued. It’s… worrying, to be honest. I fear my work is suffering. I apologize for my… negativity. I didn’t intend to burden you with my concerns.
DOCTOR: You’re not burdening me at all, Evann. It’s important to know how these things are affecting your daily life. Fatigue and difficulty concentrating, especially when you're accustomed to such precise work, are definitely things we should investigate. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let me ask one final question. You mentioned your memory isn't what it once was. Has this been a gradual change, or did it seem to come on suddenly?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question to answer, Doctor. It's been… gradual, I believe. A slow erosion, rather than a sudden decline. I first noticed it several months ago, perhaps six or eight months. I began misplacing things, forgetting appointments… small things, initially. But it’s worsened progressively. Now, I struggle to recall recent events, and even familiar faces sometimes elude me. It's… unsettling. And frustrating. I’ve always prided myself on my sharp mind, and it’s… distressing to feel it slipping away. I apologize for my… emotional state. It’s simply… a worrying development. I fear it's impacting my ability to function, both professionally and personally.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Evann. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing some significant changes, and it’s understandable that you’re worried. Given your fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and memory issues, I think it's important to do a more thorough evaluation. I’d like to perform a brief physical exam – just to check your basic neurological function, reflexes, and vital signs. We may also need to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that sounds prudent. I trust your judgment. I understand the necessity of a thorough evaluation. I’m… apprehensive, naturally, but I’m willing to do whatever is necessary to determine the cause of these changes. Please, proceed as you see fit. I apologize if I seem… uncooperative. I simply wish to understand what’s happening, and to find a solution, if possible.
DOCTOR: You’re not uncooperative at all. It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive. We’ll take things slowly and I’ll explain everything as we go. Alright, let’s start with your vital signs. I’m just going to take your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 – all within the normal range. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the edge of the exam table, and I’ll gently tap on your knees and ankles?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise. I apologize if I'm making this more difficult than it needs to be. It's… simply unsettling to be subjected to such scrutiny.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are present and symmetrical – that’s good. A little diminished, but not concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves. This involves a few simple tests to assess your vision, facial movements, and coordination. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. I am following your finger. Is there a particular pattern I should be looking for? I apologize if my movements seem… erratic. It’s simply difficult to maintain such precise control.
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing fine. Just follow the finger with your eyes. Okay, good. Now, could you smile for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. Is that adequate? I apologize if it seems… strained. It’s difficult to express emotion on command.
DOCTOR: That's alright. Now, could you please stick out your tongue?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. Is that adequate? I apologize if it’s… uncooperative. It simply feels… awkward.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Evann. No need to apologize. These are just simple assessments. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart and lungs sound clear, no murmurs or wheezing. Finally, I’m going to do a quick assessment of your balance. Could you please stand up and close your eyes, and try to maintain your balance for 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. I… I believe that's enough. It's… difficult to maintain balance without visual cues. I apologize if I'm making this more challenging than it needs to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Evann. You did your best. Okay, thank you. That was helpful. Based on this quick exam, there are a few things I want to investigate further. Your reflexes are a little diminished, there’s slight asymmetry in your facial movements, and you experienced some difficulty with balance. These findings aren’t necessarily indicative of a serious problem, but they warrant further evaluation. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to get a more detailed look at your neurological function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. MRI… that sounds… rather invasive. But… if it’s necessary to determine the cause of these changes, then… then I suppose it’s acceptable. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment. But… could you explain the procedure to me in a little more detail? And… what are the potential risks involved? I apologize if I’m being… demanding. It’s simply… unsettling to contemplate such a procedure.
DOCTOR: You’re not being demanding at all, Evann. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to know what to expect. An MRI – Magnetic Resonance Imaging – uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It's a non-invasive procedure – meaning it doesn’t involve any incisions or injections. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-like machine. It can be a little noisy, and you’ll need to remain very still during the scan to get clear images. The procedure typically takes about 30-60 minutes. The main risks are minimal, but they include a slight risk of claustrophobia – feeling confined in the machine – and, if you have any metal implants, they could potentially interfere with the scan. We’ll make sure to screen you thoroughly beforehand to ensure it’s safe. Do you have any metal implants, such as a pacemaker, cochlear implant, or any surgical hardware?
PATIENT: Metal implants… let me see. I believe I had a small plate inserted in my wrist many years ago, after a fracture. It was a simple procedure, and I don’t recall any specific warnings at the time. But… it was a long time ago. And I've never had any other surgical interventions, to my knowledge. No pacemakers, cochlear implants, or any other hardware. But… I'm not entirely certain. It was a rather unremarkable procedure, and I've never given it much thought. Could it potentially interfere with the scan? And… what are the implications if it does? I apologize if I’m being… unnecessarily cautious. It’s simply… unsettling to contemplate such a procedure, knowing the potential risks involved.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know about the plate in your wrist. It's good you remember that. While most plates are MRI-safe, it’s important to know the specific material it's made of. We’ll need to get that information from your medical records, or from the surgeon who performed the procedure. If it’s not MRI-safe, we may need to consider alternative imaging options. In the meantime, I’ll order the blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health. We’ll also try to track down your medical records to get more information about the plate in your wrist. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: A primary care physician… let me see. I haven’t had a regular doctor in many years. I used to see Dr. Anya Volkov, but… she retired several years ago. And I’ve never really bothered to find a replacement. I tend to avoid medical interventions whenever possible. But… I believe she was affiliated with St. Jude’s Hospital. Perhaps they have my records on file? I apologize if I’m being… unhelpful. It’s simply… I’ve never prioritized regular medical checkups. I tend to manage my own health, as much as possible. But… I understand the necessity of seeking professional guidance, given these recent changes.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Evann. No need to apologize. We can certainly contact St. Jude's Hospital and request your medical records. That’s a good place to start. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for some blood work. You can get that done at any local lab. Once we have the results, and your medical records from St. Jude's, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and determine the next steps. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Just… one question, Doctor. If… if it is something serious… something neurological… what are the potential implications? What are the possible treatments available? I understand it’s impossible to provide a definitive diagnosis without further evaluation, but… I’d appreciate a general overview of the potential scenarios. I apologize if I’m being… morbid. It’s simply… unsettling to contemplate such possibilities. It’s better to be prepared, I suppose. Even if the reality is… less than ideal.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Evann, and it’s good that you’re thinking ahead. It’s important to remember that we don't know what’s causing your symptoms yet, so it’s impossible to say definitively what the potential implications might be. However, if it is something neurological, the possibilities range from relatively benign conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or migraines, to more serious issues, such as stroke, dementia, or multiple sclerosis. The potential treatments vary depending on the specific diagnosis. They can include medication, physical therapy, lifestyle changes, or, in some cases, surgery. I understand it's unsettling to contemplate these possibilities, but it’s important to remember that many neurological conditions are treatable, and early diagnosis is key. We’ll do everything we can to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a plan that’s right for you. For now, let’s focus on getting the blood work done and tracking down your medical records. Once we have those results, we’ll have a better understanding of what we’re dealing with. Do you have any other questions, or anything else you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that’s all. Thank you for your patience, and for your… thoroughness. I appreciate your willingness to address my concerns, and for your reassurance. I… I trust your judgment. I will schedule the blood work as soon as possible, and I will contact St. Jude’s Hospital to request my medical records. I… I suppose there’s nothing more I can do for now. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Evann. That sounds like a good plan. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
