DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well… it’s my family, you see. Lots of… problems. My mother, she had… something with her heart. And my brother… he had trouble with his mind. Not remembering things. I’m… I’m okay now, but I worry. I just want to be sure I don't get those things, you know? Just… peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you're coming in because of family history, preventative measures. I understand. It's good you're being proactive. “Something with her heart” and “trouble with his mind” are… rather vague, though. Could you tell me a bit more about what was going on with your mother?
PATIENT: Vague, yes, I know. I was… not a doctor then, and my sister, she handled most of it. I think… she had trouble breathing. Lots of coughing. And her legs… they got big and puffy. She was always tired. She… she died when I was young. Maybe sixty? Something like that. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Sixty… alright. And your brother?
PATIENT: My brother… he started forgetting things. Small things at first. Where he put his keys, what he ate for breakfast. Then… bigger things. Names of his kids. He got… confused. Angry sometimes. He needed someone with him all the time. It was… sad. He was a good man. He… he's gone now too. A long time ago, like my mother. I don't… I don't know what it was called. They said it was his… his brain. Something about it getting smaller.
DOCTOR: So, your mother had shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, and fatigue, passing away around age sixty. And your brother experienced progressive memory loss and confusion, ultimately attributed to something affecting his brain. Do you recall if he received a specific diagnosis?
PATIENT: A diagnosis… No, I don't think so. Not that I remember. It was a long time ago, and my sister… she did most of the talking to the doctors. They just said something about his brain, like I said. That it was… shrinking. And that it ran in families, maybe? I remember her saying something about it being… hereditary? Does that mean… passed down? I don’t understand all those words.
DOCTOR: Hereditary just means passed down through families, yes. What your sister said is… plausible. Given your family history, we need to explore some possibilities. Now, let's focus on you. You said you’re feeling okay now, but we want to keep it that way. Have you experienced any memory problems, shortness of breath, swelling in your legs, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I forget things sometimes, like everyone does, I think. Where I put my glasses, or what I had for lunch. But nothing… serious. I can still remember my address, and… and my children’s names. I can breathe okay, I think. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m an old man, you know? I work hard. Sales is… tiring work. But I don’t think it’s anything wrong, just… old age.
DOCTOR: Right. Sales is demanding. And it’s good you’re aware of these small changes. We'll still want to do a full assessment, just to have a baseline and monitor things. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think the doctor told me that once, a long time ago. Maybe ten years ago? He gave me some pills, but I didn’t like how they made me feel, so I stopped taking them. I told him, and he… well, he didn’t say much. Just shrugged, I think. I haven't been to the doctor much since then. No diabetes, no heart problems, as far as I know. I get regular check-ups, but mostly just for… things. I don’t know. I'm not good at remembering doctor words. My insurance… it's Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Medicare is helpful to know. And stopping your blood pressure medication without consulting a doctor… that wasn't ideal, Mr. Schwer. It’s important to manage that, even if you don’t feel symptoms. We'll need to check your current blood pressure. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never needed any. I'm a tough old man, you see. Broken a few bones when I was young, working on the farm, but they healed up just fine. Just… regular aches and pains, you know? Like everyone gets when they get old. I don't… I don't like hospitals. Too many… smells. And too many people. Makes me nervous. But I am here, aren't I? Trying to do the right thing. So, what do we do now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are doing the right thing. We’ll start with a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment - just to check your reflexes and memory a bit more thoroughly. Then, I'd like to order some blood work. That will give us a better picture of your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Sounds… okay. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have appointments later. But… if it's important, I can reschedule. Just… tell me what you're doing, okay? I don’t like surprises. And… be gentle? My bones aren’t what they used to be. And… what about my heart? You’ll check that, right? To make sure it’s okay? Like my mother’s?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take our time, I’ll explain everything as we go, and I will be gentle. And yes, we will definitely listen to your heart. That’s a very good question. It’s important to address your concerns. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Could you please take a seat and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. Do I need to… do anything? Breathe special, or something?
DOCTOR: No special breathing just relax your arm and keep it still. I’m just getting a baseline reading.
PATIENT: Is… is that normal? That feels… tight. It’s been a long time since I had my blood pressure checked. I mostly just avoid doctors. It makes me anxious, you know? They always find something wrong.
DOCTOR: It is a bit tight, that’s true. But it’s only temporary. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. It’s not drastically high, but it's higher than we’d like, especially given your history of high blood pressure and your family history. I'll listen to your heart now. Take a deep breath for me, and exhale slowly… Again…
PATIENT: It feels… okay. No pain. Just… a little strange. My heart doesn't race much anymore. Used to, when I was younger. Working on the farm, that was hard work. Lots of running, lots of lifting. Now… not so much. Is everything… okay? You're frowning again, Doctor. Is my heart bad? Like my mother’s?
DOCTOR: Your heart rhythm is regular, which is good. I’m hearing a slight murmur, but it’s not overly concerning at this point. It could be something benign, or it could warrant further investigation. We’ll need to do an EKG to get a more detailed look at your heart’s electrical activity. The murmur isn't necessarily indicative of the same issues your mother faced, but it’s best to rule things out. Now, let’s check your lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly.
PATIENT: An EKG… is that… bad? Does that mean something is wrong? My sister… she always knew what all the doctor words meant. I mostly just nodded and smiled. Now I wish I had paid more attention. My lungs… they feel okay. Maybe a little… wheezy sometimes? When it’s cold. Is that bad too, Doctor? You’re making me nervous.
DOCTOR: An EKG is a simple test, Mr. Schwer, it doesn't mean anything is wrong. It's just a way to get a clearer picture of your heart's activity. The slight wheezing you mentioned is worth noting, but it's common, especially with changes in the weather. It could be mild asthma, or something else entirely. I’m going to ask you some simple memory questions now, just to get a baseline. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… Hmm. August… the second? Is it the second? Yes, I think it’s the second. August the second… 2025. Is that right? I try to remember the date. My granddaughter, she keeps track of things for me now.
DOCTOR: Yes, August the second, 2025 is correct. And that's perfectly alright that you needed to think about it. We are just gathering information. Now, can you tell me the names of three objects I just placed on the table?
PATIENT: Three objects…? Oh dear. Where… where did you put them? I don’t see anything on the table. My glasses… are they on? Are they small objects? Or big ones? I’m sorry, Doctor. I’m not very good at remembering things. I get… distracted easily.
DOCTOR: They’re right here, Mr. Schwer. A pen, a water glass, and a tissue box. Don't worry if you can't remember them right away. Just take your time. It’s alright.
PATIENT: A… a pen. Yes, I see a pen. And… and something shiny. Is that a glass? With water? And… a box. A white box. For… for tissues? Is that right? I think… I think that’s all I see. My mind… it’s not what it used to be. It feels… foggy.
DOCTOR: Alright. You remembered a pen, a glass, and a box. That’s a good start. Given your family history and these initial findings, I recommend we order some blood work and an EKG. We should also schedule a follow-up appointment with a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an EKG… and a neurologist… Oh dear. That sounds like… a lot. Is it… is it bad? Is something seriously wrong? My sister… she always said I worry too much. But I can’t help it. My mother… and my brother… I don't want to end up like them. What are you expecting to find, Doctor? Please… just tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, it's too early to say definitively what’s going on. These tests aren’t about expecting the worst, but about gathering information. The blood work will check for underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. The EKG will give us a more detailed picture of your heart's activity. And the neurologist can assess your cognitive function and rule out any potential neurological issues. The goal is to understand what's happening and develop a plan to keep you healthy. We aren’t jumping to any conclusions at this point. I want to rule out anything serious, and then we can discuss a course of action. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: I… I think so. So… you’re not saying I have something wrong? Just… checking? That’s… a little better. My granddaughter… she would tell me to just get it over with. She’s very practical. But I… I get nervous. So many tests. So many doctors. But… if it’s going to make me feel better, then… then I suppose I can do it. What do I need to do first? The blood work? And where do I go?
DOCTOR: Yes, let's start with the blood work. The lab is just across the street, at 123 Main Street. Here's the requisition form. They’ll need to draw a few vials of blood. It should take about 30 minutes. Fasting for 12 hours beforehand is recommended, meaning no food or drink except water. After the blood work, the results will be sent to me, and I'll review them. Then, I'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and schedule the EKG and the neurology consultation. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: 12 hours… no food? That will be… difficult. I like my breakfast. But… alright. I can try. 12 hours. And… you’ll call me when the results are back? And then we’ll talk about the EKG… and the neurologist? So many steps. But… if it’s going to help me feel better, then I’ll do it. Is there anything else I need to know? Anything I should avoid doing before the tests?
DOCTOR: Just try to stay well-hydrated, Mr. Schwer. And avoid any strenuous activity the day before the blood work. Also, if you are on any medications, continue taking them as usual unless I specifically instruct you otherwise. And I will call you as soon as the results are back. Do you have any other concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I’m still… nervous, but I feel a little better knowing what to expect. Thank you. I suppose I’ll go across the street and get this blood work done. I hope… I hope everything will be alright. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. Take your time. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. I hope we can get some answers and put his mind at ease.
