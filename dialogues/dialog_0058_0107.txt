DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. My heart... it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but... yeah. Flapping. It scares my wife. That's why I come. August 2, today, right?
DOCTOR: "Flapping," okay. And how long has your heart been doing this "flapping," as you put it?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… six months? I don’t know exactly. It comes and goes. Sometimes a few days, then nothing for a month. It’s hard to say. Not every day, definitely. I work a lot, you know? Chemical stuff. Makes it hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Chemical stuff… right. And when it happens, does anything bring it on?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I mean, I work… sometimes hot, sometimes cold. Heavy lifting. But it doesn’t seem to be any one thing. It just… starts. I’m not doing anything special when it happens. Just… being. My wife says maybe when I’m tired? But I always tired, you know? Work is hard.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms with this “flapping”?
PATIENT: Other stuff? Uh… sometimes I feel a little… dizzy? Not fall-down dizzy, just… light. And… I get out of breath easy. Walking upstairs… I have to stop sometimes. That's all I think. Maybe a little… sweaty too, when it’s flapping. But not always. It’s just… a lot of things at the same time, when it happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been officially diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No doctor before. Always busy with work. And… no money for doctor, you know? Just… tough. My wife, she worry a lot, that’s why I come now. She say it’s important. She's right, probably. Never been told anything about my heart before.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any family history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... My father, he had… I don’t know the English word… like a weak heart? He tired easy too. But he lived long time, old man. My mother… no problems, I think. Lots of brothers and sisters, back in Yemen. Hard to remember what everyone had. We don’t talk much about sick stuff. Bad luck, you know? We don’t want to talk about it. So… maybe my father? Weak heart. That's all I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. No pills. Never take anything. Just… water, when I’m thirsty. And coffee, for work. A lot of coffee. But not pills, no. I don't like pills. Make me sick, probably. My wife says I should take something for the… worry. But I don’t want.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Puder. Let's have a listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll check your blood pressure. Then we'll talk about what might be going on. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Heart and lungs, yes. I’m ready. Careful with the table, it squeaks. Old table, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart rate is a bit fast – 98 beats per minute. Blood pressure is 130/85. Lungs sound clear. I do hear a slight… irregularity with your heartbeat. It’s subtle, but it’s there. It sounds like you’re experiencing palpitations, likely due to premature atrial contractions, or PACs. It’s not necessarily dangerous, but we need to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Palpa-what? And pre-what? I don't understand. Is it bad? My wife is going to be so worried. Is it my heart? The flapping? I don’t like it when you talk like that. Is it… serious? Like, need hospital serious? I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Palpitations just means you're feeling a fluttering or racing heart. The "pre-what" is just a fancy medical term for an extra beat in your heart. It’s usually not life-threatening, but it can be a symptom of other problems. That’s why we need to investigate further. No, I don’t think you need the hospital right now. But I want you to get an EKG – that’s a simple test to record your heart’s electrical activity – and a blood test to check your thyroid and electrolytes. And I want you to cut back on the coffee. Seriously. That much caffeine is likely contributing to this.
PATIENT: Okay... EKG... blood test... No coffee... That sounds like a lot. Will it cost much money? I don’t have much money, you know. And… what if it is bad? What if it’s something serious? My wife… she will be very scared. Where do I go for the test? Close to work? I have to work tomorrow, you said. Is there… a place close to work?
DOCTOR: Here. This is a list of labs in the area. I’ve highlighted a few that offer financial assistance. The cost will vary, so you’ll need to call and ask. As for whether it’s “bad”… we don’t know yet. That’s why we’re doing the tests. I understand your concern, and I’m not trying to scare you. But ignoring this won't make it go away. If the EKG shows anything concerning, we may need to refer you to a cardiologist – a heart specialist. For now, focus on cutting back the coffee, getting these tests done, and try not to stress. Stress will only make things worse. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay... Okay. Coffee… less coffee. Tests… call and ask. No stress… Financial… assistance… Okay. I think I understand. But… my wife… she worries so much. I will call, I promise. And I will try… less coffee. Is it okay if I get the test on Wednesday? I have to work tomorrow and Tuesday. Wednesday? And… thank you. For not… scaring me too much.
DOCTOR: Wednesday is… acceptable. But don't delay any longer than that. And bring the results with you when you come back. We'll review them then. I’ll also print out a sheet with some information on managing palpitations. It’s mostly about lifestyle changes. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No... I think that’s all. Less coffee, Wednesday, and… not to worry too much. I will try. Thank you… very much. I should go now, I think. Work is calling. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Alright. See you on Wednesday. Try to get some rest. .
