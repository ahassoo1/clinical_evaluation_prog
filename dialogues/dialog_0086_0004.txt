DOCTOR: Right. Well, Teah, good morning. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning! Just here for my shots, like we talked about. Routine stuff, you know? Gotta keep up with all that.
DOCTOR: Yes, the… shots. Right. And just to confirm, you're referring to your tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis booster, as discussed during your visit last year?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You lose me with those big words already! Tetanus… that’s the one from rusty metal, right? And the other two… honestly, I just remember my nurse saying I needed a booster. It's been a while, and I don’t really keep track of names. Sorry! Is this one of those where my arm gets sore?
DOCTOR: Yes, tetanus is contracted through rusty metal – or any wound contaminated with dirt. It’s quite unpleasant, so it’s good you’re keeping up with it. The others are diphtheria and pertussis – diphtheria affects the respiratory system, and pertussis is whooping cough. And yes, it will likely cause some soreness in your arm. Let’s just verify your allergy list quickly. I see here… no reported allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Lucky me! And no medications either. I try to stay healthy, you know? Mostly just… lots of walking, good food when I can get it. Living out in the country, things aren’t always easy to come by.
DOCTOR: Right. Walking is good. And… well, it’s good you’re proactive about your health. Now, before we administer the booster, I do need to ask a few routine questions, just to make sure there aren't any contraindications. Have you been feeling unwell recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess! Nothing I haven’t had before. No fever, no cough, no… anything like that. Feeling pretty good, actually. Why do you ask? Is something wrong with the shot itself?
DOCTOR: No, it’s standard procedure, Teah. We simply need to rule out any acute illness that might make the vaccine less effective or cause a reaction. Alright. And have you had any changes to your medical history since your last visit?
PATIENT: Nope, no changes. Still married to Harold, still working construction… everything’s pretty much the same. We did get a new puppy, though! Little terrier mix. Keeps me busy, that one. But no doctor visits or anything like that. Harold’s been good too, just his usual knee trouble.
DOCTOR: A puppy, very nice. Harold’s knee… well, that’s good to know. Okay. Just one more thing, and this is important. Do you have any immune system problems or are you currently being treated for cancer, HIV, or any other condition that weakens your immune system?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Nothing like that, thankfully. I’m a pretty healthy woman, all things considered. Construction work keeps you strong, you know? Harold and I both. We're out there rain or shine. We don't have anything like those problems. Why would you even ask something like that?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard question, Teah. We always ask about immune deficiencies before administering any vaccine. It’s for your safety. Alright. Well, since you've assured me there have been no changes to your health, we can proceed. Please have a seat and roll up your sleeve. I’ll need to clean the injection site first.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I understand. It’s just… sometimes it feels like you’re looking for something wrong when there isn’t anything. But fine, I’ll roll up my sleeve. Just… don’t poke too hard, alright? My skin is getting thin these days. .
DOCTOR: I assure you I will use proper technique. It’s a very quick injection. And please remain still. There. All done. Apply gentle pressure to the site for a few minutes. You may experience some soreness and mild swelling. Here's a bandage. And I will document this in your chart. .
