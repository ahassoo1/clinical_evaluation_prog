DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. I'm Dr. Voytek. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my foot. This sore, it just won’t go away. Been bothering me for… oh, a good while now. It’s quite painful, you know. I’ve tried things, but nothing seems to help. It's a diabetic thing, the nurse told me, but honestly, I don't put much stock in what they say these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been persistent. I understand it’s been painful and you’ve tried some things already. And you mentioned the nurse alluded to it possibly being related to your diabetes. We definitely want to take a good look at it. First, can you tell me a little more about when this sore started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was… after that little trip to Majuro. Yes, Majuro. October of… 2023, I believe. We were visiting my niece, Lani. I stepped on something sharp, I think, while walking on the beach. Didn’t think much of it at the time, just a little prick. But it never really healed properly, you see? Just got worse and worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started in October of 2023, after a trip to Majuro, and you recall stepping on something sharp on the beach. And it just didn’t heal as it should have. Alright. And can you describe the sore to me now?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… not pretty. It's red around the edges, naturally. And it’s… weeping, I suppose you’d say. Always a little damp. And it smells. Not horribly but… you know. It's also quite deep, I think. I don't like to look at it myself. It's on the bottom of my foot, near my big toe.
DOCTOR: Okay, red, weeping, with an odor, and deep – on the bottom of your foot near your big toe. That gives me a better picture. I see here in your chart that you are diagnosed with diabetes. And foot care is especially important with that. I'm going to need to take a look at it. Would you mind if I examined your foot?
PATIENT: Examine it? Well, I suppose so. But be gentle, dear. My skin is very thin, you know. And don't take too long. I haven’t got all day. It's just… I don't like people poking around.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. And I’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, Louine, if you could just flex your foot for me. I'm going to take a look at the sore and gently palpate around it to get a sense of how deep it goes and if there's any warmth or redness extending beyond the sore itself. Hmm. Okay. There is some redness extending beyond the edges of the sore, and I do see some drainage. It feels warm to the touch. I’m also noting some… diminished sensation in this area of your foot. Do you feel this when I lightly touch here?
PATIENT: Diminished sensation? What do you mean? Honestly, doctor, you're talking in riddles again. Just tell me if it’s bad or not! I feel… something, I suppose. A little tingle, maybe. But it’s not like it used to be, that’s for certain. My feet haven't been right since… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you feel some sensation, a little tingling, but it’s not as strong as it used to be. That diminished sensation is what I was concerned about. With diabetes, sometimes the nerves can be affected, and that can make it harder to feel injuries and infections. And it can also affect healing. Based on what I’m seeing and feeling, it does appear you have an infected ulcer. We need to get this treated promptly to prevent it from getting worse. I’m going to order some lab tests to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. I also want to get an X-ray of your foot to make sure the infection hasn’t spread to the bone. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lab tests and X-rays? Honestly, doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. It's just a little sore! But… alright, fine. Do what you think you need to do. Just… don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. And I hope it doesn’t cost me a fortune. Medicare barely covers anything these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and the time involved. We will submit everything to Medicare, and we can discuss any potential out-of-pocket expenses with the billing department. Okay, I’ve ordered the labs and the X-ray. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and take you down for the X-ray. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a course of oral antibiotics to start fighting the infection. We’ll adjust the medication if the lab results indicate a different type of bacteria. I also want to emphasize the importance of keeping weight off of your foot as much as possible. Are you able to use a walker or crutches?
PATIENT: A walker or crutches? Goodness, no. I'm 89 years old, doctor, not a spring chicken! I'll just try to stay off of it as much as I can, I suppose. But I still need to get around the house, you know. What kind of antibiotics are you prescribing? I've had bad reactions to some in the past.
DOCTOR: I understand. We won’t push anything you're not comfortable with. We will start with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, Cephalexin, which is generally well-tolerated. I’m also going to recommend a special type of footwear and some offloading socks to reduce pressure on the sore. I’ll have the nurse show you those before you leave. Do you have any known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I had a rash once when I took…Penicillin, I believe. Years and years ago. A very nasty rash. And something with…sulfa, maybe? But it was a long time ago, I can’t quite recall. Honestly, I take so many pills these days, I lose track.
DOCTOR: Okay, a rash with Penicillin and possibly with something containing sulfa. We will definitely avoid those. The Cephalexin we're prescribing doesn't contain either of those. Okay, so to recap: we’re starting you on Cephalexin, we've ordered labs and an X-ray, and the nurse will show you some special footwear and offloading socks. We will follow up as soon as we have the lab results to adjust treatment as needed. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Well… how long is this going to take to heal? I have Lani’s granddaughter’s wedding in November, and I must be able to dance! And… will this medicine make me sleepy? I like to watch my stories in the afternoon.
DOCTOR: Those are both very good questions. As for how long it will take to heal, it’s hard to say definitively, Louine. It depends on how quickly the infection responds to the antibiotics, and how well you're able to keep weight off of your foot. With diabetes, healing often takes longer. But we will do everything we can to get you dancing at the wedding in November! As for the Cephalexin, some people experience mild side effects like nausea or stomach upset, but drowsiness is not a common one. However, everyone reacts differently, so if you do feel sleepy, please don’t drive or operate heavy machinery. The nurse will be in shortly to go over discharge instructions and answer any other questions you may have. Do you have any concerns about getting to follow-up appointments?
PATIENT: Follow-up appointments… Well, my niece, Lani, she usually drives me, but she's been quite busy lately with her job. I don't want to be a bother. And… truthfully, I’m not sure I can manage the stairs at the clinic. They haven’t got an elevator, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. We can definitely work around that. We may be able to schedule a telehealth appointment for some of the follow-ups, or potentially arrange for an appointment at a different clinic location that’s more accessible. We can also explore transportation options through some local services. I’ll have the care coordinator reach out to you to discuss those options. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. You’ve been… thorough, doctor. Though I still think you're making a fuss over nothing. But thank you. I appreciate you trying to help. Now, where is that nurse? I’m starting to feel a bit faint.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Louine. It’s my job to make sure we address all your concerns, even if it seems like a “fuss.” I will go ahead and let the nurse know you're ready. And if you start feeling faint, please let me or the nurse know right away. The nurse will be with you shortly. Take care.
