DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Kahrin. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hi Doctor. Just the results, please. I’m pretty busy, so if we can just jump straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you’d like to get straight to the results. I have them here on the computer. Just to confirm, are you referring to the blood work and urine analysis we completed earlier this week?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s the stuff. Anything… concerning? I skimmed the email, but honestly, all those numbers just blur together.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s go through this together. Your complete blood count – that’s the CBC – looks largely within the normal range. Your white blood cell count is normal, which is good, and your hemoglobin and hematocrit are also stable. The basic metabolic panel, which checks your kidney function, electrolytes and blood sugar, is also within acceptable limits. However, there is one result that’s slightly elevated: your liver enzymes, specifically your ALT and AST levels, are a bit higher than we'd like. They're not drastically elevated, but enough to warrant further discussion. Do you have any history of liver problems, or have you been feeling any unusual fatigue, nausea, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Liver problems? No, not that I know of. And no, no fatigue or anything like that. I mean, I work long hours, so tired, yeah, but that’s just… life. Abdominal pain, nope. Look, I eat pretty healthy, mostly, and I don’t drink much. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that’s it. What does “slightly elevated” even mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. “Slightly elevated” means the levels are above the typical reference range, but not by a large amount. It could be due to a number of things – even temporary things like a recent viral infection, certain medications, or even strenuous exercise can cause a mild increase. Since you don't have a history of liver problems and you describe a healthy lifestyle, it’s likely not something serious. However, we don’t want to ignore it. To be on the safe side, I'd like to repeat the liver enzyme test in about a month to see if the levels have returned to normal. In the meantime, it would be helpful to avoid any unnecessary medications, including over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as these can sometimes affect liver function. And while you mentioned you don’t drink much, completely abstaining from alcohol for a month would be beneficial. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: A month? Ugh. Okay, fine. No booze for a month. And I guess I can lay off the painkillers if I get a headache. But honestly, a month seems like a long time just for “slightly elevated” enzymes. What if I just… feel fine? Does it need to be a month? Could we do it again in, like, three weeks? I have a pretty busy schedule, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and appreciate you being upfront about your commitments. Three weeks is a reasonable compromise. Repeating the test in three weeks will give us a good indication of whether the levels are trending down. Let me schedule that for you now. How about August 23rd?
PATIENT: August 23rd works. Okay, great. Is there anything else? I really need to get back to work, so if that’s it, that’d be amazing.
DOCTOR: Alright, August 23rd it is. Aside from repeating the liver enzyme test, there isn’t anything else immediately necessary. I would advise continuing your healthy lifestyle habits – focusing on a balanced diet and staying hydrated. If you do experience any new symptoms – such as persistent fatigue, jaundice , abdominal pain, or dark urine – please contact the clinic right away, even before your follow-up appointment. Otherwise, I'll see you on August 23rd. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Doctor. I really appreciate you fitting me in, even if it was just for slightly elevated enzymes. I’ll see you then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kahrin. It’s always best to be proactive about your health, even with minor concerns. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before your appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you on August 23rd. .
