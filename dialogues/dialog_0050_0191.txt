DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. Well, to be frank, I came in to ask about getting tested for… for HIV. I wanted to get it checked, if that’s alright. It’s something I’ve been meaning to do.
DOCTOR: HIV testing, you say. Certainly. A… proactive measure, I suppose. While I commend your… diligence, Ms. Shaub, it's typically reserved for individuals with a higher risk profile. May I inquire as to what prompted this request?
PATIENT: Well, it's not… it's not because I think I’ve been exposed, not exactly. It’s more… peace of mind, really. My husband and I, we’ve been together a long time, but… you hear things, don’t you? About people, even people you know. I just want to be sure, for both our sakes. And, honestly, I haven’t been tested in… well, a very long time. Is that alright? I understand if it’s unusual.
DOCTOR: “Unusual” isn’t necessarily the word I’d use, Ms. Shaub, but preventative testing without a clear indication is… not standard practice. However, I suppose a baseline assessment is… permissible. Before we proceed, I must ask a few rather personal questions to ascertain your risk factors more comprehensively. It is crucial for accurate assessment, you understand. Now, regarding your marital history – and please be assured, this information is strictly confidential – have you or your husband ever had any… extramarital encounters?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, that feels… a bit intrusive. My husband and I have been married for forty years. Forty years! To ask me such a thing… It implies a certain… distrust, doesn’t it? And frankly, it’s nobody’s business but ours. I came here for a test, not an interrogation. Is the test still possible if I’m uncomfortable answering that?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shaub, I assure you, my intention is not to cause offense. However, a thorough medical evaluation necessitates a complete understanding of potential risk factors. To proceed responsibly, I must gather all relevant information. To offer you a test without proper assessment would be… negligent. I understand your discomfort, but I reiterate, this is for your well-being. If you are unwilling to disclose pertinent details regarding your sexual history, I’m afraid I cannot ethically administer the HIV test at this time. Perhaps a consultation with a therapist might be beneficial to address your… reservations?
PATIENT: Doctor, I understand you need information. But I also have a right to privacy. I came here requesting a simple test, and I’m being treated as though I’m hiding something. It’s quite upsetting. I’ve been married for forty years – forty years of faithfulness. I shouldn’t have to justify that to a doctor just to get a health check. If you’re unwilling to proceed without these… accusations, then I suppose I’ll have to find another doctor who respects my boundaries. It's a shame, really. I came here hoping to be proactive, and instead, I feel… judged.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shaub. I respect your decision, though I maintain it is not in your best medical interest. It is unfortunate you feel… "judged," as you say. However, I am obligated to adhere to strict ethical guidelines, and a responsible assessment necessitates complete transparency. I can provide you with a list of local testing facilities should you reconsider. I wish you good health.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Though, I suspect I will be seeking a different kind of care altogether.
