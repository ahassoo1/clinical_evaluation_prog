DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good morning to you as well, Doctor… Pirl, was it? Quite a name. Well, I believe it’s something to do with… certification. One must keep up with these things, you know. Though frankly, I can’t recall the specifics. It's about my…eyes, I think? Or perhaps my ears. It’s all rather… bureaucratic, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right. Certification renewal… yes, I understand. And you're experiencing some issues, potentially with your eyes or ears?
PATIENT: Issues? I wouldn't say issues. One simply needs to be examined to ensure one is still…competent. Though, I suppose my wife – my ex-wife, rather – always complained I didn't listen to her. Perhaps it’s my ears. Yes, that sounds… plausible. Though, again, I don’t really know. It’s all so tiresome, really. One has standards to maintain, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. So, to clarify, the reason for your visit today is a routine check-up related to maintaining your professional certification, and you’re wondering if there might be some hearing loss?
PATIENT: Routine… yes, that’s a… generous way of putting it. And “wondering” is a rather… weak term. One doesn’t wonder if one is still capable. One ascertains it. And yes, the ears, perhaps. Though, I do recall a rather unpleasant ringing sensation a while back… but whether that’s relevant, I haven't the foggiest. Is this going to take long? I have… commitments, you understand.
DOCTOR: We'll try to be as efficient as possible, Mr. Oriley. The ringing sensation is certainly relevant. Do you still experience that ringing?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. It comes and goes, I suppose. It’s not constant, thankfully. More of a… a subtle annoyance, really. Like a distant… chime. Though, I must say, my memory isn’t what it once was. Perhaps it’s always been there, and I simply haven't noticed. One gets distracted, you see. Life is full of distractions. Is this standard procedure? Are other patients subjected to this… line of questioning?
DOCTOR: It's standard to ask about symptoms like ringing in the ears, Mr. Oriley, as it can indicate several different things. Now, can you tell me when you first noticed this ringing?
PATIENT: When? Good heavens, that's asking a great deal. Years, I should think. Decades, perhaps. One doesn’t keep a precise record of such trivialities. It was… after a particularly loud concert, I believe. A Wagnerian opera. Dreadfully loud, it was. Though, truthfully, I attend so many concerts, it's difficult to pinpoint. Really, Doctor, I’m not one for details. One simply… carries on, you see. Is there a reason you're focusing on this so intently? Is something amiss?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have a timeline, even a rough one, Mr. Oriley, to understand what might be causing the ringing. And Wagnerian opera can be quite loud. Have you noticed any difficulty hearing in one ear more than the other, or in quiet situations?
PATIENT: Difficulties? Well, now that you mention it… my ex-wife always said I wasn't listening. But that was… a marital issue, not a medical one. As for quiet situations… everything sounds rather muffled these days, to be honest. Like being underwater. But then again, I’m getting old, aren’t I? One’s faculties diminish, you see. Is this usual? Do most patients complain of being underwater? I’m not keen on being compared to other patients, Doctor. One has a reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Oriley. It's not unusual to experience changes in hearing as we age, and the sensation of muffled sounds can be a sign of hearing loss. Let's do a quick hearing test to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A test… yes, I suppose one must. Though I assure you, I’m perfectly capable. I used to manage complex… well, never mind. A test, then. As long as it doesn't take too long. And please, Doctor, try to keep it… discreet. I don't relish the thought of being subjected to beeping noises in front of… anyone. Is there a waiting room? Is this soundproof? One has standards, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Oriley. We have a private soundproof room for the test. It will be completely confidential, and I will be right outside the entire time. It shouldn’t take too long—perhaps 10-15 minutes. I'll explain everything before we begin. Shall we proceed?
PATIENT: Very well. Ten to fifteen minutes, you say? Let’s get this over with, then. But if it involves any…headphones, I must warn you, I’m not particularly fond of them. They tend to…discomfort me. And please, no loud noises. I have a sensitive disposition, you see. Lead the way, Doctor. Though, I must say, this whole affair is rather… undignified. .
