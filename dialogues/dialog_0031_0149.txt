DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, well, good morning to you, doctor. Rakosky, you say? Sounds…foreign. Doesn’t matter, I suppose. I’m Wynell. And honestly? I don’t rightly know why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Something about…not wanting things done. I’m perfectly healthy, you know. Always have been. Barely need a doctor at all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s common for people to feel that way when they’ve been healthy for a long time. Your daughter is likely concerned and wants to ensure everything remains that way. Even a check-up can be helpful in preventative care. To start, perhaps we can just go through a few questions to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Questions? Oh, goodness. I hate questions. Always poking and prodding. But… alright. I suppose. As long as they don’t take too long. And don’t expect me to remember everything. My memory… it ain’t what it used to be. I told my daughter that, you know. She just… doesn’t listen sometimes.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We’ll take things at your pace, Ms. Gunasekara, and there’s no pressure to remember specific details. We can take as much time as you need. If you’re unsure about something, that’s perfectly fine. Let's begin with what’s been going on recently. Have you experienced any new or unusual symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Land sakes, what kind of symptoms? I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? And my feet… well, they ache. They’ve always ached. Being on them for so long, you know. I was a podiatrist, for goodness sake! I should be the one asking you about feet! Though, I haven’t really… done much podiatry in years. It's just… aches. Old age aches, mostly.
DOCTOR: I see. Being a podiatrist yourself gives you a unique perspective on aches and pains. It’s good to know you understand your body well. When you say “tired,” could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t do things, if that makes sense. I still potter around the house, do my little bit of gardening, watch my stories on the television. But… at the end of the day, I just feel… spent. Like someone’s wrung me out. And it takes a good long nap to get me going again. Not like it used to be, you know? Used to have energy to burn. Now… it’s just… quiet exhaustion.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Ms. Gunasekara. "Quiet exhaustion" is a good way to put it. It sounds like it’s impacting your energy levels at the end of the day. Have you noticed this tiredness getting worse over time, or has it been fairly constant?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s a hard one to say. Things sort of… blur together when you get to my age. I think it’s been gradually getting worse. Not suddenly, mind you. Just… a little more each year. I used to be able to do my gardening all afternoon. Now I have to take breaks every hour or so. And sometimes… sometimes I just don’t feel like it at all. It’s… irritating, more than anything. I like my garden.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s disheartening when something you enjoy becomes more difficult. It sounds like this is affecting your quality of life. Besides the tiredness and the foot aches, have you noticed any other changes in your body or how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Well… my daughter keeps saying I’m losing weight. But I’m not trying to lose weight. I eat perfectly fine, you know. A nice plate of fish and vegetables most evenings. And a little bit of dessert now and then, don’t tell anyone. But I feel thinner, if that makes sense. My clothes are a little looser. And… I get cold easier. Used to be able to wear a light cardigan in the evenings, but now I need a proper sweater. And sometimes… sometimes I just feel a bit… shaky.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Gunasekara. Weight loss, feeling cold more easily, and shakiness are all important things to note. Do these feelings of shakiness happen at any specific time, or are they random?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not specific. It’s just… comes and goes. Usually in the evenings, I think. When I’m sitting and watching television. Or sometimes when I’m getting dressed. It’s not… awful, mind you. Just… a little tremble. I try not to think about it. My daughter makes a big fuss. Says I should see a doctor. Which is why I’m here, I suppose. Honestly, I think she worries too much.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re here, Ms. Gunasekara, and it’s understandable your daughter is concerned. Shakiness, along with the other symptoms you’ve described, warrants a closer look. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes. Now you’re asking about the past? That's a long story. I had… the usual things, I suppose. A bout of pneumonia when I was younger. Broken a wrist once, falling in the garden. And… well, I had a hysterectomy a long time ago. Other than that… I've always been pretty healthy, really. I prided myself on being healthy. Didn’t take much medicine, if I could help it. Still don't.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Gunasekara. And you were a podiatrist for how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I finished training in… 1962, I believe. So, nearly forty years, if you count everything. I had my own practice for a long time, you know. A very good practice. Lots of happy patients. Though, the hours were long, and it was hard work. That's why I retired, eventually. My feet just couldn't take it anymore. Irony, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That is rather ironic, Ms. Gunasekara. Forty years is a long and dedicated career. And I imagine it took a toll on your feet. Now, have you had any surgeries other than the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. No, not really. I had my appendix out when I was a child, but that was a long, long time ago. And… I had some cataracts removed a few years back. That was alright, fixed my vision right up. But no major surgeries, if that’s what you mean. Nothing like a hip replacement or anything like that. I’ve been lucky, I think. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Gunasekara. What about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. She was always a bit frail. And my father… he was a strong man, but he got diabetes when he was older. My brother… he was healthy as a horse, but he passed away suddenly from a stroke a few years back. It was… a shock. We weren’t very close, to be honest, but it was still… sad. I always worried about inheriting their problems, but so far, so good, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Gunasekara. That gives me a better picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, not that I know of. I’ve never really had much trouble with allergies. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the winter, but that’s about it. And I can’t stand shellfish, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. My mother used to say I had a sensitive stomach, but I think she was just being fussy. Honestly, I’m a pretty simple person. Don’t need much to make me happy. Or to make me sick, for that matter.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of calcium for my bones, my daughter makes me take it. Says I need to keep them strong. And sometimes I take a little bit of ibuprofen if my feet are really bothering me, but that’s about it. I don’t like taking pills, if I can help it. Too many side effects, you know. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. A good cup of tea always makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam? Well… I suppose. As long as it's not too invasive. I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know. Just a quick look-over, is that all? I do have an appointment with my hairdresser this afternoon, so I can’t stay too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. Just a quick look-over. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look at your feet, as you mentioned some discomfort. We can take things slowly and stop at any time. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood pressure, is it? Sounds… ominous. . My daughter always worries about my blood pressure. Says I need to watch my salt intake. Honestly, I don't use much salt. Just a pinch. Get it over with, then. I have a feeling this is going to take a while.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 158/92. A little elevated, Ms. Gunasekara, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight crackling in your lungs. Not concerning, but we should keep an eye on it. Now, could I take a look at your feet?
PATIENT: Crackling in my lungs? That doesn’t sound good. My daughter’s going to have a fit. Go on, look at my feet, then. Get it all over with. They’re probably just tired. Spent a lifetime on them, you know. Be gentle, doctor. They’re sensitive.
DOCTOR: I do notice some swelling in your ankles and feet, Ms. Gunasekara, and your pulses are a bit weak. Your range of motion is slightly limited, and you do express some tenderness when I palpate the arches of your feet. I also notice some discoloration of the skin on your feet. Your skin feels cool to the touch. Overall, these findings suggest some peripheral vascular issues and possible edema. Would you mind if I check your capillary refill?
PATIENT: Oh, that is tender, doctor. You’re poking right on the sore spot. Peripheral vascular issues? Edema? What does all that mean? Is it serious? My daughter’s going to be furious if you tell me I need more tests. Capillary refill? Is that going to hurt? Honestly, I just want to go home and have a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Gunasekara. "Peripheral vascular issues" means there may be some reduced blood flow in your legs and feet. And "edema" simply means there’s some fluid retention, causing the swelling. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's something we need to investigate further. Checking your capillary refill is not painful at all. I simply press on your toenail for a few seconds and see how quickly the color returns. It gives me an idea of how well blood is circulating in your feet. It does seem to be taking slightly longer than usual for the color to return, Ms. Gunasekara. Given your symptoms – the fatigue, weight loss, shakiness, crackling in your lungs, and the findings on the physical exam – I'd like to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: It did feel a bit cold. And it took a long time to turn pink again, didn't it? Blood tests? Oh, goodness. I hate blood tests. Needles and everything. My daughter will be thrilled. She's always telling me I need to get more tests done. What kind of tests are you talking about? And will they take a lot of blood? Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit faint. I told you I just wanted a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Gunasekara. We'll just need a routine blood panel – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels. It’s not a lot of blood – just a few vials. And the phlebotomist is very skilled, so it shouldn’t be too painful. These tests will help us rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms, such as anemia, kidney problems, thyroid issues, or vitamin deficiencies. They will also help us assess the cause of the crackling sound in your lungs. It's better to be thorough and get a clear picture, so we can address any potential problems early on. Would you like me to write you a note for the phlebotomist explaining your anxiety, so they can take extra care?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Do the tests. Get it over with. But please tell them to be gentle. My veins aren’t very good, you know. They always have trouble finding them. And I really don’t like needles. And can you explain the results to me in plain English? I don’t understand all that medical jargon. Honestly, I just want to go home and rest. And have a nice cup of tea. Will it take long?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. I’ll make a note to the phlebotomist to be extra gentle and to take their time finding a good vein. And I promise to explain the results to you in plain English – no medical jargon. The tests shouldn’t take long – about 15-20 minutes. We can get them done right away, and the results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild diuretic to help reduce the swelling in your ankles. And I'll provide you with some instructions on how to manage your fatigue and shakiness at home. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results?
PATIENT: A diuretic? Will that help the swelling? My feet are just so uncomfortable at the end of the day. And instructions… alright. As long as they’re easy to understand. And a follow-up appointment… yes, I suppose. But not too soon, please. I have my hairdresser appointment, you know. And I need to rest. Honestly, this has been exhausting. I just wanted a simple check-up. Is there anything I can do right now? To make myself feel a little better? Besides having a cup of tea, of course.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. The diuretic should help reduce the swelling in your ankles by helping your body get rid of excess fluid. Right now, I recommend elevating your feet whenever possible – when you're sitting or lying down. That will help improve circulation and reduce the swelling. You can also try wearing compression socks, which can provide support and prevent fluid from pooling in your ankles. And gentle ankle exercises – rotating your ankles clockwise and counterclockwise – can also help improve circulation. And most importantly, remember to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. I'll print out a sheet with these instructions and a list of potential side effects of the diuretic. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Elevate my feet… compression socks… ankle exercises… It sounds like a lot of work. But alright. I’ll try. As long as it helps. Side effects? What kind of side effects? I don’t want anything complicated. And… Will the tests be expensive? My daughter manages my finances, and she gets upset if I spend too much money. Honestly, I just want to go home and rest. And have a nice cup of tea. Is there anything else I need to know? Or do? Before I… leave?
DOCTOR: The most common side effect of the diuretic is increased urination, so you'll need to use the restroom more frequently. It’s also important to stay hydrated to avoid dehydration. In rare cases, some people may experience dizziness or lightheadedness. If you experience any of these side effects, please contact my office immediately. As for the tests, I’ll submit them to Medicare, and they should cover the majority of the cost. There may be a small co-pay, but it shouldn’t be significant. I'll let the billing office know about your concerns, and they can provide you with a cost estimate. Before you leave, I’m going to give you a list of warning signs to watch out for – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or sudden weight gain – and a phone number to contact if you experience any of these symptoms. And finally, remember to take things easy and listen to your body. It's okay to rest and prioritize your well-being. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Warning signs… chest pain… shortness of breath… It all sounds so serious. Honestly, I just want to go home and forget about all of this. No, I think that's all. Just… let me go home and rest. And have a nice cup of tea. Thank you, doctor. I think. I appreciate you trying to help. Can you… help me to the door? .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. Let me walk you to the door. And please, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Get some rest, and enjoy your tea. And remember, we'll get to the bottom of this. .
