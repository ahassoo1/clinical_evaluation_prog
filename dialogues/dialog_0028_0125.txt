DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Belan, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Jacquille Belan. Look, I just… wanted to get this checked. It’s a bit embarrassing, honestly, having to ask for this.
DOCTOR: Well, embarrassment doesn’t get anyone better, does it?
PATIENT: Exactly. It’s just…you hear things, you know? People talking. And my wife… she’s been a bit…concerned lately. Not that I’ve done anything, mind you. Just…precautionary.
DOCTOR: “Concerned” how?
PATIENT: Oh, you know. Just…asking a lot of questions. About where I’ve been, who I’ve seen. It’s a bit much, if you ask me. She watches too many of those… dramas on TV, I think. Gets ideas.
DOCTOR: And what specifically is it she’s concerned about that brought you in today?
PATIENT: She asked if I’d been… “safe”. I told her I always am, of course. But she kept going on about… well, about getting tested. Said it would give her “peace of mind”. Honestly, it’s a bit insulting. But here I am, right? To shut her up.
DOCTOR: So, let’s be clear. You’re here solely to satisfy your wife, not because you have any symptoms or concerns?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. It’s just… easier this way. Less arguing. She’s a good woman, my wife, but… she worries too much. Honestly, it’s a bit ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well. Still, a check-up isn’t harmful. Let’s just get this over with then. Have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Not a cold, not the flu… I had a bit of a stomach bug last year, but that was it. And that was ages ago. I’m usually pretty healthy, to be honest. Good constitution, you know?
DOCTOR: Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had a reason to. I’ve always been careful. I eat well, I exercise… I don’t go around doing stupid things. My father always said, “Look after your body, and it’ll look after you.” And I have.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. My parents were both… healthy, I guess. They’re both gone now, sadly. Didn’t really talk about medical stuff much. It wasn't really our culture, you know? More about just… getting on with things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I come home. I spend time with my wife. I watch a bit of television. It’s pretty normal, really. I don’t… go out partying or anything like that. I’m not a wild man.
DOCTOR: Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Makes you cough, doesn't it? And smells awful. My wife would kill me if I even thought about it.
DOCTOR: Alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a beer now and then, with dinner. Sometimes a glass of wine on the weekend. Nothing heavy. I don’t… get drunk or anything. Social drinking, you know? Perfectly responsible.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I haven't really taken much medication in my life. A painkiller for a headache now and then, maybe. But nothing serious. I'm generally a healthy person, remember?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s just get this over with. I’m going to need a urine sample. And I’ll need to do a quick physical exam. Just to be thorough. Follow me.
PATIENT: Fine. Let's just get it done then. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: In there. When you’re finished, just knock. Don't make a mess.
PATIENT: Right. Honestly, this is all a bit much.
DOCTOR: Done.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table.
