DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just… this fever keeps comin’ back. It’s been botherin’ me for a bit now, and I figured I better get it checked out before it gets worse. It’s just… annoying, really.
DOCTOR: “Annoying,” you say. Very well. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Well, it usually starts in the evenin’. Chills, then I get real warm. Nothin’ a couple blankets can’t handle, usually, but then it’s gone by mornin’. Happens maybe… three, four times a month now? It started, oh, maybe six months ago. I don’t really keep track, to be honest. I just know it keeps comin’ back. It don’t hurt or nothin’, just makes me feel tired.
DOCTOR: Three to four times a month for six months. And you state no accompanying pain?
PATIENT: Nope. No pain, no cough, no nothin’ else. Just… warm, then cold, then back to normal. Like a regular ol’ fever, but it ain’t knockin’ me off my feet or nothin’. I can still get around, still do my work. It just… slows me down a bit. My wife gets worried, that’s why I’m here, really. She says I should get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Your wife is… cautious. Very well. Let’s move on. Any significant past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox… nothing major. Broke my arm once fallin' out of a mango tree when I was a kid, but it healed up fine. And I had my appendix out when I was around thirty, but that was a long time ago. Other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I’m a chiropractor, you know? I take care of other people’s bodies all day.
DOCTOR: A chiropractor. Interesting. And family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure when she got older, but she lived to be eighty-five, so it didn’t bother her too much. My father, he had diabetes, but that was when he was an older man too. And his brother… I think he had some heart trouble. But that's about it, really. Nobody with fevers comin’ and goin’ like mine, not that I know of. We don’t really talk about illnesses much in my family. It’s bad luck, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any trouble with medicine. I don’t take much, thankfully. A little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. And I ain't had any reactions to it. I’m pretty lucky that way. I’m a healthy guy, Doc, really. This fever just… is annoying. Like I said.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter supplements or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every mornin'. My wife makes sure of it. Says I need to keep my strength up. It's one of those fancy ones, with all sorts of things in it. I don’t really pay attention to what's in it, just swallow it with my coffee. Other than that, nope. Nothing. I don't like takin' pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check for any obvious signs of infection. It's standard procedure, Mr. Brege. Don't waste my time.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let's get it over with. Just try to be quick, Doc. I got patients waitin' on me this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is within normal limits… slightly elevated respiratory rate, but that could be anxiety. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Temperature is 99.8 Fahrenheit. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No hepatosplenomegaly. Examination is unremarkable.
PATIENT: Unremarkable, huh? So what is it, Doc? This fever ain't just comin' and goin' for no reason. It’s botherin' me, and it’s worryin’ my wife. I need somethin' to make it stop. Some kinda medicine, or somethin'. I ain't got time for this “unremarkable” business.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, I understand your frustration. However, "unremarkable" does not necessarily mean there is nothing wrong. It simply means I have not identified an obvious cause for your symptoms during the physical examination. Given your history and the lack of definitive findings, it is likely a mild viral infection or a self-limiting inflammatory process. I can prescribe you some over-the-counter fever reducers to manage the symptoms, but I strongly advise rest and adequate hydration. This is likely all that is required. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fever reducers? That’s it? I can buy those at the drugstore myself! I came to a doctor for somethin’ more than somethin’ I can get myself. Look, Doc, I’m a chiropractor. I understand the body. There’s gotta be somethin’ goin’ on here. Maybe some bloodwork? Or somethin’ to check my… I don’t know… my immune system? I just want to be sure it ain’t somethin’ serious. My wife is gonna kill me if I just go home with some drugstore pills.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, with all due respect, I find your insistence… unnecessary. However, to appease your wife – and to avoid further disruption of my schedule – I will order a basic blood panel: a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. This will rule out any gross abnormalities. But I assure you, it is highly unlikely to reveal anything significant. Do not expect immediate results. It will take several days to process. And I reiterate, rest and hydration remain the most important course of action. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, that’s acceptable. Just… get it done. And let me know as soon as you have somethin’. My wife… she’ll be happier, at least. And I gotta get back to work. People are waitin’. So, where do I go to get the blood drawn? And how long will it really take? Don't tell me "several days" again. I got a business to run.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall to your left. Tell them Dr. Mutnick sent you. As for the results, I cannot guarantee a specific timeframe. It depends on their workload. But I expect it will be within three to five business days. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. .
