DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s nice to meet you. Now, I understand you’re here today for a consultation?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, that's right. My nails... they just ain't lookin' right. Not sure what to do 'bout 'em. They kinda… changed. I don't even remember when exactly, to be honest. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Changed how, exactly?
PATIENT: Well… they're thicker, I think. And the color… it’s not like my normal color. More… yellowish. Not a pretty yellowish, either. More like a sickly one. I haven’t been doin’ nothin’ different, I swear. No fancy polishes or nothin'. Just… livin'. You know? It's just weird. I mostly just try to ignore it, but my friend said I oughta get it checked. She always worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Thicker and yellowish… and when did you first notice these changes, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. Maybe… a few months back? Or was it last winter? Honestly, time kinda blurs together after a while, don't it? I don’t keep track of nail colors and dates, doctor. I got more important things on my mind. I just know it’s been a little while, and it don't seem right.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Thut. It's alright if you don’t remember specifics. We’ll do our best to figure it out. Do you notice any pain or discomfort in your nails, or around them?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. They don't hurt, exactly. Just… feel different. Kinda rough, like sandpaper. And sometimes... they catch on things. My clothes, mostly. Annoyin', more than painful. I clipped 'em pretty short yesterday tryin' to smooth it out, but it didn't really help much. Honestly, I'm thinkin' it's just old age. Everything's fallin' apart these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes to your skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Skin… around 'em? Not that I recall. Maybe a little red sometimes, but I get red skin easy. I'm a woman of a certain age, you know? Things don’t stay smooth like they used to. Probably just dry skin. I use lotion, but I forget sometimes. I'm always forgettin' somethin' these days. Is this gonna be expensive? I’m on Medicare, so…
DOCTOR: We'll see what we find, Ms. Thut. Medicare should cover a good portion of the exam, and we can discuss any potential further testing if needed. Now, let's have a look at your nails. Could you please extend your hands for me?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Here. Don't take too long now, I got errands to run. It's gettin' hot out there.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some thickening and a yellowish hue, as you mentioned. The texture is a bit rough. I also notice some slight pitting on a couple of nails here. Now, this could be a number of things, Ms. Thut. It could be a fungal infection, which is fairly common. It could also be a sign of something else, so we'll need to rule a few things out. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Oh, goodness. Let me think. I got my blood pressure, the doctor says it's a little high sometimes. And my knees ache somethin’ awful in the cold weather. Old age again, I reckon. Oh! And I had a little surgery on my hand years ago, but that was a long time ago. Just a little thing. It don’t bother me no more. What kinda 'things' are you thinkin' it could be? Don't tell me it's somethin' serious. I ain't got time for serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, knee pain, and hand surgery… noted. No, I’m not suggesting anything serious at this point, Ms. Thut. Just trying to get a complete picture. To be thorough, we'll want to do a simple nail clipping test to check for fungus. And, just to rule things out, I’d like to order a basic blood test – just a routine check of your overall health. That will help us determine if anything else might be contributing to this. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Fine. Whatever you gotta do. But don't expect me to remember all these appointments. And try to be quick, alright? I got a life to live. Where do I go for these tests? And will they hurt? I don't do well with needles. Honestly, I think I’m comin' down with a headache just thinkin’ about it. Is there anythin' I can do to make my nails look better in the meantime? Like, a special polish or somethin'?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. I understand your concerns. The blood draw will likely be a standard arm draw, a quick pinch. You can tell the phlebotomist about your anxiety - they are very good at making people comfortable. As for the nails, a special polish won't address the underlying cause. In fact, polish can sometimes trap moisture and worsen a fungal infection. For now, keeping your nails short and dry is best. I’ll have the nurse print out the lab requisition and instructions for you. She'll also schedule the blood draw. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Let me see. I think I had a reaction to some kinda cream once, years ago. Made my skin all itchy. But I can’t recall what kinda cream it was. And I can’t remember when it was, exactly. Honestly, doc, my memory ain't what it used to be. Just… red and itchy, that’s all I remember. I probably shouldn't have used it in the first place. My friend always tells me I try too many new things. She's probably right, come to think of it. Is this gonna take much longer? I really gotta get goin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. We're almost finished, Ms. Thut. Just a few final questions. Do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think. Oh! I take somethin' for my blood pressure, like I said. A little white pill. And sometimes, when my knees are really bad, I take ibuprofen. Just the regular stuff you get at the drugstore. And… oh, I used to take somethin' for my cholesterol, but the doctor took me off of it a while back. Said my numbers were lookin' better. I think. Honestly, I forget half the things I take. My daughter usually keeps track of it all. She's a good girl, that one. She worries too much, but she means well. Is that enough? Can I go now? This chair is killin' my back.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed, and previous cholesterol medication. That's very helpful. Okay, we’ve covered everything I need for now. The nurse will go over the lab instructions and schedule your appointment. She'll also provide a summary of what we discussed today. It's important to follow up with the results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Questions? Not really. Just… how long before I know somethin'? I don't wanna be waitin' forever. And will this be expensive? I’m on Medicare, remember? Honestly, doc, I just want my nails to look normal again. Is that too much to ask? I gotta go run some errands now. Thank you… I guess. .
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take 3-5 business days to come back. The nurse can help with any Medicare billing questions, and we'll discuss the cost of any further testing if needed. We'll work with you to find the best course of action. We will call you with the results. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Thut. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try not to overdo it with the errands. .
