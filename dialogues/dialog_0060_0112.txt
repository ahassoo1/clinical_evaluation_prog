DOCTOR: Good morning, Keoni. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been needing to go to the bathroom very often lately. It's been going on for a little while now, but it’s become quite disruptive. I honestly can’t say how long, exactly. Time just… slips away, you know? I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, disruptive is a good word. It’s… it’s hard to explain. I work as a concierge, and it makes it difficult to be away for extended periods. I find myself constantly needing to… locate a restroom. It’s also been happening at night, which… well, that’s not ideal either. I’m just tired, honestly. Tired of worrying about it, mostly. And I haven't been sleeping as well.
DOCTOR: And how much fluid are you typically drinking in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. I… I honestly don't keep track. Probably a normal amount? I enjoy tea, particularly in the mornings, and I drink water throughout the day when I remember. Perhaps a bit more tea than water, if I'm being truthful. I don't drink soda, and very little juice. Is that helpful? I'm afraid I'm not very good at estimating quantities.
DOCTOR: "Normal" is rather subjective, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. Terribly so, I suppose. It’s just… everything feels a bit muddled lately. I apologize for being so imprecise. Perhaps… if you could tell me what a “normal” amount would be, and I could try to gauge if I’m exceeding that? I'm truly trying to be helpful, Doctor. It's just... the details escape me.
DOCTOR: Well, a reasonable intake is generally around eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Tea does count, to an extent, but it can also have… other effects. Now, is there any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Eight glasses… yes, that sounds like a good benchmark. I don't think I consistently reach that, to be honest. Probably closer to six on most days, if I'm estimating correctly. And no, thankfully, no pain or burning. It's not that kind of discomfort. It’s just… the frequency. It’s like I barely finish emptying my bladder before I feel the urge to go again. It’s… unsettling, and rather inconvenient. I do feel a bit of pressure sometimes, though. A dull ache, low in my abdomen. But it’s not constant, and it’s not severe. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Pressure… Dull ache. And how often are we talking, here?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… difficult to quantify. It's not every time I go to the bathroom, but… several times a day, certainly. Perhaps four or five times, minimum? It’s worse in the evenings, I think. And sometimes it wakes me up at night. Perhaps once or twice a week. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit all of this, Doctor. It feels so… trivial, and yet it’s deeply disruptive. I keep hoping it will just… resolve itself, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… no, Doctor. Not currently. I am divorced, as you may have noted in my file, and… I haven't been involved with anyone for some time now. It’s… been a difficult transition, and I haven’t prioritized that aspect of my life. Is that relevant? I apologize for the personal nature of the question.
DOCTOR: Just routine, dear. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vaginal discharge?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. That’s… quite a personal question, isn’t it? I… I honestly don’t pay very close attention. I suppose… no. Nothing obvious. I haven’t noticed any unusual odor or color. It’s… it’s just not something I routinely check, if I’m being honest. I apologize for my lack of… detail. Is this a symptom of something serious? You’re starting to worry me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, everything is a symptom of something, dear. And let's be realistic, you are rather thin. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… yes, actually. Now that you mention it. I… I have lost a little weight. Not intentionally, of course. My appetite hasn’t been very good lately, and I’ve been feeling quite stressed. It’s… it’s been a difficult year. Perhaps five or six pounds? It doesn’t sound like much, but I’ve noticed my clothes feel a bit looser. I hadn’t connected that to this… this issue. Is that… concerning? You’re making me quite anxious, Doctor. I came here hoping for a simple solution, and now… I’m worried it’s something much more serious.
DOCTOR: Stress doesn’t cause frequent urination, dear. Now, have you been having any bowel changes?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness, Doctor. That’s… quite direct. Bowel changes? Well… I… occasionally a bit of constipation, if I'm being honest. Nothing major, usually resolves with a bit of extra water. And sometimes… sometimes a bit of diarrhea, but that's rare. I wouldn't say it’s a consistent problem. I attributed that to… well, stress, actually. And perhaps my diet. I do eat a lot of… salads. Is that relevant? I feel like we're going in circles here, and I'm becoming increasingly concerned. Are you suspecting something serious, Doctor? I would appreciate some clarity.
DOCTOR: Let’s be frank, dear. You’re underweight, you’re experiencing frequent urination, bowel changes, unintentional weight loss… and you’re vague about everything. It could be a number of things. But we need to rule out some possibilities. I’m going to order a urine analysis, a complete blood count, and a stool sample. And I think we should schedule a pelvic exam as well.
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. A… a pelvic exam? All of that… sounds very invasive. And… rather frightening, actually. Is it… is it absolutely necessary? I… I hadn’t anticipated this at all. I was hoping for something simple, perhaps a change in diet or some medication. I’m… I’m quite anxious, Doctor. And frankly, a little embarrassed. Is there… is there any other way to investigate this? Perhaps a different kind of test? I’m not sure I’m comfortable with all of this.
DOCTOR: Look, dear, I understand your discomfort, but we need to be thorough. It's standard procedure. We need to rule out infection, hormonal imbalances, and… other possibilities. A simple blood test won't cut it. If you want a diagnosis, you have to cooperate. I’ll schedule the pelvic exam for next week. In the meantime, the lab orders are being sent electronically to the lab down the street. It's simple. Now, do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Next week… yes. Very well. I… suppose I have no other choice. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Although… could you perhaps explain the procedure a little more? Just… to ease my anxiety. What exactly does a pelvic exam involve? And… will it be painful? I apologize for my incessant questioning. I just… I've always been rather squeamish. And I'm deeply uncomfortable with… well, with all of this. Could I… could I bring someone with me for support?
DOCTOR: It involves a visual examination of your external genitalia, followed by an internal examination using a speculum and a brief manual examination. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. And yes, you can bring someone with you for support. Now, are you on any medications?
PATIENT: Oh. That… that doesn’t sound too terrible, I suppose. A visual examination and… a speculum. Yes. That’s… manageable. Thank you for explaining. And no, Doctor. I’m not on any medications. I haven’t required anything regularly for years. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally, for headaches. Nothing else. I’m generally quite healthy, otherwise. Well, aside from all of this, of course. I’m… I’m relieved to hear I can bring someone with me. That will… help a great deal. Is there anything else I should know before the appointment? Any special preparations I need to make? I want to be as prepared as possible.
DOCTOR: Avoid sexual intercourse and douching for 24 hours before the exam. And come with a full bladder; it helps with the ultrasound. I'll have the receptionist schedule you for next Tuesday at 10 AM. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10 AM… yes, that will work. No sexual intercourse or douching, full bladder… I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that covers everything. Although… one final question, if you don’t mind. What if… what if something is seriously wrong? What are the potential outcomes? I’d rather be prepared for the worst, even if it’s unlikely. I appreciate your honesty, Doctor. It will help me… cope.
DOCTOR: Look, dear, let's not get ahead of ourselves. We don't know anything yet. But potential outcomes could range from a simple infection that's easily treated with antibiotics to… other, more complex issues requiring further investigation and treatment. It's best not to dwell on the negative possibilities. We'll address any concerns as they arise. Now, here are your lab orders. I expect you to follow the instructions carefully, and I’ll see you next Tuesday. Please, try to relax. It's likely nothing serious. .
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Thank you, Doctor. I… I’ll try to relax. And I will follow the instructions carefully. Thank you again for your time and… your honesty. .
