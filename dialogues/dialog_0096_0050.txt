DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. Or is it Brodie?
PATIENT: Brodie. Yes, Brodie is fine. Though… folks used to call me Bro back in the shop. It’s been a while since anyone asked. Is that… is that Dr. Burlingham? You have a kind face.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. Dr. Burlingham will do just fine. Now, Mr. Brodie, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, this cough. It just… won’t go away. Been going on for… well, a long time now, I reckon. Feels like something stuck in my throat, but there ain't nothing to cough up, you see? Just… dry. Very dry. It gets worse at night, keeps my wife… used to keep my wife up. She’s gone now, though. Didn't mean to… ramble.
DOCTOR: A long time, you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months, I suppose. Maybe closer to a year? Hard to say, really. Time… it kinda blurs together when you get to be my age. I just figured it was… old age. Or the dust from the shop, maybe. Worked in auto body for… well, a lifetime. Lots of sanding.
DOCTOR: A year is… quite a while to have a cough, Mr. Brodie. And auto body work… yes, that dust could certainly be a factor. Do you notice anything else accompanying the cough?
PATIENT: Accompanying…? Let me think… I get… a little tired easier, I suppose. But that’s just getting old, right? And sometimes, when I walk up the stairs… I get a little breathless. Not bad, just… a little winded. Nothing I haven't lived with for years. Used to be able to run up those stairs two at a time, but those days are long gone. Does that… does that count?
DOCTOR: A little more breathless… and the fatigue. Alright. Have you noticed any fever, chills, night sweats, or any weight loss, Mr. Brodie?
PATIENT: No… no fever, not that I know of. And I don't sweat much at night. Not anymore, anyway. As for weight… I think I’ve lost a little, but it’s hard to tell. My wife always cooked for me, kept me well-fed. Since she’s been gone… I just don’t have much appetite, I guess. I eat when I remember, but it’s not like it used to be. Not much reason to, anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Medications… not really. Doc gave me somethin’ for my knee a few years back, but I didn't like how it made me feel, so I stopped taking it. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get poison ivy pretty bad when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. I haven't run into anything lately that bothered me. No, I don't think so. I'm pretty sturdy, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brodie. I'd like to listen to your lungs, and then I'll take your blood pressure and pulse. Just so we have a better understanding of what's going on. If you could just loosen your shirt, please.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sure, sure. Take your time, Doc. It's a little chilly in here, isn't it? My old bones feel everything these days. Just let me know if you need me to… I don’t know… hold my breath or somethin’. I get a little confused sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brodie. Deep breath in… and out… again… and again. I'm hearing some… diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, and a slight… wheezing. Blood pressure is 140 over 85, and pulse is 88. Now, I'd also like to check your oxygen saturation. Let's see here… 92%. That's a little low, Mr. Brodie.
PATIENT: Diminished… wheezing… oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Ninety-two… is that bad? My wife always said I turned a little blue when I got a bad cold, but that was just a little sniffle. What does this all mean, Doc? I don’t want to end up in the hospital, I just want to get this cough cleared up.
DOCTOR: It means we need to investigate a bit further, Mr. Brodie. Given your age, your history of working with auto body, and these findings, I’m concerned about possible COPD – Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease – or even something like pneumonia. Now, I’m going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. And I want you to do a simple blood test to check for infection. Do you understand?
PATIENT: COPD…? Pneumonia…? Oh dear, those are big words, Doc. I… I don’t think I understand. Auto body…? Is that from the dust? And a chest X-ray… is that safe? I… I don't like hospitals. I just want this cough to go away. What will the blood test tell you? Are you sure it’s somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brodie, I understand you’re concerned. The auto body dust can certainly contribute to lung problems. The X-ray uses very little radiation and will help us see what's going on inside your lungs. And the blood test will tell us if you have an infection. It’s better to be safe and rule things out. It's possible it's nothing serious, but at your age, we need to be thorough. We need to find out what’s causing your cough and shortness of breath. Now, I’m going to have the nurse take you down for the X-ray and blood draw. After that, we’ll talk about the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, I guess so. If you think it's best. My wife… she always said I should listen to the doctors. Just… try to be quick, okay? And… and could the nurse explain it all to me again? I get a little lost with all the big words.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brodie. I’ll speak to the nurse and make sure she explains everything clearly. We’ll get this sorted out. I’ll see you shortly. Let’s get started. Nurse, could you please come in here?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Lead the way. .
