DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Woodring, is it?
PATIENT: Yes. Look, can we just get this over with? I have things to do. It’s been… well, it’s been awful, and frankly, I’ve already been to a doctor about this. Twice.
DOCTOR: Twice, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Both times they just told me it was a bug and to drink more fluids. Honestly, it felt like a waste of my time and money. This has been going on for weeks. It's not just a little upset stomach, you know? It’s… disruptive. I run a business. I can’t be running to the bathroom all day.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, yes. Well, we’ll see if we can get to the bottom of this. Perhaps those doctors didn't fully investigate. Tell me, what exactly is happening?
PATIENT: Ugh, what isn't happening? I'm going to the bathroom constantly. Like, ten times a day, easy. It's… watery. And it just comes on suddenly, usually after I eat anything. Doesn’t matter what it is anymore. It used to be just spicy food, but now… even toast sometimes. And I feel weak. Just generally awful. I’m trying to stay hydrated, but it's exhausting.
DOCTOR: Ten times a day… and watery, regardless of diet. And weakness. Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No. No blood. Look, I’m not a delicate flower, okay? I know what blood looks like. It’s just… everything is going through me. It's embarrassing, frankly. And inconvenient. I’m starting to dread eating.
DOCTOR: Alright, no blood. And it's impacting your appetite. Have you had a fever, or any nausea or vomiting alongside this?
PATIENT: No fever. No vomiting. Just… this. Constant… urgency. And the weakness. It’s like all my energy is going into… well, you know. I'm starting to lose weight too, I think. Though, honestly, I haven't weighed myself. Too depressing.
DOCTOR: No fever, no vomiting, and weight loss... or perceived weight loss. Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Look, I’m generally healthy. I've always been… robust. I had the usual childhood things, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing major. My husband… well, he had a heart condition, but that’s not relevant. I don't have any allergies. And I don’t take any medications. I prefer to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: No significant medical history, no allergies, no medications. Good. Do you have any family history of digestive issues?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not that I know of. My mother was… particular about her diet, let’s put it that way. Always bragging about her ‘clean’ eating. But no one had… this. None of my siblings have this either. It just came on suddenly, out of nowhere. Which is why I’m here, wasting my time, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: What do you need to know, exactly? I run a painting business. I’m busy. I don’t… socialize much. I mean, I have a few clients, but that’s not really… socializing. And I certainly don’t… well. My husband passed away two years ago. I don’t drink or smoke. Never have. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: No alcohol, no tobacco. Widowed two years ago. Painting business. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your abdomen, just to get a baseline. If you could lie down on the exam table, please.
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful. Another waste of time. Fine. But if this isn’t going to be productive, I’m leaving. Just hurry it up, please.
DOCTOR: If you could lie on your back, with your knees bent. And relax as much as possible. I’m listening for… any unusual sounds. Normal bowel sounds are… well, they sound like gurgling. These… are quite active. Increased bowel sounds. And slightly tender to palpation in the lower abdomen, on both sides. No guarding or rebound tenderness at this time. Pulse is 88 and regular. Blood pressure is 118 over 76. Temperature is normal.
PATIENT: Well? What does that mean? Is it something? Because I swear, if you tell me it’s just a bug again…
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things. Increased bowel sounds and tenderness suggest some inflammation in the digestive tract. But it's not conclusive. Given your history of weeks of symptoms, and the fact that other treatments haven't been effective, I think we need to run some tests. I'm going to order a stool sample – to check for infection and parasites. And a blood test – to look for signs of inflammation and rule out other possibilities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More waiting? Honestly, this is ridiculous. But fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I need a container for… that. And when can I expect results? I don't have all day, you know. I have a business to run.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Here's a container and instructions for the stool sample. We'll need a small amount – about the size of a walnut. And the blood test will be drawn right here in the clinic. The results typically take 3-5 business days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. In the meantime, I recommend sticking to bland foods – toast, rice, bananas – to minimize irritation. And continue to hydrate. It's not ideal, but… hopefully, we can get some answers soon. I’m also noting a referral to a gastroenterologist, just in case it turns out to be something more complex.
PATIENT: Gastroenterologist? Wonderful. More specialists. Just what I need. Fine. 3-5 days. I’ll try the bland food. But if I don’t see any improvement, I’m finding another doctor. Don’t bother walking me out. I know where the door is.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will show you where to draw the blood. .
