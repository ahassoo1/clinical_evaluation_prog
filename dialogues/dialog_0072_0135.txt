DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Hembrey. It is good to meet you also. I have… a problem with my ear. It is leaking something. It started maybe… one week ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, a problem with your ear, leaking something for about a week. Can you describe what this "something" looks like?
PATIENT: It is… not water. It is… yellowish. And a little bit… sticky. Not much, but… enough to bother me. I try to clean it, but it keeps coming back. It does not hurt, exactly… just… uncomfortable. Like something is in there.
DOCTOR: Yellowish and sticky, and you've been trying to clean it out. And it's causing discomfort, feeling like something is in there, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… correct. It is a strange feeling. I have never had this happen before. I am… careful with my ears, usually. I do not put anything in them. Just… clean the outside with a cloth.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you say you haven't inserted anything into the ear canal itself?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing goes in. Only… the cloth, on the outside. Very gently. I am… old enough to know better than to put things in my ears. My mother… she always warned me about that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. My hearing… it is a little… muffled, maybe. Not very bad, but… not as sharp as usual. And… sometimes I feel a little… dizzy. Not falling down dizzy, just… a little off balance. It happens when I stand up quickly, maybe.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing and occasional dizziness upon standing. Do you have any pain in your ear currently, or have you experienced any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Not at all. And no fever, no chills. I feel… normal otherwise. Just… this ear. And the dizziness is not… frequent. Maybe once a day, when I get up too fast. I eat well, I sleep well. I do not understand why this is happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, I had the usual childhood sicknesses, I think. Measles, mumps… things like that. Long time ago. As an adult… I had my blood pressure checked, sometimes. It is usually… okay. And I had a problem with my knee, many years ago, but it is fixed now. I do not take any medicines, regularly. Just… sometimes aspirin, for a headache. And I had… a divorce, about ten years ago. Is that… medical history?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Radillo, that is not what I meant. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… let me see. No, I do not think so. Not for anything… serious. When my son was born, maybe, but only for a short time. And… a small cut on my hand, when I was a young man. Nothing… major. I am usually… healthy. I try to be. Is this… important? You think this ear is something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s important for me to have a complete picture of your health, Mr. Radillo. Now, have you ever had any problems with your ears before this current issue?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. Not even as a child. No ear infections, no ringing, no nothing. This is… new. Completely new. It is… worrying me, to be honest. I do not like this feeling. It is… unsettling. And I do not want to lose my hearing. I need my hearing. I am a teacher, you see. I need to hear my students.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Radillo, it would be best to take a look at your ear. If you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a quick examination. It will just involve using an otoscope to look inside your ear canal. And I’ll listen to your heart and lungs as well, just to get a general sense of things. Please have a seat and lean forward.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. Whatever you think is best. I will do as you say. Leaning forward… is that alright? Do I need to… do anything special? I will try to be very still. I want this to be over with, quickly, if that is possible. This… makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Mr. Radillo. Just try to relax. I will be as quick as possible. Hmm… Yes, I see some… inflammation and a small amount of yellowish discharge. Your tympanic membrane—that’s your eardrum—appears slightly… clouded. It’s not ruptured, thankfully. It appears you have a mild case of otitis externa – an outer ear infection, or swimmer's ear, though you don't have to be a swimmer to get it. The inflammation is causing the discomfort and discharge. Your hearing is slightly diminished, but not severely. I suspect a bacterial infection.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? Swimmer’s ear? But I do not swim! I told you, I have never had problems with my ears before. Is this… serious? Will I go deaf? What do we do about it, Doctor? Do I need… pills? Or something stronger? This is… frightening. I need to hear my students. Very important.
DOCTOR: Mr. Radillo, as I said, you do not have to be a swimmer to develop otitis externa. It’s caused by bacteria or fungi entering the ear canal, often due to moisture or irritation. It’s not typically serious, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left untreated, could lead to complications, though that's unlikely in your case. As for going deaf, no, you will not go deaf. I’m going to prescribe you ear drops – a topical antibiotic/corticosteroid combination. It's very important that you follow the instructions carefully. You will need to instill these drops in your affected ear twice daily for seven days. Avoid getting water in your ear during this time. Also, I advise against using cotton swabs or any other objects in your ear, as that can further irritate the canal. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. My wife… she always remembered those things. But she is… gone now. I have never had a bad reaction to any medicine. Aspirin is fine, sometimes. And I take vitamins, occasionally. But nothing… serious. So, just the ear drops? Twice a day for seven days? No cotton swabs? And avoid water… difficult, in the summer. I teach outside sometimes. But I will try. Very important. Will these drops… make me dizzy? I need to be steady on my feet.
DOCTOR: No, the ear drops should not make you dizzy. The medication is applied directly to the ear canal and isn’t absorbed into the bloodstream in significant quantities. However, if you experience any unusual side effects, such as increased pain, redness, or hearing loss, discontinue use and contact me immediately. Here is the prescription for the ear drops and these instructions. Please read them carefully. If your symptoms don’t improve after seven days, or if they worsen, you will need to come back for a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Hembrey. This… is helpful. Seven days, no cotton swabs, watch for bad side effects. I will be very careful. I do… have one question, if you do not mind. Will this… come back? Is this something I will have to deal with… often? I do not want this to happen again. My teaching… it is very important to me. I need my ears.
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say with certainty, Mr. Radillo. The recurrence of otitis externa depends on various factors, including your ear anatomy and hygiene practices. Keeping your ears clean and dry, and avoiding excessive moisture, can help prevent future infections. If you are prone to this, you may consider using earplugs when showering or swimming, despite you not swimming. I recommend regular cleaning of the outer ear with a washcloth after showering, but avoid inserting anything into the ear canal itself. If you experience frequent recurrences, we can discuss preventative measures further at a follow-up appointment. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
