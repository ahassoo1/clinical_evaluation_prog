DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need a checkup for a team tryout. Gotta make sure I'm good to go, you know? Don't want any surprises when I start running around.
DOCTOR: A team tryout, at your age?
PATIENT: Hey, age is just a number, right? I keep myself in shape. It's a… well, it's a local team. Not the Olympics or anything. But I still wanna be sure. Don't wanna pull a muscle first five minutes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll need to go through a standard physical assessment, then. Let's start with your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I usually just… deal with things. This is kinda the first time I've needed something official like this. I haven’t been sick much, thankfully. Mostly just aches and pains like anyone else. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: It matters a great deal. Lack of regular check-ups means we don't have a baseline for comparison. Any significant illnesses ever?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a kid, I had a really bad fever. Almost didn't make it, my mom said. But that was… a long time ago. Besides that, nothing serious I can remember. Broken bones here and there, sprains… stuff from just being active. Is that what you mean by “significant”?
DOCTOR: No, not just broken bones. Anything chronic?
PATIENT: Chronic? You mean… something that lasts a long time? Honestly, no. I don’t think so. Sometimes my knees ache a bit in the cold, but that’s just… old age, I guess. Everyone gets that, right? Not a problem problem.
DOCTOR: “Everyone gets that” isn't a medical diagnosis, Mr. Kingan. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I haven't taken much medication in my life, to be honest. Maybe a painkiller or two for a bad headache. Never had a reaction. But I wouldn't swear on it. I just… don't really keep track of that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Just… water, mostly. I try to drink a lot of water. And… well, sometimes a bit of fermented mare's milk, but that's more of a… cultural thing, not really medicine. Does that count? It's good for you, or so my grandmother always said.
DOCTOR: Fermented mare's milk… Right. Let’s move on to your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, both gone now. Mom passed away about fifteen years ago, Dad before that. Both lived pretty long lives, all things considered. They weren't exactly… healthy eaters, if that matters. Lots of meat, not much green stuff. And Dad smoked for a long time. But no… no major illnesses on either side that I know of. Just… old age stuff. Heart problems, I think, with Mom eventually. But I wasn’t really involved in their medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Tried it once when I was a young man, didn't like it. Alcohol… maybe a beer with friends sometimes. Not much, not a regular thing. And definitely no… recreational drugs. Never been my thing. I need a clear head for… things. Especially for this tryout. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Let's move on to a physical examination, then. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Let's get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get back to training. Hope this doesn’t take too long. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: 129 pounds at 183 centimeters. That is… quite low for your height. Let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just… try to be quick, Doctor. I'm not exactly comfortable with all this poking and prodding. I just want to know if I’m fit enough to play, not get a full body inspection. But fine, whatever you need. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but somewhat faint. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Slightly diminished resonance. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Don’t hit me too hard though. I need those reflexes for the tryout, you know. And please, tell me if anything seems… wrong. Don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… sluggish. And diminished. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Mr. Kingan, have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm… now that you mention it… maybe a little. I haven’t been eating as much lately. Been focusing on training, you know? But I thought it was just… because I'm busy. It’s not like I’m wasting away or anything. Is that… bad? It's just a few pounds, right? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: A few pounds can be significant in your case, given your already low weight. And sluggish reflexes, diminished resonance… I am concerned about possible muscle wasting, and your overall nutritional status. I would like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, and a basic metabolic panel. We also need to check your vitamin D levels and thyroid function. And, Mr. Kingan, I strongly advise against participating in this tryout until we have these results back. It could be dangerous.
PATIENT: Blood work? Dangerous? Look, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, but this is just a local team. It's not the NFL. I'm just trying to stay active. Fine, fine. Do the blood work. But if it takes too long, I'm going to the tryout anyway. I just don’t have time for all this. What do I even need to do? Where do I go? Just tell me the simplest thing possible, alright? I'm not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Here. Take this to the lab at County General Hospital. It's about ten miles from here. Fasting blood work – meaning you can't eat or drink anything but water for eight hours before the test. They will draw about two vials of blood. The results should be back in 48-72 hours. I will call you with the results as soon as they are available. And Mr. Kingan, I strongly advise you not to push yourself physically until we have a better understanding of what’s going on. This isn't about whether you're trying out for the NFL. It’s about your health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. No eating, got it. County General, got it. Look, I understand you're just doing your job, Doctor. But I gotta tell you, this is a real inconvenience. I'll go get the blood work done. But don’t expect me to sit around twiddling my thumbs while I wait. Just call me when you have something… useful. And please, don’t lecture me again.
