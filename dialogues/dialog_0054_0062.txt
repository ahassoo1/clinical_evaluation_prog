DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks, and I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and it’s… well, it’s causing a bit of a problem, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, you're seeking a medical exemption from the mask requirement at your job as a Protective Service Worker. That's perfectly reasonable to discuss. To help me understand the situation and determine if an exemption is appropriate, could you tell me a little more about why wearing a mask is causing a problem for you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s not that I want to be exempt, understand. I take safety very seriously in my line of work. However, I find that wearing a mask… it makes it difficult to communicate. A large part of my job relies on reading people, understanding their emotions, and building trust quickly. The masks hide a lot of that. It’s especially important when working with vulnerable individuals, and I worry about misinterpreting signals or causing undue stress simply because they can’t see my full face. I’ve noticed it affects my ability to de-escalate situations, and frankly, it makes me anxious that I might miss something crucial.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Knabenshue. Communication is absolutely key in your field, and I can see how a mask could hinder that, especially when building rapport and assessing someone’s emotional state. It’s good you’re aware of how it impacts your performance and are proactively addressing it. To get a better picture, could you tell me a bit more about when this became a problem?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, the mask requirement itself wasn’t sudden. It started, I believe, in late March of this year, as a precaution with a new strain going around. At first, I thought I could adjust. But it quickly became apparent it wasn’t as simple as just getting used to it. I’d say within the first couple of weeks, I noticed a definite decline in my ability to connect with the people I’m assisting. There were a couple of instances where I misread a situation, thankfully nothing serious, but enough to make me very concerned. That’s when I started thinking I needed to explore options, and a colleague suggested speaking with a doctor about a possible exemption. It’s been increasingly difficult since then, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been roughly four months since the requirement started, and you've noticed a progressively worsening impact on your ability to communicate effectively. And you've had a couple of specific instances where you felt it led to misinterpretations. That’s helpful to know. Now, outside of the communication difficulties, are you experiencing any other symptoms when wearing the mask?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Aside from the trouble with communication, there’s… a physical discomfort. It’s not severe, but it’s there. I find it a bit difficult to breathe, especially when I’m exerting myself – which happens quite frequently in my line of work. It’s not like I’m gasping for air, but it’s enough to make me feel lightheaded sometimes, and it adds to the overall anxiety. I also get a bit of a headache behind my eyes after wearing it for extended periods. It's not debilitating, but it's definitely noticeable. I hadn’t initially connected it to the mask, but I’ve been paying closer attention lately, and it seems to consistently happen when I’m wearing one for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have communication difficulties, some physical discomfort including mild breathlessness, lightheadedness, and headaches related to prolonged mask use. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m generally a healthy man, as far as I know. I don’t have any major chronic illnesses. I had pneumonia when I was a boy, but I fully recovered. I don’t take any regular medications. I had my appendix removed when I was younger, but that was many years ago and caused no lasting problems. I’ve never been diagnosed with asthma or any other respiratory condition. I get a yearly physical, and the last one, in January, showed everything was normal. I’ve never had any issues with allergies, either. I do have slightly high blood pressure, but it’s well-managed with diet and exercise, and my doctor hasn’t prescribed any medication for it. That’s pretty much it, I think. A fairly unremarkable medical history, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Knabenshue. A generally healthy history with well-controlled blood pressure is reassuring. No history of respiratory issues is also helpful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question, Doctor. My mother passed away several years ago from heart disease, unfortunately. My father has type 2 diabetes, and he’s been managing it for quite some time. My older brother has high cholesterol, but other than that, there aren't any major inherited conditions that I’m aware of. There's a history of high blood pressure on my mother’s side of the family, and I suspect that’s likely where I get it from. Beyond that, my family has generally been quite healthy, and long-lived, thankfully. I do have some distant relatives with arthritis, but that’s about it. It's not a long list, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. That's good information to have. Now, just to cover all bases, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve never been a smoker, and I rarely drink alcohol. I might have a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that’s it. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I believe in keeping my body as healthy as possible, and I avoid those types of things altogether. I've always been very mindful of my health, and I try to make responsible choices.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's excellent. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no drug use. Very good. Now, Mr. Knabenshue, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears just to rule out anything obvious that might be contributing to your discomfort. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I understand the importance of a thorough examination, and I appreciate you taking the time to do so. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. If you could just sit back and relax. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Okay, your heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear, but I do notice a slightly elevated respiratory rate. Now, let me check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little higher than ideal, but not drastically so. And finally, let’s take a quick look at your throat and ears. Throat looks clear, no signs of inflammation. Ears are also clear. Everything appears normal on the quick exam. So, physically, everything seems within normal limits. The slightly elevated respiratory rate could be a response to the anxiety surrounding the mask, or simply from talking. The blood pressure is a bit elevated, but given your history, it’s not entirely unexpected.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. I do tend to get anxious easily, so it’s possible that’s contributing to the elevated respiratory rate. And I’ve been a bit stressed lately with this mask issue, so that could certainly be playing a role in my blood pressure. I manage it well normally, but stress does tend to affect it. So, what does this all mean, in your professional opinion? Do you think an exemption is a possibility?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. Based on the history and the physical exam, it seems unlikely there’s an underlying medical condition causing your discomfort. Your symptoms – the communication difficulties, mild breathlessness, headaches, and anxiety – are all plausible responses to wearing a mask, particularly in your profession where clear communication is so vital. However, simply stating that you feel anxious isn't sufficient for a medical exemption, unfortunately. Most organizations require more objective evidence. We could explore some options to gather that. We could consider a simple spirometry test to objectively measure your lung function, although I anticipate it will be normal. We could also discuss a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist to assess for anxiety and document its impact on your ability to perform your job. Alternatively, if your organization allows for accommodations rather than exemptions, we could explore the use of a different type of mask – perhaps one with a wider fit or better ventilation – or even a face shield as a potential alternative. Would you be open to any of these options?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot to consider, Doctor. I understand the need for objective evidence, and I appreciate you laying out the options so clearly. A spirometry test sounds reasonable, if it helps to rule things out. I’m less keen on a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist, frankly. I don’t believe I suffer from severe anxiety that requires professional intervention, and I’m concerned about the stigma associated with it. I’m more inclined towards exploring the possibility of accommodations, if that’s feasible. Perhaps a different type of mask or a face shield could be a good compromise. Would you be willing to write a letter to my employer outlining my difficulties and recommending those accommodations, based on our conversation and the examination? I understand it might not guarantee an exemption, but it could at least open the door for a discussion.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Knabenshue, I’m certainly willing to do that. I understand your hesitation regarding a referral, and I agree that exploring accommodations is a reasonable first step. I can write a letter outlining your difficulties with mask-wearing, detailing the impact on your communication skills and potential for misinterpretation in your professional role, and recommending a trial period with a different type of mask or a face shield. I will document the normal findings of the physical exam and spirometry to indicate there’s no underlying medical condition contributing to your discomfort. To proceed with the spirometry test, we can do that here in the clinic today, if you’d like. It's a simple breathing test that takes about 10-15 minutes. Alternatively, if you’d prefer to skip that step, I can draft the letter based on our conversation and examination alone. What’s your preference?
PATIENT: I think… let’s skip the spirometry test, Doctor. If you feel comfortable writing the letter based on our conversation and the examination, I trust your professional judgment. I’d rather avoid unnecessary testing if it’s not absolutely essential. I appreciate you being so understanding and accommodating. It gives me a bit of hope that we can find a reasonable solution. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m happy to do that. I’ll draft a letter outlining your concerns, the normal findings of the examination, and recommending a trial period with a different type of mask or a face shield. I’ll have my assistant print it out for you before you leave. Just to be clear, the letter will state that, based on my medical assessment, you are experiencing difficulties with mask-wearing that could potentially impact your ability to effectively perform your job as a Protective Service Worker, and that I recommend exploring accommodations to mitigate those difficulties. It will not guarantee an exemption, but it should provide a solid foundation for a discussion with your employer. Do you have any questions for me before I proceed with drafting the letter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable and I appreciate your thorough explanation. You've addressed all my concerns. I don't have any further questions at this time. I’m very grateful for your time and assistance. I truly appreciate you taking my concerns seriously and being so willing to help. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have my assistant bring the letter to you shortly. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any further concerns, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that will be all. Thank you once more for everything. I’m confident we've taken the necessary steps to address the situation. I appreciate your professionalism and compassion. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I wish you all the best in your discussions with your employer. Have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. .
