DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s about my waterworks, I suppose. They’ve been botherin’ me again. It’s…difficult to explain, really. It happens every few months, I think. I just...feel unwell when I need to go.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Bothering" is a good way to put it. It sounds like this has been an ongoing issue for some time. Could you elaborate on what you mean by “unwell”?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, it’s not…a pleasant feeling, that’s for certain. A bit of a burnin’ sensation, mostly. And I have to go quite often, even when I haven’t had much to drink. It's…uncomfortable, to say the least. I don’t rightly remember when it started, though. A long time ago, I expect.
DOCTOR: A burning sensation and increased frequency… Alright. And would you say this happens all day, or is it more pronounced at certain times?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's…hard to say, really. It seems worse at night, maybe? I wake up several times to go. And then, sometimes during the day it's just…constant. Not severe, you understand. Just…present. It’s frustrating, more than anything. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wease. Frequent urination, especially at night, and that persistent discomfort… that does sound bothersome. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, no, thankfully not. Not that I recall, anyway. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, so I…I wouldn't necessarily see it. And back pain…well, I have a bit of a bad back generally, from all the bendin' over at work. But I wouldn't say it’s related to this waterworks trouble. It’s just…old age, I expect.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what sort of work do you do, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Oh, I fix…things with wheels. Recreational vehicles, they call 'em. Campers, mostly. Lots of bendin’ and reachin’. It's…physical work. Been doin' it for…well, a long time. I suppose I should retire, but...what else would I do?
DOCTOR: That sounds like demanding work indeed. And I understand completely about wanting to stay active. Now, let’s go through a bit more of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… I…I had something once. Years ago. The doctor…he gave me pills for a bit. But I don't rightly recall what it was for. My memory…it’s just not what it used to be. I haven't been to a doctor in…well, it’s been a long time. I try to stay healthy, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to forget details over time, especially if it was a while ago. We'll do our best to piece things together. Do you recall if you've ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital…oh, yes. A long time ago. When I was young. It was…my appendix, I think. But it was so long ago, I don’t remember much about it. Just…a lot of white walls and people in uniforms. It wasn’t pleasant. I try to avoid hospitals if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal many years ago. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family…oh, my daughter. She lives in another city. And…I had a husband, but we’re…divorced now. It was a long time ago. As for illnesses…I don’t rightly recall anyone in my family havin' problems like this, but… I wasn't very close to them.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not that I know of. I can take most pills, I think. I used to take something for my…arthritis, maybe? But I stopped takin’ it a while ago. It didn't seem to do much good.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, Ms. Wease, I’d like to ask about your current medications. Aside from the arthritis medication you previously mentioned, are you taking any other pills, creams, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, no. Just… vitamins, sometimes. A multi-vitamin, mostly. I try to eat healthy, but you never know what you’re missin’. That’s all. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not a complicated case. I just want this waterworks trouble to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. And I appreciate you being so open with me. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. It will just involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a simple urine test. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A test? Well...I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have things to do, you see. But…yes. Go ahead. But please be quick, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. Please lie back on the examination table. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Alright. Everything sounds normal there. Now I'll check your reflexes. Just relax your legs. And those are normal as well. Now, we just need a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup, and I’ll leave the room for a moment to allow you privacy. When you're finished, just let me know, and I’ll collect the sample.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. A sample…yes. Very well. I’ll…try to be quick about it. Just…call out when you’re ready, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I’ll be just outside the door. Take your time, and let me know when you’ve collected the sample.
PATIENT: Alright…I think I’ve got it. Doctor?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wease. Excellent. Now we'll send this off to the lab for analysis. It will give us some more information about what might be causing your symptoms. It typically takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of a urinary tract infection, or possibly some bladder irritation. However, we need the lab results to confirm this.
PATIENT: An infection? Oh, dear. Is it serious, Doctor? I really don’t have time to be ill. I have a camper to fix! What does that mean, exactly? Bladder irritation?
DOCTOR: It's good that you're asking these questions, Ms. Wease. A urinary tract infection, or UTI, is quite common, especially in women. It's often caused by bacteria entering the urinary tract. It’s not usually serious if treated promptly, but can become more problematic if left unchecked. "Bladder irritation" simply means the bladder is inflamed or sensitive, which can cause the frequent urination and discomfort you’re experiencing. It can be caused by a variety of things, including infection, but also other factors. To be on the safe side, and to get a definitive answer, we’ll await the lab results. If the results confirm a UTI, we’ll start you on a course of antibiotics. If it’s something else, we'll discuss other possible causes and treatment options. I also recommend drinking plenty of fluids, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh. Antibiotics…those make me feel poorly, I recall. But…I suppose if I need them…Alright. Fluids, no caffeine… I can manage that. But…how long will these results take? And…what if it's not an infection? What then? I really don’t like being left in the dark, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wease, and I apologize for any anxiety this is causing you. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I will call you as soon as I have them, regardless of the time of day. If the results are negative for infection, we'll need to explore other possibilities. This could include further testing, such as a bladder ultrasound, or a referral to a urologist, a specialist in bladder and urinary tract problems. It's also possible that it could be related to something simpler, like a sensitivity to certain foods or irritants. I will keep you informed every step of the way, and we'll work together to figure out what's going on and get you feeling better. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain in your back or sides, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Emergency room…oh, dear. No, I don’t want to go to the emergency room! Alright. 2-3 days…I can wait, I suppose. No fever, no pain… I’ll remember that. Is there…anything else I should be doin' in the meantime? Any special teas, or…anything? I do like a good chamomile.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Ms. Wease. Chamomile tea is a good idea. It has calming properties and can help with bladder irritation. Cranberry juice is often recommended, but the evidence is mixed. Some people find it helpful, others don’t. It’s certainly won’t harm you, as long as you don’t have any medical conditions that prevent you from drinking it. The most important thing is to stay hydrated, and avoid caffeine, alcohol, and sugary drinks. And if you feel any burning sensation when you urinate, try to urinate immediately, rather than holding it in. I’ll write down these instructions for you, along with my phone number. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before I call with the lab results. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… very thoughtful of you, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don't think so. Just…please call me as soon as you have the results. I don't want to be left wonderin'. And…thank you again. You’ve been very patient with an old woman. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wease. It was my pleasure. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. And please, don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before then. Have a good day, and try to relax.
PATIENT: .
