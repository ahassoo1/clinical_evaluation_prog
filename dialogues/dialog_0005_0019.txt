DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Carlotta… yes, that is me. Hmm… well, my wife… she wants… a baby. We old, you know? But she says… maybe still can have. So we come to ask… is possible? I forget things… so maybe she explain better. But I want to know… is okay for me?
DOCTOR: A baby, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. A baby. She very hopeful. I… I work with metal, small things. Making models. Is good work, with my hands. But… maybe too old for baby-making? Is that… how you say? I not so strong like before. And sometimes… I forget where I put my tools!
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Carlotta, it’s good your wife is hopeful, but… let’s be realistic. At your age, and frankly, with your wife’s age as well, conceiving naturally is… highly unlikely. But we can certainly discuss options. First, let’s talk about you. You mentioned working with metal – any exposure to lead or other toxins?
PATIENT: Lead…? Hmm… maybe. Sometimes the metal… smells strong. Old metal. I not sure if lead… but we use many things to make shiny. And… sometimes I cut the metal, and the dust… goes everywhere. I wear mask, but… maybe still breathe some. Is bad? I forget what my boss say about the dust.
DOCTOR: Okay. Potential lead exposure is concerning. We’ll need to check your levels. And the dust… that's also something to consider. Now, beyond that, have you had any medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Medical problems…? Let me think… I had… something with my heart, many years ago. A little fast, sometimes. The doctor… gave me pills. I take them for a while. But… I not take them now. It was… a long time. And my back… aches. Old age, I think. I not fall, not break anything. Just… aches. And sometimes… I feel tired. Very tired. But who not tired?
DOCTOR: Alright. History of heart issues, back pain, and fatigue… Any surgeries, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm… I think… yes. Long ago. When I was young man, I had… something on my leg. Bad leg. They cut it open, fix it. I not remember much, it was very long time. In… Somalia, I think. Before I come here. They give me… many sleep. I wake up, leg better. That is all I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of leg surgery… And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My wife have… many children, from before. Good children. But… not my children. My family… far away. In Somalia. I not see them for many years. Many brothers and sisters. I think… some have heart problems. My mother… she die young. Something with… the blood, I think. My father… he live long time. Very strong man. But… I forget the details. It was long, long ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some family history of heart problems. Now, are you currently taking any medications, aside from those heart pills you used to take?
PATIENT: No… no pills now. Only… sometimes, when my back is very bad, I take something for the pain. From the store. Just… when I need. Is not every day. Small white pills, I think. I forget the name. My wife buys them. She remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to some physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological exam just to get a baseline. Then, we really need to get some blood work done. It's essential to check your overall health and those lead levels, given your work. If you could just sit up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. I sit. Blood work… is many needles? I not like needles. My wife says I faint easy. But… if you need… you do it. For the baby. For my wife.
DOCTOR: "A little faint, you say?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Not much. Just… when I see… the blood. And needles. My wife always laugh. She say I am big baby. Is that bad? Being big baby? My heart… is beating fast now, I think. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: “Mr. Carlotta, your heart rate is elevated, but that could be due to anxiety. Now, deep breaths. And I need you to be honest with me… Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? Hmm… I think… maybe. The doctor… long ago. When I was younger. He say… be careful with salt. And… not eat too much meat. But… I forget the details. It was a long time. My wife, she always cook healthy. She remember everything about the food. Is my blood pressure bad now?
DOCTOR: "Mr. Carlotta, your blood pressure is significantly elevated. 160/95. That is bad. And given your age, family history, and the fact that you previously had issues, this is a serious concern. Before we even think about your wife’s… aspirations, we need to get this under control. Frankly, attempting to conceive in your condition would be… irresponsible. I’m going to order a full lipid panel, a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and, of course, a lead level. And I want you to follow up with a cardiologist as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cardiologist…? Is that… heart doctor? My heart is very bad? I… I understand. Salt… no salt? And no… make baby? But… my wife… she wants… Is there nothing… can do? Even… just a little?
DOCTOR: "Mr. Carlotta, let's be realistic. At your age, with your current health status, the risks of attempting conception are substantial. I won't encourage it. We need to prioritize your well-being. I can refer you to a cardiologist for a comprehensive evaluation and discuss medication options to manage your blood pressure. Once that’s under control, then we can revisit the possibility of further testing. But right now, a baby is simply not a safe option. I’m going to write up these referrals, and my nurse will schedule those appointments for you.
