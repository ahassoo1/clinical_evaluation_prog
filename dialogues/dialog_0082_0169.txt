DOCTOR: Good morning, Derick. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. It's good to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doc. I guess… my face and legs are kinda puffed up. Been that way a bit now, not sure how long exactly. Feels… uncomfortable, mostly. It's not painful, you know? Just… swollen.
DOCTOR: Alright, swollen face and legs… and you said this has been going on for a bit. It's good you're noticing these things. "A bit" can mean different things to different people, so could you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. That's tough. Days, I reckon. Maybe a week? Longer? Time kinda… blurs together these days, especially since Martha… well, never mind that. It just feels like it's been a while, alright? Not like it happened yesterday. I just noticed it gettin' worse, slowly. It's hard to say when it started, exactly. Don't hold me to dates, I'm terrible with those.
DOCTOR: I understand, time can be tricky. No worries at all about the exact dates. So, it's been gradually getting worse over the past week or so. Is the swelling worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, I think it's worse in the evening. After I’ve been on my feet all day, you know? I do a bit of welding over at the old mill, and by the time I'm done for the day, my legs are really throbbing. And my face feels… tighter, fuller, I guess. It goes down a bit when I lie down, though. Not much, but some.
DOCTOR: Alright, so worse after activity, particularly standing or being on your feet, and improves somewhat with rest. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, amount, how often you’re going?
PATIENT: Urine… hmm. I haven’t been payin’ much attention to it, to be honest. Old man things, you know? I go when I need to go. Color seems… normal enough, I suppose. Not bright red or anything. Amount… well, the same as always, I think. I haven't been measuring it or nothin'. Why are you askin' about my… waterworks, Doc? Seems a bit personal, don't ya think?
DOCTOR: I apologize if that was a bit personal, Derick. It’s just that changes in urine can sometimes give us clues about what’s going on with swelling. We have to check all the boxes, so to speak. Now, let's switch gears a bit. Have you had any pain in your chest, shortness of breath, or had any trouble breathing at all?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. A little ache sometimes, but that's just my old bones creakin', I reckon. Welding ain't easy on the body, you know. Shortness of breath… well, I get a little winded climbin' the stairs, but that's been happening for years. Same old story. I’m not exactly a young man anymore. Trouble breathing… no, I don't think so. I can still yell at the TV just fine during hockey season, if that counts. Doc, are you thinkin' somethin' serious? My Martha, she always worried too much.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Derick. It's good you're thinking about these things. And I understand your concern, especially after losing Martha. We're just trying to get a complete picture. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. Not much change, I suppose. I still eat. Maybe not as much as I used to. Martha was a good cook, made me all sorts of things. I mostly just heat up some frozen dinners these days, don't have the energy for much else. I don’t really crave anything, if that makes sense. Food just… is. I eat when I’m hungry, nothin’ special. And I do have a bit of a sweet tooth, I can’t lie. A little piece of chocolate after dinner never hurt anyone. Does that matter, Doc? You're askin' a lot of questions about my habits.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Derick, thank you for sharing. Everything helps us build a clearer picture. A little chocolate is perfectly fine! Alright, let's talk about any other medical conditions you might have. Have you been diagnosed with anything in the past - diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yeah. Doc told me years ago, gave me some pills, but I stopped takin’ ‘em after a while. Didn’t seem to be doin’ much good, and Martha didn’t like all the side effects. Said they made me grumpy. Besides, I felt alright mostly. Never got properly diagnosed with anything else. Just the usual aches and pains, you know? Old age comin’ on, I reckon. I don’t go to doctors much. Never been a fan. They always poke and prod and tell you bad news.
DOCTOR: Alright, so diagnosed with high blood pressure in the past, but not currently taking medication. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was a long time ago, back in Sweden actually. And I was in the hospital for a few days once when I broke my arm fallin' off a ladder. But other than that, no. Never been much of a hospital person. And I definitely don't want to become one now. Is this gonna be a long examination, Doc? I got a hockey game to watch later, and I don’t want to miss the start of it.
DOCTOR: No, we're almost done with the questions, Derick. Just a few more, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Appendectomy and a broken arm… good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, Martha’s gone, like I said. We never had kids. Always meant to, but… things just didn't work out that way. My brother, Sven, he lives back in Sweden. Haven’t seen him in years. We write letters sometimes, but mostly just about the weather. He’s got a farm, sheep and cows and all that. Said it’s hard work. He always was the sensible one. My parents are both gone now, too. Been a long time. I’m mostly on my own these days. Makes things… quiet. Don’t really have anyone to worry about, or anyone to worry about me, I suppose. Doc, are you tryin’ to figure out if I'm gonna keel over any minute?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Derick. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your health history. Knowing your family history can sometimes help us understand things better. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had much trouble with anything. I eat pretty much whatever’s put in front of me. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the winter, but that’s just the dry air, I reckon. Martha used to say I was too stubborn to be allergic to anything. Said I’d probably eat a bee if it landed on my dinner plate. She wasn't wrong, probably. No, I don’t have any allergies that I know of, Doc. Can we get to the pokin’ and proddin’ part now? I’m startin’ to get a bit restless. And that game's gonna start soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Derick, we can do that. Just need to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your legs and face. It shouldn't take long. Would you mind lying down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let's get it over with. Just try not to poke too hard, alright? My bones ain't what they used to be. And tell me if you see somethin' scary, Doc. I don't want any surprises. The game's startin' in about twenty minutes, so let’s make it quick, yeah?
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath for me… and another one… good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can hear right now. Your lungs are clear, a little bit of normal breathing sounds but nothing concerning. Now, I’m going to take a look at your legs and face. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I notice some moderate swelling in both of your legs, particularly around your ankles and calves. Your face also shows some swelling, mostly around your eyes and cheeks. The skin feels warm to the touch, but there's no redness or any signs of injury. Your pulses are present and normal in both feet. Do you experience any pain when I press on these areas?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little tenderness, maybe, but no sharp pain. Just… feels full, you know? Like somethin's pushin' out. It's been gettin' worse like that, slowly. Just feels uncomfortable, like I said. It doesn’t hurt, it’s just… annoying. Like wearin' shoes that are a size too small. Doc, is this somethin’ serious? Are you gonna send me to the hospital? Because I really don't want to go to the hospital. I’ve got that hockey game, remember? I’ll miss the start if I’m gettin’ poked and prodded in a hospital bed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Derick. No, I’m not going to send you to the hospital right away. The swelling is concerning, but it doesn’t sound like an emergency. It's good that you don’t have any pain. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found during the examination, there could be several possibilities. It could be related to fluid retention, perhaps due to your kidneys not functioning optimally, or something affecting your circulation. The fact that you stopped taking your blood pressure medication is also something to consider. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests and a urine sample. These will help us check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any other underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… water samples? More pokin’ and proddin’, eh? Well, I suppose it's better than goin' to the hospital. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I really don't want to miss the first period of the game. And I don’t want to have to come back here again anytime soon. Where do I… do the water samples? Do I just… go to the bathroom? And what about the blood tests? How much blood are you gonna take? I get lightheaded easily. Doc, you gotta promise me this won’t take all day, yeah? And you gotta tell me if it’s somethin’ serious, even if it means bad news. I’d rather know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Derick. I promise I'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. For the urine sample, yes, you just need to go to the bathroom and collect a sample in the cup the nurse will provide. It's a very straightforward process. As for the blood tests, it's just a few vials of blood – maybe two or three. I'll make sure you're comfortable during the procedure and monitor you closely to prevent any lightheadedness. You can lie down during the blood draw if that makes you more comfortable. We'll send the samples to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss the findings and create a plan. I'll be honest with you, even if the news isn't what we want to hear. We'll figure this out together. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible and limiting your salt intake. That can help reduce the swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Elevate my legs… and less salt? Alright, alright. I can try. I used to put a lot of salt on my potatoes, but I can cut back. Martha always said I used too much. She was right about a lot of things. And I suppose I can put my feet up when I'm watchin' the game. It's not like I’m doin' much else these days. So, just the water and the blood… and wait for a few days? No hospital, right? That's all I need to know. And you'll tell me if it's somethin' serious. Can the nurse get me that cup for the… water? I need to get this over with so I can get home and catch the start of the game. It’s the Flyers tonight, you know. Can't miss that.
DOCTOR: Yes, just the urine and blood tests, and then we’ll wait for the results. No hospital right now, Derick. And I promise I’ll be honest with you about the findings. I’ll have the nurse bring you a cup for the urine sample right away. She will also explain the blood draw process to you. Nurse Ellen, could you please come in and assist Derick with the urine and blood tests?
