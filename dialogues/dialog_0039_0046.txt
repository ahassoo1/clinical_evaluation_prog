DOCTOR: Hi Marialena, welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor Kamahele. I’m here because I’ve been having some… well, a lot of pressure on my bladder, actually. It's been going on for a little while now, and it's starting to become quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure… that can be quite bothersome, you’re right. And you said “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yes, about three weeks, I would say. Maybe a bit longer, but definitely not more than a month. It started gradually, just a mild discomfort, but it’s definitely increased in the last week or so. It feels…full, even after I’ve just gone to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Gradual onset over about three weeks, increasing over the last week… and the feeling of fullness even after voiding. That's helpful. Can you tell me a bit more about when you notice it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It seems to be worst in the mornings, right after I wake up. And then it comes and goes throughout the day, but it flares up if I drink a lot of fluids, even just water. It’s not painful, exactly, just… persistently uncomfortable and a little distracting. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Mornings are often when people notice these things more. And it’s good you’ve noticed a connection with fluid intake. Okay… let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, the color has been a little darker than usual, even when I’m drinking plenty of water. And… sometimes it smells a bit stronger, if I’m being honest. I didn’t think much of it at first, assuming it was just something I ate, but now that I’m thinking about it, it’s been happening fairly consistently.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker urine and a stronger smell… that is good information. Let’s see… have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and no pain in my back or sides at all. Just the pressure, and the changes in my urine. I have been a little more tired than usual, but I attributed that to work being particularly busy lately. I’m a graphic designer, and we’re working on a rather large project right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or back pain—that's reassuring. Being tired with a busy project is understandable. Let’s shift gears a little. Have you ever had any bladder infections before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have, actually. When I was in college, I had a couple. I remember it being quite painful, and needing antibiotics to clear it up. It’s been many years since then, though—at least ten years, I would say. And this doesn’t feel quite the same, not nearly as painful. But it did cross my mind, given my history.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of bladder infections, but this doesn’t feel the same. Good to know. And just to be thorough…any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, no changes in my bowel habits. Everything has been fairly normal on that front, thankfully. I apologize if I’m rambling a bit—I just want to be sure I’m providing all the information that might be helpful.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Marialena, you’re doing great. It’s always better to be thorough. Now, let's talk about your medical history generally. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m generally quite healthy. I do have slightly high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication – a low dose of lisinopril, prescribed by my primary care physician. Otherwise, I don’t have any other significant medical issues. I have Medicare, as well, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled high blood pressure with lisinopril and Medicare. That’s good to know. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, thankfully. No food allergies, no medication allergies, nothing. I’ve always been very fortunate in that regard. I am married, by the way, if that's pertinent to anything. My husband is very supportive.
DOCTOR: Good to know about no allergies, and that you are married. I always like to get a full picture. Now, let’s talk about…any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries at all. I’ve been very lucky to avoid them. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago and it was a routine procedure. Nothing else. I try to stay healthy and avoid needing any major interventions, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Tonsils out as a child is not relevant here, but good to know. And finally, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Okay. My mother has type 2 diabetes, and my father had heart disease. My maternal grandmother had high blood pressure, similar to me. I don’t believe anyone else in my immediate family has had any significant medical issues. I hope that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. That's good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your abdomen and checking your lower back. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. I understand, and I'm happy to cooperate in any way that will help determine what’s going on. Listening to my abdomen and checking my lower back sounds completely reasonable. Please proceed when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. It’s soft to the touch, no significant tenderness. Sounds are normal—no bruits or anything concerning. And your back feels…no tenderness there either. Everything feels normal to the touch. I don’t feel any masses or anything unusual. Now, I'd like to get a urine sample, to check for infection or other abnormalities. Do you have a recent sample, or should we collect one now?
PATIENT: No, I don't have a recent sample, Doctor. I haven't been to my primary care physician in a few months. I would be happy to collect one now. Where would you like me to do that? I assume there's a restroom available?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a restroom just down the hall, to your left. There's a collection cup in there, and instructions on how to collect a clean-catch sample. Just try to collect mid-stream—that means start urinating, then collect a sample about halfway through. Please bring the cup back to me when you’re finished, and I’ll send it to the lab. It will take a few minutes. While you're doing that, I'll document my findings here. We can discuss the results when they come back. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A clean-catch sample, mid-stream… I understand. I will go collect that now and return it to you as soon as I am finished. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. Take your time. I’ll be right here. Let me know when you’ve brought the sample back.
