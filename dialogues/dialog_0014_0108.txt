DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's… unpleasant, to put it mildly. Been, uh, throwing up blood. Not a huge amount, thankfully, but enough to worry a fella. Happened a couple times now over the last few days. It’s…dark, you know? Like coffee grounds. Not ideal.
DOCTOR: Coffee grounds, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's the best way to describe it. Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? I just know it doesn’t look right. And it’s not like I got a fancy diet or anything. Mostly just…regular food. Though, I haven't been sleeping much since…well, since my wife passed. Could be stress, I suppose, but this feels different.
DOCTOR: Right. Stress can certainly cause…a lot of things. But we need to rule out anything more serious. Have you noticed any pain with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain, no. More like…a gnawing feeling. In my stomach, kinda high up. Comes and goes. It's not sharp or anything, just…uncomfortable. I took some antacids, but they didn't do much good. Honestly, the whole thing just leaves me feeling weak. And tired. I used to be able to work all day without a problem, now I'm dragging myself through it.
DOCTOR: Weakness and fatigue…okay. And has this…coffee ground vomit…been accompanied by any black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Black stools? Let me think… Now that you mention it, yeah, a couple of times. Not every time, but a few times now they’ve been…darker than usual. Stickier, too. I figured it was something I ate, honestly. I eat a lot of…well, I eat. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not exactly a health nut.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. We need to do a quick examination, and I'm going to order some blood work, just to be safe. It could be a number of things, and we need to get a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never had any trouble with anything. Not a fan of taking pills in general, but never had a reaction. Look, I just want to figure out what's wrong, alright? I don't have time for a lot of tests and fuss. I got things to do. I run the crematory, you know. People depend on me.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. But some things are essential to rule out. Now, let's start with a quick listen to your abdomen, then check your vitals. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't like hospitals. Or doctors, really. Too much poking and prodding. Is there anything else we can do first? Like…a simple blood test, maybe? Before you start listening to my stomach? It's just…personal, you know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, a physical exam is a standard part of assessing your condition. It helps me narrow down the possibilities before ordering potentially unnecessary tests. However, we can start with blood work. But please understand, it won't give us the full picture. It will only offer a glimpse. I still strongly recommend a quick examination. It will take less than five minutes. Are you certain you wish to proceed without it?
PATIENT: Five minutes, you say? Alright, five minutes. But no…digging around, alright? Just listening. I don't need you poking and prodding. I've had enough of that in my life, thank you very much. Get it done quick, and let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Lie down on your back, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen in all four quadrants, and then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. Sounds…slightly diminished bowel sounds. Not what I’d expect. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 88, regular. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not exactly pain. Just that gnawing feeling. Higher up, like I said. And a little tender, maybe, if you press real hard. But I'm a big fella, always been a bit rough around the edges. Probably just muscle soreness. Look, can we just get the results of whatever tests you're gonna do? I got a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a liver function test, and a stool occult blood test. We'll also check your coagulation factors. That should give us a better understanding of what’s going on. It’ll take a few hours to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any heavy lifting, and try to stick to bland foods. I also want to be upfront: given your symptoms—the coffee ground vomit, the black stools, and the weakness—we need to rule out a possible upper gastrointestinal bleed. Depending on the results, we may need to consider an endoscopy. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Endo…what now? Look, you're losing me with all this fancy talk. Is that…serious? Like, hospital serious? I don’t do hospitals. I told you, I run the crematory. I can't just disappear for days. What's the worst it could be? Just tell me straight. No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and look for the source of the bleeding. The worst-case scenario, Mr. Gentz, would be a severe bleed requiring hospitalization and potentially a blood transfusion. It could be a peptic ulcer, gastritis, or, less commonly, something more serious. However, it's important to remember that most of the time, these conditions are treatable. We need to determine the cause of the bleeding before we can decide on the best course of action. I understand your concerns about being away from your business, but delaying diagnosis and treatment could be dangerous. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Dangerous, huh? Look, I've lived a long life, alright? Seen a lot of things. I don't scare easy. But… a tube down my throat? That doesn’t sound appealing. And a blood transfusion? I've seen what that does to people. Slows 'em right down. So, you're saying this blood test…this could tell you if I need this…tube thing? If it comes back clear, can I just go back to work? Because frankly, I got people relying on me. This crematory doesn't run itself, you know.
DOCTOR: The blood test will give us a preliminary indication of the severity of the bleeding, and can help rule out other potential causes. If the results are significantly abnormal, an endoscopy will be necessary to pinpoint the exact source and determine the best course of treatment. If the blood work comes back relatively normal – meaning your hemoglobin and hematocrit are within acceptable ranges, and your coagulation factors are normal – we can monitor you closely, and repeat the tests in a few days. However, even if the initial results are normal, the symptoms you've described warrant further investigation if they persist or worsen. I want to be clear: I’m not saying you definitely need an endoscopy. But I am saying we need to take this seriously. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So…it’s not a definite "yes" to the tube. Just a "maybe." And if the blood comes back okay, I can go back to work…for now. But I gotta watch it. Watch for what, exactly? More blood? More…gnawing? What happens if it gets worse while I'm running the crematory? I can't exactly just stop everything mid-process. People…depend on me.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It’s not a definite “yes” to the endoscopy. We’re starting with the blood work. If the blood work comes back normal, it doesn't necessarily mean everything is fine. It just means we haven’t identified a serious problem yet. You’ll need to monitor your symptoms closely. Specifically, watch for: any recurrence of the coffee-ground vomit or black, tarry stools, any increasing weakness or fatigue, any abdominal pain, and any signs of dizziness or shortness of breath. If any of those symptoms worsen, or if you experience new symptoms, you need to come back immediately. And if you experience significant bleeding – a large amount of blood in your vomit or stool – go to the nearest emergency room. I understand your concerns about your business, Mr. Gentz. But your health is the priority. I'll give you a detailed list of these instructions to take with you. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. I got it. No more blood, no more black stuff, no more feeling weak. And if anything goes south, I head to the emergency room. You’ll give me that list…good. I appreciate that. Look, I’m not one for fancy medical stuff, you know? I just want to get back to work. But I'll watch it. I always do. How long will it take to get these blood results? And can I get a copy for myself? I like to…keep track of things.
DOCTOR: The blood results should be available within a few hours. My assistant will call you as soon as they're ready. And yes, you can absolutely have a copy for yourself. I’ll have them print one out for you now. I’m also going to give you a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor, a medication that can help reduce stomach acid. It might help alleviate some of the discomfort. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Proton… what now? Just…make it easy, alright? Less acid…less gnawing? Sounds good, I guess. I'll take the pills. As long as they don’t make me feel worse. No, I think that’s it. Just…try not to scare me too much when you call with the results, alright? I got a crematory to run. People…depend on me. Thank you…I think.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Gentz. The proton pump inhibitor should help with the discomfort, and hopefully reduce the bleeding. My assistant will explain the dosage instructions. I’ll do my best not to “scare” you when I call. We'll take things one step at a time. Here are the blood test requisition and the prescription. Please call my office immediately if you experience any changes in your condition. And try to get some rest, if you can. Have a good day, Mr. Gentz.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you.
