DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Hmm... well, it’s this… going to the bathroom. Too much, you know? Seems like all I do is go. It's a bother, really. Especially when I'm trying to… what was I saying? Oh, yes. It's just… frequent. That’s the word. Frequent.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, alright. It is bothersome when it interrupts things. And… how long has this been going on, this increased frequency?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. A long while. Months, I suppose. Maybe longer. Time just… slips away, doesn't it? I don’t really keep track of these things. My wife, bless her heart, she notices these things more. She probably has a better idea how long. But me? Not a clue.
DOCTOR: Months, okay. It's alright, don't worry about the exact timeframe. We can work with that. Now, is it just frequency, or are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… feeling sick? No, not really. Just… the going. And sometimes… a little bit of a struggle to… start. You know? Just takes a moment. Not painful, mind you. Just… hesitant. It’s not like I'm doubled over in pain or anything. Just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Hesitancy starting the stream, alright. No pain, that's good. And does it happen every time, or only sometimes?
PATIENT: Oh, not every time, no. Some times it’s fine, goes right away. Others… well, you wait a bit, you know? Staring at the porcelain, waiting for things to happen. It’s… humiliating, really. A man shouldn’t have to wait to… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. It can be quite frustrating. Now, do you find yourself needing to go more often at night, compared to during the day?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely at night. Wakes me up, it does. Have to get up, shuffle to the bathroom… disrupts my sleep, it does. My wife doesn't mind too much, but I feel bad waking her up. She needs her rest, you know?
DOCTOR: Waking at night to urinate… alright. Now, when you do go, do you feel like you’re completely emptying your bladder, or do you feel like there's still some left afterwards?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. You know, I don’t really pay attention. I just go, and then I'm done. I suppose… sometimes it feels like maybe a little bit left, but I can’t be sure. I don't sit there examining every last drop, if you catch my drift. A man has his dignity, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. Perfectly understandable. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, or have you been diagnosed with anything else in the past?
PATIENT: Diabetes… now that’s a word I hear often. My brother had that, I think. Me? Not that I know of. High blood pressure… maybe. The doctor said something about it once, but I don’t take any pills for it. I just try to… you know, not worry about it. Generally, I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. A little achy in the mornings, but that's just old age creeping up, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Years and years ago… I had my appendix out, I believe. When I was a young man. And… my wife says I was in the hospital for a week with pneumonia, but I don’t really remember it. She has a better memory for these things, always has. Nothing else springs to mind, thankfully. I’ve always tried to avoid doctors as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal, and pneumonia in the past. Now, do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not really. My wife gives me a multivitamin sometimes, but I forget to take it half the time. And… occasionally some aspirin for a headache, but that’s about it. I prefer to just… tough it out, you know? Medications… they just cause problems, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I’m aware of. I eat pretty much everything. My wife makes wonderful soups, and I wouldn't deny myself anything. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing. I'm a pretty simple man, really. Don’t ask for much, and thankfully, I don't seem to react badly to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Segretto. I think I have a good understanding of your situation so far. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh dear. What does that entail? I'm not a fan of poking and prodding, you know. I'm an old man. Everything creaks and groans as it is. Is it absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Segretto. It’s fairly quick and straightforward. I'd like to check your abdomen, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological check. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Specifically, I want to check your prostate. It's a common cause of these symptoms in men your age. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. It's really not too bad, I promise.
PATIENT: Prostate? Oh, that sounds… unpleasant. My neighbor had trouble with his prostate. Had surgery, I believe. Is that what you're thinking? Look, Doctor, I appreciate you wanting to help, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with all this poking and prodding. Especially not… down there. Could we… maybe try something else first? Perhaps some pills? Or… I don't know. I'm just an old man, I don't want to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto. It's perfectly valid. A digital rectal exam can be uncomfortable, and you're right, it's not the most pleasant experience. However, it is a very important part of evaluating urinary symptoms in men, and it helps us rule out more serious conditions. It's a quick exam, and provides valuable information. Now, if you're truly opposed to it, we can start with some initial tests. We could do a urine analysis to check for infection or blood, and a blood test to check your kidney function. However, those tests won't give us a complete picture. If those tests come back normal, we'd likely still need to consider the exam to get a definitive diagnosis. Ultimately, the decision is yours. But I do strongly recommend it, if you're willing. Would you be more comfortable if I explained the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh dear, this is getting complicated. Urine analysis… blood tests… it all sounds so… invasive. Look, Doctor, I’m just worried about making a fuss. I'm a simple man, really. I just want to be able to sleep through the night without having to get up every hour. Tell me about this… exam. But be gentle, please. I don’t want any surprises. And if it gets too uncomfortable, I want to be able to stop you. No pressure, you understand? Just… explain it to me like I'm a child.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. No pressure at all. I will explain everything slowly and carefully. Okay, so the exam involves me using a gloved, lubricated finger to gently examine your prostate through your rectum. It sounds more daunting than it is, I promise. The prostate is a small gland located inside your body, near your bladder. Because of its location, it's best accessed through the rectum. I'll ask you to lie on your side with your knees bent. I’ll use a lubricant to make it more comfortable. I’ll gently insert a gloved finger and feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It will feel like a brief internal check, similar to what you might experience at the dentist. It usually takes less than a minute. I will be explaining everything as I go and stopping immediately if you experience any discomfort. You can tell me to stop at any time, and we can absolutely take a break or stop altogether if you wish. Does that sound a little less scary?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, when you put it that way… it still doesn’t sound particularly pleasant. Like a dentist, you say? My dentist is a nice young man, but still… it’s not something I look forward to. And you say it will take less than a minute? That's… something, I suppose. But what are you looking for? What if you find something… bad? I don’t want to hear about anything bad, Doctor. I’m an old man, I’ve lived a good life. I just want to be comfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Segretto. It's natural to be anxious about what we might find. What I'm looking for is any abnormalities in the size, shape, or texture of your prostate. An enlarged prostate is very common as men age, and it can cause the symptoms you're experiencing. Sometimes, we might find lumps or irregularities, which could indicate a more serious condition. If we do find something concerning, it doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. We would likely order further tests, such as a biopsy, to get a definitive diagnosis. And even if it is something more serious, there are many effective treatments available. But the most important thing is to get a proper diagnosis so we can develop a plan that's right for you. And remember, we will take things one step at a time. We don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with. Would you like me to explain those further tests to you now, or would you like to think about it for a bit?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Biopsies… now you're talking about cutting things out of me? That sounds awful. No, no, I don’t want to hear about cutting. I’m too old for cutting. Look, Doctor, I think I need to sit down and have a nice cup of tea. I’m getting flustered. Maybe… maybe we can just try some pills first? Something to calm things down, you know? Something to make me sleep through the night? Can we start with that? I’m not sure I can handle all this poking and prodding and cutting today. I just want to be comfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I understand. You're feeling overwhelmed, and that’s perfectly okay. We can absolutely start with some medication to see if that helps. There are medications available that can help relax the muscles in your bladder and prostate, which can improve your symptoms and make it easier to sleep through the night. They won’t solve the underlying problem, but they can provide significant relief. Now, there are a few different types of medications we could try. Some have more side effects than others. I can explain those to you in detail if you'd like. It's important to be aware of the potential risks and benefits before starting any medication. Would you like me to write you a prescription for one of these medications?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A prescription sounds lovely. Something to help me sleep. That’s all I ask. Don’t bother me with all the side effects, Doctor. I’m too old to worry about side effects. Just give me something to help me sleep, and I’ll be grateful. And… maybe a referral to a nice, quiet tea shop? That would be lovely too. I need a nice cup of tea after all this excitement.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I'll write you a prescription for a low-dose medication to help with your urinary symptoms and improve your sleep. It's a commonly prescribed medication with relatively mild side effects, but it’s important to let me know if you experience any. As for the tea shop, I’m afraid I don’t have a list of recommendations, but I can certainly understand the need for a relaxing cup of tea after this. Here’s the prescription. Take one tablet before bedtime, as directed. I'd like to see you back in a month to see how it's working. If your symptoms don't improve, or if you experience any concerning side effects, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it. And… please, remind me to bring my wife next time. She remembers things better. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I need to find that tea shop. And perhaps a nice, comfortable chair. Yes, a comfortable chair.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I’m glad I could help. And yes, please do bring your wife next time. It's always helpful to have another perspective. Please take care, and enjoy your tea. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
