DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here that today is August 2nd, 2025. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, August second it is. It’s…trouble breathing when I lie down flat. It’s been happening for…oh, a good few weeks now, I’d say. Not every time, but often enough to be bothersome. I want to get it sorted if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. Trouble breathing when lying flat, occurring for several weeks. That certainly warrants investigation. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the sensation a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a pain, exactly. More like…a tightness. In my chest, mostly. And I feel like I can’t get a full breath. Like something is…pressing on me. It’s quite unpleasant, and it wakes me up sometimes, I have to sit up to feel better. It doesn’t happen when I'm sitting or standing, only when I'm lying completely flat.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tightness in the chest, a sensation of not being able to take a full breath, and it's relieved by sitting up. It wakes you from sleep occasionally. That's helpful information. And just to clarify, does this tightness come on suddenly, or does it build up gradually when you lie down?
PATIENT: It builds up, Doctor. Not quick, like a fright. I lie down, feel alright for a bit…and then slowly, it gets tighter and tighter. That’s why I know to sit up. It’s not a sudden panic or anything. It takes a few minutes for it to really bother me. Then I have to sit up.
DOCTOR: That is very good to know – a gradual onset is important. Now, Ms. Vanderwiele, I'd like to ask a few more questions to get a more complete picture. Do you notice anything that makes this worse, besides lying flat?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Eating doesn’t seem to do it. Exercise…well, I don’t do much exercise these days, truthfully. Perhaps if I was walking a long distance it might be worse, but I haven’t tried that lately. It's mostly just the lying down. Oh…dust might bother it a little. If I'm cleaning, perhaps. But that's not every time, either.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, dust may be a minor factor, but primarily it’s the lying flat that triggers it. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your overall health. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past, such as heart disease, lung problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed…oh, goodness, must be twenty years ago now. I take a pill for it, every morning. Otherwise…nothing major, I don't think. A bit of arthritis in my knees, but that's just old age. I've never had any trouble with my lungs, and no heart trouble, as far as I know. The doctor always checked, and he said I was fine.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see…I have it written down somewhere… Yes, here we are. Lisinopril. I take 20 milligrams every morning. Been on it for years now, like the doctor said. It seems to keep things steady enough.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Lisinopril 20mg daily. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine care?
PATIENT: Just a gallbladder removal, Doctor. Many years ago. About…forty years, I think. It was causing me a lot of trouble, but the surgery fixed it right up. Haven't been hospitalized for anything since then. Nothing serious, like I said. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of getting older.
DOCTOR: Alright. And in terms of your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, lung problems, or anything else significant?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s a tricky one. My mother…she had heart trouble, towards the end of her life. She had to have a pacemaker, I remember. And my brother, he had asthma when he was a child, but he grew out of it. My father…he lived a long life, quite healthy actually. No real problems. But that's all I can really recall, truthfully. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, he used to smoke, but I always made him go outside. It smelled dreadful, and it's not good for you, you see. I always told him that. He quit, thankfully, many years ago. But me? Never.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A small glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Not every night, mind you. Perhaps two or three times a week. Just a little one. It helps me relax. I don't drink beer or anything stronger. Just a small glass of red wine. Nothing excessive, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me think... Yes. I take a multivitamin every morning, and sometimes I take Tylenol for my arthritis, when my knees are acting up. Just a couple of pills, as needed. Otherwise, that's it. The multivitamin and the Tylenol. Nothing else. I try to keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had trouble with any medications. I always tell the doctor if I’m trying something new, but so far, so good. No allergies at all, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele, thank you for that thorough information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your legs to rule out any swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I want to get this sorted out, so please do whatever you need to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'll listen to your heart. Please take a deep breath for me. Your heart rate is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not particularly loud, and it could be a normal finding, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Now, I'll listen to your lungs. Again, please take a deep breath for me. Your breath sounds are a little diminished at the bases of both lungs, but there are no wheezes or crackles. Now, I'll check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated. Finally, I'll examine your legs for any swelling. There is minimal swelling in your ankles. Overall, the examination findings are consistent with a few possible causes for your symptoms. The slight murmur and elevated blood pressure may be contributing factors, and the diminished breath sounds could indicate some underlying lung changes.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That sounds…complicated. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I've never had a murmur before, and my blood pressure is usually better controlled, I thought. And what about my breathing? What needs to be done?
DOCTOR: It can sound complicated, and I understand your concern. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it does warrant further investigation. The murmur is a sound heard during your heartbeat – sometimes they’re harmless, but it’s best to rule out any underlying structural heart issues. The elevated blood pressure, while slightly higher than ideal, is something we can address. Regarding your breathing, the diminished breath sounds could indicate some mild lung changes, perhaps related to aging or previous minor respiratory issues. However, the fact that it’s positional – meaning it’s worse when you lie down – suggests another possibility: fluid accumulation in the lungs, potentially related to heart function. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. First, an EKG to assess your heart rhythm and look for any signs of heart strain. Second, a chest X-ray to visualize your lungs and heart and look for any fluid accumulation or other abnormalities. Finally, a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Tests…yes, I suppose so. If it will help find out what’s wrong, then yes, do them. An EKG and a chest X-ray…and the blood test. Will it take long? And will it be uncomfortable? I don’t like needles, Doctor. I really don’t.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about the tests, and I’ll do everything I can to make it as comfortable as possible. The EKG is completely painless. Small stickers will be placed on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. The chest X-ray is also painless. You'll stand in front of a machine, and a small amount of radiation will be used to create an image of your lungs and heart. It only takes a few seconds. The blood test will require a small needle prick to draw a sample of blood. I know you don’t like needles, and I'll be as gentle as possible. The phlebotomist is very skilled. It's a quick procedure, and usually, people don’t feel much discomfort. We can even use a numbing cream if you’d like. The tests can be scheduled at the lab just down the hall. It usually takes about an hour to complete all three. Once the results are back, we can review them together and discuss the best course of action. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: An hour…yes, I can manage an hour. And the numbing cream…that would be very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. A little cream would certainly put my mind at ease. I’m most worried about the blood test, truthfully. I always get so faint. And after the tests…when will I know the results? A few days? A week? I have a bridge club meeting next Tuesday, and I’d like to know if I’ll be well enough to attend.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will write an order for the blood tests, and I’ll make a note for the phlebotomist to use a numbing cream before the draw. We have a very experienced phlebotomist, and I’ll personally let her know about your concerns. The lab results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. I should have them by Monday, and I will have my nurse call you on Tuesday morning to schedule an appointment to discuss them. We’ll have plenty of time to go over everything, and I’ll answer any questions you have. Regarding your bridge club meeting, it’s difficult to say for sure whether you’ll be well enough to attend until we have the test results. However, if everything looks good, there’s no reason why you shouldn't be able to. I'll keep that in mind when reviewing the results and formulating a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness – please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough and kind, and I appreciate your patience with my…fears. The numbing cream is a great relief. Thank you for your help. I'll go down to the lab now and get the tests done. And I’ll be sure to call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or experience any problems. I'll see you on Tuesday.
