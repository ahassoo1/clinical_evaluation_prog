DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really have time for this, but my sister insisted. I just… want to make sure everything’s okay, you know? I want to get pregnant, and I don’t want any… issues. I lost my husband a few years back, and I’d like to move on with things. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good start, thank you. I understand wanting to ensure everything is healthy before trying to conceive, especially given your circumstances. It’s very responsible of you to think ahead. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about your cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? Honestly, I don’t really track things. I just… they happen. Every month. Normal, I guess? I mean, I haven’t had any… problems, not that I’ve noticed. Look, I’m not really good with dates and all that. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: No, this won't take long, and that's perfectly alright. Not everyone tracks their cycles, and that's fine. Just a general sense is helpful. Roughly, how often do you have your period?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, this is what I mean. Roughly? Like… every month-ish? Sometimes a little closer together, sometimes not. It’s never been regular regular, if that makes sense. I just… assumed it was normal. I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. Is it bad that I haven't? Will it affect things?
DOCTOR: It’s not bad at all that you haven't, Carmaleta. Many women don't meticulously track, and it doesn't necessarily mean there’s a problem. However, cycle regularity can give us some clues about overall health and reproductive function. And when you say “closer together” or “not,” about how much variation are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Okay, let me think. Sometimes it's like… a week early, maybe? Other times… like ten days late? It really varies. I don’t know. It's just… a mess, honestly. I’m just hoping everything’s still working properly, you know? I’m not as young as I used to be. Is there a test or something? Can we just do something to make sure? I really don’t have the patience for all this questioning.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and wanting to get straight to answers. Yes, we can absolutely do some tests. A basic work-up would include blood tests to check your hormone levels and ovarian reserve, and a pelvic exam. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical conditions… Let me see. Honestly, not much. I had the usual childhood things, measles and whatnot, but nothing serious. I had high blood pressure for a little while, but it went down with diet. Oh! And I had fibroids a few years back, but the doctor said they were small and wouldn't cause trouble. That’s about it, I think. Is that important? They didn’t seem to care much about them back then.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful to know, thank you. The fibroids are potentially relevant, even if they were small, and the history of high blood pressure is good information to have. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, supplements. My sister keeps trying to get me on all sorts of things. Let me think… I take a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember. And I've been taking some ginger pills for nausea, but that's only when I feel sick. Oh, and I used to take something for the blood pressure, but I stopped when it went down. That's it, I think. Honestly, I try to avoid taking pills if I can. They make me feel weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Multivitamins, ginger pills, and a history of blood pressure medication. Now, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies... Honestly, not really. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but that's it. Nothing serious, I haven't ever had to go to the hospital or anything. Is that important? Are we almost done with the questions? I really need to get going soon. I have a meeting later.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild allergy to cats. That’s good to know. Alright, we’re getting there. One last thing for now. Could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history? Honestly, it's a mess. My mother had… something with her stomach, but I don't remember what. And my aunt had… high blood pressure, I think? Everyone on my side has something, but nobody ever really talks about it. It’s all very… complicated. Is this really important? I barely knew my family. Can we just do the tests now? I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and that it can be difficult to recall family history. It is helpful, but we can move on if it’s too stressful. Alright. Given your history, I recommend a pelvic exam and some blood work to assess your hormone levels, ovarian reserve, and overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally! Yes, yes, just do it. The sooner we get this over with, the better. I have a meeting later, you know. I need to know if everything's working properly, and I need to know now. Just tell me where to go, and let's get this done. Don't ask me any more questions, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Carmaleta. I understand. The nurse will be in shortly to take your vitals and then guide you to the examination room. I'll be with you as soon as I'm able. Please get undressed from the waist down for the exam. I'll explain everything as we go. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Ugh, no! No questions. Just… do it. And please be quick. I really need to go. .
