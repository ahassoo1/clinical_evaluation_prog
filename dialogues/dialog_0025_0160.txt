DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Honestly, it's about this… tiredness. It's just getting worse and worse, and it’s… embarrassing, really. I don’t even have the energy to keep up with my garden anymore. And… well, I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to know something isn't right. It’s just…clay, mostly. From the flower pots. Don't look at me like that.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt! Clay. Red clay, usually. I find it… satisfying. Don’t judge me, doctor. I’ve always been a… particular person. It’s not like I'm out there shoveling it up, just little bits. But lately, I’ve been wanting it more. It doesn't make any sense. And it hasn’t helped the tiredness at all, obviously. Is this… common?
DOCTOR: Well, “common” is a strong word, Candis. Craving non-food items – what we call pica – isn’t typical in someone your age. But it can indicate a nutritional deficiency. Now, you mentioned the tiredness is getting worse. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh, don’t even get me started. It's just… heavy. Like I'm wading through molasses. I used to be able to get everything done, you know? Garden, volunteering at the church, even a little bit of painting. Now I take a nap after just thinking about doing something. It started slowly, a little extra sleep here and there. Now? I sleep all day and still wake up exhausted. And it’s not a restful sleep, either. I toss and turn. Honestly, I thought it was just… old age catching up with me, but this dirt thing… it feels connected, somehow. Do you think it is connected?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see... no recent bloodwork on file. We'll need to get some tests done. Before we do that, let me ask a few questions to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any other changes besides the tiredness and the clay cravings?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. My appetite hasn't been great, to be honest. Everything just tastes… bland. And I've been a bit more… irritable, I suppose. Snapping at my neighbors over silly things. Not like me at all. Oh! And my hands… they feel numb sometimes, especially at night. It’s not constant, but it’s there. And I seem to get cold easily, even when it’s warm. Really, doctor, I just want to feel normal again. This is ridiculous. Are you sure this dirt eating isn't the problem? Maybe it’s just stress.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly exacerbate things, but this combination of symptoms – fatigue, loss of appetite, irritability, numbness, feeling cold, and the clay cravings – is concerning enough that we need to investigate further. The clay eating could be a symptom itself, indicating a deficiency. Now, have you ever had any problems with anemia or low iron?
PATIENT: Anemia? Oh, goodness, let me think… years ago, back in Ethiopia, when I was a young woman, I was… weak, very weak. The doctor gave me some pills, reddish brown ones, and I felt better. That was a long time ago, though. I haven’t had any trouble with that since I came to America. And I don’t really remember anything about it being iron specifically. Just… pills. And feeling tired. Everything was so different then. Is that relevant? You're making my head spin with all this talk of deficiencies and things. Just tell me if I need to stop eating the dirt!
DOCTOR: Yes, that is relevant. Past history of weakness, possibly anemia, is important. And yes, Candis, I strongly advise you to stop eating the dirt immediately. It could be causing or worsening whatever is going on. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your hands. Then we’ll get some bloodwork ordered. If you'll just have a seat...
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you say. It’s probably nothing. Just old age. But if you must poke and prod, please be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And don’t be surprised if I’m a little chilly. I always run cold. Honestly, I don't see what good this is going to do. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. Just relax. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is a bit slow, but regular. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished, but not severely. Now, let’s examine your hands. Skin is pale, and I notice some slight swelling in your knuckles. Nail beds are a bit brittle. Okay. Everything seems consistent with what you’ve described. Now, we’ll need to draw some blood to check your iron levels, vitamin B12, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. I'll have the nurse come in to take care of that.
PATIENT: Finally. About time. Honestly, all this poking and prodding… So, just bloodwork, then? No… other unpleasantness? And how long until I get the results? I don’t want to have to come back here again anytime soon. This whole thing is… upsetting, really. I just want to feel better, and I want to feel better now. I hope these tests tell you something useful. And please tell me I don't need a transfusion or anything awful like that.
DOCTOR: Just bloodwork, Candis. The lab usually takes a few days to get the results back. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. We’ll go over them together then and discuss a plan. A transfusion is unlikely, but we need to see the results first. It's too early to rule anything out or in. Now, while we wait for the results, I want you to focus on eating a well-balanced diet. And again, please refrain from eating the clay. It won’t help, and it could be masking the underlying problem. I’m also going to refer you to a nutritionist to help you with that. They can provide guidance on ensuring you're getting all the nutrients you need.
PATIENT: A nutritionist? Oh, honestly. I’ve been feeding myself for seventy-nine years, I think I can manage my own diet. This is ridiculous. Fine. Whatever. Just get me out of here. And if this nutritionist tries to tell me to eat kale, I swear… Is that it? Can I go now? I need a nap. And maybe a cup of tea. This has been… draining.
DOCTOR: Yes, Candis, you can go. The nurse will escort you to the front desk to schedule your bloodwork and the nutritionist appointment. Please follow up with me as soon as you have the results. And, with all due respect, sometimes even those of us who've been "feeding ourselves for seventy-nine years" can benefit from a little expert advice. Now, have a good day. .
PATIENT: Fine. Good day to you too. Expert advice… honestly. .
