DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s…well, my skin. It’s darkening. And I feel…tired. Extremely tired. It’s quite bothersome, really. I’ve been a working man my entire life, and I don’t have time for ailments.
DOCTOR: Alright, darkening skin and fatigue. I understand wanting to get to the bottom of this quickly. When did you first notice the skin changes, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, dates escape me. Some time ago, I suppose. Perhaps…a few months? It’s a gradual thing. Not sudden, thankfully. Though it is rather unsightly. I don’t recall anything specific triggering it. Just…woke up one day and noticed it was a bit…less vibrant. Is that sufficient? I’m not one for dwelling on minutiae.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. And can you describe where on your body you're noticing the darkening skin?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor. Not in patches, mind you. Just…a general dullness. My hands, mostly. And my face, I suppose. Though my wife does the looking in the mirror these days. I don’t bother with such vanities. It’s not as if a bit of color will affect my ability to…reinforce iron. That’s what matters, isn't it? Hard work. Not appearances.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned fatigue. Is this just feeling tired, or is it something more?
PATIENT: “Just tired?” Doctor, I’ve been working with steel and concrete since I was a boy. Of course it’s more than “just tired.” It’s a bone-deep weariness. I can barely get through a shift anymore. Used to be, I could work all day and still have energy for…things. Now? I need to rest after a few hours. It’s…disconcerting. And frankly, inefficient.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very concerning, Mr. Drahota. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue and skin changes?
PATIENT: Hmm…other symptoms. Let me think. My appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t crave much these days. And…perhaps a bit of shortness of breath when I’m exerting myself. But that could just be my age, Doctor. I am 85, you know. Things wear down. It’s the natural order. I doubt it’s anything…serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, loss of appetite and some shortness of breath. And have you had any fever, chills, weight loss, or any unusual bleeding or bruising?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, are you questioning my constitution? I’ve survived decades of hard labor! No fever, no chills, and I haven’t weighed myself in…well, decades. As for bleeding or bruising, I get the occasional scrape on the job, naturally. But nothing…unusual. Honestly, I think I’ve answered quite enough questions. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply cataloging the inconveniences of old age? I have a schedule to keep, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I apologize if my questions seem extensive. I just want to be thorough. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Doctor, I’ve avoided doctors for most of my life. That’s my medical condition. I work hard, eat reasonably, and mind my own business. I don’t have medical conditions. My wife handles all that paperwork. And frankly, she doesn't involve me in the details. She says I get…agitated. Which, I suspect, is quite accurate at this point. Look, I’m a sturdy oak, not a fragile flower. Can we please move this along? I’m wasting precious daylight.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely nothing. I don't believe in relying on pills and potions. A good night's sleep and a strong work ethic are all a man needs. My wife occasionally tries to slip something into my tea, but I always detect it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure why I’m even here. This is proving to be a complete waste of time. I think I'll just go home and get some rest. Perhaps that will be the best medicine of all. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your reluctance, but I really think it would be helpful if I could just perform a quick physical exam. Just to check your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. It will only take a few minutes. It’s important to rule out anything serious, even if it turns out to be nothing. I promise to be as quick and efficient as possible. Would you allow me to do that?
