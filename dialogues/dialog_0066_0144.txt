DOCTOR: Hi Lilly, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Condray, is it? Yes, well... honestly, I'm not entirely sure. My daughter, Susan, thought I should come. She says I've been...forgetful. It's probably nothing, really. Just old age, I suppose. I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about, you know? Susan makes such a big deal out of everything.
DOCTOR: It's good of you to come in, Lilly, and it’s very thoughtful of Susan to encourage you to get checked out. Forgetfulness can be a lot of things, and it's always best to rule things out. So, let’s talk about this a bit more. When did Susan first start noticing you being more forgetful?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did she start noticing? That's a tricky one. She's always been observant, that girl. Probably…a few months ago? Maybe longer. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. I can’t recall any specific incident, just…nagging from her. “Mom, did you take your pills?” “Mom, where are your keys?” That sort of thing. It’s just Susan being Susan. I mean, I usually remember things. It’s not like I’m… completely losing my marbles.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months. And Susan’s concerns seem to be about everyday things – keys, medications. Has it been getting progressively worse, or does it seem to fluctuate?
PATIENT: Fluctuate, I think. Yes, that’s a good word for it. Some days I’m perfectly fine, I can remember everything. I still know how to do my job, you know. Surgical tech for forty years – not easy, that. But then other days…well, I’ll go to the store for milk and come back with…who knows what. Last week I bought three bags of onions. Onions! I don’t even like onions that much. It’s frustrating, really. Makes me feel…useless.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lilly. It sounds like it’s definitely affecting your daily life sometimes. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me about any other changes you've noticed?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmmm... Well, I've been a bit…tired lately. Not like, sick tired, just…dragged out. And my daughter says I’ve been repeating myself. I don’t think I am, but she insists. Honestly, she’s always been a bit dramatic. I used to tell her stories about when I was a nurse during the Korean War, and she’d say, “Mom, you already told me that one!” It's probably just because I have a lot to say. And... maybe I'm not as quick as I used to be. It takes me a bit longer to figure things out, I suppose. But that’s just aging, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing all of this with me, Lilly. That’s very helpful. The tiredness, the repetition, and feeling a bit slower… those are all things we want to explore. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was… a while back. And my knees bother me sometimes, the arthritis. Just old age, really. And…high blood pressure, I think? The doctor put me on some pills for that, but I can’t remember what they’re called. Susan handles all my medication now, so I don’t really worry about it. She’s very good at keeping things organized, thank goodness. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for my age. I still get around, still cook, still manage. Though sometimes...I forget what I was cooking halfway through! It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, arthritis, and high blood pressure. We'll definitely need to get a list of your current medications from Susan, that's good she keeps track of things. Now, have you ever had any problems with allergies, or reactions to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I used to take… penicillin, I think, when I was younger. Susan might know better, honestly. She remembers everything. She’s always been very cautious. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills, unless absolutely necessary. I prefer to tough things out, you know? I grew up in Korea, things were different back then. We didn't run to the doctor for every little sniffle. It builds character, I always say. But Susan worries... She’s a good girl. Just a bit…overprotective.
DOCTOR: That's good to know you haven't had any allergic reactions. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history... That's a tough one. My mother…she died when I was young, from something with her heart, I think. Very vague memories, it was a long time ago. My father was strong as an ox, lived to be almost ninety. He never got sick a day in his life, as far as I know. My brother, he had…diabetes, I think? But he didn’t take care of himself, always eating sweets. My sister…she lived in America, Susan’s mother. She had… I don’t remember, something with her stomach, maybe? Honestly, my family wasn’t very good at talking about health issues. It was just…not done, back then. It's all a bit of a blur, I'm afraid. Susan would probably know more. She's very good at genealogy, all that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart issues in your mother, diabetes in your brother, and some kind of stomach problem in your sister. That gives us something to work with. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! I've never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven't had a drink since… well, since my husband passed away. He enjoyed a glass of soju with dinner sometimes, but I never cared for it. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not! I was raised properly, you know? I spend my days cooking, gardening, and…watching Korean dramas. It keeps me occupied. I used to volunteer at the church, but my knees haven’t been cooperating lately. I try to stay active, but it’s getting harder as I get older. Honestly, I’m a pretty boring person. Susan says I need to get out more, but I’m quite content at home. It’s peaceful, you know? No trouble, no fuss.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling life, Lilly. It's good to hear you're content. Now, before we move on, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even if Susan manages them?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Well, there's the one for my blood pressure. Susan calls it… amlodipine, maybe? And something for my arthritis, a little white pill. I think it's naproxen. She gives them to me with my breakfast every morning. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, she gives me something stronger. I don't know what it's called, but it makes me feel a little drowsy. Oh! And I take a vitamin D supplement. Susan says I need more sunshine. Honestly, I can barely keep track of everything. It's a good thing she's around to remind me. I'd be lost without her. It's probably best if you just ask her. She has a list, I'm sure of it.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Lilly. It’s good you’re honest about it. Okay, well, let's do a quick physical exam now, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. Whatever you need. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, I can’t remember when. I suppose it's a good thing you're doing this. It's just…I'm not very good with doctors. Always poking and prodding. But do whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, alright? My knees aren’t what they used to be. And… try to explain what you’re doing, if you don’t mind. I get a little nervous when I don't know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilly. I'll explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'll take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is good. Now I’ll check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Now, I'll do a quick neurological exam to check your memory and coordination. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh dear... Today's date? Let me see... It's... August... Is it the 1st? No, Susan said something about it being the... 2nd? Yes, the 2nd. August the 2nd. 2025, right? I think so. It's all a bit hazy, honestly. I used to have a very good memory. I could remember everything. Now... not so much. I hope I’m not failing your test already. It’s just… getting older, you know? It does things to your brain.
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Lilly. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty remembering dates, especially if you're not actively thinking about them. Now, can you tell me the names of three things we’ve talked about today?
PATIENT: Oh dear, three things? Let me see... Well, we talked about…my daughter, Susan. And… my blood pressure pills. Amlodipine, I think. And...oh, what was the other one? My knees, maybe? Yes, my knees bothering me. Is that three? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I wish Susan was here, she’d remember everything. She has a very good memory. I'm sure she’d ace your test.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilly. Remembering three things is not the main goal. We are simply getting a baseline assessment. Now, I'm just going to check your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, all right. Just a few steps? Very well. There. Is that enough steps? My knees are protesting a bit, you know. I used to be a very graceful walker, but now... it's more of a shuffle. It's just age, I suppose. Getting old isn't for the faint of heart. Do you need me to do anything else? I'm happy to cooperate, but my knees are starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lilly. That's enough. You’re doing great. Now, I'd like to order some blood work, just to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. We’ll also do a basic cognitive assessment – it’s a short questionnaire that will help us evaluate your memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work, you say? And a questionnaire? Well, alright. I suppose it's best to be thorough. Though I'm not very good with paperwork, you know. My handwriting isn't what it used to be. And I tend to get confused easily. But I'll try my best. Susan can help me fill it out, if you like. She's very good at those sorts of things. Is it a long questionnaire? I hope it doesn't take too long. My knees are starting to ache again. And… honestly, I’m getting a bit tired. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: It's a relatively short questionnaire, Lilly, and we can take as many breaks as you need. Susan can absolutely help you fill it out. And we'll schedule the blood work for a time that’s convenient for you. I’m also going to recommend a referral to a neurologist, just to get a more specialized evaluation of your cognitive function. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's always best to have a thorough assessment. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A neurologist, you say? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is something wrong? I thought you said it didn’t necessarily mean anything was wrong, but… a neurologist? Those doctors deal with the brain, don’t they? I’m not sure I like the sound of that. I just wanted a quick check-up, not a whole battery of tests. I suppose if you think it's necessary… but I’m getting a bit anxious now. My knees are really aching. And… honestly, I just want to go home and take a nap. It's been a very long morning. Maybe we can skip the neurologist? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Lilly. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The neurologist referral is a precaution. Many things can cause memory changes, and it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, and we’ll discuss the results thoroughly. We can start with the blood work and the cognitive assessment, and if those results are concerning, we can then consider the neurology referral. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, start with the blood work and the questionnaire, you say? Yes, that sounds… better. Less intimidating, perhaps. No neurologist right away. Good. I’m not sure I’m up for a whole battery of tests. My knees are protesting already. And… honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. Is it going to be a long wait for the results? I hope not. I just want to get this all over with and go back to my peaceful life. Maybe Susan can come with me to the lab? She’s very good at those things. And… she can help me remember what you told me. I tend to forget things easily, you know. Do you think that’s alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilly. Susan can definitely come with you to the lab, and having her there will be a great help. The results should be back in about a week. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, I'm going to give you some handouts with information about memory loss and brain health. These contain helpful tips and resources. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. Now, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Handouts, you say? Yes, that’s nice. Susan can read them to me later. And… thank you, dear. You’ve been very patient with me. I know I’m not the easiest patient. My knees are still aching, but… I suppose I should be getting home now. I'm quite tired. I think a nap is in order. And… maybe a cup of tea. Do you think Susan can help me schedule the follow-up appointment? She's very good at those things. And… thank you again. It's been a long morning. I just want to go home now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilly. It was my pleasure. Susan can absolutely schedule the follow-up appointment for you. We’ll make sure it’s at a convenient time. Please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Let's get you a little assistance getting to the front desk. Have a good day, and get some rest. And enjoy that cup of tea.
