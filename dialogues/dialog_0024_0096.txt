DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's about the sun, really. I've been getting really bothered by it lately. Like, really bothered. It's not a sunburn thing, it's just... everything feels too bright, and it hurts my eyes. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, and it's making things difficult.
DOCTOR: “'Bothered by the sun'… a rather vague complaint, Mr. Komarov. Forgive me for stating the obvious, but the sun is bright. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: No worries at all, Doctor. You're right, "bothered" isn't very specific. Okay, let me try. It's like... even on cloudy days, the light feels too intense. And when I go outside, even with sunglasses, everything seems washed out, and my eyes ache afterwards. It’s not just the brightness, it's like a pain behind my eyes, if that makes sense? It’s been making me want to stay indoors all the time, which isn’t great.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Pain behind the eyes.” And this has been ongoing for weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few weeks now. Maybe... six, seven weeks? It started gradually, just a little discomfort, and then it got worse and worse. I didn't think much of it at first, just figured I was tired, or needed new glasses. But it’s really starting to affect things. I used to enjoy gardening, but now I can barely stand being outside for ten minutes. It's also giving me headaches sometimes, behind my eyes, of course.
DOCTOR: Headaches and photophobia – sensitivity to light. Have you noticed any changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: Photophobia, that's a fancy word for what I'm feeling, huh? Yeah, that's exactly it. And changes in vision… not really blurry vision, no. But things seem… paler, maybe? Like the colors aren’t as bright as they used to be. It’s hard to explain. And sometimes, when I look at something bright, I get little sparkly things in my vision for a moment afterwards. Not all the time, though. It's like a flash, but just little spots.
DOCTOR: “Little sparkly things.” Right. And are these headaches constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They definitely come and go, Doctor. They're not always there. They're usually worse after I've been outside, or if I've been reading for a long time. Sometimes they're just a dull ache, other times they feel like a pressure behind my eyes. It’s hard to describe, honestly. It’s not like a normal headache, like a pounding pain. More… uncomfortable, if that makes sense? And they don't last all day, usually just a few hours at a time. Oh, and sometimes my eyes feel gritty, too, even when they're not dry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. Let’s have a look. Look straight ahead… good. And now follow my finger… left… right… up… down. Pupils appear normal size and reactive to light. No obvious clouding of the lens. However, your conjunctiva does appear slightly inflamed. Now, tell me, have you had any recent upper respiratory infection?
PATIENT: Inflamed… is that bad? I haven’t been sick, not really. I had a little sniffle a couple of months ago, but it didn’t last long. Just a normal cold, I thought. Nothing major, no fever or anything. Just a blocked nose and a sore throat for a few days. I took some over-the-counter cold medicine and it went away pretty quickly. I don’t get sick very often, usually.
DOCTOR: A minor cold… unlikely to be the cause of your symptoms, but noted. Do you currently take any medications, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. Just some vitamins, a multivitamin every morning. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, just something I picked up at the pharmacy. And occasionally, if my joints are acting up, I'll take some ibuprofen. But that's it. I try to stay healthy, so I don't take much medication at all. Oh, and I wear glasses for reading, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything, and I've never had any trouble with any medications I've taken in the past. Actually, now that I think about it… my wife, before she passed, she was allergic to penicillin. But I’m not allergic to anything myself, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on your description and this brief examination, it could be a case of viral conjunctivitis complicated by some mild photophobia. However, given the duration of your symptoms, the gritty sensation, and the headaches, I would like to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some basic blood work to check for inflammation, and I recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist for a more comprehensive eye exam. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: Blood work and an eye doctor… okay. That sounds… thorough. Is it… serious, Doctor? Should I be worried? And what does the ophthalmologist do, exactly? I've never been to one of those before. Also, does Medicare cover all of this? I worry about the costs, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov, let us not jump to conclusions. "Serious" is a subjective term. We are simply being diligent. The ophthalmologist will perform a more detailed examination of your eyes to assess the cause of your discomfort. As for Medicare coverage, I am reasonably certain it will cover the necessary tests, but you should verify this with your insurance provider. Here is the referral. I will also order the blood work now. You should schedule both appointments as soon as possible. Avoid prolonged exposure to bright light until we have a definitive diagnosis. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Avoid bright light, schedule the appointments… I’ll call and get those set up right away. Thank you. I appreciate you being thorough, even if it is a little worrying. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It’s hard to enjoy life when your eyes are bothering you. I guess I’ll see you again when the test results are back?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Komarov. We will review the results and discuss further treatment options at that time. Do not hesitate to contact the office if your symptoms worsen. You may leave now. .
