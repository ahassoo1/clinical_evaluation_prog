DOCTOR: Hi Lilyanna, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet. A bit like I might fall, though I haven’t yet. It’s been… a while now, I think. Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Fuzzy” is alright, we can work with that. Just tell me what you do remember. How long would you say this has been going on, even roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… weeks, perhaps? Maybe a couple of months? It's hard to say. Things… haven't been very consistent lately. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It started… after… well, never mind that right now. It feels longer than a few weeks, but I couldn’t give you a precise date, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Right, no worries at all. We'll figure it out. So, this unsteadiness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes. Some days I feel perfectly fine, quite stable, actually. Others… others it’s more noticeable. It seems to be worse when I'm… tired, I suppose. And when I’ve been on my feet for a long time. Though, truthfully, even when I haven’t been on my feet all day, it can still happen. It's rather unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable and related to fatigue… that's helpful. Are you experiencing any dizziness with the unsteadiness, or is it more of a feeling of being off-balance?
PATIENT: Hmm… not dizziness, precisely. It’s not like the room is spinning. It’s more… a wobble. A feeling that I’m not quite connected to the ground, if that makes any sense. Like I could tip over easily. It's not a spinning sensation, no. More… precarious.
DOCTOR: Alright, "precarious" is a good way to put it. And are you noticing any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No… not that I've noticed, specifically. I’ve been rather tired, of course, but I attribute that to… well, to things. I haven't been sleeping well. And I suppose I've been a little more clumsy than usual, bumping into things. But I wouldn’t necessarily say those are symptoms, exactly. Just… things. Is there something specific I should be looking for? I worry I'll miss something important.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing great. Just trying to get a full picture. Okay, tiredness and a bit clumsier… Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… No, not that I'm aware of. Everything seems… normal. Perhaps a little blurry sometimes, but I’ve always needed glasses. It hasn’t gotten any worse, certainly. I had my eyes checked last year, and they said everything was… adequate. Though I can't recall the specifics. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, occasionally. Not severe ones, usually just a dull ache. They come and go, like everything else. I take… I take something for them, when they bother me. But I wouldn't say they’re constant, or particularly debilitating. They feel… like tension, mostly. At the base of my skull.
DOCTOR: Alright, tension headaches… good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. Things were… complicated. I was seen by doctors, of course. After… everything. But I don't have all the records. And truthfully, I don't remember much of what they told me. I believe I had… some tests. Nothing specific comes to mind. I was generally healthy before… before my husband passed. I don’t believe I’ve ever been diagnosed with anything significant, but I can’t say for certain. Would you like me to try and think harder? I just… it’s all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: No, don't strain yourself. It's perfectly alright. We can work with what you do remember. Okay. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: There… was a surgery. After… the accident. It was… necessary. But I don’t remember the details. They kept me in the hospital for… a while. A long while. But it was some time ago now. I don't recall what was done, specifically. It was… a very difficult time. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory is… unreliable, at best.
DOCTOR: Okay. No need to apologize. We'll do what we can. Any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. Just the over-the-counter pain reliever for my headaches, when I need it. And… I take a multivitamin, I believe. That’s all. Nothing prescribed, no. I… I haven’t really needed much medication since… well, a long time ago. I try to avoid it, if possible. Is there something I should be taking? I worry I've forgotten something important.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prescribed medications. Okay. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. I don't get seasonal allergies, like sneezing or a runny nose. And I can eat all sorts of foods without any problems. No known allergies, no. Though… could allergies cause unsteadiness? I worry I'm missing something obvious.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No, allergies typically don’t cause unsteadiness directly. Okay. Now, just a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s another difficult question. My family… we weren’t very close. I didn’t see them often. And my husband… he didn’t have a large family, either. I believe his mother had… something with her heart. But I don’t recall the specifics. And my mother… she was generally healthy, I think. No major illnesses, not that I’m aware of. I’m afraid I don’t have much information about my family’s medical history. It's not something we discussed much. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's alright. We can move on. And finally, what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I work, as you know. It’s… physically demanding. Long hours, a lot of standing. It’s a demanding job. Aside from that… I don’t really have many hobbies. I try to get enough sleep, but it's difficult. And I don’t eat as well as I should, I suppose. It’s hard to eat properly when you’re always on the go. And I don’t get much exercise. Is there something specific you're asking about? I feel like I'm not giving you enough information.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing fine. Just trying to get a full picture. Okay. Alright, Lilyanna. Given what you've told me, and based on your history, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your balance, your reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn't take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that’s alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, just… be gentle. I haven’t been feeling very steady.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be. Alright, let's start with your balance. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Here I am, Doctor. It's… a little wobbly, but I'm standing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. Now, can you close your eyes and stand with your feet together?
PATIENT: Yes… I’m doing it. It’s… not very comfortable, Doctor. I feel like I’m going to fall. Just let me know if I’m doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see that. You're doing fine. A little wobble is expected. Now, I’m going to ask you to do a tandem stance – that means putting one foot directly in front of the other, heel to toe, like you're walking a tightrope. Can you try that for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear… this is… difficult. Very difficult. I don't think I can do this, Doctor. I'm going to fall.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, that's alright. Don't worry, I've got you. You can step back. That was very helpful. Your balance is definitely affected. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you please sit back down?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… was not pleasant. Thank you for catching me. I really appreciate it. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Okay, I'm going to check your reflexes in your arms and legs. I'll gently tap on a few tendons, and you just relax. This shouldn't be painful, but let me know if it's uncomfortable. First, let's check your biceps reflex. Could you please let your arm hang relaxed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's relaxed. Go ahead. I'm a little nervous, but I’m trying to stay calm.
DOCTOR: Okay. And again. Good. And now the triceps reflex. Relax your arm again. Okay. Now, let's check your knee reflex. You might need to let your leg dangle for this one.
PATIENT: Yes, it's dangling, Doctor. Go ahead. It's… a little strange, but I’m cooperating. Let me know if you need me to do anything differently.
DOCTOR: Okay. And again. Alright. Now, finally, the ankle reflex. You might need to move your foot slightly. Alright. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Deep breath in… and out. Is that alright? I'm trying to breathe as deeply as possible. It's a little difficult, but I’m doing my best. Do you hear anything unusual?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Deep breaths. Your heart sounds regular. Your lungs are clear. Alright, Lilyanna. That completes the physical exam. Your balance is definitely affected, but your reflexes are normal, and your heart and lungs sound good. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect this could be related to an inner ear issue or potentially some neurological concerns, but further testing is needed to determine the exact cause. I'd like to order an MRI of your brain and an audiogram to check your hearing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… and an audiogram? Those sound… serious, Doctor. Is something seriously wrong? I was hoping it was just something simple. Neurological concerns… that sounds frightening. What does that mean, exactly? And what are the chances it’s something… less concerning? I'm a little overwhelmed, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Lilyanna. It is a bit unsettling to hear those terms. I want to be thorough, and those tests will help me rule things out and pinpoint the cause of your unsteadiness. “Neurological concerns” just means we need to check your brain and nervous system to ensure everything is functioning properly. It doesn’t necessarily mean there is something wrong. Many things can cause unsteadiness, and most are not serious. Inner ear issues are very common and treatable. An MRI is just a scan – it doesn’t hurt, and it will give us a detailed picture of your brain. An audiogram is a simple hearing test. The chances of it being something serious are low, but we need to rule out all possibilities. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain them in more detail. Knowing what to expect might help calm my nerves. What exactly will happen during an MRI? Will I be in a closed space? And what does an audiogram involve? Is it painful? I'm just… anxious, Doctor. This is all very overwhelming. And… will these tests be covered by my insurance?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your anxiety completely. Let’s start with the MRI. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, tube-shaped machine. It is a closed space, but it's well-ventilated and you'll have headphones to listen to music. It's important to stay very still during the scan, which usually takes about 30-60 minutes. We'll give you earplugs to help with the noise, and you can talk to me through an intercom system if you get uncomfortable. It's not painful, but some people feel a little claustrophobic. We can discuss options for that if you're concerned. Now, the audiogram is much simpler. You'll sit in a soundproof booth and wear headphones. You’ll hear different tones at different volumes, and you’ll press a button whenever you hear a sound. It tests your hearing sensitivity. It doesn’t involve any pain or discomfort. As for your insurance, you have private insurance, which should cover both tests. However, there may be a copay or deductible depending on your plan. I can have our billing department verify your coverage details and let you know the estimated costs beforehand. Does that help ease your concerns a little?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that does help, thank you. Knowing what to expect is definitely reassuring. The MRI sounds a bit scary, but I think I can manage it if I know I can talk to you if I get uncomfortable. And the audiogram sounds much simpler. Could you please have the billing department verify my coverage details? I'd like to know how much I'll be responsible for before I schedule anything. And… when would be a good time to schedule these tests? I work full-time, so I need to find a time that works with my schedule. I appreciate your patience, Doctor. This is all very kind of you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. I will have our billing department contact you directly with the coverage details. As for scheduling, let me check the availability. We have some openings next week. Would Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning work for you?
PATIENT: Thursday morning might be better, if possible. I have a few appointments on Tuesday. And… is there anything I should do to prepare for the tests? Any specific clothing I should wear? Or anything I should avoid before the MRI? I want to make sure I do everything right.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s schedule you for Thursday morning at 9:00 AM for the MRI and the audiogram will be right after. For the MRI, it’s important to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, hairpins, even piercings. And please wear comfortable clothing without any metal zippers or buttons. We'll also ask you to fill out a safety questionnaire before the scan. As for avoiding anything beforehand, just try to stay relaxed and hydrated. You can eat and drink as usual. We'll provide you with more detailed instructions when you check in. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You’ve been very helpful and reassuring. I’ll wait to hear from the billing department and then I’ll schedule the tests. I appreciate everything you’ve done.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns before your appointment. We'll see you on Thursday. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. I will. You have a good day as well. .
