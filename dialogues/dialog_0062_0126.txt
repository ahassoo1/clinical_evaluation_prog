DOCTOR: Hi Christen, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you as well, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… extraordinarily thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It’s just… a lot more than usual, and it’s become quite bothersome. I’m hoping you can help me figure out what’s going on. I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a good place to start. Increased thirst and hunger can be caused by a lot of different things. To help me narrow it down, can you tell me a little more about how much more thirsty and hungry you are?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I’m drinking… easily twice as much water as I used to. Maybe more. And I feel… parched again very quickly after drinking. As for the hunger… I used to be content with three meals a day, and perhaps a small snack. Now? I’m eating… five or six meals, and still feel… unsatisfied. It’s a rather… frustrating situation, to be honest. I haven’t changed my diet or exercise routine, if that’s what you’re wondering.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a significant increase in both thirst and hunger, without any changes to your usual habits. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Let me see… now that you mention it… I suppose I have been going to the lavatory rather frequently. More often than usual, certainly. And… I’ve been feeling a bit tired lately, though I attributed that to… well, just being tired. Nothing major, mind you. Oh, and perhaps a little bit… blurred vision, now that I think about it. It’s not constant, but it happens occasionally. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all definitely relevant, Christen. Frequent urination, fatigue, and blurred vision alongside increased thirst and hunger… those symptoms together are making me think about a few possibilities. Before we go any further, let's get a bit more of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, all things considered. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, that sort of thing, but nothing serious. No ongoing conditions, no chronic illnesses, nothing requiring regular medication. I had a bout of… the flu, a couple of years back, but that was a one-off. I've had a divorce recently, which has been stressful, but physically, I've been sound. Is that... sufficient?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No prior medical conditions. And you mentioned a recent divorce – stress can certainly play a role in how we feel, but the symptoms you're describing seem more specific. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been under the knife, and thankfully, never required hospitalization. I broke my arm when I was a child, playing football, but that was just a simple fracture, treated with a cast. Beyond that… nothing. I’ve always been… fortunate, in that regard. I do take a daily multivitamin, if that's of any importance. It’s just a standard over-the-counter one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations, just a daily multivitamin. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mother passed away a few years back. She… suffered from high blood pressure, I believe. And my father had… some issues with his heart, later in life. Nothing particularly noteworthy before that, as far as I’m aware. My sister is… perfectly healthy, thankfully. Does that provide any… assistance? I’m not much of a medical historian, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. High blood pressure in your mother and heart issues in your father are good things to know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. I do not smoke, nor do I partake in any recreational substances. I occasionally enjoy a glass of whisky with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week, but that's the extent of it. Very moderate consumption, I assure you. I prefer a quiet evening at home to… any sort of excess. I take pride in leading a rather… temperate life.
DOCTOR: Okay, very moderate alcohol consumption, otherwise a temperate lifestyle. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions, thankfully. I’ve had no issues with penicillin, or any other common antibiotics. No food allergies, no sensitivities… nothing of that nature. I've had a few insect bites over the years, but nothing beyond the usual redness and irritation. I suppose… I'm rather fortunate in that regard as well. Is that all you require for the history, Doctor? I’d like to get this sorted if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Christen, that’s a very thorough history. Based on what you’ve told me – the increased thirst and hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, and the family history – I’m concerned about the possibility of diabetes. To confirm this, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and then order some blood tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Diabetes… that sounds… unpleasant. Very well, Doctor. If that’s what’s required, then I suppose so. A physical exam and blood tests… as quickly as possible, if you please. I have… commitments, you understand. Though, I’d appreciate a clear explanation of what you’re looking for, if you wouldn't mind. I dislike being kept in the dark.
DOCTOR: Certainly. During the physical exam, I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam. I’ll also check your feet for any signs of nerve damage, which can sometimes occur with diabetes. The blood tests will measure your blood glucose levels – both fasting and after you consume a sugary drink. We’ll also check your HbA1c, which gives us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past few months. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds reasonable. Blood pressure, heart, lungs, feet… and the glucose tests. I understand it’s a precaution, I suppose. Though, I must admit, I’m rather concerned about the potential outcome. I've always considered myself a healthy individual. Very well, Doctor, let’s proceed. As swiftly as possible, please. I’d like to get this sorted today, if at all feasible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Christen. We’ll move as quickly as we can. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed. I shall endeavor to remain… composed. Though I make no promises.
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathe normally. … 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Now, let’s check your feet. Can you please take off your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you can see, I take reasonable care of my person. Though, admittedly, I haven’t paid particular attention to my feet lately. It's been a stressful time. Proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay, pulses are present, but a little weak. And… hmm. Let me check sensation. I’m noticing a slightly reduced sensation in your toes, especially on the outside of your feet. Not alarming, but something to be aware of. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Now we’ll just need to draw some blood for the tests. The nurse will be in shortly to take that. Do you have any questions before she comes in?
PATIENT: Reduced sensation… that doesn't sound… promising. Is that… definitely indicative of diabetes, Doctor? And how much blood will be required? I dislike needles, you understand. I would appreciate a clear explanation of the process. I’ve always been… somewhat squeamish. Is there any way to expedite the results? I have… matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Christen, let’s address your concerns. Reduced sensation isn’t definitely indicative of diabetes, but it can be a sign of nerve damage caused by prolonged high blood sugar levels. It could also be due to other things, which is why the blood tests are so important. As for the blood draw, it’s standard procedure – a few vials will be taken from your arm. It will be a quick pinch, and it's over very quickly. The nurse is very experienced and gentle. Regarding expediting the results, I’ll speak with the lab and see if they can prioritize them, but it typically takes a few hours to get the complete results back. I’ll do my best to get them to you as soon as possible. In the meantime, I want to reassure you that we’re just gathering information right now. Don’t jump to conclusions until we have the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A few hours… I suppose that’s… acceptable. Though, it will be a rather… anxious few hours. Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavor to remain calm. Inform the nurse I dislike needles, if you would be so kind. And… perhaps a cool compress afterwards? I am… not a fan of discomfort. Thank you, Doctor. I believe that concludes my inquiries for the moment. I shall await the nurse’s arrival. Though, I must admit, I’m not looking forward to it.
