DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Right… well, it’s my ear, you see. Feels… blocked. Full, like. Been that way for a little while now, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me. It’s just… annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “blocked” and “full” – I understand. And you said a “little while now”?
PATIENT: Hmm… a few weeks, maybe? Or was it months? It’s hard to say. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days. I don't really keep track of these things, not since… well, never mind. It's just been getting worse, slowly, so I figured I should get it checked.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few weeks to months, gradually worsening. No fever, drainage, or pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And definitely no… drainage. Pain? Not really pain, exactly. More like… discomfort. A pressure, I suppose. It doesn’t hurt to touch it, or anything. Just… there. It's irritating, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no drainage, just discomfort and pressure. Have you noticed any hearing loss, ringing in your ear, or dizziness alongside the fullness?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… maybe a little? People sometimes seem… muffled. I just figured I was getting old, you know? Ringing… I don't recall any ringing. And no dizziness, thankfully. I get enough trouble just staying upright these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, some muffled hearing, no ringing or dizziness. Have you tried anything to relieve it yourself – over-the-counter drops, warm compresses, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, I think my daughter – bless her heart – she gave me some drops once. Didn't seem to do much, honestly. And I tried… warm compresses, maybe? It all blurs together. I mostly just ignore it, try to get on with things. Doesn’t always work, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've tried drops and perhaps warm compresses with no relief. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I'm aware of. I used to be around a lot of flowers, working with… well, it doesn’t matter now. Never had a reaction, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the usual, for my… well, for things. My blood pressure, mostly. A little pill every morning. And sometimes something for my… joints. They ache, you see. I can’t remember the names, sorry. My daughter handles all that paperwork.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure and something for your joints. We can look those up in our system if you'd like. Now, have you had any previous ear problems – infections, surgery, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long time ago. I think… as a boy, maybe? I had terrible earaches. My mother… she always said I was prone to them. But I don’t remember any surgery. Just… the aches. Everything is so hazy these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of earaches as a child, no surgery. And finally, do you have any family history of hearing loss or ear problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, I think. He was always shouting, even when you were right next to him. My mother said he just… couldn't hear very well when he got older. But I don’t know if that was just… him. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of possible hearing loss in your father. Alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez, that gives me a good starting point. Now, would you mind if I took a quick look in your ears and do a brief hearing test to get a better understanding of what’s going on?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you wouldn’t mind. My attention… wanders, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick as possible. Please look straight ahead. Okay, the ear canal appears a little narrow, and there's some cerumen present. Nothing dramatically abnormal, but the eardrum isn't quite as clear as I’d like to see. Same on this side – narrow canal, cerumen, slightly obscured eardrum. Okay, I'm going to make some sounds and have you tell me when you can hear them. Please raise your hand when you hear the tone, even if it's faint. Alright, your hearing appears to be slightly diminished in both ears, particularly at higher frequencies. It's not a dramatic loss, but it's noticeable. It could be related to the cerumen buildup, age-related changes, or something else. I recommend we remove the earwax first and see if that improves your hearing. We can do that here in the office. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Removing the wax. If it helps, that would be good. I just want to be able to hear my daughter properly. She worries so much, you see. Yes, please, remove the wax. The sooner the better, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. We can proceed with the earwax removal right away. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure. I’ll use a gentle irrigation system. We will also document this in your chart and keep a record of it. Are you experiencing any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort. Just… a bit of coolness, perhaps? It's… strange, but not unpleasant. As long as it helps, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, we're making good progress on both sides. I'm seeing clearer and clearer. Alright, all done! That wasn't too bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Actually, I think… I can hear you a bit better already. It's subtle, but… clearer. Good. Very good. My daughter will be pleased.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! Now, I recommend a follow-up hearing test in about a month to see if the hearing improvement continues and to rule out any other underlying issues. We can schedule that for you now if you'd like. And I’ll give you some instructions on how to prevent wax buildup in the future. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that's all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening, and for helping. It’s been… worrying me, you see. And my daughter… she worries even more. Yes, thank you. Schedule the follow-up, if you would. And instructions on the wax… yes, that would be good.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I’m glad we could address your concerns. I’ll schedule a follow-up hearing test for you in one month, on September 2nd at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: September 2nd… yes, that’s fine. Thank you again, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the receptionist print out those instructions on wax prevention for you now. She’ll also provide a summary of today’s visit, including the medication list. If you experience any sudden hearing loss, dizziness, or severe ear pain before your follow-up appointment, please contact the office immediately. Have a wonderful day, Mr. GuerreroloLopez, and please give your daughter my best. .
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. I will. You have a good day too, Doctor. And thank you again for everything.
