DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… right. My ear. It feels… full. Like something’s blocked, you know? It’s been bothering me for a bit now. Honestly, I can't quite recall when it started, exactly. A few weeks, maybe? It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Right. And is it just the feeling of fullness, or is there any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain… not really pain, no. More like… pressure. A sort of muffled feeling, everything sounds quiet. I don’t think it hurts, not unless I try to… really clear it, I guess. Which doesn’t work, by the way. I've tried. A lot.
DOCTOR: Pressure and muffled hearing… alright. And has this happened before?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I think maybe… once, a long time ago? But I couldn't swear to it. It’s all a bit fuzzy. I do remember my wife used to deal with all these appointments… and everything. It’s… different now.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll figure it out. Let’s try to pinpoint a few things. Have you noticed any dizziness, ringing in your ears, or any discharge from your ear at all?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. Though, I do get a bit… unsteady sometimes, but that’s probably just my age, you know? Ringing… occasionally, maybe? A very faint sort of… hum. And no, no discharge. Definitely no discharge. I'm fairly certain. Everything just feels… blocked. It's incredibly frustrating. Can we just… get this sorted out? I have a lot on today.
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll get to it. It's just important to rule things out. Alright. And have you been around anyone recently who's been sick?
PATIENT: Sick… uh. Not that I recall. Old Man Hemmings down the road had a bad cough last week, maybe? But I didn't get close to him. I try to avoid germs, if that makes sense. Look, is this going to be a long process? Because I really need to get back to the farm. The potatoes need tending.
DOCTOR: Mr. GuerreroloLopez, I understand you're busy, but I need to gather a complete history to ensure I provide you with the best possible care. Now, before we move on, let's discuss your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking about… everything. Let me see. I had… a touch of the flu a few years back, but that’s hardly chronic. My wife always said I was as strong as an ox. She handled all the doctor stuff, so… honestly, I don't really know. I think my blood pressure was a little high once, but they just told me to watch my salt. That's about it, I think. Really, I’ve always been healthy. Until this ear thing, of course. Can we just… look in my ear now? Please?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look. Please lean forward a bit. Hmm. There appears to be some cerumen impaction. A fair amount, actually. That could certainly be contributing to the fullness and muffled hearing. It's quite… packed in there. And the tympanic membrane is slightly obscured. Do you have any allergies to ear drops?
PATIENT: Ear drops… no, I don’t think so. Never needed them before. My wife used to get those little nose sprays, but that was her. Allergies… I’m not sure. I get a bit sniffly in the spring, but that’s probably just the pollen. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not good with these medical details. If it's just wax, can you just… remove it? Please? I really need to get back to the potatoes. They're a very temperamental variety.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can attempt to remove the wax. However, given the amount of impaction, I’d prefer to use irrigation. It’s the safest and most effective method. And before we proceed, I need to document your history fully. Just a few more questions, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, let me think. Just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. When it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think it is. The blue tablets. And a multivitamin. That's it. Honestly, I try to avoid pills whenever possible. They never seem to do much good, anyway. Can we please get on with removing the wax now? I’m starting to feel quite anxious, if I’m being honest. The potatoes… they need me. And I don’t want to risk damaging my hearing.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed with the irrigation. But I need you to understand there is a small risk of temporary dizziness or discomfort. And if the irrigation isn’t successful, we may need to refer you to an ENT specialist. Are you comfortable with that understanding?
PATIENT: ENT specialist… goodness. No, I’m not comfortable with that at all. I just want the wax gone. That’s all. Can’t you just… flush it out? I've got a very important harvest coming up. I really, really don't have time for specialists. Is it going to hurt? Please, Doctor, just tell me it won’t hurt. I'm starting to feel rather lightheaded, actually. Perhaps it's the stress. The potatoes… they’re counting on me. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Let's proceed with the irrigation. But I need you to stay very still. And if you experience any pain or discomfort, you must tell me immediately. I’ll try to be as gentle as possible. Now, lean your head slightly to the side…
