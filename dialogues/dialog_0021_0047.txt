DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover, have a seat. So, Cleo Rover, 47 years old… right. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, Cleo. That’s right. Doc… Jumana, is it? Well, it’s… about long-term care. My wife… she took care of all that stuff. Now she’s… not here anymore. And I gotta figure things out, I guess. Something about insurance? It’s all kinda blurry, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Insurance… yes, well, that's usually someone’s department. Private insurance, good. Though frankly, most people come prepared with some paperwork. It's… simpler that way. Blurry, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, blurry. Real blurry. She had all the files… boxes of 'em. I… I haven’t really looked through ‘em yet. Too hard, you know? She did everything. Bills, doctors… everything. I just… worked. Moved stuff around. Freight, mostly. I don't keep track of papers. Sorry. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's… not ideal, Mr. Rover. Let's not get dramatic, though. “Not ideal.” We’ll figure it out. So, this is about understanding your coverage, potentially finding new doctors, making sure you're… taken care of now that your wife handled everything. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… that’s right. Taken care of. That sounds good. Real good. She always said I needed someone to… keep an eye on things. She was a smart woman, my wife. I just… don’t know where to start. Like, what do I need to know? And what does this… assessment… actually do?
DOCTOR: An assessment… well, it's standard procedure, Mr. Rover. We need a baseline. Current health status, any existing conditions, medications… things like that. Even if you feel perfectly fine, things can change. It helps us understand what your coverage will allow and what specialists, if any, you might need. And frankly, it helps me understand what I'm dealing with. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly… hmm. Not really. I mean, I went when I broke my wrist a few years back, loading a truck. And I get a check-up when the company makes us, you know, for the insurance. But… not a regular doctor. Not like… every year. I mostly just try to stay moving. Keeps things… working. Is that bad too? I just haven't needed to… bother anyone much, I guess.
DOCTOR: “Bother anyone”?
PATIENT: Well, my wife… she always handled it. Appointments, questions… she liked talking to doctors. I just… do the work. She said I wasn’t good at explaining things. Said I got straight to the point and didn’t… pay attention to details. Which is probably true. I'm a mover, Doc. Not a talker. Sorry. I'm probably making this harder than it needs to be.
DOCTOR: Right. A “mover.” Well, that's… useful, I suppose. Look, Mr. Rover, I’m going to need some basic information. Let's start with allergies. Any known allergies to medications, food, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a problem with food, not really. I think I got a rash once, when I was a kid, but my mom said it was just poison ivy. And I don't take any pills or anything. Never been one for that sort of thing. Does that… help? I'm not sure I'm very good at this. Is there a form I could fill out later? Maybe that would be easier?
DOCTOR: A form… eventually. Right now, we need to establish some basics. Alright. What about past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical… Well, like I said, broke my wrist a few years back. Working, of course. That's… about it, I think. I had the flu a couple times, when I was younger, but everyone gets the flu, right? Nothing serious. And… I had stitches once. When I was a teenager. Fell off my bike. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, Doc, I'm not a sick man. I just… need to figure out what my wife took care of. Everything’s blurry. It's like… she handled everything, and now I'm just… floating. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Blurry. Yes, we’ve established that. Alright, Mr. Rover. Let's move on to family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings – had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mom… she lived to be pretty old. But I think she had… something with her heart. Towards the end. But she never talked about it much. And my dad… he worked on the boats. Tough man. Always strong. I don't remember him being sick. He just… stopped working one day. And that was that. I had an older brother, but… we didn't see each other much. I'm not sure I know much about their medical stuff. Honestly, Doc, we didn't really… talk about that kind of thing. It was just… work. And living. That’s all. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It’s…helpful. It gives us a bigger picture. Social history, Mr. Rover. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she hated smoking. Said it was awful for you. I always stayed away from it. Always. And I don't drink much either. A beer sometimes, with dinner. But that's about it. I mostly just… go home after work and… sleep. Is this… a test? I'm not very good at tests, Doc.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Rover, it's not a test. It's an assessment. And we are getting somewhere, albeit slowly. Let’s talk about weight. Have you noticed any significant changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight… hmm. I think I’ve maybe gained a little. Since my wife… well, since she’s gone. I haven’t been… eating as well, I guess. Mostly just whatever’s easiest. And I haven’t been moving around as much. I used to be always loading and unloading… now I mostly just… sit. It's just… different now. Everything’s different. I'm sorry. I'm probably not helping much, am I? I just… miss her. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, I understand this is difficult. We will get through it. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs…standard things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah… alright. That’s okay. Blood pressure, heart rate… sure. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, okay? My wife… she always said I didn't do well with doctors. I just want to get this done and figure out what she took care of. I just… want to know I'm okay. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Rover, that is not too much to ask. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Heart rate is regular at 78. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though you do have some slight rhonchi in the bases. We’ll keep an eye on that. Do you have any history of shortness of breath, or wheezing?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Not really. Not that I remember. I mean, I get a little winded sometimes, when I'm doing a lot of lifting. But that's just… normal, right? Lifting heavy stuff? I'm a mover, Doc, I lift things all day. And I don't think I wheeze. Maybe a little cough sometimes, when it's cold. But not wheezing. My wife… she always said I was stubborn about going to the doctor. I just… don't like being poked and prodded, I guess. Is that bad? I just want to know what she took care of, and if I'm going to be okay. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Rover, it’s not too much to ask. And frankly, you are rather stubborn. A slight cough is something we'll note. Alright, let's move on to a neurological exam. I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Follow your finger… okay. Like this? Is that right? I'm not very good at this, Doc. My wife… she always said I was better with my hands than my eyes. I'm a mover, remember? Loading and unloading... that’s what I do. Am I doing it wrong? I just want to know what she took care of, and if I'm okay. Is that too much to ask? This is making me nervous. Can we just… talk about the insurance?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, we’re getting there, slowly. Your eye movements are normal, for what it’s worth. Look, let’s take a step back. The insurance is… complicated. To even begin to understand it, we need a baseline understanding of your health. We need to rule out any urgent issues before we can even think about coverage. Now, do you have any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… hmm. Well, my wife always said I had a bad back. From all the lifting. But that's just… normal, right? For a mover? And I get a little ache in my shoulder sometimes. But that comes and goes. Does that count as chronic? I don’t… I don’t think I have anything serious. I just… I miss her. She always knew what to do. She always took care of everything. I just want to know what she did, and if I'm going to be okay. Can we just… talk about the insurance? I just want to know if I'm covered, and if I'm going to be alright. Is that too much to ask? I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, let’s be frank. Your lack of a clear medical history is… concerning. We've established you’ve had a bad back and shoulder pain, but those are vague complaints. To understand your coverage, and to ensure you don't have any underlying conditions, I need to order some basic bloodwork. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. We’ll also need a chest X-ray, to rule out anything in your lungs. Will you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Bloodwork… and a chest X-ray? I… I don't like needles. And X-rays… are those safe? My wife… she never made me get bloodwork. Or X-rays. She always said I was fine. Just a little sore sometimes. I don't want to… I don't want to know if something’s wrong. I just want to know what she took care of, and if I'm going to be alright. Can we just… talk about the insurance? I just want to know if I'm covered. Is that too much to ask? I just want to go home. Can we just talk about the insurance?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, I understand you’re anxious, and you miss your wife. But I cannot, in good conscience, discuss your insurance coverage without a basic understanding of your health status. It's irresponsible, and frankly, it could leave you vulnerable. Look, the bloodwork is minimal. A few vials of blood. And the chest X-ray is standard procedure. It’s a quick scan. It's about ruling things out. If you refuse these tests, I can refer you to another physician. But I strongly recommend you reconsider. We need to know what we’re dealing with before we can proceed. Will you consent to the tests?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, fine. Bloodwork… and the X-ray. But… can you be quick? And… can you explain everything to me? I don’t understand medical stuff. My wife… she always did the talking. She always knew what to ask. Just… please be quick. And please explain everything to me. I just want to know what she took care of, and if I’m going to be alright. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover. Yes, we’ll be quick. And I will explain everything, as clearly as possible. The bloodwork will give us a snapshot of your organ function, your blood count, and your cholesterol levels. The chest X-ray will help us visualize your lungs and heart. It’s routine. Once we have the results, we can discuss your coverage, and address any concerns you may have. I'll also need to ask you to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review everything. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… one week. That sounds… okay. As long as you explain everything to me. And… thank you. Thank you for being patient with me. My wife… she would have understood. Can we… can we at least talk about the insurance a little bit? Just to know… if I’m covered for anything, in case something’s wrong? Even just a little bit? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover. Very well. Let’s talk about the insurance, briefly. You have private insurance, which is good. However, without knowing your specific plan details – deductible, co-pay, covered services – it’s difficult to say exactly what will be covered. I see here that your plan is a PPO, which means you have more flexibility in choosing providers. But you'll need to check your plan's formulary to see if any necessary medications are covered. And, of course, you'll need to obtain pre-authorization for any specialist referrals. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. Once we have the results, we can delve deeper into your coverage and address any concerns. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… PPO… formulary… pre-authorization… It's a lot. Too much. Can you… can you just write everything down for me? All the steps? And… can you help me figure it out? I just… I just want to know what she took care of, and if I'm going to be alright. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover. Yes, I can write everything down for you. Here. Here’s a list of steps. I’ll also include the phone number for your insurance company. I can help you navigate the process, but ultimately, you’ll need to be the one to make the calls and obtain the necessary information. We’ll take it one step at a time. First, let’s get the bloodwork and X-ray scheduled. Then, we’ll tackle the insurance. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. That sounds… better. Much better. Thank you. Thank you for writing it down. And thank you for being patient with me. I just… I miss her so much. She would have known what to do. Can we… can we just schedule the tests now? And then I can go home? I just want to get this done. Please.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Rover, let’s schedule the tests now. Alright. I'm going to have the receptionist schedule your bloodwork for tomorrow morning, and the chest X-ray for the following day. They’ll provide you with all the necessary paperwork. Alright, it’s scheduled. Bloodwork tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM, and chest X-ray the day after at 10:00 AM. And yes, you can go home now. I understand this has been difficult. Just remember to take it one step at a time. We'll get through this together. Now, do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that's all. Thank you. Thank you so much. Just… thank you. I think I can manage from here. Thank you. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Next patient.
