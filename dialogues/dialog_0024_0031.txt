DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kreckel. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. It's been bothering me for a few days now. And… I have a heart thing, the atrial fibrillation, you see. I think it might be connected.
DOCTOR: Connected, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The doctor back home, he said it could cause things like this, swelling. Though, I don't really understand how. It just… feels different than before. More achey, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: "Back home?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I just moved here, to be closer to my cousin. I used to live in a small town, near Inverness. That’s where my doctor was. I haven’t found a new one yet, except for you, of course. I was hoping you could help.
DOCTOR: Right, a recent relocation. And you believe this swelling coincided with the move?
PATIENT: Well, it started a few days after I arrived. It's hard to say for sure if it was the move itself, or just… a bit of bad timing. I did a fair bit of travelling to get here, you see. Lots of sitting on planes and in cars. Could that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Sitting for extended periods. Hardly a novel affliction. Now, tell me specifically about the swelling. Where exactly on the leg is it located?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my lower leg, Doctor. From my ankle all the way up to just below my knee, I would say. And it's… it's not hard, if that makes sense. It's soft to the touch, but quite… puffy. It also feels warm, compared to my other leg. I noticed that this morning when I was getting dressed.
DOCTOR: Warm, you say. Very well. Let’s have a look. Please, have a seat on the examination table. And try not to fidget. We haven't all day.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Is there anything I should be doing while you look? Should I move my foot, or…? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No, remain still. I will tell you if I require any movement. Now, let me assess the extent of this… puffiness. Hmm. No obvious signs of trauma. Skin temperature is… slightly elevated, as you indicated. And some mild pitting edema present. I'll need to check your pulses.
PATIENT: Pulses? Oh, yes, alright. I do get a bit cold sometimes, so I suppose that might be why my legs feel cold normally. Is pitting edema… bad? I’m sorry, I don't mean to ask so many questions.
DOCTOR: "Asking questions is precisely why I'm here, Ms. Kreckel, although a little research beforehand is always advisable. Now, pitting edema is not, in and of itself, immediately alarming, however, it can indicate a number of underlying issues. And given your… cardiac history, we must proceed with caution. Tell me, are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No chest pain at all. I'm a bit tired, but I think that’s just from the travelling and getting settled. And sometimes I feel a little… fluttery in my chest, but that’s just my usual atrial fibrillation, I think. It doesn’t happen all the time. Shortness of breath, no, not at all. Dizziness… not really, although I did feel a bit lightheaded standing up earlier. But that could just be from getting up too quickly.
DOCTOR: Lightheadedness upon standing. We shall explore that further. Now, Ms. Kreckel, I need to inquire about your medication regimen. Are you currently taking any pharmaceuticals?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I take bisoprolol, for my heart. Here it is. And… sometimes I take paracetamol, if I get a headache. But that's not regularly. Just when I need it. The bisoprolol, though, I take that every day. The doctor back home prescribed it for me.
DOCTOR: Bisoprolol, as expected. And paracetamol, intermittently. Very well. Now, have you had any blood clots in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! No blood clots, Doctor. I've never had any problems with blood clots. My family doesn’t have a history of them either, as far as I know. That’s… that’s good, isn't it? I do worry a bit, you see. About my heart. And now my leg. It all feels a bit… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Worry is rarely productive. Now, Ms. Kreckel, I believe we have enough information for a preliminary assessment. It is possible this swelling is simply a result of prolonged travel and venous insufficiency, exacerbated by your cardiac condition. However, we cannot rule out a deep vein thrombosis. Therefore, I will order a D-dimer test to assess for the presence of blood clots, and a comprehensive blood panel to evaluate your overall health. We will also need to check your kidney function.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A D-dimer test… and a blood panel. That sounds… thorough. Will the blood tests be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I just… I would like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if that’s alright. Is that a lot to ask?
DOCTOR: A phlebotomist will draw blood from your arm, Ms. Kreckel. It will be a momentary discomfort, hardly worth mentioning. As for the results, they typically take 24 to 48 hours. I would remind you, however, that laboratory turnaround times can vary. Do not expect miracles. Now, I will also order compression stockings, which you should wear daily to improve circulation in your leg. I will see you again in two days to discuss the results. Until then, elevate your leg whenever possible and limit prolonged periods of standing or sitting. Do you have any further questions, or may we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Compression stockings. I think I can manage that. Elevate my leg… yes, I can do that too. Just… if it is a blood clot, Doctor… is it… serious? I’m sorry, I just… I don't like to worry, but I can’t help but think about the worst-case scenario. And… thank you for seeing me so quickly. I appreciate it. I don’t think I have any more questions at the moment. Thank you.
DOCTOR: A blood clot, if present, requires prompt treatment. We will address that should it be necessary. Now, please do not dwell on hypothetical scenarios. Focus on following the instructions I have provided. Very well. You are dismissed. The nurse will show you where to schedule your follow-up appointment.
