DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is Andraca, yes? It is nice to meet you too. I am here for… the talk on the computer. The one they told me about. For my health. I am Avril Benites.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, Andraca is correct. And you are Avril Benites – excellent. Ah, you mean your annual wellness visit – the preventative health screening. That’s right. We’ll go over your medical history, do a quick physical exam, and discuss any concerns you might have. It's a comprehensive check-up to help keep you healthy. Before we begin, just to confirm, is your date of birth August 12th, 1968?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. August… the twelfth. 1968. It is hard to remember sometimes, everything goes so fast. But yes, that is my birthday. Is okay if I ask what we will do exactly? I am not so good with computers, and I worry I forget things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Benites, and it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. No worries at all about asking questions – please feel free to interrupt me at any time. We'll start by reviewing your current medications, any allergies you have, and your past medical history – any illnesses or surgeries you've had. Then, I'll ask about your family history and lifestyle, like your diet and exercise habits. Following that, I’ll perform a brief physical exam – checking your blood pressure, heart rate, lungs, and so on. We'll also discuss any specific concerns you have today. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds good. Yes. I take… a pill for my blood pressure. And sometimes something for my knees, when they bother me. No allergies that I know of. I had… surgery on my knee, many years ago. It was a long time ago. And my mother, she had problems with her heart. Is that… the family history?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what we'd consider family history – knowing about health issues your close relatives have experienced. So, you take a pill for blood pressure and something as needed for your knees. Do you recall the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… difficult. The blood pressure one… it is a small white pill. I take it every morning. The other one… the doctor gave it to me after the surgery. It is a yellow capsule. I do not remember the names. I… I have many pills. It is hard to keep track. I always ask my daughter to help me fill the bottles.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Benites. Medication names can be confusing, and it's common to have trouble remembering them. We can certainly look those up in our system to be sure we have everything correct. Let's start with your blood pressure medication. About how long have you been taking it?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe five years? Six? It was after my husband… passed away. The doctor said my blood pressure was high from the stress. So he gave me the small white pill. It helps, I think. I still feel tired sometimes, but… that might be just getting older. Is that okay to say?
DOCTOR: That is absolutely okay to say, Ms. Benites. And it’s very good you’re aware of that possibility. Feeling tired can have many causes, and it’s good to consider all of them. Six years, okay. And do you know approximately when you had the knee surgery?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time ago. Maybe… twenty years? More? It was before my granddaughter was born, and she is eighteen now. So… yes, a long time. It helped for many years, but now it bothers me again. Sometimes it is hard to walk.
DOCTOR: Twenty years ago, alright. And you're experiencing some pain in your knee again currently?
PATIENT: Yes. Not all the time. But when I walk too much, or if it is cold. It aches. And sometimes it feels… stiff. Like it will not move. I try to rest it, and it helps a little. But it is… annoying. Is that a good word?
DOCTOR: "Annoying" is a very good word, Ms. Benites. It sounds like you're describing some osteoarthritis symptoms – pain and stiffness, especially with activity or changes in the weather. Now, let's move on to your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband, he smoked for many years, but I never liked it. It smelled bad, and he… he had problems with his lungs. I told him to stop many times. No, I do not smoke. And I do not drink alcohol very much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Benites. And how about exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… I used to walk more. But with my knee, it is harder now. I try to do some things at home. Like… stretching. And I do some light housework. But I do not go for long walks anymore. I used to garden, but that is hard too, bending and kneeling. I miss my garden.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve had to adjust your activity level due to your knee. That’s understandable. And do you have any questions for me at this point, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we proceed to the physical exam?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so. You asked many questions. I just want to… be healthy. I want to be able to play with my granddaughter. And I worry about my heart, like my mother. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Benites. Those are very valid concerns. Wanting to be healthy and enjoy time with your granddaughter is a wonderful goal, and your family history is important to address. Alright, let's move on to a brief physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also take a look at your knee. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. You are very kind, Doctor. I… I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Benites. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me… excellent. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That’s slightly elevated. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs... Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s take a look at your knee… Could you please point to where you’re experiencing the most pain?
PATIENT: Here. It hurts when I bend it. And sometimes it feels warm. I do not know if that makes sense. It is not always warm, but sometimes it is. And… it is hard to touch.
DOCTOR: I see. There is some tenderness here, and I do notice a bit of swelling. It does feel slightly warm to the touch. Can you bend your knee for me, and tell me if you feel any pain?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that hurts. It is… a sharp pain. Not all the time, but when I bend it like that. And it feels… like it will stick. It does not bend very smooth.
DOCTOR: I see. Your range of motion is somewhat limited, and there's some crepitus – that's a grinding sensation – when you bend it. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam findings, it sounds like you likely have osteoarthritis in your right knee. Now, osteoarthritis is a common condition, especially as we get older. It's a gradual wearing down of the cartilage in the joint. We can manage it with a combination of approaches. Would you like me to explain some of those options to you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I… I want to know what we can do. I do not want to stop playing with my granddaughter. Is there medicine? Or… something else?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Benites. There are several options. We can start with some lifestyle modifications – things like weight management, if applicable, and low-impact exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knee. Physical therapy can also be very helpful. For medication, there are over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen that can help with pain and inflammation. We can also consider topical creams or gels. In some cases, we may consider injections, like corticosteroids, to reduce inflammation. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. I… I do not weigh much, but I can try to do more exercises. And the physical therapy… is that like… someone helping me stretch? I worry I will not be good at it. I am not very flexible.
DOCTOR: That's a very common worry, Ms. Benites, but physical therapists are experts at tailoring exercises to your abilities and needs. They'll start with gentle stretches and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. They’ll also teach you how to protect your knee and avoid movements that aggravate your pain. I'm going to write you a referral to a physical therapist nearby. And I'll also give you a prescription for a short course of ibuprofen to help manage the pain while you start physical therapy. I also want to order some X-rays of your knee to get a better look at the joint and confirm the diagnosis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. X-rays are okay. And the physical therapy… is that far away? I do not drive very well anymore. My daughter usually takes me to appointments. And thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I feel… a little better now. Just knowing what is wrong.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I'm glad I could help. The physical therapy clinic is just a few blocks from here, so your daughter won't have far to drive. I'll also give you a list of resources for managing osteoarthritis, including some online exercises and helpful tips. Here's your referral to physical therapy, and this is the prescription for the ibuprofen. Please call the physical therapy clinic to schedule an appointment. And if you have any questions or concerns at any point, please don't hesitate to call my office. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: No, I think that is everything. Thank you again, Doctor Andraca. You have been very kind and patient. I appreciate your help very much. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember to take things one step at a time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. I wish you all the best with your physical therapy and getting back to playing with your granddaughter. Have a good day. .
