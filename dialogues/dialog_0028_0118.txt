DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Oriley, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Oriley. Though, honestly, these forms… one fills them out and then someone has to read them, doesn’t one? It’s all rather… inefficient.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s not dwell on administrative matters, shall we?
PATIENT: Quite. I suppose you're Dr. Memmolo? A… Russian name, if I'm not mistaken. No offense intended, of course. I simply like to be aware of these things. Now, about this exam… is it going to take terribly long? I have a luncheon planned.
DOCTOR: Dr. Memmolo is correct. And frankly, your luncheon is not my primary concern. However, I aim to be efficient. Now, tell me – in your own words – what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Right. Well… it’s for… certification, I believe. Something about needing to be… up to date. Honestly, my ex-wife handled all these details. She was very… meticulous. I seem to recall a notice, something about needing to renew a… a permit of some kind? It's all rather foggy, I'm afraid. Do you have the details? Perhaps something I could read?
DOCTOR: It appears you are here for your annual flight physical, Mr. Oriley. Required for your pilot’s license. And yes, it is rather tedious. Now, have you noticed any changes in your health since your last exam?
PATIENT: Pilot’s license… oh, that’s right. Goodness, it’s been a while. Changes… hmm. Well, I do seem to… misplace things more often. Keys, spectacles… the usual things for a man of my age, I suppose. Nothing alarming, certainly. My hearing… I wouldn’t say it’s bad, but things aren’t as crisp as they used to be. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Memory lapses and some hearing decline… noted. Any dizziness, headaches, or vision changes?
PATIENT: No dizziness, thankfully. I detest feeling off-balance. Headaches… occasionally. Nothing debilitating, just a mild ache now and then. Probably stress. And vision… well, I need my reading glasses, naturally. But apart from that, it seems… adequate. Though, I wouldn't claim to have the eyesight of a hawk anymore, if that's what you're asking. Is this all terribly important, Doctor? I truly hope it won't interfere with my luncheon.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Oriley. We need to ensure you meet the medical standards for safe flight operation. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? Goodness, no. I wouldn’t know a palpitation if it bit me. Chest pain… well, a slight discomfort sometimes after a particularly rich meal, but I attribute that to… well, enjoying life. I’ve always been a robust individual. I hardly think a little indigestion warrants a medical examination. Are we making progress here, Doctor? I do appreciate your time, but my luncheon…
DOCTOR: Let’s move on to a brief physical exam then. Please step onto the scale. And, Mr. Oriley, I assure you, this is not a matter of personal preference. It is standard procedure. Weight first, please.
PATIENT: Standard procedure… yes, yes. I understand. Though I must say, these scales are rarely accurate. I maintain a rather strict diet, you know. Perhaps we could simply skip this part? It's rather… humiliating. But very well. Proceed, Doctor. Though, do try to be quick.
DOCTOR: 86 kilograms. That is… a slight increase since your last exam. Now, please stand still while I take your blood pressure. Right arm, please.
PATIENT: A slight increase? Preposterous. It must be the clothing. I’m a rather large man, you see. Broad shoulders, substantial frame. I’ve always been… imposing. Do be gentle, Doctor. I’m rather sensitive about my circulation. And do hurry, won't you? The hollandaise sauce doesn't stay warm forever, you know.
DOCTOR: 140/90. Elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds… regular, but slightly… distant. Now, open your mouth. Say “Ahhh.” Throat appears normal.
PATIENT: "Ahhh." Perfectly normal, as you can see. Though, I did have a rather nasty cold last winter. Perhaps that's lingering. Are we nearing the conclusion, Doctor? I sincerely hope this doesn't require any… invasive procedures. My luncheon awaits, you know. And frankly, I'm starting to feel a bit… peckish.
DOCTOR: Given your elevated blood pressure and slight weight gain, I recommend a more comprehensive evaluation. We should check your cholesterol levels and perform an EKG. It's standard procedure, Mr. Oriley. And it's in your best interest. We need to rule out any underlying cardiovascular issues before you resume flying. I understand you have a luncheon, but your health is paramount.
PATIENT: Cholesterol? An EKG? Preposterous! I feel perfectly fine! A luncheon is hardly a strenuous activity, Doctor. And frankly, I find your concern… excessive. I’ve been flying for decades without a single issue. And my ex-wife would have had my hide if I missed this event. It’s… important. I believe I’ve been quite clear. Perhaps we could simply sign off on this and be done with it? I assure you, I am perfectly capable of piloting an aircraft. This is all rather… unnecessary. I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I understand your frustration. However, as a physician, I am obligated to ensure your safety and the safety of others. We cannot proceed with your flight certification without a thorough assessment. I recommend you schedule an appointment with a cardiologist for a full work-up. I can provide a referral. Until then, I must advise you to refrain from flying. This is not a request, Mr. Oriley. It’s a medical necessity. .
