DOCTOR: Alright, Arbin Komarov, 32 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Billman. Well, it's… it's been a bit strange lately. I'm really bothered by the sun, more than usual. Like, really bothered. It feels like my skin is extra sensitive, even on cloudy days. It's just...photosensitivity, I guess is what my friend called it.
DOCTOR: Photosensitivity, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. It started a few months back, I think? Maybe around April? I can't say for sure, exactly. It's just gotten worse since then. I used to be able to spend a good part of the day outside, but now... not so much. Even driving is rough with the sun coming through the window. It feels like a burn, but without the actual burn, you know? Just... uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, April… a few months of gradually worsening sensitivity. And it’s not a burn exactly, more of a discomfort. Do you notice it happening more in certain areas, or is it pretty widespread?
PATIENT: It's pretty widespread, actually. My face gets it the worst, I think. And my arms, if they're exposed. But even my legs, through my jeans sometimes! It's weird. It doesn’t really seem to matter what I’m wearing, honestly. And it's not like a rash or anything, just… tender skin. Like I’ve been out in the sun too long, even when I haven’t been.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay, widespread, even through clothing sometimes. That is unusual. And you said it started around April… have you started any new medications around that time, or changed anything in your skincare routine?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question! Let me think… No, no new medications. I haven't really changed anything with my skincare, either. I just use regular soap, and sometimes a bit of lotion if my skin feels dry. Nothing fancy at all. I really haven’t changed much in my life, to be honest. It just… started happening. It's just been me, and…well, it's been a bit lonely since my wife passed, but…nothing different with routines or anything.
DOCTOR: Right. And when your wife…passed…how long ago was that?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it was last December. So, about seven months ago now. It was… unexpected. We were getting ready for the holidays, and… well, it happened quickly. It's still hard, to be honest. I don't mean to bring it up, but…it was a big change. Everything changed. I'm sorry, I'm rambling. I don't usually talk this much.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see. Well, sometimes significant life changes can manifest physically. But we need to rule out other things first. I’m going to take a look at your skin. Could you sit up and expose your arms and face for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Here you go. I don’t have much on right now, so it’s pretty bare. Just letting you know, it doesn’t look like anything, usually. It just feels bad.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Skin looks…normal. No rash, no obvious lesions. Color is even. Same here. No visible abnormalities. But I feel a slight tenderness when I press here on your cheek. Okay. Your skin's not presenting with the typical signs of photosensitivity. We're going to need to run some blood work, just to rule out anything systemic. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a Vitamin D level. We'll also check for autoimmune markers.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. That’s good, I guess. Blood work… alright. Will that tell us if it's something serious? I'm not a big fan of needles, but if it helps figure out what's going on, I'm happy to do it. And…what does "autoimmune markers" mean, exactly? I don't think I've ever heard of that.
DOCTOR: “Autoimmune markers” means we’re checking to see if your body’s immune system is attacking its own tissues. It’s a long shot, frankly, but we need to cover all bases. It could be something as simple as a Vitamin D deficiency, but we can’t just assume. As for being "serious," it depends on what we find. Most of the time, it’s nothing major, but it's best to know for sure. The lab orders are being sent to the front desk now. They'll schedule you for a draw. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, try to limit your sun exposure as much as possible, and wear protective clothing and sunscreen when you have to go outside. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Limiting sun exposure... yeah, I can do that. And sunscreen… definitely. Protective clothing too. I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor Billman. It's… reassuring. No, I think that covers it for now. Just… waiting for the results, I guess. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Try not to worry too much. It's likely something straightforward. Have a good day. .
