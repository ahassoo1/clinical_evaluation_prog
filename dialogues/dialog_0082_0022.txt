DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Let me see… well, my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. That’s why I’m here, I think. It just… doesn’t feel right. I don't remember exactly when it started, though. Everything is a bit fuzzy these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Things can get fuzzy. “Tummy feels big” and not much appetite… alright. Can you tell me a little more about this “big” feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… hard to explain. It’s not painful, not exactly. Just… full. Like I ate a very big dinner, but I didn’t. And it feels… tight, sometimes. Like a… a balloon, maybe? But not a painful balloon. Just… there. I used to be a sociologist, you know. Always thinking, always studying… but now… remembering is hard. I hope that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Soila. “Full” and “tight,” not painful, but noticeable… alright. And you mentioned you used to be a sociologist – that’s interesting. Now, has this feeling been getting worse, staying the same, or getting better over time, as best as you can recall?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… worse… better… I… I really don’t know. It comes and goes, I think. Some days I don’t even notice it. Other days… well, like today. It feels more… present. I used to study people, you know? Their habits, their lives… now my life feels… distant. Is that making sense? I’m sorry if I’m not very helpful. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Soila. Don’t worry about a thing. It's perfectly alright if remembering details is difficult. We'll take things slowly. So, it comes and goes… sometimes you don’t notice it, and other times it’s more present. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t think so. I eat… well, I try to eat. But it doesn’t seem to matter what I eat. And… nothing I do makes it go away, or get worse. I used to walk a lot, you know? But my legs aren’t so strong anymore. Maybe that? But I don’t think so. It just… is. It's very strange. I feel a little tired, too, but I'm ninety years old, so maybe that's normal?
DOCTOR: You’re right, feeling tired at ninety is perfectly normal. Alright, so no specific things make it better or worse, and it’s not related to eating or walking. Just a persistent feeling of fullness. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with this – things like nausea, vomiting, changes in your bowel habits, or any weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… nausea? Vomiting? No, no, not really. I… I haven't been sick. My tummy doesn't hurt, like I said. And… I don't know about my… bowels, Doctor. I just… go to the bathroom when I need to. I haven't noticed anything different. And weight loss… well, I'm always a little thin, you know? I don't think I've lost more weight, but I don't weigh myself regularly. I used to be very careful about my studies, but now… little things like that don’t matter so much. Everything feels… faraway.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you mind if I ask about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history? I… I don’t remember much about that, Doctor. I’ve been to doctors before, of course. But it was a long time ago. I had… something with my heart, I think? But it was many years ago, and they fixed it. I don’t remember the details. I used to be very good at remembering details, you know? But now… it’s all a bit of a blur. I hope that's not a problem? I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No, not a problem at all, Soila. It’s perfectly alright. Something with your heart a long time ago… that’s good to know. Do you recall if you’ve ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think… I… I think so. When they fixed my heart, I had surgery. And… maybe another one? For my… appendix, perhaps? But it was so long ago, I’m not sure. Everything is… faded. I used to write everything down, you know? All my studies, all my appointments… but I lost my notes. Everything gets lost, eventually. I'm sorry I can't remember more clearly. It’s just… a long life, Doctor. A very long life.
DOCTOR: A very long life indeed. Now, do you happen to know if anyone in your family has had similar problems, like heart trouble or issues with their stomach?
PATIENT: Oh… family… Let me think. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She was always tired. And… my brother, he had trouble with his stomach. He was always complaining. But that was a long time ago, and I was young. I don't remember the details. We didn't talk about such things much, you know? Back then, people didn't talk about their health. It was… private. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be. I used to be very sharp, you know? Always remembering everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you live alone, or do you have family or friends nearby?
PATIENT: Oh… I live alone. My husband… he passed away many years ago. And… my children… they live far away. They visit sometimes, but… not often. I have a few friends, but they are all… old, like me. We don't see each other much anymore. It's… quiet, you know? Very quiet. I used to be very busy, you know? Always studying, always teaching… but now… I mostly just sit and think. It’s a long life, Doctor. A very long life. I’m sorry if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Soila. It sounds like you’ve lived a full life. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies? Let me think… I don’t think so. I haven't taken much medication over the years. Maybe… a little something for my blood pressure, a long time ago? But I stopped taking it. It made me feel… funny. I don’t remember the name of it. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, really. I used to be very careful about everything, you know? Always reading labels, always checking ingredients… but now… little things like that don’t matter so much. It’s a long life, Doctor. A very long life. I hope that's helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Soila. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh… no, not really. I have some… cream for my skin, but that’s all. And sometimes… a little something for my arthritis, when my joints ache. But I don’t take it regularly. It doesn’t really help much, anyway. I mostly just try to rest. I used to be very active, you know? Always studying, always walking… but now… it’s hard to get around. It’s a long life, Doctor. A very long life. I’m sorry if I’m not being very clear. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. That's perfectly alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I used to be very strong, you know? Always active, always studying… but now… I’m just an old woman. Do whatever you need to do. It’s a long life, Doctor. A very long life. Just be gentle, please. My bones are… fragile.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I will be very gentle. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds a little… quiet, but regular. I hear some… crackling in your lungs, which is common at your age. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your abdomen is… soft, but a bit full. I don’t feel any sharp pain or anything concerning. Your skin feels… warm and dry. It seems like you are a bit underweight.
PATIENT: Oh… that doesn’t sound very good, does it? Quiet heart… crackling lungs… full tummy… underweight… I… I don’t understand. What does that mean, Doctor? Is something wrong? I’m just an old woman, you know? I’ve lived a long life. I used to be very strong, very healthy… but now… I just feel tired. Is there something you can do to help me? I don’t want to be a burden, you know? I just want to feel… comfortable.
DOCTOR: Soila, it’s okay to feel worried. And you are not a burden. What I’m hearing and feeling isn’t necessarily alarming, but it does suggest we need to investigate a little further. The quiet heart and crackling lungs are common with age, and we can monitor those. The fullness in your abdomen and being underweight… those are what I want to look into more closely. It could be something simple, like decreased appetite, or it could be something else. I’d like to order some blood work and a simple abdominal X-ray to get a better picture of what’s going on. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh… blood work and an X-ray? That sounds… scary. I don’t like needles, you know? And… X-rays… aren’t those dangerous? I’m just an old woman, Doctor. Is it really necessary? I just want to feel… comfortable. Maybe… maybe I just need to rest more? I used to be very strong, very healthy… but now… I just feel tired. I don’t want to be a bother, you know? I just want to go home and rest. Is there anything else you can do? Perhaps… a little something for my tummy? Something to help me eat more?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. It’s perfectly alright to feel scared or hesitant. The blood work is just a small sample, and the X-ray uses very low levels of radiation – it’s much safer than you might think. We take every precaution to minimize any risk. And I completely understand you just want to feel comfortable. The blood work will help us understand why you're not feeling like yourself, and rule out anything serious. It’s not about finding something wrong, it’s about making sure you’re as healthy and comfortable as possible. Regarding your tummy, we can certainly talk about things to help with your appetite once we have the blood work results. But right now, it’s important to get some information so we know the best course of action. Would you like me to explain a little more about the blood work and X-ray, so you feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh… explain more? Yes, please. That would be… helpful. I don't understand these things, you know? I used to be very smart, very knowledgeable… but now… my brain doesn’t work so well. Just tell me… what will they do? And will it hurt? I don’t like pain, you know? I just want to feel… comfortable. Is there someone who can come with me? My children… they live far away. I just feel… scared. A long life, Doctor. A very long life. But now… I just feel tired. And scared.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. Let’s take it slowly. The blood work is very simple. A nurse will just take a small sample of blood from your arm, using a tiny needle. It’s a quick pinch, and it’s over very quickly. Most people don’t even feel it much. We’ll send the sample to a lab, and they’ll analyze it to check things like your blood count, electrolytes, and kidney and liver function. This will help us understand if there's a reason you're not feeling well, like a vitamin deficiency or something else. The X-ray is also very simple. You’ll just stand or lie down while a machine takes a picture of your abdomen. It doesn't hurt at all. It uses very low levels of radiation, and we'll provide a protective lead apron to minimize any exposure. It will help us see your organs and check for anything unusual. As for someone coming with you, do you have any friends or neighbors who could accompany you?
PATIENT: Oh… friends… Well, Mrs. Petrovich lives down the hall. But she's… a bit frail, you know? And… she doesn't drive. I don't want to be a burden, you know? I can go by myself, I suppose. If I have to. But… it sounds scary. Needles… and radiation… and waiting for results… I just want to feel… comfortable. Is there anything else you can do right now? Perhaps… a little something for my tummy? Something to help me eat? Just a little something? I’m just an old woman, Doctor. A long life, Doctor. A very long life. But now… I just feel tired. And scared.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. It’s perfectly alright to feel scared. And you’re not a burden. You’re right, let’s focus on something we can do right now to help with your tummy. I can prescribe you a medication called metoclopramide. It helps to speed up digestion and can sometimes increase appetite. It's a low dose, and we can see if it helps. It's not a cure-all, but it might make a small difference. I’ll also give you some advice on eating smaller, more frequent meals, and staying hydrated. And I’ll write down the information about the blood work and X-ray, so you can read it over at your own pace. Would you like me to call Mrs. Petrovich to see if she can accompany you?
PATIENT: Oh… metoclopramide? That sounds… complicated. And smaller meals… I try, but I just don’t have much appetite, you know? I just feel… full. If you could call Mrs. Petrovich, that would be… helpful. But don’t worry if she can’t come. I can go by myself, I suppose. I just… I just want to feel… comfortable. A long life, Doctor. A very long life. But now… I just feel tired. And scared. Please… just tell me again… what will they do with the blood? What are they looking for? And… how long will it take to get the results? Just… tell me everything one more time. Slowly. I need to understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. Let's go through it one more time, slowly. The blood work is a way for us to get a better understanding of what’s going on inside your body. The nurse will take a small sample of blood from your arm. It will be a quick pinch, and it shouldn’t hurt much. Then, the sample will be sent to a lab, where they’ll analyze it. They’re looking for a few different things. First, they’ll check your blood count, which tells us if you’re anemic – meaning you don’t have enough red blood cells. That can make you feel tired and weak. They’ll also check your electrolytes, like sodium and potassium, which are important for your body to function properly. And they’ll check your kidney and liver function, to make sure those organs are working okay. The results usually take about 3 to 5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll call you to schedule another appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. As for the X-ray, it's a picture of your abdomen. It doesn't hurt, and it helps us see your organs to make sure everything looks normal. Does that make sense, Soila?
PATIENT: Oh… blood count… electrolytes… kidney and liver… X-ray… 3 to 5 days… It sounds… complicated. And scary. But… I suppose it’s better to know, right? I think… I think I understand. A little bit. But… what if they find something wrong? What if it’s… serious? I’m just an old woman, Doctor. A long life, Doctor. A very long life. But now… I just feel tired. And scared. I… I think I’m ready to go home now. I need to rest. And think. And maybe… maybe I’ll call Mrs. Petrovich. But… what if they find something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel scared, Soila. It's natural to worry about the unknown. And you’re right, it’s okay to rest and think. I want you to know that we’ll be with you every step of the way. If they find something, we’ll explain it to you clearly and discuss all your options. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable and informed. And remember, it’s just as likely that everything will be okay. We're just being thorough. Here are the prescriptions for the metoclopramide and a card with information about the blood work and X-ray. And here’s my contact information, if you have any questions. I’ll have the nurse escort you home, and please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. I wish you a peaceful rest, Soila. And remember, you’re not alone.
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind. And patient. I… I appreciate it. I think… I think I’m ready to go home now. And rest. And… think.
