DOCTOR: Hello, Soila. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… well, my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want much food these days. Not like before, you know? It just doesn’t… feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, “big” and not feeling hungry… I understand. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed your tummy feeling big?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I notice? That’s a good question. It feels like… a while now. Maybe a few weeks? Or was it longer? Time… it goes so fast, you know? I just… woke up one morning and felt… different. Not bad, just… bigger.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be hard to remember exactly. A few weeks is helpful. And you said it just felt different, not necessarily painful?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. Just… full. And heavy, sometimes. Like I ate too much, but I haven't! It’s strange. It’s not… a sharp pain, or anything. Just… uncomfortable, if I sit for too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sharp pain, just a feeling of fullness, heaviness, and discomfort when sitting. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – like constipation, diarrhea, or anything different with your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… my… stool? Doctor, I… I don’t really talk about those things. Is it… important? I go to the bathroom, yes. But… different? I don’t… I don’t think so. Maybe a little harder sometimes, but… I just thought I wasn’t drinking enough water.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Soila. It’s sometimes difficult to talk about these things. Yes, changes in bowel habits can be important. A little harder stool is good to know. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite besides just not feeling hungry?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. I haven't… thrown up, no. And… well, I like food, I always have! But now… it just doesn’t… tempt me, you know? Like looking at a nice cake… doesn’t make me want it like it used to. Just… not interested. I eat a little, so I don't get too weak, but… not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no nausea or vomiting, just a decreased appetite. And you’re eating a little bit to keep your strength up, which is good. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh dear… I haven’t been trying to lose weight! I suppose… maybe a little? My clothes feel… looser. But I haven’t been weighing myself. Old woman, you know, don't bother with scales so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss, clothes feeling looser. That’s helpful to know. Now, are you experiencing any fatigue, shortness of breath, or swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Oh, the legs… sometimes they feel a little… puffy. Especially if I sit for a long time. And… yes, tired. I get tired easily these days. It's not like… a bad tired, just… more tired than I used to be. I take naps, you know. Lots of naps.
DOCTOR: Okay, some swelling in the legs and increased fatigue. And you've been taking more naps. Alright, Soila, I’m going to do a quick physical exam now. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll gently feel your abdomen to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Do what you need to do. I trust you. My tummy… it doesn’t hurt, so you don’t need to be gentle too gentle, you know? But thank you for asking.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take nice, deep breaths for me, please. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. Lungs are clear. Now I'm going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, I’m feeling some mild fullness in your lower abdomen. It doesn't seem to be particularly tender. I do notice some slight distention. Your weight is 106 pounds and your height is 154 cm. I also notice some edema in your ankles.
PATIENT: Oh… edema? What’s that? Is that bad? My ankles… they just swell up sometimes. I thought it was the shoes. And my weight… 106? That doesn’t sound like much. Is something… seriously wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Edema just means some swelling, and it’s often due to fluid buildup. It’s common, especially with age, but we want to figure out why it's happening. And yes, 106 pounds is relatively low, which is why I asked about weight loss. It’s good we're keeping track of these things. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like we need to do a little more investigation. I'd like to order some blood work to check your overall health, including your kidney and liver function, and also a complete blood count. We’ll also do a stool test to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… lots of tests. I don’t like going to the hospital, you know. But… if you think it’s important, Doctor, then yes. Do what you need to do. Blood work… and a stool test… Is it… will it be painful? I’m an old woman, I don’t have much strength these days.
DOCTOR: No, Soila, neither test will be painful. The blood work is just a simple prick of a needle, and the stool test just requires a small sample. I'll give you instructions on how to collect it at home. It’s very straightforward. While we wait for the results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake, try to eat small, frequent meals, even if you don’t feel very hungry, and elevate your legs when you’re sitting. Also, given your unintentional weight loss, I’m going to recommend a referral to a nutritionist to help you ensure you’re getting enough nutrients. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… fluids, small meals, and… a nutritionist. That sounds like a lot. Alright, Doctor. I’ll try. I always liked a good cup of tea… maybe I’ll drink more tea. And the nutritionist… is that someone else I have to see? I get so confused with all the doctors these days. But… yes, I’ll try my best. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. Yes, the nutritionist is another healthcare professional who specializes in diet and nutrition. We’ll get you scheduled for an appointment. I'm going to write down the instructions for the blood work and stool sample, and also the contact information for the nutritionist. I'll also send these instructions to the front desk so they can give you a copy. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Hmm… questions? Will… will I feel better soon, Doctor? That's my biggest question. I just want to feel like myself again. And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to worry for too long.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Soila. It's hard to say exactly when you’ll feel better until we get the results of the tests. But we’re taking steps to figure out what’s going on, and hopefully, we can get you back to feeling like yourself soon. The blood work and stool test typically take 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever, please contact my office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… 3 to 5 days. And call you. And… new symptoms. I understand. Thank you, Doctor Piet. You’ve been very kind. I feel a little better just knowing you’re trying to help. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. If anything else comes up, don’t hesitate to call. Here are the instructions and the contact information. Have a good day, and please try to get some rest. We'll talk soon.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you again, Doctor. You too. I will… I will try to rest. Bye bye to you as well.
