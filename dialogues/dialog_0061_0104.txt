DOCTOR: Talofa lava, Tammie. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a time. I don’t rightly recall when it started, just that it does. And frankly, I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A sore throat that's been bothering you for a while. No worries, we'll figure it out. It's good you came in to get it checked. To start, can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: More about it? It hurts, Doctor. What more is there to say? It’s… scratchy. And sometimes it feels like something’s stuck. Honestly, it’s quite bothersome. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. We’ll try to be as quick as possible. Knowing where it hurts specifically, and what makes it worse or better, helps me figure out what's going on. Is it painful to swallow?
PATIENT: Swallow… yes. A bit. Not terribly, but… yes. Especially with… dry things. Like crackers. Or toast. Wet things are… easier. Though not much is easy these days, if you want to know the truth. Are you writing all this down? It feels like a lot of questions for a simple sore throat.
DOCTOR: I am writing everything down, yes. It is a lot of questions, but it helps me rule things in and out. Dry things being more painful is helpful to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Goodness. I’m not a doctor, am I? What does that mean, “other symptoms”? A bit tired, perhaps. But who isn't? And my… well, my husband passed last year. Everything feels a bit off since then, if you must know. Is that what you mean by “symptoms”? Because frankly, that’s a rather personal question.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was insensitive, Tammie. I didn't mean to pry. When I ask about other symptoms, I’m thinking more along the lines of fever, cough, runny nose, body aches, or any swollen glands in your neck. Things that might point to a common illness. But you’re right to mention feeling tired. Grief is a very real symptom, and it can affect your body in many ways. Have you experienced any fever, cough, or runny nose along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: A cough… yes, sometimes. A little one. Not a bad one. And maybe a bit of a stuffy nose. Nothing major. Honestly, Doctor, I just want something to make my throat feel better. I haven’t got time for a lengthy examination. I have responsibilities. Are you going to give me something, or am I wasting my time here?
DOCTOR: Okay, a little cough and stuffiness. I understand you'd like something to relieve your throat pain and that your time is valuable. Before I prescribe anything, I'd like to quickly take a look at your throat and feel your neck to check for any swollen glands, if you don't mind. It will only take a moment and will help me make the best decision about your care. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look at my throat? Feel my neck? Honestly, Doctor, it feels like you’re treating me like some… child. I’m a grown woman. But… fine. Get it over with. Quickly, please. And be gentle. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Thank you for allowing me to examine you. I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay… your throat is a little red, and I do feel some slight swelling in your lymph nodes. Nothing terribly concerning at this point, but it's good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I recall, no. My husband always handled the medications. I just… took what he gave me. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything, but honestly, I couldn’t be certain. I’ve been rather preoccupied, you understand. Is that enough information? Can we please get to the medicine now? This is all very… unsettling.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Tammie. We can work with that. It’s good you haven’t known of any allergies. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, it sounds like you likely have a viral pharyngitis - a common sore throat caused by a virus. There's no need for antibiotics, as they won't help with a virus. I’m going to recommend a soothing throat lozenge and plenty of fluids. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help with any pain or fever. Are you able to take those?
PATIENT: Lozenges… and… pills. Yes, I suppose I can manage that. Acetaminophen… ibuprofen… are those… strong? I don’t want anything that will make me feel… unwell. I have things to do, Doctor. Responsibilities. Just… something to make my throat stop hurting, please. And quickly.
DOCTOR: Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are common pain relievers, and are generally well tolerated. They shouldn’t make you feel unwell when taken as directed. They’re available over-the-counter, so you don’t need a prescription. Here's a handout with information about managing your sore throat and the proper dosage for both medications. I also recommend getting plenty of rest. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or trouble swallowing, please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Rest… yes, of course. Though that’s hardly practical. And… difficulties? Fine. I’ll remember. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate you trying, but I’m not one for fuss. I’ll take the lozenges and pills. Just… is that it? Can I go now? I have a lot to attend to.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is all. I’ve documented everything in your chart. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. And remember to prioritize your well-being, Tammie. Have a good day, and I wish you a speedy recovery. .
PATIENT: Right. Thank you.
