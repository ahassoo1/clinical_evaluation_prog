DOCTOR: Bonjour, Ms. Kovtun. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hi Doctor. Just the results, please. I’m really swamped, so if we can just get straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Of course. I pulled up your results from August 1st. Before we dive into them, could you briefly remind me what we were testing for, just to ensure we’re on the same page?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t really remember all the details. Something about…checking if I was getting enough of…something? I was feeling tired a lot, and my work sent me. They said it was a routine thing. I mostly just filled out a lot of forms.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. It looks like we ran a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. Let's start with the complete blood count – everything there was within normal limits. Your metabolic panel was also largely normal, with slightly elevated glucose, but not concerning enough to warrant immediate action at this time. However, your vitamin D level is quite low – 18 ng/mL. Optimal levels are generally considered to be above 30 ng/mL. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Low vitamin D… okay. No, not really. What does “optimal” even mean in this case? And what does low vitamin D do? I feel fine, mostly. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: Certainly. "Optimal" means the level at which your body functions best and is least likely to experience negative effects from a deficiency. Vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption, which is important for bone health. Low levels can cause fatigue, muscle weakness, and even bone pain. It also plays a role in immune function, so a deficiency can sometimes make you more susceptible to illness. Your fatigue could absolutely be related to this. Do you spend a lot of time indoors, or perhaps have darker skin pigmentation?
PATIENT: Yeah, I work nights, so… mostly indoors. And, um, my mom is Tahitian, so I definitely have darker skin. I guess that makes sense. Is it… bad? Like, do I need a bunch of shots or something?
DOCTOR: It's not bad, no. It’s very common, especially with your work schedule and skin tone – darker skin produces less vitamin D from sunlight exposure. We don't usually do shots for vitamin D deficiency. The best approach is usually oral supplementation. We can start you on a high dose for a few weeks, then reduce it to a maintenance dose. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay, pills are fine. How many? And for how long? I need to know if I have to schedule a bunch of follow-ups or anything. Seriously, my work… it’s a nightmare trying to get time off.
DOCTOR: I’m prescribing you 50,000 IU of vitamin D weekly for eight weeks, then we’ll switch to 2,000 IU daily as a maintenance dose. After eight weeks, I’d like to recheck your levels to ensure it’s working, which would require a quick blood draw. It's important to monitor, but it's a relatively simple procedure. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay, weekly for eight weeks, then daily. And one follow-up blood test? That’s… doable. Is there anything else? Like, do I need to eat anything special or avoid the sun completely now or something?
DOCTOR: No, no dramatic lifestyle changes are needed. Continue your normal diet. While it’s good to get some sunlight exposure when possible, you don’t need to actively seek it out, especially given your schedule. And no specific foods are required. Just take the vitamin D as prescribed. I will send the prescription to your pharmacy electronically. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. Okay, great. I think that’s everything. Thanks, Doctor. Really appreciate it. I gotta run.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kovtun. I’m glad we could get that sorted. Here's a printed summary of our conversation and the prescription details. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Okay, thanks again. Bye.
