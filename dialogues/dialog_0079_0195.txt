DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Micucci. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 60 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Sixty, yes, that's right. Though I feel much younger, honestly. It's not really an illness, you see. I just…well, my sister, she gets these lovely cards when she's feeling a bit under the weather. All encouraging and such. Thought I'd ask if you might write me one. Just a little something to brighten the days, you know? It’s a bit silly, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A…card?
PATIENT: Yes, a card. Like…one of those greeting cards. With a nice picture, and a little message. You know, to say “Get Well Soon” or something. My neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, she gets them after her bunion surgeries, and it really lifts her spirits. I thought it might be nice for me too. It's just been a bit…dull lately, and a little encouragement would be lovely. I don’t need anything done, mind you. Just a card. Are you able to do that, Doctor? It’s not asking much, is it?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Micucci, with all due respect, I am a physician. My expertise lies in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions, not the creation of…sentimental correspondence. While I appreciate your…unique request, it falls well outside the scope of my practice. Perhaps a local card shop would be more suited to your needs?
PATIENT: Oh, now see here! A doctor doesn’t have to just poke and prod, does he? A kind word, a little bit of cheer...that's good for the health, isn't it? My sister, she says the doctors these days have no bedside manner whatsoever. I'm not asking you to cure me, Doctor, just write a simple card. It's really not a big deal. I mean, you write prescriptions, don't you? It’s just…different writing. Are you telling me you're completely unable to offer a bit of encouragement to a patient? It’s a bit cold, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Micucci, I assure you, I am perfectly capable of offering encouragement. However, that encouragement takes the form of evidence-based medical advice and treatment plans. A greeting card is simply not a medically justifiable intervention. While I understand your desire for a morale boost, I must prioritize my professional obligations. I can, however, document your…emotional state in your chart. Would that suffice?
PATIENT: “Document my emotional state?” Is that some kind of joke? You’re going to write down that I’m feeling a bit low instead of just saying something nice? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve never heard anything so ridiculous. What good does that do? It's not like you're going to prescribe me a “feel better” pill and write it down, are you? You really don't understand, do you? It’s not about treatment, it’s about…well, it’s about feeling cared for. And a simple card would do that. You write things all day! I just don’t understand why you’re being so difficult. It’s…it’s actually quite rude, if you want to know the truth.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Micucci, I find your accusations rather…unwarranted. I am providing you with the highest level of medical care within the bounds of my profession. Your request is…unconventional, to say the least, and frankly, detracts from the serious purpose of a medical consultation. I can offer you a referral to a therapist if you are experiencing significant emotional distress. Otherwise, I believe this conversation has reached an unproductive juncture. Perhaps we should focus on any actual medical concerns you may have. Are you experiencing any pain, fatigue, or other symptoms?
PATIENT: “Other symptoms?” What symptoms would I have from being a bit…discouraged? Honestly, Doctor, you’re being deliberately obtuse. You're twisting my words and making me feel like I’m the one who's unreasonable! A referral to a therapist? For wanting a card? You really have no understanding of common courtesy, do you? And now you’re acting as if I’m wasting your time! It's just… it's incredibly dismissive. Fine. No, I don’t have any “symptoms.” I just wanted a little kindness, and you can’t even manage that. You know what? Forget the card. Forget everything. I should have known better. I’m leaving. And frankly, I’ll be telling everyone I know what a cold fish you are. .
DOCTOR: Patient presented with…unrealistic expectations and demonstrated a lack of understanding regarding the scope of medical practice. Refused medical assessment. .
