DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, Hartness is right. I’m here for… this army thing. They want me to take a test before they let me sign up. Seems silly, but you gotta do what you gotta do, right? I just need someone to say I’m good to go. Don’t see why I wouldn’t be, honestly. I keep myself fit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A pre-enlistment physical. That's perfectly reasonable. Just routine. And you’re feeling healthy overall, no complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? No. I ain't one for complainin'. Look, I work with machines all day. Engines, gears… you name it. Keeps you strong, all that lifting and wrenchin’. Healthy as a horse, I reckon. Though… my back gets a bit stiff sometimes. But who doesn’t, eh? It’s just age.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has your back been stiff?
PATIENT: Oh, a while now. Years, probably. Not suddenly, just… slowly. Like an old door hinge, needs a bit of oil now and then. It doesn’t stop me from doin’ things, if that’s what you’re askin’. I can still lift plenty. Heavier than most lads half my age, I’d wager. It just… aches sometimes. More after a long day, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And does anything specific make it worse, like bending, twisting, or sitting for long periods?
PATIENT: Bending… yeah, bending is a bit rough. Not bad, mind you, just… reminds you it’s there. Twisting, not so much. And sittin’… well, I don’t sit around much, to be honest. Always movin’. But if I do sit for too long, like in the car on a long drive, it gets a bit… tight. Not comfortable, let’s put it that way. But I just stretch it out when I get where I'm goin'. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you experience any pain radiating down your legs, numbness or tingling in your feet or hands?
PATIENT: Radiating… what now? You losin’ me a bit, Doc. Numbness… no. Tingling… hmm. Sometimes my fingers get a bit cold when I’m workin’ on those engines in the winter. But that’s just the cold, ain’t it? Not like a proper tingly feelin’. Just… cold. Everything works fine, though. I can feel perfectly well. I ain’t lost any feelin’ anywhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, have you had any previous injuries to your back – any falls, twists, or strains?
PATIENT: Injuries… well, nothin' major. When I was a lad, I took a tumble off a roof fixin' somethin'. Landed on my backside. But that was ages ago. Barely remember it, honestly. And I’ve pulled a muscle here and there over the years, wrenchin’ on those engines. But I always just worked it out. Rubbed it, rested it. Never needed a doctor for any of it. Tough as nails, I am.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about other medical conditions. Do you have any health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. High blood pressure… I don’t think so. My wife checks on me sometimes, says I worry too much, which probably raises it. Heart disease? Never been told I have any of that. Arthritis… now, my hands get a bit stiff in the mornings, but that’s just from workin’ with those tools all day. Not like the kind where you can’t move, mind you. Just a bit of stiffness. Honestly, Doc, I’m a pretty healthy guy. You're makin' me feel like somethin's wrong now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Just routine questions, Mr. Hartness. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Not a fan of all those pills, honestly. Give me a wrench any day. Supplements… well, my wife gets me those fish oil capsules sometimes, says they’re good for your brain. But I forget to take ‘em half the time. It’s mostly just coffee to get me through the day. Strong coffee. That’s about it. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that's just a bit of snifflin'. Nothing serious. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’ a doctor’s given me, and my wife’s a good cook, so no food allergies either. I eat pretty much anything. Though I don’t much care for beets. But that's a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Not anymore. Gave that up years ago. Too bad for your lungs, my wife told me. Drink… well, I have a beer with dinner sometimes. A couple, maybe. Nothing crazy. Keeps you relaxed, that's all. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never touched ‘em, never will. Not my style. I get enough excitement workin' with engines, thank you very much. A sensible man, I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hartness. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to check your range of motion, reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine by me. Get it over with, eh? Don’t see what all the fuss is about, but I reckon you gotta do what you gotta do. Just try not to poke around too much. I’ve got things to do. And be gentle with that back, alright? It's got a few miles on it.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with your back. Please lie down on your stomach. I’ll just gently palpate your spine and muscles to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Then we'll move on to checking your reflexes and listening to your heart and lungs. I'll try to be quick and gentle. Okay, can you tell me if you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little bit. Right… there. Not sharp, just… achey. Like a dull thump, you know? It’s always a bit tender there, though. Been like that for years, as I said. It's nothin’ new. Don’t go diggin’ too deep, alright? Just feelin’ it, is it? That's fine. Just tell me when you're done with that back, eh? It's gettin' a bit cold lyin' here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A little tenderness in the lower lumbar region. That's consistent with what you described. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. Can you try to bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Whoa there... easy. Don’t go expecting miracles, Doc. I ain’t as flexible as I used to be, you know? This is about as far as I go. See? Not bad for an old machine, is it? A bit stiff, but still workin'. Don’t push it, alright? I don’t want to pull somethin’ and have to explain that to the army. That wouldn't look good.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That's good enough. Now, can you try to bend backwards, gently?
PATIENT: Ugh… that’s a bit… tighter. Feels a bit pinch-y there, on the side. Not awful, just… reminds you you’re gettin’ older, you know? There. Done. Don't expect any fancy acrobatics, alright? I'm a mechanic, not a gymnast. Can we move on now? This lyin’ down business is makin’ me stiff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more quick tests. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please turn over and lie on your back. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. In… and out…
PATIENT: There. Done. Soundin’ alright, is it? Wife says I snore like a freight train, but that’s just her, probably. She likes to complain. Everything feels… normal, I guess. Just a bit tired lyin' here, that's all. Can we get this over with now? I’ve got a machine to fix. A good old Swedish engine, needs my touch.
DOCTOR: Okay. Everything sounds reasonably clear, although I did hear a little bit of mild wheezing. And I noticed some tenderness and limited range of motion in your lower back. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it seems you have some mild lower back pain, likely due to age-related wear and tear, and possibly a bit of mild underlying asthma, judging by the wheezing. I don’t think this will necessarily prevent you from joining the army, but it’s something they’ll want to be aware of. Do you have any history of asthma or use an inhaler?
PATIENT: Asthma? Never been told I had asthma. No inhalers. Like I said, sometimes my chest feels a bit tight when it’s cold, but I just put that down to gettin’ older, or maybe workin’ in a dusty garage all day. Never had any trouble breathin’ bad enough to need a doctor, though. You think that’s somethin’ I should worry about? Seems a bit… sudden. I've been wrenchin' on engines for thirty years, never had no asthma! You sure about that?
DOCTOR: It's possible it's never been formally diagnosed, and it could be mild. It doesn't necessarily mean you can’t join the army, but they will likely want to investigate it further with a pulmonary function test, which measures how well your lungs are working. This is standard procedure. For your back, I recommend continuing with regular stretching and avoiding heavy lifting when possible. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with any discomfort. I’m going to write a note for the enlistment physical outlining my findings - the mild lower back pain and possible mild asthma - and recommend they perform a pulmonary function test. I’ll also recommend they consult with a specialist if they have any concerns. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A specialist… sounds like a whole lotta fuss over nothin’, if you ask me. But, alright. If you gotta write a note, write a note. Just don’t go makin’ things sound worse than they are, eh? I still reckon I’m fit enough for the job. And I don’t want no specialist tellin’ me I can’t join because of a bit of stiffness and a bit of wheeze. I’ve been workin’ hard all my life, I can handle a bit of army training, I’m sure. Just don’t want no trouble gettin’ in. So, write your note, and let’s hope they don’t give me too much grief over it. Is there anything else you need to poke and prod, or can I go now? I’ve got a machine waitin’.
DOCTOR: No, that’s all for now, Mr. Hartness. I'm just providing them with information so they can make the best decision for your health and safety. Here’s a copy of the note for your records. And here's a referral to a pulmonologist, just in case they want you to get things checked out. I wish you all the best with your enlistment. If you have any questions in the future, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. It was nice meeting you.
PATIENT: Right. Well, thank you, Doc. I reckon. Hope this note doesn’t cause too much trouble. And I’ll keep that pulmonologist’s number… just in case. Though I seriously doubt I’ll be needin’ it. Alright. Best be off. Got a machine waitin’ for me. And a bit of Swedish engineering that needs my touch. Good day to you.
