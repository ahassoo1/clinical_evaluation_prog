DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Right. Well, the army... they want me to get checked out. Some kinda exam before I can... you know... really sign up. Seems like a lot of bother, honestly. But they said I gotta do it.
DOCTOR: So this is a pre-enlistment physical?
PATIENT: Physical? Yeah, I guess that's what you'd call it. Look, I build things. Engines, mostly. Good, solid work. Don’t see why they need to poke and prod. I’m strong as an ox, I tell ya. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Strength is certainly important, Mr. Hartness, but the military has very specific requirements to ensure recruits are medically fit for service. It's not simply about how much you can lift. We need to assess all systems. Let's start with a little history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries? Hmm. Now that you mention it... I twisted my ankle bad, maybe ten years back. Building a snowmobile engine, it was. Real tricky job. Had to get it wrapped, but I worked through it. Didn’t stop me. Other than that… nothing. I don’t get sick. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Ankle sprain, noted. And you haven’t had any other serious illnesses – no childhood diseases, infections, hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Look, I grew up on a farm. Fresh air, good food. We didn’t go to doctors for every little sniffle. You build up an immune system, you know? I was always the one fixing things, not being fixed.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. Why would I need a surgery? I keep myself in good shape. Everything works the way it should. I’ve always been careful with tools, always focused. No accidents.
DOCTOR: Very well. What about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What do you mean? Like... who got married when? That doesn't sound right. I mean, my dad was a strong man, built things with his hands too. He lived a long life. Mom, she… well, she wasn’t much for outdoors. But she didn’t have any… problems, not that I recall. Are we talking about... sicknesses that run in families? Honestly, I don't really keep track of that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: I’m referring to any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, things of that nature. It’s important information, Mr. Hartness. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any of those?
PATIENT: Oh. Those things. Right. Well, my Uncle Sven... he had a bad heart, I think. Kept complaining about chest pains. But he smoked like a chimney, you know? Didn't look after himself. Probably his own fault. And… my grandmother, on my mother’s side… she got real weak towards the end. But she was ancient. Everything was failing, not just one thing. Is this really important? Seems like a waste of time if everyone just gets old and… you know.
DOCTOR: It’s important for risk assessment, Mr. Hartness. Alright. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Filthy habit. Makes you weak. I need clear lungs for building, for... well, for everything. My uncle Sven smoked, like I said. Look where that got him.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. Sometimes. With dinner, maybe. A glass of wine, that's all. Nothing fancy. Helps you relax. I don't get… rowdy or anything. Always in control. It’s not like I’m out every night getting plastered.
DOCTOR: And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational… drugs? What kind of question is that? I build engines! I don’t have time for… that sort of thing. Honestly, Doctor. That's a ridiculous question. I'm a practical man. I need a clear head for my work.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing. I eat everything. Whatever’s in front of me, I eat it. Never had a problem. I’m a strong constitution, I tell you. Never been one to be delicate.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Let’s move on to a physical exam. Please step up on the scale for me.
PATIENT: Fine. Let's just get this over with. I have things to do, you know. Building doesn’t do itself.
DOCTOR: 53 kilograms, Mr. Hartness. That’s… quite low for your height of 187 centimeters. Now, I’m going to measure your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt.
PATIENT: What? 53… That can’t be right. I’m a solid build, I tell ya! Always have been. This is ridiculous. A waste of time. But fine, if you insist. Don’t expect much, Doctor. I’m a man of action, not a… a specimen.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, and your breathing sounds slightly diminished. I’m going to palpate your abdomen now. Please let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Elevated? Diminished? What does that even mean? Ouch! That’s… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just… sensitive. I haven’t been sick, if that’s what you’re getting at. I just… work hard. Lots of bending, lifting. Maybe it’s that.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is quite tender to the touch, Mr. Hartness, and I can feel some slight resistance. I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds now. They seem… very quiet. We’ll need to run some tests. Do you have any current medications you're taking?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? Look, I told you, I'm perfectly fine! Quiet bowel sounds... what does that even mean? I haven't taken a pill in my life! I told you, Doctor, I don't get sick. This is getting ridiculous. You're going to find nothing wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but it is my professional responsibility to assess your health thoroughly before deeming you fit for military service. Given your low weight, diminished bowel sounds, and abdominal tenderness, I’m concerned about potential malnutrition and dehydration. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool analysis. I also recommend a chest X-ray to assess your lung health. I will need to refer you to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. Do you have any insurance?
PATIENT: Insurance? Insurance? No. Never got around to it. Waste of money, if you ask me. I’m a practical man, I take care of myself. I build things! I don't need insurance. What's a… a gastroenterologist? Is that someone who looks at stomachs? Look, I told you, there's nothing wrong with my stomach. This is becoming a complete waste of time. You're going to tell me I can't join the army over… quiet bowel sounds?
DOCTOR: A gastroenterologist is a specialist who diagnoses and treats conditions affecting the digestive system, Mr. Hartness. Your symptoms warrant a referral. And without insurance, these tests will be quite costly. Given your financial situation, I can refer you to a few clinics that offer reduced-cost care, but it may involve a waiting list. Until we have the results of these tests, I cannot, in good conscience, clear you for military service. It would be irresponsible to put your health, and potentially your life, at risk. I will have the lab requisition forms ready for you shortly. Do you have any questions before I proceed?
PATIENT: Questions? Yes, I have a question. Why are you wasting my time? I’m a strong, practical man, I build things, and I want to serve my country. You're going to tell me I can't because of… what was it? Quiet bowel sounds? This is absurd! Look, just tell me yes or no. Can I join the army or not? Don't tell me about tests and doctors and… quiet bowel sounds. Just give me a straight answer!
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but I cannot provide a definitive answer at this time. Your current health status, as indicated by my preliminary examination, raises significant concerns. To responsibly assess your fitness for service, we must proceed with the recommended tests. Therefore, I cannot clear you for enlistment until we have the results and can determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. I am obligated to prioritize your health and well-being, even if that means delaying your enlistment. .
