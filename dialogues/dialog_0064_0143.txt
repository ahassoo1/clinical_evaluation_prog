DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My… a friend, she's thinking about having a baby. And I thought… maybe I should talk to someone first. Just to… make sure everything is okay, you know? Before… things happen. I’m not sure what I need to know, really. It’s been a long time since… well, since I thought about these things.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It is wise to think things through, and it’s perfectly alright if it’s been a while. So, to clarify, you're concerned about potential health considerations before trying to conceive with your friend?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Exactly. Health things. I don’t… I don’t know what things I need to be worried about. Or if I need to be worried about anything, even. I'm… not the youngest anymore, you know? And… well, I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Verrall. It’s very responsible of you to be thinking about this now. And yes, age can be a factor, and a lapse in regular check-ups is quite common. Let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood… pressure… I think the doctor said something about that, maybe ten years ago? But it wasn’t… bad, I don’t think. They told me to watch my salt, that’s all. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Heart… maybe a little fast sometimes, if I get stressed, but nothing the doctor ever said was wrong. Honestly, I can’t really remember. It was a long time ago. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Verrall. It’s perfectly alright. We can try to piece things together. Do you recall ever having any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… uh… yes! When I was a boy, I had my tonsils out. A long, long time ago. And… I think I broke my arm once, and they set it, but I don’t know if that’s a surgery… maybe not. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. I really can’t remember anything else. It's just… a lot of years.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he had problems with his heart, I think. He… passed away when he was… not very old. And my mother… she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. And… my sister, she had something with her… eyes, maybe? I’m really not sure. I didn’t see my family much when I was older, so I don’t know a lot about what happened to them. Sorry. It’s a bit of a mess, my memory.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Mr. Verrall. You're doing very well just by sharing what you remember. So, heart problems in your father, arthritis in your mother, and a possible eye condition in your sister. We can make a note of those. Now, just to get a full picture, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. I don't think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes if I eat shellfish, but it's not… serious. Nothing I need to carry a pen for, you know? I’m pretty lucky, I think. I haven’t really had many problems with… anything, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to eat healthy, that’s all. I used to take a multivitamin, a long time ago, but I stopped. I figured if I eat enough fruits and vegetables, I should be okay. I don't like taking pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. Now, Mr. Verrall, before we move on, I just want to quickly confirm some basic information. I see here your height is listed as 168 centimeters and your weight as 141 kilograms. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That sounds… right. Maybe a little high on the weight? I haven't weighed myself in a while. But yes, I think so. I'm not a very big man. I'm… average. Is that okay? Should it be lower? I don’t really pay attention to those things.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Verrall. It's good to be aware of these things, and we can check your current weight and blood pressure to get a more accurate picture. Would you be comfortable if we did a quick physical exam now?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. It's better to be safe, right? I just want to make sure everything is okay, for… my friend. So, yes, a quick exam sounds good. Just… don’t be too rough, okay? I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Mr. Verrall. We'll take it very gently. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Excellent. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from talking. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. 150 over 90. A little elevated, but we'll monitor that. Let's take a look in your ears... and your throat... Everything looks normal there. Now, just a quick palpation of your abdomen... No tenderness. Alright. Everything seems within reasonable limits for now, but the elevated blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on. We should also run some blood tests to get a better baseline of your overall health. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good, Doctor. Blood tests, yes. That makes sense. I’m glad we’re doing all this. The blood pressure… is that bad? Should I be worried? I try to stay calm, but… things do stress me out sometimes. My friend… she’s very important to me, and I want to make sure everything is okay for her. If the blood pressure is from stress, can… can you give me something for that?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re aware of your stress levels, Mr. Verrall. Blood pressure of 150/90 is considered elevated, and while it’s not immediately alarming, it does warrant further investigation and management. It could be related to stress, but we need to rule out any other underlying causes with the blood tests. We’ll check your cholesterol, kidney function, liver function, and a complete blood count. As for medication, let's see what the blood tests reveal first. We can explore lifestyle modifications – things like diet, exercise, and stress management techniques – and see if those are sufficient. If needed, we can discuss medication options, but I prefer to start with the least invasive approaches. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable, Doctor. Lifestyle things, yes. I can try that. Diet… I already eat pretty healthy, I think. Exercise… well, I don’t do much. I walk sometimes, but not… regularly. Stress… that's the hard part. But I can try. What kind of things can I do for stress? Just… thinking about my friend sometimes makes me worry. And then I can’t sleep. Is there something… something I can take to help me sleep? A little something? Before I get too worried again?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re recognizing the stress and wanting to address it, Mr. Verrall. And it's common for worry to affect sleep. There are several things we can try. Lifestyle modifications, like establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed, can be very helpful. We can also explore relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga. There are many guided meditation apps available that can be quite effective. As for medication, I generally recommend trying non-pharmacological approaches first. However, if your sleep continues to be significantly disrupted, we can discuss short-term use of a sleep aid. We don't want to rely on medication long-term, but it can be helpful to get you through a difficult patch. Before we proceed with any medication, though, let's get those blood tests done. It's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your stress or sleep problems. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good, Doctor. Blood tests, then try the other things. I can try the breathing, and the… the routine. I’ll try. I’m not sure I’m very good at relaxing, but I can try. Thank you for not just giving me pills right away. I… I appreciate that. So, what do I need to do for the blood tests? Do I need to… fast? And where do I go?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It's important to address the root cause of the problem, and sometimes that takes more than just a quick fix. Yes, for the blood tests, you do need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. The receptionist there will give you a requisition form – that’s the paperwork the lab needs. Just tell them Dr. Smetak sent you. They'll draw a few vials of blood, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back, which usually takes a few days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, try to focus on those relaxation techniques and establishing a regular sleep schedule. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That… that makes sense. Fasting, go to the lab, relaxation… I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a little less worried now. I’ll go do the blood tests, and then I’ll schedule the follow-up. .
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Verrall. That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, I’m here to help in any way I can. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
