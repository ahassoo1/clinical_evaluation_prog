DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Laury, please. I want to… find out where my people come from. My kids, they want me to do one of those… DNA tests. To see… ancestors, yeah? You do that here?
DOCTOR: Ancestry tests?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like… where my family really come from. Long, long time ago. My mama, she from Marshall Islands. But… before that? My kids say it's interesting. They buy it on the… internet? I just want to know if you can… help me do it here. Safer, maybe?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, while I appreciate your desire to learn about your heritage, ancestry testing isn't typically something we offer here at the clinic. It falls outside the scope of standard medical practice. We focus on your current health concerns and preventative care. Those tests you see online... they aren’t medical procedures, and frankly, the accuracy can be… questionable. It sounds like your children are interested in genealogy, which is fine, but it’s not something I can facilitate. Now, perhaps we should focus on your health today. Do you have any specific medical issues you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Not… good for health? I thought… maybe it was like a check-up, for family. No, nothing bad. Just… old. Everything hurts a little. But nothing new. Just… old. So, no test for family then?
DOCTOR: It's not a health check, Mr. Scobie. It provides information about your genetic lineage, not your current wellbeing. And while knowing your family history can be helpful from a medical standpoint – for example, identifying predispositions to certain diseases – that’s different than simply tracing ancestry. “Everything hurts a little” is rather vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Vague? Old man problems! My knees, they complain when I walk too far. And my back… sometimes stiff. Mostly in the mornings. Not so bad I can’t do things, just… slow. Like a turtle, maybe. And… I forget things. Not important things, usually. Just… where I put my glasses, or what I had for breakfast. Is that what you want to know? Real problems? I don’t have any real problems, Doctor. Just… getting old.
DOCTOR: So, you’re experiencing some joint pain – specifically in your knees – and some morning stiffness in your back. You’ve also noted some memory lapses, though you state they aren’t significant. And to clarify, these memory issues are recent, or have they been present for some time?
PATIENT: A long time. Not new. Always been a little forgetful. Mama always said I had a head full of clouds. But… maybe worse lately? Hard to say. Time goes fast when you old. My kids say… they worry. They say I repeat myself. Maybe they right. Doesn't bother me. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s document this as chronic, mild forgetfulness. While it's good you aren't concerned, it’s still important to assess. Repeatedly mentioning this to your children is a reasonable observation, and we should rule out any underlying causes. Now, let's move on to some basic questions. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. Just… old. Doctor, you think this forgetfulness… something bad? My kids… they read things on the… computer. They worry too much. I’m just old! No sugar sickness, no heart trouble, no… nothing bad. Mama lived long life, and she just… got old too.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I understand your concerns, and I assure you I’m not implying anything definitive. However, it's my responsibility to investigate any changes in cognitive function, even if they seem minor to you. It's standard practice, especially given your age. We need to rule out common causes of memory loss, such as vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, or other treatable conditions. Have you been taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… just a little pill for my water. Doctor give me, long time ago. For… water pills. Makes me go pee a lot. And sometimes… I take something for my knees, when they really hurt. But not every day. My daughter buy it for me, from the store. Big bottle. White. I don't remember the name. Too many pills. I forget.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to get a complete medication list. Do you happen to know the name of the diuretic?
PATIENT: No. I ask my daughter. She fill the bottle. I just take the pill. She know. She very good with… with remembering things. I’m no good with names. Or… with remembering what doctor say. Always forget. It’s… frustrating. Maybe my brain just tired.
DOCTOR: Understandable. It’s common for patients to have difficulty recalling medication names. We can contact your daughter to obtain a list. In the meantime, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I'd like to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It’s a routine part of assessing cognitive function and overall neurological health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay. If you think it good. I trust you, Doctor. Just… don't make me stand on one leg too long. I might fall. Old man problems!
DOCTOR: Of course not, Mr. Scobie. We'll take it slowly. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, symmetric. Within normal limits. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No weakness noted. Gait is slightly slow, but steady. No significant balance issues observed. Mildly slow gait, otherwise stable. Overall neurological exam appears grossly intact. However, we’ll need further testing to rule out other causes of your forgetfulness.
PATIENT: See? Just old! Everything slow. What kind of testing? Will it hurt? I don’t like needles. Mama… she didn’t like needles neither. Will it take long? I got… bingo tonight. If I’m lucky, I win. That’s important!
DOCTOR: No, there won’t be any needles involved for the initial testing. We’ll start with a basic blood test to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and other common causes of cognitive decline. It's a standard procedure, and it shouldn’t take long. We'll also perform a brief cognitive assessment – a few simple questions and tasks to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. The blood test results typically take a few days to come back. The cognitive assessment can be completed during this visit. It will take about 20-30 minutes. Are you agreeable to proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Okay. If it no needles. And… 20-30 minutes, I can do that. Bingo start 7 o’clock. So… I need be home before that. My friend, she save me seat. Important things, Doctor. Very important! But… yes. Do the tests. Get it over with. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Very well. This assessment is quite straightforward. I will ask you a series of questions and show you some simple images. There are no right or wrong answers; I’m simply trying to get a better understanding of your cognitive function.
PATIENT: Today… August second, right? And… the year? Is it still 2025? I always forget the year. This… this place… Doctor’s office! That’s right. And… repeat? What repeat? You said a lot of things! Old brain… slow. Sorry, Doctor. I try.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Scobie. We’ll proceed at your pace. Can you tell me the names of these three objects?
PATIENT: Hmm… That one… is a… a stick! For writing. A pen, right? My daughter use them. And that… is a fruit! Red and… sweet. An apple! And this… shiny thing? Money! A… coin. Yes. A coin. But… what kind of coin? Old brain… so slow. I used to know all these things!
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Scobie. It’s not a test of your general knowledge. Now, can you spell the word "WORLD" backwards for me?
PATIENT: W… O… R… L… D… D… R… O… L… W? No! That’s… that’s wrong! I know this! I used to… I used to be good at spelling! My brain… it’s… broken! I can’t do it, Doctor. I just… can’t. I need to go home. I need my bingo.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. That's enough for today. You’ve done very well. We've gathered enough information to start. We'll get the blood test results back as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. It’s standard protocol, and it will help us determine the cause of your memory lapses. The neurologist will be able to perform more detailed cognitive testing and rule out any underlying neurological conditions. Don’t worry, we're simply taking a precautionary approach. Here's the referral. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. And please, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Go enjoy your bingo, Mr. Scobie. And remember, we're here to help you every step of the way.
PATIENT: A neurologist? That sounds… serious. Is it… bad, Doctor? Is my brain really broken? I just want to remember where I put my glasses. And win my bingo. Okay. I’ll… I’ll call them. Thank you, Doctor. I… I need to go now. .
