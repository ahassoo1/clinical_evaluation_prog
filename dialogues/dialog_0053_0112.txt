DOCTOR: Alright, Keoni, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pitmon. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, certainly. It’s… frequent. That’s the best way to put it, I suppose. I don’t… I don’t quite recall when it started, but it's been bothering me for a while now.
DOCTOR: <stage>I tap a pen against the chart, a slight frown creasing my brow. Frequent, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… hard to explain precisely. Not painful, exactly. Just… often. I find myself needing to go quite frequently throughout the day, and sometimes even during the night. It disrupts my sleep, and… well, it’s just inconvenient. I don't… I don’t know if that makes sense. I apologize for being vague; my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Frequent urination. And you said it’s been happening for a while. Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… difficult. Perhaps… a few months? It's hard to pinpoint. Time seems to… slip away, you understand? It wasn't sudden, not a clear starting point. Just… gradually more and more often. I really wish I could be more precise, Doctor. Is that… helpful at all?
DOCTOR: A few months… Right. And when you do go, is it a full emptying, or do you feel like you still have to go afterwards?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a good question. Usually, yes, I feel… emptied. But sometimes… sometimes I feel a little residual sensation afterwards, like there might be a little left. It's not strong, just… a lingering feeling. It’s difficult to explain. Is that… normal? I do apologize for my inability to articulate this clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any burning or discomfort during urination?
PATIENT: No, not… burning, exactly. There’s no pain, as I said. Sometimes… a little tenderness, perhaps? A mild discomfort afterwards, a sort of… ache. But definitely no burning sensation while going. It’s more… afterward, and it’s not constant. It comes and goes, you understand? I'm afraid I’m not being very helpful with specifics. Is there a… a specific question I should be answering?
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? No, I don’t… I haven’t specifically looked, if that makes sense. I suppose… I haven’t noticed anything unusual. It looks… normal. The usual color, I think. I haven’t detected any… odd smells or anything like that. It's possible I should be paying more attention. I’m not sure if that's helpful, Doctor. Honestly, I tend to just… avoid thinking about it too much. Is there something specific I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s move on. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, chills… or abdominal pain. Nothing like that. I haven’t felt unwell in any other way. Just… this constant need to go to the bathroom. It’s… rather frustrating, honestly. I feel perfectly healthy otherwise, which is why it’s so… perplexing. I wish I could offer more details, but my memory is proving… unreliable, as usual. I’m truly sorry for the vagueness. Perhaps a test might be helpful? If you think it's necessary, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll do a quick urinalysis. It’s standard procedure. Follow me.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate your attention to this matter. Lead the way, please. I'll do my best to cooperate. I hope it will shed some light on the… situation.
DOCTOR: Just a clean catch. Midstream. There are instructions on the wall. Let me know when you're finished.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Thank you for the clarification. I’ll do my best to follow the instructions accurately.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll send this to the lab. It will take about fifteen minutes to get the results.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I hope it's… adequate. Fifteen minutes, you say? Very well. I shall wait here, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Hmm. White blood cells are elevated. And a trace of protein. It appears you have a mild urinary tract infection. Nothing serious, but it needs to be treated.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. An infection… Is it… contagious? And… what sort of treatment is required, Doctor? Is it… unpleasant? I apologize for all the questions, but I must admit, I’m rather apprehensive. I’ve always been prone to… worrying.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not contagious. And treatment is simple – a course of antibiotics. Usually, it's a seven-day course. There might be some minor side effects – nausea, stomach upset – but nothing major. Plenty of fluids are also important. Here. I’m prescribing you Trimethoprim. Take it twice a day for seven days, with food. Drink plenty of water. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. And if you don’t see improvement within a few days, or if you develop a fever, come back immediately.
PATIENT: Trimethoprim… Twice a day for seven days, with food. Yes, I can manage that. Avoid caffeine and alcohol… Plenty of water. Thank you, Doctor. That sounds… manageable, thankfully. And if I don't see improvement, or if a fever develops… Yes, I will return immediately. I appreciate your thoroughness. Is there… anything else I should be aware of, Doctor? Perhaps something I should avoid eating, or any other precautions I should take? I apologize for my incessant questioning, but I simply wish to be as prepared as possible.
DOCTOR: No, that’s all. Just follow the instructions. And try not to worry. It’s a common infection, easily treated. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time, and for your patience with my… anxieties. I shall follow the instructions carefully, and I will return immediately if any complications arise. I appreciate your help immensely. Good day to you, Doctor Pitmon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon. .
