DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's my chest, you see. It's been… not good. Like a tight feeling, sometimes. It comes and goes. Not all the time, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. A tight feeling in your chest that comes and goes. Can you describe that tightness a little more?
PATIENT: It's hard to say exactly... like someone is hugging my chest, but not a nice hug! More like… squeezing. And it feels… heavy, sometimes. Not a sharp pain, never sharp. Just… uncomfortable. It usually happens when I'm walking, maybe after I climb the stairs. But not always. That's what worries me, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. So, squeezing, heavy discomfort, not sharp, and it seems to be brought on by exertion like walking or stairs, but not consistently. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, maybe… three months ago? At first, it was just a little thing, I didn't even pay it much mind. But it's been happening more often lately. Maybe once a week at first, now… maybe three or four times a week? It's hard to keep track, you know? My husband, he helps me remember things.
DOCTOR: Three to four times a week, progressively worsening over three months. And does anything relieve the discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, it does. When I stop and sit down, it gets better. And if I take a few deep breaths, that helps too. Not right away, but after a little bit. It goes away completely when I rest, usually. It's just… I don't like having to stop all the time! I used to walk to the market every day, now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Relieved with rest and deep breathing. That’s good to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this chest discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Sometimes I feel a little… breathless, maybe. But I walk slow, you know? I'm not a young woman anymore! And sometimes my arm feels a little… tired. My left arm, I think. But it could just be from carrying groceries. It's hard to say. I haven’t been really sick, no fever or cough or anything like that. Just the chest. And a little worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, cough, or other systemic symptoms. Breathlessness and occasional left arm fatigue. Have you had any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? No, not that I've noticed. I wear sandals most of the time, you know? It's hot here. But no, I don't think so. My feet feel normal. I check them sometimes, because my mother, she had problems with her feet when she was older. But no swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay. No ankle swelling. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… My doctor, he always says my blood pressure is a little high, but he gives me a little pill for it. Just one little pill every day. And I had a little bit of sugar in my blood once, but he said it was okay, just watch what I eat. No diabetes, he said. My cholesterol… I don't remember about my cholesterol. He checks it every year, I think. And no, no heart problems. Not that I know of. My husband, he keeps track of all that.
DOCTOR: Alright. You're on medication for high blood pressure, previously had slightly elevated blood sugar, and you have your cholesterol checked annually. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear... that's a good question. It's a little white pill… I think it starts with an 'A'? Or maybe a 'B'? I'm so bad with names. My husband, he fills the little box for me every month. I just take the pills, you know? I can show you the bottle, if that helps? It's in my purse.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you could, that would be helpful. While you're looking, can you tell me about any surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Here it is! It says… Amlodipine. Yes, Amlodipine. That's the one. And surgeries… let me think. Oh! I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Maybe… twenty years ago? And I had a little bit of a problem with my knee, so I had a little surgery on my knee too. But that was a long time ago. Nothing else, I think. Just those two.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, 5mg daily. Okay. Gallbladder removal and a knee surgery, both in the past. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. My mother, she had high blood pressure too. And my father, he had… something with his heart, I think. He died when I was young, so I don't remember exactly. My brother, he's healthy as a horse! Always running around. And my sister… she has arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. No one else, that I know of, had problems with their chest like me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of hypertension, potential cardiac issues in your father, and your sister has arthritis. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor! No smoking! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don't drink much alcohol. Maybe a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. And drugs? Oh goodness, no! I’m a good Colombian woman! Just my little pills for my blood pressure, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no drug use. Now, Ms. Chelberg, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are… regular rhythm, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not a new finding, likely, but we'll note it. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulses are regular and present. No edema noted in extremities. Now, I'd like to order an EKG and some blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. This will help us get a better picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. EKG and blood work… okay. Is it going to hurt? I don't like needles very much. But I’ll do it if you say so. I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? I want to be able to walk to the market again.
DOCTOR: The blood work will involve a small needle prick, yes, but it’s usually very quick. And the EKG is completely painless – we just put some stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It won’t take long at all. The lab is right down the hall, and the technician is very skilled. We’ll get the results back within a few days, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and if you experience any worsening chest pain or shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. No strenuous activity, go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I can do that. And I'll wait for the results. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. I feel a little better just knowing what we're going to do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’m going to have the nurse draw your blood and get you set up for the EKG. She’ll explain everything to you. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you again. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll go with the nurse now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please don’t hesitate to let the nurse or me know if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Chelberg.
