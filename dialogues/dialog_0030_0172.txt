DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it’s just… a formality, really. My husband insisted. New to the area, you understand. One has to have these things checked, I suppose. Medicare requires it. Now, if you could just get this over with quickly, that would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. I understand wanting to be efficient with your time. While it is a requirement for Medicare, a check-up can be helpful even if you're feeling well. It allows us to establish a baseline and catch anything early. To start, could you tell me a little bit about why your husband suggested you come in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Harold worries too much. Always has. He says I’ve been… a bit forgetful lately. Nonsense, really. I simply have a great deal on my mind. Dispatching is a demanding job, you know. All those numbers and schedules... It’s not as if I’ve forgotten everything. Just… small things. Now, are we quite finished with these questions? I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that Harold is looking out for you, and it sounds like you have a very busy and mentally stimulating job. Just to get a clearer picture, could you give me an example of one of these "small things" you've noticed?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Must I? Honestly, it’s rather embarrassing. Well… last week, I believe it was, I dispatched the wrong unit to Mrs. Abernathy's house. A simple error, really. She just needed assistance with her television, and I sent the fire crew! Harold was quite cross. But it’s not important. It happens. People make mistakes. Can we move on now? This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. I apologize if I’m taking up too much of your time. It's helpful for me to understand everything, even what seems like a small issue. Have you noticed any other instances like this, perhaps forgetting appointments, names, or where you've placed things?
PATIENT: Honestly, it all blurs together, Doctor. I'm a busy woman! Names… well, sometimes a face doesn’t ring a bell, but I'm sure you understand. So many people come and go. And appointments… Harold usually handles those. I simply show up when he tells me to. It’s not as if I’m incapable of remembering things; I simply have more pressing matters on my mind. Are we nearly finished? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Candice. It sounds like you have a very full life and rely on Harold for some organizational tasks, which is perfectly normal. Just to get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few quick questions about your overall health. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or sense of taste or smell recently?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re asking about my body? Honestly, Doctor, this is rather intrusive. My husband fills out all those forms, and I sign them without looking. I suppose my vision isn’t what it used to be, but who’s does at my age? And I haven’t noticed anything particularly wrong with my hearing. Everything sounds… normal. Although Harold does complain I don't listen to him. But that's beside the point. Can we please conclude this examination? I am becoming quite impatient.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m making you uncomfortable, Candice. I understand your frustration. These questions are simply routine and help me get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any trouble with your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance? Heavens, no. I walk perfectly well, thank you very much. I’ve always been quite graceful, actually. Though I did stumble slightly on the stairs last week… but that was simply because Harold left a box in the hallway. It’s his fault, really. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see the point of all these questions. Are you attempting to find something wrong with me? Because if you are, you're wasting your time. I’m perfectly healthy for my age. Now, can we be done? I have a luncheon engagement, and I’m already late.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. I assure you, I’m not attempting to find something wrong. I simply want to ensure that we have a complete picture of your health. To finish up, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam—just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! I will not be prodded and poked. I have tolerated these questions for far too long. This is ridiculous! I came here at my husband’s insistence, simply to satisfy Medicare requirements, and I have done that. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must leave. I have a luncheon to attend, and I refuse to be further delayed. Good day, Doctor. And please, do not attempt to contact me. .
