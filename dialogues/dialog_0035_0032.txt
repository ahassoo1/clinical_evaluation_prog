DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s a bit… delicate, shall we say? I’ve noticed… a bit of a problem. A discharge, you see. Not a gentleman’s issue one discusses easily, but it’s… persistent. I haven’t the foggiest idea what’s caused it, to be frank. I suppose… age? It’s probably just age.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krok, I understand. It is not always easy to talk about these things, so thank you for being open with me. Persistent discharge… alright. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm. More about it… Let me see. It’s… clear, mostly. Though sometimes a bit… cloudy, perhaps? And it’s not terribly painful, just… there. Quite irritating, if I’m honest. My wife, bless her heart, suggested I come in. She’s always been the practical one. I don’t recall exactly when it started… a few weeks, maybe? Time rather slips away these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks, clear to cloudy discharge, not painful, just irritating. And your wife encouraged you to come in – good of her. Is it only from one opening, or both?
PATIENT: Good of her, yes. She has a very… discerning eye. And… opening? Oh. Well, now, that’s a rather blunt way of putting it, Doctor. Just the one, I believe. Certainly not both. I assure you, it’s not… a widespread issue. Though, frankly, I haven’t gone to great lengths to… investigate the matter thoroughly. One look is usually quite enough, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. No need for a thorough investigation on your own. Just the one. And has there been any odor associated with it?
PATIENT: Odor? Now, let me think… No, not particularly. At least, nothing I’ve noticed. Though my sense of smell isn’t what it once was, you understand. Years working with machinery – all those oils and greases… it takes its toll. My wife might notice something, she has a rather keen nose. But I haven’t detected anything unpleasant myself. Just… a general… something. Not a rose garden, certainly, but nothing dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no noticeable odor. Good to know. And have you experienced any burning when you urinate, or any increased frequency or urgency to go?
PATIENT: Urinate… No burning. No, that hasn't happened. Frequent? Perhaps a little more than usual, but I’ve always enjoyed a good cup of tea. Several cups, in fact, throughout the day. That might explain it. As for urgency… well, one gets older, you see. Things don’t work quite as smoothly as they once did. Perhaps a bit more… prompt, shall we say? But nothing alarming. I wouldn’t call it urgent.
DOCTOR: Okay, no burning, and a slight increase in frequency possibly related to tea. Alright. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or body aches recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, thankfully not. I do get a bit… warm sometimes, but that’s just the summer heat, I expect. And chills… no. I keep the thermostat at a respectable 72 degrees, you see. Body aches… Well, my knees ache a bit, but that’s just… age again. I used to be quite the dancer, you know. Many years ago. A very energetic tango, it was. But that was… decades ago. No recent body aches, no. Just the usual creaks and groans.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or recent body aches. And just the usual aches and pains. Now, Mr. Krok, can you tell me about any medical conditions you have been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Medical conditions… let me see. I have… high blood pressure, I believe. The doctor mentioned it a few years back. And… arthritis, certainly. In my hands mostly. Makes it difficult to tighten bolts sometimes. My wife helps with that now. Oh, and… I had a touch of pneumonia once, many years ago. A nasty business, that was. But I recovered fully, thank goodness. Otherwise… nothing springs to mind. I’ve always been a fairly robust fellow, despite my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, arthritis, and a history of pneumonia. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me ponder. Yes, actually. I had my prostate removed. Quite a while ago now, maybe twenty years? Something like that. A rather unpleasant experience, I assure you. But it seemed necessary at the time. And… oh, and I had my appendix taken out when I was a young man. A sudden attack, it was. But that was decades ago. Aside from those two… no, nothing else. I’ve always been rather careful, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, prostate removal about twenty years ago and appendix removed in your youth. Now, are you currently taking any medications for these conditions or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications… yes, I am. For the blood pressure, I take… what is it called? Amlodipine, I believe. A small white pill, once a day. And… yes, I take something for the arthritis, too. Naproxen, I think. Helps with the stiffness. My wife manages the pills for me, to be honest. She's very organized. I couldn’t possibly keep track of it all myself. She’ll tell you exactly what I take, if you’d like. She has a list.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Krok. Amlodipine and Naproxen. And you said your wife has a list – that would be wonderful if we could take a look at that. Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Let me see. I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. I’ve always been a fairly… robust fellow, as I mentioned. But my wife might know better. She’s very attentive to such things. She’s the one who always reads the labels, you see. I tend to leave that sort of thing to her. She’ll tell you if I’m allergic to anything, if I am. She’s remarkably thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that’s a good start, Mr. Krok. If you could have your wife bring in that medication list, that would be very helpful. And then, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. A physical exam… perfectly reasonable. My wife will be happy to bring in the list. She’s very eager to assist, you see. And… I trust you’ll be gentle? It's not a young man's body anymore, you understand. But do what you need to do, of course. I’m in your capable hands.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll just take it slowly. If you could change into a gown and lie on the examination table, we can begin. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you.
PATIENT: A gown… Very well. A bit… exposing, perhaps, but I suppose it’s necessary. I’ll change, then. And… where is this examination table? Is it comfortable? One prefers a little cushioning, you see. And… will my wife be allowed to wait nearby? She worries, you understand.
DOCTOR: The examination table is just over there, Mr. Krok. It is padded, and we have a blanket if you get cold. Your wife is welcome to wait in the waiting room, or if she prefers, the nurse can offer her a seat just outside the room. We want you both to be comfortable. The nurse, Maria, will be right in to help you get settled. She'll explain everything as you go.
PATIENT: Very good. A blanket, that’s reassuring. And my wife nearby… Yes, that would be most appreciated. Maria, you say? A kind name. I trust she’s… experienced? I wouldn't want any… mishaps. I’ll go and change, then. A bit undignified, but necessary, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… consideration.
DOCTOR: Maria is excellent, Mr. Krok. Very experienced and gentle. Take your time getting changed, and she'll be right with you. And don't hesitate to let either of us know if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be just outside when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I shall try to… compose myself. A bit of a trial for an old man, you see. But… one does what one must. I’ll call when I am… prepared.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. Take all the time you need. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: .
