DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. It’s nice to meet you. My name is Dr. Lahn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… well, I want to know more about where my people come from. My kids, they get these tests… DNA tests, to see where their family is from. I want to do one too, if that's okay? I’m Laury Scobie, by the way.
DOCTOR: It’s good to officially meet you, Laury. And that’s perfectly alright, many people are curious about their ancestry these days. I understand you’re interested in learning more about your heritage through a DNA test. While I don't directly do the tests here at the clinic, I can certainly discuss the process with you and help you understand what the results might mean from a health perspective. Before we dive into that, could you tell me a little more about your background?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay, that sounds good. Health perspective… yes, good. Well, I was born here, on this island. But my parents… they came from the Marshall Islands. A long time ago. They made boats, mostly. And fished. I… I make little boats too, out of wood. Not like they did, though. Smaller ones. More for… showing. Not for going anywhere. I’ve always been here, though. Always. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Laury. It sounds like you have a strong connection to your heritage, even though you were born here. Knowing your family’s origins is important, and you’re right to be curious. Just to get a better picture, do you know which atoll – which island within the Marshall Islands – your parents came from?
PATIENT: Atoll… is that a small island? They didn’t… they didn't say much about which one. Just… the Marshall Islands. They talked about the ocean, and the boats, and the sun. And sometimes… being sad. It was a long time ago. I was just a little boy. Maybe Majuro? I think I heard that name sometimes. But I’m not sure. It was a long, long time.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Laury. Memories fade, and it sounds like they didn’t talk about it often. Majuro is the largest atoll in the Marshall Islands, so that’s a reasonable guess. Now, while DNA tests can be fascinating, it's important to understand they won't tell us everything about your health. However, knowing your ancestry can sometimes be helpful in identifying potential genetic predispositions to certain conditions that are more common in specific populations. Do you have any known health concerns that you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: Hmm… genetic predispositions… that’s a big word. I get a little tired sometimes. Old age, I think. And my knees… they ache when it rains. Nothing much else. Doctor tells me to take it easy, that’s all. Just old age. I don't want any big troubles. Just want to know where my family is from. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Laury, that’s perfectly okay. Knowing your family history is important, regardless of any specific health concerns. We can definitely focus on that. And it’s good you have a doctor who is monitoring your aches and pains. Before we discuss the DNA test options, let's quickly review your current medications, allergies, and any past surgeries you may have had. Just to be thorough. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my blood. The doctor gives it to me every month. Keeps the blood… not too thick, he says. And I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. That’s all. No allergies, I don't think. I eat everything. I like food too much to not eat it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a monthly pill for your blood – that’s good to know. And tonsils removed as a child, excellent. No known allergies – that simplifies things. Now, let's talk a bit about the DNA tests themselves. There are several companies that offer these tests. They typically require a saliva sample, which you send in the mail. The results can take a few weeks to come back. They’ll give you an estimate of your ethnic origins, and sometimes information about potential health risks. However, it's important to remember that these tests aren’t always 100% accurate, and they shouldn’t be used to make major medical decisions. Would you be interested in me giving you some information on a few reputable companies that offer these tests?
PATIENT: Reputable… does that mean good companies? Yes, please. That would be good. I don’t know anything about these companies. I just want to find out where my family came from. If you know good ones… that would be very helpful. Not the ones that cost too much, maybe? I don't have much money.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, reputable means trustworthy and reliable companies. I understand you’re looking for something affordable, and that’s perfectly reasonable. Two companies that are generally considered reputable and offer reasonably priced ancestry tests are 23andMe and AncestryDNA. 23andMe also offers a health report add-on, but that increases the cost. AncestryDNA focuses more on building family trees, which might be of interest to you given your desire to learn about your family origins. Both require you to create an account and send in a saliva sample. They both often have sales as well, which could help with the cost. I can print out some information about both, including their website addresses and general pricing, for you to review. Before I do that, are you comfortable with the idea of your DNA information being stored in a company database?
PATIENT: Database… You mean… they keep my spit? Forever? Is that safe? I don't like people keeping things about me… especially my spit. I don’t know about that. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Laury. You’re right to ask. Yes, these companies do store your DNA information in a database. However, they have privacy policies in place to protect your data. Generally, your information is anonymized and used for research purposes. You have control over your data and can choose whether or not to participate in research. You can also request that your data be deleted. It’s important to read their privacy policies carefully before submitting a sample. I can point you to the specific privacy policy links for both 23andMe and AncestryDNA. We can discuss your concerns in more detail if you’d like. Many people are hesitant about sharing their DNA information, and that’s perfectly understandable. Perhaps, before we decide on a DNA test, we could focus on documenting what you do know about your family history. We can create a family tree together, starting with your parents and working backwards. This might be a more comfortable way to learn about your origins without sharing your DNA information. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: That… that sounds better. A tree… yes. I remember my mother telling me stories… about the ocean, and the stars, and the people. We can write those down, maybe? No spit. Just stories. Yes, that's much better. Maybe we can find out where they came from… from the stories. That would be good. Thank you, Doctor. That's very kind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Laury. That’s a wonderful idea. Stories are a powerful way to connect with our past. We can certainly start documenting your mother's stories. We’ll take it one step at a time, and see where it leads us. Let’s start with your mother. What was her name?
PATIENT: Her name was Lilian. Lilian Kili. She was… very strong. She knew everything about the ocean. And she could sing… beautiful songs. About the stars and the fish and… home. She always said the ocean was her home. And my father's name was Taro. Taro Kabua. He made boats. Very strong boats. They came here a long time ago, before I was born. That's all I remember, really. Just their names… and the ocean.
DOCTOR: Lilian Kili and Taro Kabua. Wonderful. That’s a great place to start. Do you remember anything specific about why they came here?
PATIENT: Hmm… They didn't talk much about leaving. Just… things were hard. Very hard. The ocean was changing, they said. And there wasn't much food. I was just a little boy, though. I didn’t understand. They wanted a better life, I think. For me. They wanted me to be safe. That’s all I remember. They never spoke about the islands… except when they were sad.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Laury. It sounds like they were seeking a better life and a safer future for you. It’s understandable they didn’t talk about it much if it was a painful experience. Okay, let's try this: Do you know what atoll – what specific island within the Marshall Islands – they might have come from?
PATIENT: Atoll… No. I told you, they never said. Majuro? Maybe. It’s just a name I heard. But I don’t know. They used to sing songs about a… a beautiful lagoon. And a tall coconut tree. But there are many lagoons and many coconut trees, I think. I wish I knew. It feels like a piece of me is missing.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Laury. It's okay not to know all the details. It sounds like you have some beautiful memories of their songs, and that’s a wonderful starting point. The lagoon and the coconut tree… those are good images to hold onto. We can try to research islands with beautiful lagoons and prominent coconut trees within the Marshall Islands. Perhaps, if you’re comfortable, we could also look at maps of the Marshall Islands together. Seeing the different atolls might jog some memories, or perhaps spark a feeling of recognition. We don’t have to push it if it feels uncomfortable, but it’s just an idea. Would you like to do that now, or would you prefer to stop here for today?
PATIENT: A map… Yes. A map… maybe. It won't hurt to look, will it? If it makes me sad… we can stop. I just want to know. I want to know where I come from. Yes, a map sounds good. Let's look at a map, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Laury. Here we are. As you can see, the Marshall Islands are made up of many atolls and islands. They are quite spread out. We can zoom in on each atoll and take a look. We’ll take it slowly, and if anything feels upsetting, we can absolutely stop. Let's start with Majuro, since you mentioned that name. Do you recognize anything about this atoll?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… big. Lots of little islands. And water. Very blue water. It looks… peaceful. I don't know if I recognize it, exactly. But… The shape of the islands… it looks a little bit like my mother’s necklace. She had a necklace with little shells shaped like these islands. Not exactly, but… similar. Does that make sense? It just feels… familiar.
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful observation, Laury! That's a very meaningful connection – the shape of the islands resembling your mother’s necklace. It’s certainly possible this is where your family came from. Let’s look at some images of Majuro Atoll. Perhaps seeing photos of the lagoon, the vegetation, and the people will spark more memories. Let’s take a look. We'll take our time.
PATIENT: Oh… That water… it's the same color as the ocean in my dreams. And the trees… My mother used to weave like that! Beautiful patterns. She made mats and baskets. I… I think… I think this might be it. This might be where my family came from.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Laury. It sounds like those images are resonating with you deeply. It’s perfectly okay to feel emotional. It’s important to remember that these are just images, and we can’t say for sure without more information. But it’s wonderful that they’ve sparked such a strong connection. Now, even though we don't have definitive proof, knowing this information can be helpful from a health perspective. People from certain islands within the Marshall Islands may be predisposed to specific conditions. I can document your potential ancestry as Majuro Atoll, and we can consider appropriate health screenings based on that information. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Majuro… yes. It feels right. Even if I can’t be sure. It feels like coming home, a little bit. Document it. That’s a good idea. Health… yes. Maybe knowing something about the islands will help me… help my body. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve helped me a lot today. Really, a lot. I feel… lighter.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Laury. I’m so glad I could help. It sounds like you’ve reconnected with a part of yourself today. Okay, I’ll document your potential ancestry as Majuro Atoll. We’ll also schedule a routine check-up and discuss appropriate health screenings based on that information. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that's all. Just… thank you again, Doctor. You're very kind. And… it's good to remember my mother. And my father. It makes me feel… stronger. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Laury. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember to take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'll see you at your next appointment. Have a wonderful day.
