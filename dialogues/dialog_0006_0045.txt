DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe, good to see you. I'm Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… the flushing. I keep getting… warm. My face, mostly. It comes and goes. Not always, but enough to make me worry. It started maybe… three weeks ago? I think so. It is hard to keep track of days these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing… comes and goes for about three weeks now. You said mostly on your face?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, mostly on my face. Sometimes my neck too. It feels… hot, like a sunburn, but there is no sun. And it doesn’t look like a sunburn, if that makes sense. Just… red. It goes away after a little while, then comes back later. It does not hurt, though. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. No pain, just redness and warmth… on your face and neck. Happens intermittently. Any particular time of day it seems worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I don’t think so. Not really. It seems to happen… whenever. After I eat sometimes, maybe? But not always after eating. And sometimes it happens when I am just sitting and watching television. So… I do not know if there is a pattern. I am sorry. It is just… random.
DOCTOR: No, no, that's alright. Random is good information to have. It helps rule things out. You said after eating sometimes... what do you typically eat?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. I try to eat healthy. Mostly vegetables, some chicken, a little rice. I like curry, sometimes. Not very spicy, though. My wife, she used to make very good curry. I make it myself now, but it is not the same. I drink tea with my meals, usually. And water, of course. I do not drink… strong drinks. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a pretty healthy diet, it sounds like. No recent changes to what you're eating?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I have been eating pretty much the same things for… a long time now. Maybe a little more tea, since… well, since she passed. It comforts me. But that is the only change. I don’t think that would cause this, would it? The tea, I mean.
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be the tea directly, but anything new can sometimes be a trigger. Let’s move on. Any other symptoms alongside the flushing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but I am 57 years old. That is probably just… old age. No headaches, no dizziness, no… stomach trouble. Nothing like that. Just the flushing. And the tiredness, but I do not know if that is connected. I sleep okay, usually. Maybe six, seven hours a night. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, but that is just… worrying, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no other associated symptoms. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Could I check your blood pressure and pulse, take a look at your face and neck a bit closer?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I just… I want to know what is wrong, if anything is wrong. I do not like feeling… red. It makes me feel self-conscious.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 142 over 88. Pulse is steady at 76. Your face is a little flushed right now, but no obvious rashes or lesions. Your neck is also slightly reddened. I don't see anything alarming, but we should probably run a few tests just to be sure. Would you be okay with a blood test?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Blood test is fine. Whatever you think. I just want this to stop. Elevated blood pressure… is that bad? I do not remember my wife mentioning anything about my blood pressure. She was a nurse, you know. A very good nurse. I should have paid more attention. If a blood test can help… then yes, please.
DOCTOR: It's good that we're checking. Elevated blood pressure isn't necessarily bad right away, but it's something we want to monitor. It's possible the flushing is related, or it may be completely separate. The blood tests will help us rule out some common causes for flushing, like thyroid issues or certain infections. We'll also check your overall health. It’s likely nothing serious, but better safe than sorry. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any allergies. Never had a problem with any medicine. And latex… no, I don’t think so. I used to help my wife with her garden, and she used those rubber gloves sometimes, but I never had a reaction. I just… I worry sometimes. It has been a year since she passed, and I still miss her so much. Maybe that is why I am getting flushed. All the… stress. But you are the doctor, you tell me.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to be stressed and anxious after a loss like that. It definitely can manifest physically. But we still need to rule out any medical causes first. I’m ordering the blood test now, and the lab is just down the hall. They’ll just need a small sample. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. A plan… yes, that would be nice. I will go to the lab. Just… let me know if anything is… seriously wrong, okay? I do not want any surprises. Thank you for listening. It helps, just talking about it. I hope these tests show nothing. I hope it is just… stress.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Withycombe. We'll let you know as soon as the results are back, and we'll go over everything thoroughly. I’ll also write you a note for any work or school obligations explaining you had a medical appointment today. If you start to feel any worsening symptoms – like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. Here’s the lab requisition. Hopefully it is just stress, but we're covering all bases.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you very much. I will go to the lab now. And I will… remember what you said about the emergency room. Thank you again for listening.
