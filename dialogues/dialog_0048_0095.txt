DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Nissenbaum, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Look, I don’t have all day, so if we could just get on with it… I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels… droopy. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… a start. Though “droopy” isn't very precise, is it?
PATIENT: Precise enough for you to figure out what’s wrong, I should think. It’s… like one side of my mouth won't lift when I smile. Honestly, I haven’t got time for a detailed facial analysis. I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s not be dramatic. When did you first notice this, precisely?
PATIENT: This morning. I told you. When I woke up. It was… startling, to say the least. I was getting ready for my book club and… well, that’s when I noticed. Really, doctor, are we going in circles here?
DOCTOR: And before this morning?
PATIENT: Before this morning? What do you mean before this morning? I haven't had a stroke or anything, if that's what you’re implying. Everything was perfectly normal yesterday. I went to the market, had tea with a friend… normal. I'm a very healthy woman, despite… recent events.
DOCTOR: Right. Any dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Not at all. Though, frankly, being questioned like this is making me a little lightheaded, if you must know. Are you ruling things out or in with all these questions? I’d appreciate a little clarity.
DOCTOR: I need to establish a timeline. Have you experienced any vision changes?
PATIENT: Vision changes? No. My eyesight is… was… perfectly fine. I read a great deal, you know. And I would have noticed if something was wrong with my vision. Honestly, doctor, this is all rather…basic. I expect a little more from a professional.
DOCTOR: And any headache?
PATIENT: A headache? Well, a bit of one now, actually. But that’s probably from all this… interrogation. Before this morning? No. Just a normal, everyday headache occasionally. I don’t make a fuss over small things. It's not as if I'm constantly plagued by migraines.
DOCTOR: Any numbness or weakness anywhere else?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’m a perfectly functional woman, doctor. If I felt anything else, I would tell you. I’m not prone to… exaggeration. Look, is this going to take much longer? I really need to be going. I have a very important engagement.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick look. Please open your mouth and say “ah”.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to look at me? After all those questions? Fine. Ah. There. Is that satisfactory? I hope you find something helpful, because frankly, I’m losing patience.
DOCTOR: Tongue looks normal. Now, let me check your reflexes…please relax your arms. Reflexes are…slightly diminished on the left side. That’s…not ideal. Now, I'm going to check your facial movements more closely.
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, you’re making me feel like a specimen! Diminished reflexes? What does that mean? Is it serious? Stop poking and prodding and just tell me what’s wrong with me! I haven't got time for cryptic medical pronouncements.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Nissenbaum. I’m going to need to ask you some further questions. Have you had any recent infections?
PATIENT: Recent infections? No! I maintain a very strict hygiene regimen. What kind of question is that? I haven't been ill in… well, years. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Are you suspecting I’m carrying some sort of plague? I should probably get a second opinion. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, I’m going to order a CT scan. Just to be safe. You’ll need to go to the imaging center downtown. It’s rather urgent. I'll have the paperwork ready for you. And frankly, I strongly advise you follow up with a neurologist. Don't delay.
PATIENT: A CT scan? A neurologist? Honestly! All this fuss over a little deafness and a slightly droopy face? Fine. Do whatever you think is necessary, but I expect a full explanation of the results, and quickly. And I expect it to be simple enough for someone without a medical degree to understand. I don’t have time for jargon. Just get the paperwork. I have commitments, remember?
DOCTOR: Here. The imaging center is at 123 Main Street. They’re open until 8 pm. And I’ll have my assistant schedule a neurology consult for you as soon as possible. It’s standard procedure. That’s all for now, Mrs. Nissenbaum. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
