DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um... well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. It's about... pain. Down there. In... well, you know. Honestly, I’ve been meaning to come in for a while, but things have been… busy. And it’s a little embarrassing, if I’m being frank.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright to feel embarrassed, and you've come to the right place. Many women experience similar issues, and we’re here to help, no judgement at all. When you say “down there,” could you be a little more specific about where you’re feeling the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It's... in the, um... the scrotal area, I believe? That’s what the young man at the pharmacy said, when I asked about something for it. It's a dull ache, mostly, but sometimes it gets quite sharp. It’s been… on and off for a few weeks, I think. Perhaps longer? It's hard to say, truthfully. I haven't been keeping track.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. The scrotal area… a dull ache that sometimes gets sharp, and it’s been going on for a few weeks, potentially longer. To clarify, is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It’s not… always there. Some days I don’t notice it at all. And other days, like today, it's… well, noticeable. It seems to be worse after I’ve been… working. I do a lot of woodworking, you see. Perhaps that has something to do with it? I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: Woodworking, okay. That’s helpful information. So it seems to be aggravated by activity. Does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Um… honestly, not much. Lying down sometimes helps a little. And… taking some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, the ibuprofen, perhaps? But it only takes the edge off, really. It doesn't really fix it. I mostly just try to ignore it, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lying down and ibuprofen offer some minimal relief. Now, have you noticed any swelling, redness, or any changes in the skin in that area?
PATIENT: Swelling… I don't think so. No, it doesn’t feel swollen. And redness… I haven’t really looked, if I’m being perfectly honest. I haven’t been brave enough to… examine it closely, I suppose. The skin… I suppose it looks normal? I haven’t noticed anything different, but I haven't been paying much attention, to be fair. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. It’s perfectly understandable. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any fever, chills, or any unusual discharge from the area?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I haven’t. And chills, no. Not at all. Discharge… no, Doctor. Definitely not. I’m glad it’s not anything… serious. It's just been a nagging pain, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No fever, chills, or discharge. Alright, Noelani. Based on what you've told me, and given your history, it sounds like we need to rule out a few possibilities. The pain you're describing could be a number of things, from a simple muscle strain to something requiring further investigation. To get a better understanding, I’d like to do a quick physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Yes, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. Just… please be gentle. It’s a bit… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Noelani. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll take it slow and stop if you feel any discomfort at all. If you could please lie down on the examination table, we'll start there. I'm going to start by just feeling around the area to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. It's just... a little embarrassing, but I understand it’s necessary. Please… just let me know if I need to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Noelani. I appreciate your cooperation. I'm going to start with a visual inspection, and then I'll gently palpate the area. This means I'll be feeling around with my hands. I'll let you know what I'm doing as I go. Okay. I'm not feeling any significant swelling or masses at this time. There's some mild tenderness to palpation on the left side, but nothing alarming. Can you tell me if this feels particularly painful when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. A little bit. It’s not excruciating, but… yes, that's where it hurts most. Just a dull ache, but definitely more pronounced there. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. That’s helpful to know. Tenderness on the left side is consistent with a few possibilities. It could be something simple like an epididymitis – an inflammation of the tube that carries sperm – or a mild testicular strain. However, to be thorough, we need to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to order a urine test to check for infection, and a scrotal ultrasound to get a better look at the structures in that area. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A urine test and an ultrasound? Yes, Doctor. If that's what you recommend. Will the ultrasound… be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to get this sorted out, if possible.
DOCTOR: No, the ultrasound itself isn't painful at all. It's a non-invasive procedure where a technician uses a wand and gel to create images of the inside of your scrotum. It’s like getting a pregnancy scan. It might feel a little cold from the gel, but that’s it. As for the results, the urine test should come back within a day or two. The ultrasound images will need to be reviewed by a radiologist, which usually takes about 24-48 hours. Once I have both results, we can discuss them in detail and decide on a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity, wearing supportive underwear, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Supportive underwear… and no strenuous activity. I think I can manage that. Um… will I need a referral for the ultrasound? And… how much will all of this cost? I’m on Medicare, so I’m not sure what will be covered. It’s just… I worry about the bills.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Noelani, and I'm happy to address that. Yes, I will need to send a referral for the ultrasound. I’ll send it to [Name of local imaging center], they work closely with Medicare and have a good reputation. Regarding costs, Medicare should cover a significant portion of both the ultrasound and the urine test, especially with a referral. However, there might be a copay or deductible depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can provide you with a detailed cost estimate before the procedures are done, and they can also help you understand your coverage. I can have them contact you directly after this appointment. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Having the billing department contact me would be a great help. Yes, please. That would take a lot of worry off my mind. Um… is there anything I need to do to prepare for the ultrasound? Do I need to drink a lot of water, or… anything like that? I just want to make sure I do everything correctly.
DOCTOR: No, there's nothing special you need to do to prepare for the ultrasound. You don’t need to fast or drink a lot of water. Just wear comfortable clothing and arrive a few minutes early for your appointment. They might ask you to empty your bladder before the procedure, but they’ll let you know when you get there. Alright, Noelani. I’ll send the referral for the ultrasound right away, and the billing department will be in touch with you shortly. I’ll also document everything we discussed today in your chart. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time and patience. I really appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly and addressing all my concerns. I feel much better now, knowing what to expect. I suppose I’ll just wait for the billing department to contact me. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or if anything changes before your ultrasound appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the results. Have a good day. .
