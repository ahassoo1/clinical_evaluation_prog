DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my speech, I think. It hasn't been quite right lately. It feels…slurred, sometimes. I don’t really know when it started, to be honest. Things have been a bit hectic.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Not quite right” and “slurred, sometimes.” That's not very specific, Ms. Swaby. Can you tell me more about when you notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. When… that’s tricky. I suppose… when I’m tired, definitely. And, um… when I talk for a long time? Like, if I’m explaining something at work, it gets worse. I manage construction sites, so I do a lot of talking. But honestly, it comes and goes, and I just… don't remember noticing a specific time it began. It just… is. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… less than ideal that you can’t pinpoint a start date, Ms. Swaby. That makes things more difficult. And construction site management… that is a lot of verbal communication. When you say “worse,” could you describe exactly how it feels worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How does it feel… It's like… my tongue feels heavy, maybe? And the words… they don’t come out clearly. People sometimes ask me to repeat myself. Or they look confused. It's not all the time, you understand. Just… sometimes. My husband says it sounds like I’m mumbling, but I don’t always notice it myself.
DOCTOR: “Heavy tongue” and needing to repeat yourself. Right. Let's move on. Do you experience any difficulty understanding what people say to you, or is it solely with your speech?
PATIENT: No, no, I can hear perfectly well. It’s definitely saying things that's the problem, not hearing. I can follow a conversation just fine. It’s just… getting the words out. It's a bit frustrating, to be honest. Especially when I need to give clear instructions.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this speech issue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Not really… oh! Sometimes my face feels a bit… weak, on one side? But it comes and goes, and I just thought I was tired. It's hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt, it just feels… droopy, maybe? Again, it's not constant. It's all very vague, I'm afraid. I don't keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: “Droopy” feeling on one side of your face… That is, potentially, quite relevant. We're going to need to examine that. Could you please sit up straight and smile for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is that alright? It's a bit silly, isn’t it? Smiling on command. But I’m happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I do see a slight asymmetry. Your smile is a little uneven, and there’s a subtle droop to the left side of your mouth. Now, could you please close both of your eyes tightly?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that alright? It feels a bit strange having someone look at me so closely. I hope I'm not being difficult. It's just… I don't usually pay attention to these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, stick your tongue out as far as you can. I need to see how it moves.
PATIENT: Is that… okay? It feels a bit silly, doesn’t it? I hope I’m not making a mess. It does feel a bit… awkward, honestly. I haven’t had to do this sort of thing before.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, a little deviation to the left. Alright, Ms. Swaby. We've done enough of the basic exam for now. I'm concerned about potential neurological involvement. I need to ask you some questions about your past medical history, medications, allergies, and family history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history… Let me see… I haven’t really had any major medical problems, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I had… tonsillitis once, I think? And I broke my arm when I was a little girl. Apart from that, I’m pretty healthy, as far as I know. I haven’t been to the doctor much over the years. I just haven’t needed to. Does that help? I’m married, if that’s relevant. My husband is very good at looking after me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Past surgical history - a broken arm, which I assume was treated. No other surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries at all. It was just a simple break, really. A cast and then it healed just fine. I was a very active child, you see. Always climbing trees and things. My mother was always worried about me. It's probably a good thing I grew out of that phase. Now, what was I saying…? Oh yes, medical history. I don’t think I have anything else to report, Doctor. I really haven’t been a troublesome patient.
DOCTOR: And what about family history, Ms. Swaby?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… a difficult one. My mother passed away a few years ago, and she didn’t really talk much about family illnesses. She was very private, you see. My father is still alive, but he lives in Jamaica, and we don’t speak very often. As far as I know, he’s healthy, but I haven’t had a proper conversation with him in years. There was an aunt, maybe, who had… something with her heart? But I’m not really sure. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very involved. I apologize, Doctor, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s all very vague, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking any medications at all. Never have, actually. I don't really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy through diet and exercise, you see. Though with my job, it’s sometimes hard to find the time for exercise. But I try. Mostly, I just drink a lot of water. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. And I've never had a reaction to anything. Well, except for… mosquitoes, maybe? They really love me, but that’s not an allergy, is it? It just… itches. I think my husband might be allergic to shellfish, but that’s him, not me. I really don’t think I have any allergies, Doctor. I’m very lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Given your symptoms—slurred speech, facial droop, and tongue deviation—and the relatively rapid onset, I'm concerned about a possible neurological event. While it could be several things, we need to rule out something serious. I'm ordering an MRI of the brain and a CT scan to get a clearer picture. I’m also going to order blood work to rule out any underlying infections or other causes. I'm referring you to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. An MRI and a CT scan… and a neurologist? That sounds… serious. I… I do understand, Doctor. But… what does that mean, exactly? Is something really wrong? I just thought it was… stress, maybe? Or tiredness. This is all a bit overwhelming, honestly. I feel… quite anxious now. Will it hurt? And… what if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: Ms. Swaby, I understand you're anxious, but it’s important to be proactive. These tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out anything serious, such as a stroke or a tumor. The MRI and CT scans themselves are painless, though you will need to lie still for a period of time. The neurologist will conduct a thorough examination and discuss the results with you. It’s possible there’s a simple explanation, but we need to investigate. It would be irresponsible of me to dismiss your symptoms without proper evaluation. I will have the radiology department contact you to schedule these tests. And frankly, worrying yourself unduly won't help. We will address this systematically. Do you have any further questions, or are you prepared to proceed with these steps?
PATIENT: I… I suppose not. If you think it’s necessary, then I trust your judgement, Doctor. It’s just… the thought of something being seriously wrong… It’s a bit frightening. But you’re right, worrying won’t help. I’ll let the radiology department contact me. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose… I’ll just try to stay calm, then.
