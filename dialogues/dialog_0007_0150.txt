DOCTOR: Hi Angelle, nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez, but you can call me Valerie. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… rather straightforward, really. I’m 51, and I want a baby. Without any… complications. I don’t have time for things to be complicated, you understand. I’ve heard good things about your clinic, though it’s a bit… remote. But time is of the essence.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Angelle. It’s wonderful you’re considering this, and you’re right to be proactive. We do our best to provide excellent care even out here. "Time is of the essence" – I’ll definitely keep that in mind. Okay, so you’re looking into pregnancy at 51. To get a good picture of things, let’s start with your medical history. Have you had any children previously?
PATIENT: No. Never. And frankly, that's not something I usually discuss. It’s… personal. But to answer your question directly, no children. I was… focused on my career for a very long time. Bicycle repair is demanding, you know. Not exactly conducive to raising a family. Is this going to be a long questionnaire? Because I really don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your privacy, Angelle, and I apologize if I’ve touched on something sensitive. We’ll move as quickly as we can. And yes, bicycle repair is demanding! Okay, no children previously. To assess the feasibility and safety of pregnancy, we need to cover some basics. Have you had any significant medical conditions diagnosed – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I’m remarkably healthy for my age, if I do say so myself. I cycle every day. It keeps me fit. I’ve broken a few bones over the years, fixing those dreadful tourist bikes, but nothing… serious. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, rubella, but that was… decades ago. I don’t see why that would matter now. Are you writing all this down? Because it’s rather tedious repeating it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down, Angelle. It's important to have a complete record. And you do sound remarkably healthy, daily cycling is excellent. Just to be thorough – have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Absolutely not. And hospitalised? Only once. When I was a teenager, appendicitis. It was rather unpleasant, but a quick recovery. Honestly, I don’t see what any of this has to do with wanting a baby now. It’s like asking a perfectly good engine if it was ever a bit rusty thirty years ago! It’s irrelevant. Are we getting anywhere with this? Because I have a rather important shipment of gears arriving this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Angelle. You’re right, it can feel tedious. It’s just that a lot can change over time, and we need to make sure everything is optimal for a healthy pregnancy. It’s not about doubting your current health, but about being thorough. Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations aside from the appendicitis as a teenager. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. Another rabbit hole. My mother… she had high blood pressure, later in life. And a bit of arthritis. My father was… perfectly healthy until he fell off a roof. Completely unrelated, I assure you. And that’s about it. Mostly just… sensible, hardworking Hungarians who lived long lives. Not much excitement. Is this going to involve contacting relatives? Because I absolutely forbid that. It would cause a scandal.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, arthritis, otherwise healthy. No, we won't be contacting relatives, Angelle. I understand your concern about privacy. Now, let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. A sensible one. And occasionally ibuprofen for… well, for aches and pains from fixing bicycles. Nothing else. I don't believe in filling my body with unnecessary chemicals. It’s counterproductive. And frankly, I find the question insulting. As if I would willingly compromise my health! Is this… are we nearing the end of this interrogation?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Angelle. It’s not my intention to insult you, quite the opposite. I'm simply trying to get a complete picture. And you’re right to be mindful of what you put into your body. Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. One last quick area – do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Absolutely none. I eat everything. I’ve travelled extensively, you know. Sampling local cuisine is essential. I’m a remarkably robust individual. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel rather… patronised. Are you suggesting I'm somehow unsuitable? Because if you are, I'd like to know now. I have other clinics to consider. And a shipment of gears arriving. A very important shipment.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Angelle. I assure you, I am not suggesting you are unsuitable. Quite the opposite, you sound incredibly healthy and robust. I'm asking these questions to ensure we consider all aspects of your health before proceeding. Now that we’ve covered your medical history, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just be a basic check of your blood pressure, heart, lungs, and abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam. Fine. Get it over with. But please be quick. And gentle. I’ve spent the entire morning wrestling with a particularly stubborn derailleur. My hands are not in prime condition. And frankly, I'd prefer not to discuss this further. Let’s just ascertain whether I'm… physically capable, and then we can discuss the practicalities. I have a business to run, you know. .
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. 130/80. That’s within the normal range. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds strong and regular, and your lungs are clear. Now I’m going to palpate your abdomen. No tenderness or abnormalities detected. Everything feels normal so far. Do you have any pain anywhere?
