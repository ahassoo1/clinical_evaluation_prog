DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Genard. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor... Seil, you say? Hmm. Well, it's... down there. Something's leaking. Not good. It's been... a little while now. I don't know how long, exactly. Old lady problems, I guess. It's not like it used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. “Something leaking” can be concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the leakage a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? Like... what do you want to know? It's... wet. And... smelly, a little. Not a good smell. It's not like... pee, though. Definitely not pee. It's... thicker. And sometimes... there's a little bit of... stuff with it. I don't know. Old lady stuff! I told you. It's just… unpleasant. You know? I don't go around looking at it all day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand it's difficult to describe, Mrs. Genard, and you're right, you shouldn't have to be examining it closely. “Thicker” and “smelly” are helpful. And you mentioned sometimes there’s “stuff with it.” Could you describe that “stuff”?
PATIENT: Stuff... Hmm. It's... yellowish. Sometimes white. Little bits. Not big. Like... cream cheese, but not as smooth. And sometimes... a little bit of red. Not a lot, mind you. Just... a speck. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s probably nothing. Just… getting old. Everything gets a little… messy when you get old. You wouldn't understand.
DOCTOR: It does help me understand, Mrs. Genard. And it's perfectly reasonable to come in and get these things checked out, regardless of age. The yellowish or whitish discharge, and the occasional speck of red, are important details. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if this is a new issue, or has it been going on for a long time?
PATIENT: Long time… a long time. I don't remember exactly when it started. Months, I guess? Maybe longer. Everything's blurry these days. I just thought it was… normal. You know, when you get older, things change. I didn't think it was something to bother the doctor with. Honestly. It's just… embarrassing. I haven't really… talked about this with anyone before. Not even my sister. She's got her own problems.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mrs. Genard. Many women experience changes like this, and it's very common to feel embarrassed talking about it. That’s why I’m here – to provide a safe space to discuss these things. Since it’s been going on for months, and you haven’t noticed any worsening symptoms – like pain, burning, or fever – that’s good. However, because it’s been ongoing, it would be best to do a quick examination to determine the cause. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Examination? Oh, dear. I don't know… I’m not real keen on… poking around down there. Is it really necessary? Maybe it'll just go away on its own? I mean, things do sometimes fix themselves, don't they? I'm an old woman, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life. Maybe it's just… my time. I don't want any fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mrs. Genard. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. However, even though you’ve lived a long life, it’s still important to understand what’s causing this, even if it’s something minor. An examination will help us rule out any potential infections or other issues that might need attention. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, and it will give us peace of mind. The examination itself is quite quick and straightforward. I will explain everything as I go, and you are welcome to stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. We can also discuss alternative options if you'd prefer. Would you like me to explain the examination process in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, all right. Explain it, I suppose. But don’t go poking around too much. And no funny business, you hear? I've seen things, Doctor. I’m not as naive as I look. Just tell me what you’re going to do, and make it quick. I have a bingo game later. A very important bingo game.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Genard. I completely understand. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I will explain everything before I do it. First, I’ll ask you to lie on the examination table with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. I’ll drape you with a sheet to maintain your privacy. Then, I’ll visually examine the external area. After that, I’ll use a speculum – a small, gently-shaped instrument – to gently open the vaginal canal so I can see the cervix. This allows me to look for any abnormalities. I may also take a small swab to collect a sample for testing. It might feel a little pressure or discomfort, but it shouldn't be painful. The entire process usually takes only a few minutes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A speculum... sounds awful. And a swab? Like one of those things the nurses use? No, I don’t like the sound of this at all. Is there anything else you can do? Maybe just… give me some cream? Or some pills? I used to have a friend who swore by pills for everything. She lived to be 95, you know. Maybe that's the answer. Just some pills. That's all I want. No poking and no swabbing.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mrs. Genard. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to avoid anything uncomfortable. While pills or cream might offer some temporary relief, without knowing the cause of the discharge, they could potentially mask a more serious issue. For example, the discharge could be due to an infection, which requires a specific antibiotic to treat. Or it could be a hormonal imbalance, which requires a different approach. Without a proper examination and sample for testing, it’s difficult to determine the best course of action. However, I respect your wishes. We could try a course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic cream, which covers many common infections. But I would strongly recommend that if your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen, you come back in for a full examination. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A week… Alright. A week of cream. But if it burns, I'm not using it. And don’t expect me to come running back if it doesn’t work. I have a life, you know. Bingo, mahjong, watching my stories… I'm a busy woman. Just give me the cream, and let's be done with this. And make sure it doesn't smell too funny. I don't want to smell like a hospital all week.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Genard. I understand. I’ll prescribe a mild, broad-spectrum antibiotic cream with a neutral scent. It shouldn’t cause any burning, but if you experience any irritation, please stop using it immediately. I’ll also write down clear instructions on how to apply it. Here’s the prescription. You can pick it up at the pharmacy of your choice. And, as you requested, I won't pressure you to come back if it doesn’t resolve the issue. However, I do want to emphasize that if your symptoms worsen, or you develop any fever, pain, or unusual odor, please seek medical attention promptly. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that's all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For not making me get poked and prodded. And for understanding that I have a bingo game to get to. It's very important.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Genard. I completely understand about the bingo game – important things come first! Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
