DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. MayHugh. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's my ears, mostly. They've been playing up. And, um, a bit wobbly sometimes, if that makes sense. It’s hard to explain, really. It comes and goes. It’s been happening for a bit now, I think. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. My daughter, Leilani, she said I should come in.
DOCTOR: "Playing up" and "wobbly," right. Alright. And by "playing up," can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. Let me think. It’s like… everything gets quiet, suddenly. Not painful, just… muffled. Like someone turned the volume right down. And then, the room spins. Not always, but sometimes. It doesn’t last long, usually. Maybe a few minutes. It’s just… unsettling, you know? I get a bit dizzy, and everything feels off. My husband… oh, he used to say I got a bit pale when it happened, but… well, that was a while ago now.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing and dizziness. And this "spinning"… is it a constant spinning sensation, or more like a brief whirl?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not constant, no. Definitely not constant. It comes in waves, I suppose. More like… a quick whirl, yes, that's a good way to put it. Like when you spin around as a child and then stop suddenly? A bit like that, but not as… fun. And it’s usually when I stand up too quickly, I think. Or maybe when I turn my head. It’s hard to remember exactly what I’m doing when it happens. It just does.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on, Mrs. MayHugh?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's the tricky part, isn’t it? Like I said, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Leilani says it’s been a few months, at least. Maybe six? But it comes and goes, so it's hard to keep track. It wasn’t all the time at first, just now and then. It’s been a bit more frequent lately, I suppose, which is why I’m here. It's just… worrying.
DOCTOR: "A few months, intermittently, and worsening recently." Right. Now, have you had any ear infections recently?
PATIENT: Ear infections… hmm. Not that I remember. I had something when I was a child, I think, but nothing in a very long time. Certainly not recently. Leilani always checked me over when I was sick, but I don’t think she ever mentioned an ear infection. I’ve just felt generally unwell sometimes, you know? A bit tired, a bit achy. But ear infection… no, I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any difficulty with your balance generally – not just when this dizziness occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Um… well, I have tripped a few times lately. Nothing major, just a little stumble. But I’m not as steady as I used to be, I suppose. I put it down to getting older, mostly. Everything gets a bit wobbly when you get to my age, doesn’t it? But, thinking about it… maybe it’s not just old age. Maybe it’s connected to the ears, like Leilani said. I honestly don't know. It's all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: "Recent falls, attributed to age, but potentially related." Right. Let’s do a quick exam. I'm going to look in your ears, check your balance, and listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that sounds sensible. I’ll try my best. Just… be gentle, if you could? Everything feels a bit sensitive lately.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Now, let's have a look in your ears... Hmm. A bit of cerumen buildup, but no obvious signs of infection. Now the right ear… Similar here. A little wax, but nothing concerning. Okay, let's check your balance now. I'd like you to stand with your feet together, and close your eyes. Just try and maintain your balance for as long as you can. Let me know if you feel unsteady.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Closed eyes… Oh… whoa… I don’t like this… I feel a bit wobbly already… It’s hard to keep steady…
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, that’s enough. Just sit down, please. "Romberg test positive – loss of balance with eyes closed." Right. And now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are a little diminished on the lower lobes, but nothing overtly concerning. Heart sounds are regular, although slightly…distant. Blood pressure is a bit low, actually. 110/70.
PATIENT: Low blood pressure? Oh dear. Is that bad? I haven’t been feeling very well lately, like I said. Just a bit tired and… not quite myself. I've not been eating much either, to be honest. Everything tastes a bit… bland.
DOCTOR: "Decreased appetite, subjective report of bland taste, associated with recent decline in well-being." Hmm. Alright, Mrs. MayHugh, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like we have a few things going on. The dizziness and balance issues could be related to something called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo – BPPV – which is a common problem with the inner ear. The low blood pressure and diminished appetite are also concerning. It's possible the dizziness is exacerbating the low blood pressure, or it could be a separate issue altogether. I'm going to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying conditions, like anemia or vitamin deficiencies. I'd also like you to have an ECG to check your heart rhythm. And finally, I’m going to refer you to an ENT specialist – that's an ear, nose, and throat doctor – for further evaluation of your dizziness.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds like… a lot. Blood tests? ECG? ENT specialist? Will it be painful? I don't like needles much. And I don't really like going to lots of different doctors. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. MayHugh. It does sound like a lot, and I apologize for that. But it's important to rule out anything serious. The blood tests are fairly routine – just a small sample of blood taken from your arm. And the ECG is a painless procedure – we just attach some sticky pads to your chest to record your heart's electrical activity. As for whether it’s serious… it's too early to say definitively. That's why we need to do these tests. We need to find out what's causing your symptoms before we can determine the best course of action. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Sharma, a very good ENT specialist in town. I'll also give you a lab requisition form for the blood tests. They can draw the blood here at the clinic. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and eat as well as you can. If your dizziness gets significantly worse, or if you experience any chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Hydrated… and eat well. I'll try. Dr. Sharma, you said? I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. Chest pain… I haven’t had any chest pain, thankfully. Just the dizziness, and feeling a bit… off. Next week… yes, alright. Next week is fine. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. It's just… a bit much to take in.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. MayHugh. It is a lot, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, if anything changes, or if you develop chest pain, please go to the emergency room. Here's a copy of the patient instructions outlining everything we discussed. I'll have the receptionist schedule your follow-up for next Tuesday at 10 am. Is that suitable?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10 am… yes, that sounds alright. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. I think… I think that's all for now. I just want to get home and sit down. It’s been… a long morning.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. MayHugh. Get some rest. And do try to stay hydrated. The receptionist will be happy to help you schedule a follow-up appointment and answer any questions. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
