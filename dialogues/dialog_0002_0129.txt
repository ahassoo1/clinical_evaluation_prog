DOCTOR: Hi Dawnetta, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, well, it’s about my… stool. It’s black. And frankly, I haven’t got all day. I take pills, you see. For the pain. Been taking them for years. I suppose that's what this is about. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Okay, black stool is definitely something we want to look into. And I understand you're on pain medication and haven't got all day, so let's try to be efficient. When you say black stool, is it consistently black, like tar?
PATIENT: Yes, consistently. Like… well, like tar, exactly. You’re a clever one, figuring that out. It's not just a little dark, it's… black. And it's been going on for a little while now, maybe a week or so. Honestly, I thought it might just be the pills, but my Harold said I ought to get it checked. He worries too much, but… well. Is it serious? Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week of consistently black, tarry stools is concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked, and that Harold is looking out for you. It could be related to the pain medication, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. Black, tarry stools often indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract. Now, I'm not trying to scare you, but it's better to be thorough. Could you tell me a little bit more about the pain you're taking medication for?
PATIENT: Oh, bleeding? See, I knew it was something bad. Harold always says I worry too much, but I told him! It’s my back, mostly. Old injury, working on those trucks. It flares up, you see. Terrible, terrible pain. I take… let me think… Naproxen. Yes, Naproxen, twice a day. Sometimes more if it’s really bad. And I take something else… oh, what was it… a muscle relaxant, I think. Something blue. I don’t bother with names, really. They just make things confusing. Is Naproxen the problem? Just tell me if I need to stop taking it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain is in your back from an old injury, and you're taking Naproxen twice a day, sometimes more, and a blue muscle relaxant. It's good you're trying to manage the pain, but taking more than prescribed Naproxen can increase the risk of stomach irritation and bleeding, which could be the cause of the black stool. However, we can't be certain yet. Do you remember the name of that blue muscle relaxant, even roughly?
PATIENT: Ugh, names. Honestly, it's a little round pill. Blue, as I said. I think… it started with a 'C'? Cyclo… something. Cyclobenzaprine? Is that it? Harold gets it for me. He’s the one who deals with all that. I just take them when my back hurts. I don’t see why knowing the name matters, frankly. Is this going to take much longer? I’ve got dinner to make.
DOCTOR: Cyclobenzaprine, yes, that's it! Okay, that's helpful. And you’re right, names aren’t always important. We’re getting there. Knowing the medications helps us build a picture. To be sure, I'd like to ask a few more questions, then I'll do a quick physical exam. It won’t take long, I promise. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the black stool?
PATIENT: Oh, more questions? Honestly. Well… I suppose I’ve been a bit tired lately. Just… generally run down. And maybe a little lightheaded when I stand up too quickly. But I'm 73, Doctor! What do you expect? I get tired. That’s just… how it is. It’s not like I’m springing with energy, you know? I don’t see what that has to do with my… stool. Is this going to require blood tests? Because I hate needles.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, and I apologize if I’m asking too many questions. The tiredness and lightheadedness could be related, especially if there's been some blood loss. Yes, I think some blood tests would be a good idea to check your overall health and see if there are any signs of bleeding. I understand you don't like needles, and we'll do it as quickly and gently as possible. There's also a chance we may need to check a stool sample. Before we do that, have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're talking about samples? Really? Fine. Just get it over with. My appetite is fine, I eat like a bird, always have. No nausea, no vomiting. My stomach is usually alright. Sometimes it feels a little… unsettled, if I eat something rich, but that’s it. And maybe a bit of heartburn, but that's just… old age again, I suppose. And Harold's cooking! He makes a lovely roast, but it doesn’t agree with me sometimes. Is this it? Can we just get the tests done? I’m starting to feel faint just talking about it all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no nausea, vomiting, or changes in appetite, just occasional unsettled stomach and heartburn. That’s helpful. Alright, let's get started with the physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your blood pressure. It won't take long. Then we’ll get the blood work and stool sample sorted out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the lower right quadrant. Nothing too alarming. Now, let’s get those blood tests ordered and collect a stool sample. I’ll get a nurse to assist you with the stool collection.
PATIENT: Tender, you say? Oh, wonderful. Just what I needed. Fine. Get it over with. And hurry up. I've got a roast to think about. And Harold will be home soon. I really don’t want to be fussing about with samples when he gets back. He’ll make such a fuss. Honestly, I’m too old for this. Just… get it done quickly, please. And tell the nurse to be gentle! This whole thing is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dawnetta. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll let the nurse know to be especially careful. I’ll have everything arranged right away. .
