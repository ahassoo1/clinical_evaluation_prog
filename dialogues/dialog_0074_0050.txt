DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's... good to meet you too, I think. My name is Brodie Pavlovic. Or... is it? Anyway, I've been having this cough. A dry one. Been going on for… well, a long time now. Seems like it just won't go away. I mostly just try to ignore it, but it's getting… bothersome.
DOCTOR: I see. A persistent dry cough, that's certainly something we should look into. And you said it's been going on for a long time – could you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… Oh dear. That’s hard. Let me think. It feels like… maybe since the winter? Or was it last summer? Everything's a bit mixed up these days, you know. My wife… she always remembered dates. I just… I don’t keep track of those things. It’s been many months, that much I know. Longer than it should be, probably.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when something started. "Many months" is helpful, though. And is this cough constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Mostly at night, I think. Wakes me up sometimes. And when I’ve been… out and about. Dust, maybe? Or the cold air. It doesn’t hurt, just… scratchy. And makes me tired. I try to drink water, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse at night and with exposure to dust or cold air, and it's causing some fatigue. Does anything else seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, sometimes when I've been working in the garage. I still tinker with cars, you know. Old habit. The fumes… I don’t know if that has something to do with it. And sometimes, when I lay down flat. Makes it harder to breathe a little. Not bad, just… noticeable. I don’t smoke, if that matters. Never have.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the garage and the car fumes, and that it’s worse when lying flat. And thank you for mentioning you’ve never smoked; that’s very helpful. Do you notice any wheezing or shortness of breath when you’re coughing, or at any other time?
PATIENT: Wheezing…? Oh, that’s the whistling sound, right? I… I don’t think so. Not usually. Sometimes, like I said, when I lay down, I feel a little tight in the chest. But no whistling sound. Shortness of breath… maybe a little, when I walk up the stairs. But I’m an old man, Doctor. I get winded easily. It could just be… age.
DOCTOR: I understand your point about age, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s good to take all factors into consideration. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That's another thing I struggle with. I’ve been to the doctor a few times, of course. For check-ups. And when I broke my arm when I was younger, working on a car, naturally. But nothing… serious, I don’t think. My wife handled all the paperwork and remembering things like that. She always said I wasn’t good with details. I have… high blood pressure, I think? The doctor told me once. I take a little pill for it, every day. That’s about all I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re asking something. It’s a little white pill… No, wait, maybe it’s a little blue one. I get them filled at the pharmacy down the street. The pharmacist knows me. He probably knows what I take better than I do. I just… take it every morning with my breakfast. I can’t recall the name, I’m sorry. It’s just… been so long.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Pavlovic. We can look it up in the pharmacy records if needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat all sorts of things. My wife used to make me wonderful Hmong dishes, lots of different spices. Never had a reaction. I remember a rash once, when I was a boy, but that was from poison ivy, I think. Nothing to do with food or medicine. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no. But, like I said, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you’ve never smoked. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to listen to your lungs, take your blood pressure, and check your heart rate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. My lungs… haven't felt right in a while, I guess. But what does one know? Go ahead. I'll sit still. Just let me know if you need me to take a deep breath or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovic. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. I'm listening to your lungs now. I do hear some mild wheezing, particularly on exhale, and some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes. Your heart rate is 78 and regular. I’m also going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. Your oxygen level is 92%, which is a little on the lower end of normal. It’s not critically low, but it’s something to note.
PATIENT: Oh, really? Wheezing, you say? I figured as much. Always felt a little tight in the chest. Lower lobes… I don’t know what that means, but it doesn’t sound good. And that oxygen level… lower end of normal, you say? Well, I spend a lot of time in the garage, Doctor. Maybe that’s it. It’s just… old age catching up to me, isn’t it? What do you think I should do?
DOCTOR: It's good that we're identifying these findings now, Mr. Pavlovic. While some of this could be attributed to age or time spent in the garage, the wheezing and diminished breath sounds are concerning enough that we need to investigate further. The lower lobes are the bottom sections of your lungs, and the diminished sounds suggest there might be some congestion or obstruction there. Given your cough, the wheezing, and your lower oxygen saturation, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We also need to check your blood to see if there's an infection present and to rule out other possible causes. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An X-ray and blood work… well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your professional opinion. I don't like hospitals much, but… if it'll help figure out what's going on, then I suppose. Will it be painful? And how long will it take? I have a bit of tinkering I’d like to get back to, if possible. I promised a friend I’d look at his carburetor. But my health comes first, of course.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Pavlovic, neither of these procedures will be painful. The X-ray is quick and painless; you’ll simply stand or sit while the technician takes a picture of your chest. The blood work will involve a small sample drawn from your arm, and there might be a brief pinch. It should take about an hour to get the results of the blood work, and the X-ray results usually come back within a few hours. We can review them together in the office. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for an albuterol inhaler. It's a medication that helps to open up your airways and can relieve wheezing and shortness of breath. I would like you to use it as directed, and let us know if it makes a difference. While we await the results, I'd recommend avoiding strenuous activities, like working in the garage, and ensuring you drink plenty of fluids. If your symptoms worsen – if you experience increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That all sounds… sensible. An inhaler, no garage work, plenty of fluids… I can manage that. I'll try to stay put and not bother with the carburetor for a bit. And I’ll remember what you said about the emergency room. Increased shortness of breath, chest pain, fever… I’ll keep an eye out for those. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. It’s good to finally be getting to the bottom of this cough, even if it means a bit of poking and prodding. I appreciate your patience with an old man who doesn’t remember much anymore. I’m ready whenever you are for that X-ray and blood work. Let’s get it done. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. It's my pleasure to help. And please, don't worry about remembering details – that’s what I’m here for. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood, and then we’ll head over to radiology for the X-ray. If everything looks good, we’ll discuss the results here in the office. Let’s get started.
