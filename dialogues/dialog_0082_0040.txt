DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it’s this pain in my side again. And… well, the waterworks haven’t been right either, if you know what I mean. It keeps happening, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Side pain and some trouble with urination. Can you tell me a bit more about the pain?
PATIENT: It's mostly on my right side, Doctor. Not always there, comes and goes. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. But sometimes it gets sharper, like a really bad cramp. It doesn’t go all the way through to my back, but it feels like it could. It's been happening for… oh, goodness, years now, on and off. I just thought it was getting older, you know? But it’s been more frequent lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache, mostly on the right side, that can sharpen into a cramp. And it’s been happening for years, but it’s become more frequent recently. Does anything seem to trigger the pain?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Hmm… I don't know if anything specifically sets it off. Sometimes it comes after I’ve been doing a bit of gardening, bending and stretching. But other times, it just… comes. I don’t recall doing anything special when it starts. And no, it doesn’t seem to be linked to what I eat or drink. I haven’t noticed a pattern, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned the “waterworks haven’t been right.” Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I have to go to the bathroom… a lot. Especially at night, which is a bother. And sometimes it burns when I go. Not every time, but often enough to be… unpleasant. And it feels like I haven’t emptied my bladder completely, even after I’ve just been. It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but it's been going on with the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination, especially at night, burning sensation, and a feeling of not fully emptying your bladder. That is a bit bothersome, and thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any fever or chills?
PATIENT: No blood, Doctor. I haven't seen any of that. And no fever or chills either. Just… the discomfort, and having to go so often. It's mostly just a nuisance, but it does worry me a little, to be honest. My sister had some trouble with her kidneys years ago, and... well, it makes me think.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, especially with your sister's history. We'll definitely look into this. Now, let’s go over some of your medical background. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I was told years ago, when I was in my fifties, that my kidneys weren’t working quite as they should. Something about… cysts? The doctor said it wasn’t anything to worry about too much then, just to get regular check-ups. I've seen a few doctors over the years, but no one’s ever really explained it properly. I take some medicine for my blood pressure, that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some history of cysts on your kidneys, diagnosed in your fifties, and you take medication for blood pressure. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you’re taking?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a little white pill. Oh dear, I'm terrible with names. My daughter helps me with these things usually. I believe it starts with an “A”? Am… amlodipine? Is that right? Yes, I think that's it. Amlodipine.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes. Thank you. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or insect stings?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of, anyway. I've been lucky that way. I can eat anything, and insect bites just make me itch a bit. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That’s about it, Doctor. Nothing else. It was a long time ago, when I was maybe ten years old. A simple operation, nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child. And finally, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be eighty-five, but she had diabetes. And like I mentioned earlier, my sister had some trouble with her kidneys, years back. She had to go to the hospital a few times, but she recovered alright. My father passed away when I was young, so I don’t really remember much about his health.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and I may need to check a urine sample. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever’s needed. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the examination table. Your heart sounds regular, a little bit of age-related murmur, which is common. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: It's a little tender on my right side, Doctor. Not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache, like I've been telling you. Right about here. It feels… a little bit sensitive when you press.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does this pain radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Not exactly radiate, Doctor. It doesn’t shoot down my leg or anything. But sometimes I feel a bit of discomfort in my back, on the same side. Not a lot, just a dull ache. It's hard to explain, really. It all feels connected somehow.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Now, I'd like to collect a urine sample, if that's alright. We can send it to the lab to check for infection and other issues. I'll give you a cup and instructions. It's a fairly simple process. I’ll give you a few moments of privacy. Just let me know when you're finished.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. I'll just head to the restroom then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva, are you finished with the sample?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, all done. Here you go.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I’ll send this off to the lab right away. We should have the results back in a few days. Now, based on what you've told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, it’s important to investigate this further. Your symptoms could be caused by a number of things, including a kidney infection, a urinary tract infection, or even kidney stones. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I want to get to the bottom of this, if you know what I mean. I’m happy to do whatever tests are needed. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a urinalysis to look for infection and other abnormalities. I will also order an abdominal CT scan to visualize your kidneys and surrounding structures. This will help us determine the cause of your pain and urinary symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. A CT scan sounds a little scary, but if it's going to help, then yes, absolutely. Whatever you recommend. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do to prepare for these tests.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, a CT scan can sound a little intimidating. For the CT scan, you may need to drink some contrast dye, which helps us get a clearer image. We will provide you with specific instructions closer to your appointment date. As for the blood work and urine analysis, you don't need to do anything special. Just make sure you're well-hydrated before coming in. I'll have the lab draw the blood before you leave today. We can schedule the CT scan for next week. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and resting when you feel tired. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds very manageable. Plenty of fluids, no caffeine, and rest… I can certainly do that. And I’ll make sure to follow your instructions about the CT scan. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now, just knowing what's going on and what we’re going to do about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. That’s my job. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood now. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough and helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I’ll just wait for the lab technician then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. I'll step out and let the lab technician come in.
PATIENT: .
