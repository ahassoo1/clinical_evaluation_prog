DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Galena. Thank you for seeing me. I… have something coming out of my ear. A discharge, I think it is called. It is… troubling me.
DOCTOR: Alright, a discharge from your ear. I see. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… July 18th, I believe. Yes, July 18th. I was… gardening, and then later that day, I noticed it. A little bit, at first. Now… it is more.
DOCTOR: July 18th, that's about two weeks now. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It is… mostly constant. Sometimes, when I lie down on my left side, it is… less. But mostly, it is there. A small amount, always. Not a lot, but enough to… bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, and can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: It is… clear. And a little bit… sticky. Not blood, no. Just… a fluid. Sometimes… a tiny smell. Not a bad smell, but… a smell. I cannot describe it well, Doctor. It is not like anything I have smelled before.
DOCTOR: Clear and sticky, with a slight, unusual odor… Alright. And have you noticed any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, no pain. That is good, yes? Just… the feeling of something there. And sometimes… I do not hear as well on that side. Not much different, but… a little. It is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: No pain is good, yes. And diminished hearing on the same side… Alright. Have you experienced any fever, dizziness, or nausea along with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No dizziness. And I have not felt sick to my stomach. Everything else is… normal. I eat well, I sleep well. Just… this ear. It worries me because I have never had this before.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, have you had any previous ear infections, or any injuries to your ear?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even as a child. My ears have always been… strong. That is why this is so strange. I have been careful. I do not put anything in my ears. No cotton swabs, no… anything. I keep them clean on the outside, yes, but… nothing inside.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, before we take a look, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, or if you have any allergies?
PATIENT: I take a medicine for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, it is called. A small pill, every morning. And… no allergies, Doctor. Not to food, not to anything. I have always been lucky that way. I do not react to things.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril... okay. And one last question before we have a look – any family history of ear problems, or hearing loss?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother… she had trouble hearing when she was very old, but that was just age, I think. Not a problem when she was young. My father… no. No ear problems that I know of. We did not talk much about such things. It was… not common to discuss health problems.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Okay, Mr. Radillo, I'm going to take a look at your ear now. Please sit forward. I’ll need to use an otoscope – it’s just a light and magnifying tool, nothing to worry about. It will help me see inside your ear canal.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will sit forward. Please be gentle. I… I am a little nervous, I admit. I do not like things in my ear.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. It should only take a moment. Hmm… I see some inflammation in the ear canal, and a small amount of clear fluid. The eardrum itself looks intact, thankfully, but there is some redness behind it. It appears there may be a foreign object partially impacted in the canal. I don’t see it clearly enough yet, but it looks like a piece of… possibly plant matter. It's not a large object, but it could be irritating the canal and causing the discharge.
PATIENT: Plant matter? Oh… that is possible. I was gardening, as I said. I may have gotten something in there. A leaf, perhaps? I did not notice at the time. Is it… bad? Will I need… surgery? I do not want surgery, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, no surgery needed at all, not at this point. It looks relatively superficial. We can likely remove it gently in the office. It’s causing some inflammation, which is why you’re experiencing the discharge and diminished hearing. We'll use a gentle irrigation with saline solution to flush it out. It might feel a little cool, but shouldn’t be painful. Do you have any tubes in your ears, or have you had any previous ear surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No tubes. And no previous surgeries of any kind. Never. I am a… simple man. I have been very lucky to avoid such things. This… this gardening is my first problem, I think. A little embarrassing, but… better now than later, yes?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Better now than later. Alright. I'm going to warm the saline solution, and then we’ll gently flush your ear canal. Lean your head to the right, please. I'll use a bulb syringe to introduce the solution. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. This might take a few moments. I think I see it... there’s a small piece of leaf coming out. Let’s flush a little more… And… there! I believe we’ve removed it. Let me take another look… Alright, the canal looks much clearer now. The inflammation is still present, but it should subside with some antibiotic drops.
PATIENT: Oh… that felt… strange. But not painful, no. Thank you, Doctor. That is good. The canal looks better, you say? Will I… hear better now? And what about the drops? How long do I need to use them? I always forget things, you see. I need clear instructions.
DOCTOR: Yes, it should be much better now. You may notice an improvement in your hearing right away, but it might take a day or two for it to return to normal completely. As for the drops, I’m going to prescribe you antibiotic ear drops – Ciprofloxacin otic solution. You’ll need to put two drops in your left ear twice a day for seven days. Twice a day for seven days – morning and evening. It's important to complete the entire course, even if your ear feels better sooner, to ensure the infection doesn’t return. Here are the instructions, written down for you. It also includes information about potential side effects, but those are rare. If you experience any severe pain, fever, or dizziness, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Seven days, twice a day… morning and evening. I will write that down in my book. Thank you, Doctor. That is very helpful. And if I forget… can I call the office and ask again? I do not want to make a mistake. I appreciate your patience with me. I am… not a young man anymore.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Radillo. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. That's what we're here for. My number is on the sheet. And don't worry about your age – we're happy to help, no matter what. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check on your progress and make sure the inflammation has subsided. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that is good. I will mark it in my calendar right away. Thank you again, Doctor Galena. You have been very kind. I feel much better now, knowing what to do. Is there anything else I need to do? Avoid getting water in the ear, perhaps? I do like to swim sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good question. For the next few days, try to avoid getting water in your left ear. When you shower or bathe, you can use a cotton ball with a little petroleum jelly on it to gently block the ear canal. Once the inflammation has subsided, you should be able to swim normally. And just to be safe, avoid strenuous activity for a couple of days. We don’t want to aggravate the canal. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. No strenuous activity… no water… seven days of drops… I will remember. Thank you for your time and patience. You have eased my mind. I will see you in two weeks. Goodbye, Doctor Galena.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. Glad I could help. Take care, and please don't hesitate to call if you think of anything. Goodbye, and have a good day.
